Anelay of St Johns (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, before we begin the
Second Reading of the European Union (Referendum) Bill, perhaps I may
offer the House some advice on timings and say a brief word about the
speakers list. It has come to my attention that there may be an error
on the list. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, for whom we all have great
regard, appears not to be on it, and I believe that the name of the
noble Lord, Lord Bichard, may be on it in error. With the leave of the
House, I propose that after we have had the opening speech from my
noble friend Lord Dobbs, I will discuss the matter with the opposition
Chief Whip—the noble Lord, Lord Bassam—and ensure not
only that the noble Lord, Lord Richard, is able to speak but that he is
able to do so in an appropriately prominent place in the list. I hope
that that will meet with the approval of the noble Lord, Lord Richard,
and of the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000003">I
turn to advice on timings. If we exclude from the guidance I am about
to give my noble friend Lord Dobbs, who will propose the Second
Reading, and the two speakers who will wind up—the noble Lord,
Lord Triesman, and my noble friend Lady Warsi—everybody else
should speak for four minutes. That would give us a concluding time for
the debate of about 3 pm. That terminology does not quite sit with my
usual vocabulary, but I believe that the wording will sound
particularly familiar to the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, who is to speak
in the debate, as I have blatantly pinched his words: it is the
self-same advice that he gave on a similar occasion for the Second
Reading of a Private Member’s Bill on a Friday, when he was the
then Labour Government’s Chief Whip. It was his advice for the
Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill, proposed by the noble Lord,
Lord Joffe. On that occasion, the same guidance of four-minute speeches
was given and there were no complaints, despite the fact that there
were then 92 speakers listed, as opposed to 68. The House followed the
prediction of the noble Lord, Lord Grocott. He said that it would rise
between 5 pm and 6 pm and, my goodness, it rose at 5.29
pm —he was very
accurate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T10:10:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
debate proceeded in an orderly manner, because that is the way this

Government Whips’ Office, save to say
that  I was insistent that I had put my name down but that it
did not appear on the speakers list. I am grateful to the Chief Whip

concerned about the procedure that she has outlined for the rest of the

beyond 3 pm—in which case, if we come to 3 pm and the debate has
not concluded, it will be adjourned even though it has not been
completed—or whether she is saying that if everybody does what
she would like us to do, it is her hope that the debate will finish by
3 pm. If it is the latter—if it is merely her hope—that,

course we will be up by 3 pm. If everybody takes 10 minutes, there is
not a hope that we will be up by then. This is not a time-limited
debate. The only limit is that set out in the <I>Companion</I>, which I
think the government Chief Whip is now prepared to
ignore.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000008">I am
not against this Bill getting a Second Reading; of course it should get
a Second Reading. What I am concerned about is that the Bill should be
treated no differently from any other Private Member’s Bill. I
have been present in this House on a recent Friday when the axe came
down at 2.50 pm when one of my noble friends had a Bill he was about to
propose. I am told that that was at the behest—although I cannot
verify that—but certainly at with the concurrence of the
government Chief Whip. We were told that 3 pm was the time and
therefore the Bill did not proceed.</hs_para>

Lord Steel, was proposing one of his Bills, I distinctly recollect a
situation in which it was—I hesitate to use the words,
“talked out”, but there was expansive discussion of the
previous Bill, as a result of which, at 3 pm, down came the axe and the
noble Lord’s Bill could not proceed. It is important to
establish the principle that this Bill is a Private Member’s
Bill and should be treated as such. It should be treated no differently
from any other Bill. I say to the noble Baroness that if it comes to
2.50 pm this afternoon and another 30-odd speakers remain on the list,
I will be minded in those circumstances to move an adjournment of
further discussion on the Bill. I am not saying that I am going to do
that, but I am certainly not saying that I am not going to do

Anelay of St Johns:</Member></B> My Lords, I think it would be
appropriate if I responded. The mood of the House is clearly that it
wishes to get on with the debate 
<?notus-xml column=1737?>rather than debate procedure. I remind the House that as government
Chief Whip I am indeed the guardian of the
<I>Companion</I>, so of course I accept what the
noble Lord, Lord Richard, quoted from part of it. I sought in my
introduction to explain that I was indeed following normal procedure.
The <I>Companion</I> was phrased in 2006 in the way in which the noble
Lord described—it is normal that we rise at 3 pm, but the House
is self-regulating and if Members wish to speak for longer than four
minutes and rise later than 3 pm, it is in their hands.</hs_para>

on previous occasions, Private Members’ Bills have
never—ever—taken more than one day. There has never been
an attempt to adjourn the House on a Second Reading; and it would be
unprecedented for a Member to seek to adjourn the House to prevent the
completion of a Second Reading. On previous occasions, anyone who
wished to prevent a Second Reading tabled a Motion
beforehand—and, before those procedures were put in place long
ago, a vote against Second Reading itself was made.</hs_para>

us not indulge in procedural quotations from only part of the
<I>Companion</I>. I did explain that I was following the position of
the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, when a very serious Private
Member’s Bill was before this House. In that case, the House
chose to rise at 5.30 pm. The noble Lord, Lord Richard,
referred to another occasion recently. Perhaps I may explain to the
House that when that Second Reading did not proceed, I had beforehand
talked to the mover of the Private Member’s Bill to ensure that
if the Second Reading could not be concluded at a reasonable time, I
would of course ensure that they had the first available opportunity
and date that would ensure that their Bill could reach another place.
So I always play fair. I am keeping to the rules and suggest that the
House moves on. It is now 10.16 am. This is a Bill that the House wants

Grocott (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, given that I have been quoted in
evidence, I should be able to make a couple of comments. Yes, this is a
Private Member’s Bill—but, my word, it is a Private
Member’s Bill like no other that anyone else can remember in
this House. I need to remind the House that it is a Private
Member’s Bill that is passionately supported by the Prime
Minister—so much so that when it was going through the House of
Commons, the Conservative Party was on a heavy three-line whip. That
makes the Bill very different from any other Private Member’s
Bill in my experience—and, I would guess, that of anyone in this
House with longer experience than mine. I will leave that aside for a
moment.</hs_para>

will make just this plea to the Chief Whip. As she has been kind enough
to say that she is following precisely my advice in this respect, will
she at least do me the courtesy of assuring me that whenever I give
advice on the timing of Bills between now and, say, the general

Lordships for being here in such numbers for this important debate. I
must apologise for the fact that it is a Friday and it will be a full
day. I understand just how difficult that is for many and how much not
inconvenience but real sacrifice your presence has entailed. I am
grateful. I intend to make a short speech, lasting less than 10
minutes, I hope—if any of your Lordships think that 10 minutes
is not showing sufficient respect for such an important Bill, I can
only offer a further apology. However, this Bill is short, the
principle at its heart is extraordinarily simple and I am conscious of

principle behind this Bill is that the people have a right to decide
their own future. We had a vote of course in 1975, in which we embraced
the Common Market by a huge majority. I was one of those voters.
However, that vote needs reinforcing. The institutions of Europe have
changed beyond imagination since then and no one in this country below
the age of 60 has had any say. It has caused great controversy and has
resulted in growing scepticism, not just about Europe but about all our
political processes. The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, who, I am sad to
say, is not in his seat today, was entirely right the other day in an
interview with the <I>Times</I> when he said that voters’ trust
in all sorts of institutions was collapsing, so much so that many
people simply were not even bothering to vote. I agree with him

desperate to get out of Europe and at other stages desperate to bind
themselves more closely to Europe, no one in the current Labour Party

do not mean that to be a criticism. This is a difficult issue. We

that the franchise could be extended to those from other EU countries
who are resident in Britain, to all British nationals
who live in the EU or to 16 and 17
year- olds. All those cases are arguable and I have a suspicion
that they will be argued passionately and eloquently. They are arguable
but none of them is overwhelming. Nothing in this Bill is so unfair or
so unbalanced that it is sufficient reason for denying the people their
referendum. It would be beyond irony, and in some eyes beyond
forgiveness, if this House were to pursue attempts to improve the

judge the question on the national interest. If there was a major

then, yes, there is already legislation on the statute book to say that
there would be a referendum. However, the Cameron proposition on the

of which I agree—is nevertheless fundamentally flawed. He has
chosen, as this Bill sets out, the end of 2017 as the end date for a UK
referendum without the slightest idea of what by then he will have
tried to negotiate, whether there is any prospect of our partners
playing ball with such a renegotiation, whether a new treaty is

Democrats should consult the British people through a referendum on any
constitutional changes that might arise out of the 1996
Intergovernmental Conference. I know it is not the tradition of the

opposed to it. We stood by the democratic principle that the people
should be consulted when significant change is proposed and we do so
today. We are proud to have enshrined in law the European Union Act
2011. So the Liberal Democrat position is clear: we say yes to reform
of the EU and yes to a referendum if there is any further

come to the Bill we are looking at today. The noble Lord, Lord Dobbs,
has set out a general case for why the Conservatives believe that we
need an “in or out” referendum by the end of 2017. A date
for a decision is arbitrarily plucked out of the air as the end of
2017, and the period for the preparation of that decision is randomly
established as December 2016, without an indication of what substantive
change will 
<?notus-xml column=1745?>have occurred in the United Kingdom’s position vis-à-vis
the EU in the interim. The general election is to be held in May

question the noble Lord has not addressed is what change will take
place in our relationship with the EU between May 2015 and December
2016 for which the EU referendum Act will not be sufficient safeguard.
If he believes that we will have a transfer of competences in that
19-month period, then surely the Act will apply. If there is treaty
change from today on, the Act will apply. The answer to the question
must be that noble Lords on the Conservative Benches have come to the
view that the Act only guarantees a say for the people on future
change, whereas they now—only two years after voting for that
Bill—feel the need for a repatriation of powers referendum,
which is what this should be called. That is the message behind this

even on that reasoning, they are contradicting themselves. Indeed, the
Prime Minister himself said in his Bloomberg speech that the next

settlement with EU partners and that the British people would be asked
after that negotiation. Yet now this House is asked to approve a fixed
date for a referendum before we even know whether that mandate is to be
granted or, indeed, what is to be negotiated. Should the detail of a
new settlement not be outlined to the people before they are asked for
their view on remaining in or leaving? If it is a matter of trust, then
the Conservatives are saying, “Trust us to negotiate before we
tell you what we will negotiate and trust us to have a referendum on it
irrespective of success”. It will be interesting to see what the

Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the European Union
(Referendum) Bill to which we are invited to give a Second Reading
today is a mercifully short one, but it is also exceptionally
significant. It puts into play Britain’s role as a member of the
European Union—a role that underlies much of the functioning 
<?notus-xml column=1746?>of our economy and our capacity to influence and shape events in a
rapidly changing world. To act in this way with our European Union
membership is a high-risk strategy that has been ill thought through by
its authors and is fraught with possible unintended
negative consequences for this country. However, our task, as with
every other Bill that comes before us, is to scrutinise the Bill
rigorously and, where possible, improve it—not simply denounce
it, tempting though that may
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000058">The Bill
is also in many respects an oddity. First, take its proclaimed status
as a Private Member’s Bill. That is surely more of a sham than a
reality. Just about the only characteristic that fits its proclaimed
status is that we are debating it on a Friday and will continue to do
so as we work our way through its Committee and Report stages. However,
I understand that the Bill was as good as whipped in another place and,
if I am not badly informed, it is as good as whipped in this House. It
has been openly suggested by Ministers of one of the two coalition
parties that the Bill has their full support. That hardly makes it much
of a Private Member’s Bill, even if it was introduced in this
House by a distinguished Back-Bencher, the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, who
has, with others, regaled us over the years with the odder aspects of
our political
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000059">The
oddities do not stop there. It is generally recognised as a convention
of our unwritten constitution that our Parliament cannot and should not
aim to bind the hands of its successors, but the sole purpose of this
Bill is to do precisely that. It has no other purpose and will have no
effect at all during the lifetime of this Parliament. Its object is to
ensure that, whatever the outcome of the 2015 election, the die will
have been cast. Once a precedent like that has been set, one wonders
what there will be to stop any Government that can exercise a majority
in the other place from pre-legislating commitments for their
successor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000060">Another
oddity is that only two years or so ago, when we dealt with the
European Union Act 2011 and its 57 or so varieties of decision in the
EU that would trigger a referendum in this country, we were assured
with great intensity and certainty by the noble Lords, Lord Howell of
Guildford and Lord Wallace of Saltaire, that once that Act was passed
Britain would be at ease with its membership and there would be no
question of needing any referendum outside the scope of that Act. What
has happened in the two and a half years since then to justify
reversing those assurances? It is not anything in Brussels, where no
decision has been taken to trigger that Act. I suppose the answer must
be the rise of UKIP and the attitude of a significant number of the
Government’s supporters in another place who believe that,
because they cannot secure a majority in Parliament for their objective
of Britain withdrawing from the EU, some other means must be
found.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000061">The
finally oddity is that the cry has gone up before we have even given
the Bill a Second Reading that this House should not resist the will of
the elected Chamber. Yet, if you come to think of it, every Bill that
reaches this House from another place falls into that category. Are we
therefore not to scrutinise or, where we consider it to be defective,
amend this Bill? If so, there is not an awful lot left for us to do and
the concept of a bicameral system would be junked.</hs_para>

oddities and constitutional imperfections, the Bill has a number of
other substantive defects. Does it really make sense to impose an
artificial timetable and deadline of 2017 for the holding of an
“in or out” referendum, some three years or more ahead of
the event? I suggest not. For one thing, 2017 is a singularly poorly
chosen year for such an exercise. In the first half of that year,
France will hold presidential and parliamentary elections. In the
second half, the Germans will hold national elections and, judging by
last year’s precedent, it takes some time and much internal
negotiation before they form a coalition. That same year, Britain will
next hold the presidency of the European Union. These are as suboptimal
conditions as one could devise for this choice of year, so there must
be doubt that it is really a sensible way to
proceed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000063">But
the whole concept of setting a date so far in advance is surely deeply
flawed, too. Would it not make more sense for the Government of the day
first to secure the reforms they wish for in order to put the question
on Britain’s continued membership to a referendum and then set a
date? That is what was done in 1974-75. Does it not also make no sense
to create such a long period of uncertainty for inward investors, on
whose decisions the continued improved of the economy is so
dependent?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000064">Then
there is the question to be put in the referendum. The authors of this
Bill devised a form of words that the Electoral Commission judged to be
flawed on the grounds of clarity and objectivity. More than that, the
Electoral Commission submitted two formulations which it believed met
those criteria, but the authors of the Bill brushed those aside and
continued with their own. What on earth do we have an Electoral
Commission for if we just ignore its advice? I was glad to see that our
own Constitutional Committee shared my bafflement at this cavalier
treatment of that
advice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000065">There
is also the question of the franchise, which has been referred to by
other noble Lords. It is no doubt very welcome that Members of your
Lordships’ House are to be allowed to vote on this occasion, but
three important and much larger blocks of voters who will be critically
affected by the decisions to be taken as a result of the proposed
referendum are being excluded, despite the fact that this is not a vote
for the duration of a five-year Parliament but a much longer period.
The three blocks are: teenagers between the ages of 16 and 18, whose
future job prospects and lives will be directly affected; the 1.5
million to 2 million British citizens resident in other member states,
many of whom are disfranchised from our parliamentary elections due to
the length of their residence but whose rights and status will be
directly affected by this decision; and citizens from other EU member
states resident in this country who can vote in our local elections and
who will also be affected by this. Does the case for giving these
categories the vote on this occasion not deserve careful

with the majority in the other place after the 2015 election simply be
able to impose its preferences in this respect? That surely would not
do. That was certainly the view of our Delegated Powers Committee when
it reported. Would it not be far better to set out in this Bill the way

how we should proceed. The issue that confronts us concerns the
relationship between the two Houses and the proper role of the

elected House, and with a great deal of evidence that the electorate
want a referendum. Having served in both Houses, I am certain that,
although the work we do here is hugely valuable, the will of the
elected House must prevail. For that reason, I believe that it would be
a grave mistake if the Lords were to kill the Bill. We have heard a
good deal recently about the cynicism of the public and their
considerable contempt for politicians. Very few outside Parliament will
understand our arcane procedures, and if the Bill dies in the hands of
this non-elected Chamber, many will believe that it was just another

of us fought vigorously and with success to defeat legislation that

could say, with Mrs Thatcher, that Mr Cameron’s conversion to an

heard some very impressive speeches already, but let us get down to
basics. Under pressure from UKIP and his Eurosceptic
Back-Benchers—that is where the pressure has come from—Mr
Cameron has committed his party to a referendum, as he puts it in his
Bloomberg speech—incidentally, notice the language he
uses—whether to stay in on renegotiated terms of membership or
to pull out altogether. He does not use the language of the Bill, I

short, in order to keep his party together, the Conservative Prime
Minister has taken a very big gamble with the country’s future.
We know from Mr Cameron’s speech that if a
Conservative Government are elected, they will then introduce the
necessary legislation and, after negotiation with our partners, hold a
referendum in the first half of the new Parliament. In other words, it
is quite unnecessary to have the Bill at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000080">Like all
the speakers so far, I very much admire the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs. I
have read his political thrillers and dramas with great interest and

is—is neither necessary nor fit for purpose. I agree with the

them altogether. I have also been in Parliament for 40 years both down
at the other end and at this end. Those weaknesses include the
inflexibility of the date. If Mr Cameron is going to embark on a
process of complex renegotiation, he will need flexibility in the
timing of the referendum. He is not going to get that if the Bill goes
through. Secondly, the rules under which the referendum is to be
conducted are made by orders of the Secretary of State. The Delegated

the referendum question should be amended, we are told, by the
Electoral Commission. It is no good just brushing it aside; we set it
up in order to give us advice on elections and referendums. It has said
that the question should be amended and offered two far superior
alternatives to the one in the Bill. Although, as I have made clear, I
believe that the Bill is unnecessary, I hope that this House does its
proper job, as it always does, and is able to amend the Bill to make it
better. If there are certain Bills which we are not allowed to amend,
where are we as a second Chamber? A special rule for one Bill? Come

inappropriate for a parliamentary democracy. In 1972, my sympathy was
with my then right honourable friends Roy Jenkins and George Thomson,
when they resigned from the Labour Party’s Front Bench rather
than support a referendum. However, after the 1974 elections I was much
involved in the 1975 referendum and I much enjoyed working under the
leadership of the father of the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, and with
my noble friend Lord Hurd of Westwell. I remember that my noble friend
Lord Newby, who is the Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard, was one of
the most enthusiastic young campaigners in that campaign, and that in
Manchester I worked with my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire and
Dame Helen Wallace. I, too, am therefore in favour of the broad thrust

institutions.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14011038000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000085">Why,
then, do I have questions about the Bill that we are considering? As
the noble Lord, Lord Radice, has said he does, I have considerable
doubts as to whether it is right for a referendum to be introduced by a
Private Member’s Bill. I do not believe that that in itself is a
reason for opposing the Bill. However, like other noble Lords, I feel
that there are significant defects in the Bill before us and that this
House would be failing in its function as a revising Chamber if it was
not to consider them carefully, but not for too long, in

has been said by others, I believe that at this stage to fix the date
at 2017 is a mistake. It is not clear how long it would take a
Conservative Government, assuming that they were elected at a general
election, to agree the necessary reforms to the European Union and
Britain’s relations to it. There would be a case for a
referendum when that had occurred but it is clearly a mistake to make a
fixed decision on the year of that referendum now. As has been said, as
our own Select Committee on the Constitution has reported, the question
in the Bill has been examined by the Electoral Commission and I believe
that we must return to that issue in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000087">The
Bill, as has been drawn to our attention, has a rather unusual
provision in that it widens the normal parliamentary franchise in order
to give your Lordships 
<?notus-xml column=1752?>a vote in the referendum. I am sure that that was to guarantee that
there was no amendment on that topic introduced in this House but, as
has been said, there are other significant limitations on those voting
because of the basis of the parliamentary franchise. There is a strong
case for basing it on the local government electorate, as this would
permit other citizens of the European Union to vote in the referendum.
They will be clearly affected in such a decision and we should
certainly consider this in Committee. My noble friend Lord Shipley will
be raising the related question of the right to vote of British
citizens living in the European Union. I share his view that we should
consider that in

our Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee raised in its
report questions related to Clause 3 on the rules of the conduct of the
referendum and suggested that, as in some previous referendums, they
should be incorporated as a schedule to the Bill so that they can be
given detailed parliamentary scrutiny. It is the problem of having a
Private Member’s Bill that it would have been very difficult for
the Member of the House of Commons who introduced the Bill there, or
indeed for the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, to draft a schedule when in the
case of the other Bills it amounted to some 100 pages. This is
therefore a matter which we will have to think about rather carefully
but we are unlikely to be able to make an appropriate amendment. The
House should give a Second Reading to the Bill but then carry on its
normal function of careful consideration in Committee.</hs_para>

remain part of, or leave, the European Union but simply whether the
people of our country should have a say by way of a referendum in

views on about whether the Bill is appropriate, wise or necessary, your

representatives of our fellow citizens, sent to that Chamber to
exercise their judgment on the half of the citizens—that the
Bill passed through its various stages either unopposed or with very
substantial majorities, reflecting public opinion on this matter of

<?notus-xml column=1753?>responsibility. Although the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Douglas
Alexander, speaking at Third Reading in another
place stated that members of the Labour Party had provided an
appropriate level of scrutiny in all stages of the Bill, both in
Committee and on Report, your Lordships’ Constitution Committee
identified areas where further scrutiny might indeed be advisable and

that we have substantial powers but we show maturity and considerable
restraint in the exercise of those powers. The question of Europe and
our country’s future role in Europe is important, and one which
has been fraught with considerable political disagreement. However, the
situation would be made considerably worse if, in addition to the
important debate on the future relations of our nation with Europe, the
debate were to be attended by a further accusation. That accusation
might be that those who have the privilege of sitting in your
Lordships’ House and therefore the opportunity for their
individual voices to be heard on every issue, apart from questions of
supply and confidence, were to deny our fellow citizens the opportunity
for their voice to be heard at the ballot box on the question of our
future membership of the European Union, particularly when their
elected representatives, sitting in another place, have made it very

for the Treasury, in transport and even sometimes on education, and I
continued to take a very positive view but with considerable concerns
about the extensions of the EU budget and the erosion of the principle
of subsidiarity. Today, as others have said, the EU is a very different

the Labour Party in the House of Commons not vote at Second Reading or
in fact on any amendments to amend the Bill on the points that have
been raised here? The Labour Party accepted them, did not vote and did
not take a position, and I therefore do not understand why it should be

our non-elected House, for all the reasons that we have often debated,
the most important of which is the expertise and experience of the
Members of this House that enable us, among other things, to improve in

though, is that in the end, where there is disagreement on amendments
between our two Houses, this House always gives way to the elected
Chamber. That is the principle that enables this House to continue to
do its work, despite those critics who believe that both Houses in a
democracy should be elected. Here, though, we face a rare and most
unusual situation. There is strong support in the country for a
referendum, as is clear from the polls, and this was very much
reflected in the debates in the other place on the Bill and the
decisions that the elected House made on it.</hs_para>

the other place has overwhelmingly made its position very clear. The
elected House has therefore debated all these points and, as I say,
made its position clear, and the point that we now face is that any
amendments passed by this House could almost certainly—indeed,
will—kill the Bill. In my view, it is not for this unelected

about the need for change in the European Union. My experience has made
me decidedly pro-reform of the EU, but not in favour of a pig-in-a-poke
referendum in this country designed to bridge the divisions within the
Conservative Party. Of course, at a time when people across Europe are
worried about their jobs, borne down by the cost of living and nervous
about whether or when the fast-rising economic powers in the world are
going to eat Europe’s collective lunch, it is hardly surprising
that public hostility is directed at the EU. However, it is instructive
that opinion polls, including recent ones, indicate that while the
public are in favour of a referendum they are by a bigger majority in
favour of Britain showing leadership in the EU, exerting its influence
and not walking away from its responsibilities within it. That is why I
am very confident that in any public debate we will win the argument
that breaking up the EU is not the answer and Britain leaving it will

Taverne (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, in his
very eloquent speech opening this debate, said that the referendum is
about democracy. We need to be very cautious about the use of the
referendum. It is very much against the tradition of parliamentary
government. Personally, I am a great admirer of Locke, the champion of
parliamentary government, and less an admirer of Rousseau, who felt
that the will of the people should prevail in all circumstances and, if
necessary, override that of a Parliament.</hs_para>

now accept the referendum as part of our procedures, but it has to be
used very cautiously and it can be justified only if the choice in a
referendum is clear. Will that be the case in 2017? It is extremely
unlikely. The eurozone is in a state of flux and the European Union as
a whole is in a state of turmoil. In the southern states of the Union,
there is a revolt against the austerity which they see as imposed on
them by Germany and against excessive regulation proposed—or
imposed—by Brussels. Germany is right to insist on structural
reforms and effective government, but it has pushed austerity too far
and the question still arises: will the eurozone survive? I note that
Mr Draghi says that it is wrong to assume that the worst is now over.
So the question may well arise by 2017: what sort of Europe are we
going to have to leave? It will not be clear. Will there be a larger
eurozone or a smaller eurozone? The result will have a very great
effect on relations between Britain and Europe. Will there be a new
banking union and, if so, what form will it take? There probably will
be one, but the form is still very uncertain, and it may take a long
time to work out the details, yet the shape of a banking union will
make a very big difference to the future of the City of
London.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011038000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000108">What
is going to happen in the May elections? It seems quite possible that
the extreme anti-European parties in France, Greece, the Netherlands,
Finland and, perhaps, the UK, will win an overall majority in the
European Parliament. That will have major effects and cause major
changes in the European Union as we know it. Will we know the effects
by 2017? It is very unlikely. If we are to have a referendum, it is
vital to know what sort of Europe we are going to join, and in 
<?notus-xml column=1757?>the next three years we cannot predict exactly what the implications
will be. The only logical reason for having a fixed date now is that
the events of the next three years are irrelevant. The only logical
reason, in a sense, therefore, is for those who just want out: UKIP and
the Tea Party section of the Conservative Party. As Mr Farage has
admitted, he does not really care about the economic effects or the
effect on jobs and British influence in the world. What matters to UKIP
is that in an isolated little England we should be free to keep beastly
foreigners out. It is the gut anti-Europeans who really can justify a
referendum irrespective of the

noticed that the other day the very able Treasury Minister Danny
Alexander MP was deploring the uncertainty here about the European
Union and all the scepticism, argument and talk of actual withdrawal.
He believed it was undermining investment in the UK. We have heard the

time he talks a great deal of sense and is an extremely able Treasury

is a member have got things completely upside

the best way to drain the uncertainty and doubts out of the system and
end the bickering and difficulties that have gone on? Obviously, it is
to have in due course, at the right time, a popular vote which will
settle the matter for decades ahead, just as the previous referendum
did in 1975. It may not be for ever as things change. The whole of
Europe is changing, but it will certainly settle the matter for decades
ahead. Anything which assists that outcome, such as this Bill, should
be strongly supported, not opposed, by those who see themselves as good
Europeans. If Mr Alexander and his colleagues in his party or, indeed,
the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, from whom we have just heard, want less
uncertainty and a stronger investor commitment to this nation over the
next decade, they should be supporting, not opposing, this Bill. Those
who oppose the in/out referendum idea are really saying that they are
in favour of more friction and continuing, unending uncertainty,
precisely the conditions which turn off investors and weaken
confidence. In the end I believe that in reality all the political
parties, even our Liberal Democrat friends sitting here, will have to
face that and commit themselves to a

of the Government in 2011—of some for referring great issues of
constitutional power and the national future to popular judgment

claim they espouse. There could be no better way of wounding the cause
of European reform and progress—here I want to be optimistic,

all-party common-sense support, which will be necessary for this

all that than hiding the issue from popular judgment and setting that

effective way of consolidating a more democratic and popular European

Turnbull (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, there are many features of the EU
and our relationship with it that are beneficial, but there are also
many that are objectionable, beginning with the complacency of the
Brussels elite, exemplified on the radio this morning. There is the
contempt for popular opinion; the driving ambition for ever closer
union; the relentless expansion of the EU competences; the extravagance
over buildings and expenses; the waste within EU programmes such as the
CAP, overseas aid and the common fisheries policy; the hypocrisy of
demanding a 6% real-terms increase in the EU budget while imposing
harsh austerity on national budgets; the economic illiteracy of many of
the regimes, such as the euro, the Social Chapter and the working time
directive; and the damage to competitiveness in seeking to decarbonise
in only 35 more years, largely on the basis of renewables.
There is also the jealousy and hostility towards London as a financial
centre. Finally, there is the abject failure of the Lisbon 
<?notus-xml column=1759?>agenda, agreed in 2000, to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic
knowledge-based economy in the

is not surprising that many people have become exasperated, but does
that justify this curious Bill? It does not in my view. To make a
rational and informed choice on EU membership, one needs to start with
an analysis of the status quo of EU membership—its costs and
benefits—and then compare that with not one but two
counterfactuals. First, what would life be like as a member of the EU
on revised terms? Secondly, what would life be like outside the EU?
Current government policy at least attempts to address the first. That
is, after a period of negotiation the results are to be put to the
people for a decision. However, this still fails to deal with the
nature of life outside the EU.</hs_para>

treated like deciding not to renew one’s subscription to a golf
club, which has no lasting consequences. The decision to leave the EU
would leave a host of important issues unresolved, including
citizenship and rights of residence affecting millions of people who
have moved one way or another within the European Union; ownership of
property; employment; trade in goods and services; recognition of
intellectual property; the operation of cross-border businesses; study
at European universities; and many others. We would need to know how
many of the favourable aspects of EU membership, such as free trade, we
could retain through bilateral agreements, and how many of the
unfavourable elements we could jettison.</hs_para>

Garel-Jones (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by saying that this
Bill is, in my view, otiose. That is, I hope, a polite way of saying
that it is unnecessary. Two things seem abundantly clear. If, as I
hope, the Conservative Party wins the next general election, there will
be a referendum. It will appear in the party manifesto and that is
quite good enough for me. If  the incoming Government is not
Conservative or Conservative-led and is not committed to a referendum
or enthusiastic about this Bill, all they need is a guillotine Motion
and one day to dispose of it in the other place. Therefore, I ask
myself: what is the point of all this? Is there, perhaps, a hidden
agenda? Could it possibly be an effort to bounce the Labour Party into
lining up behind the Conservatives on this matter, or perhaps an effort
to attract potential UKIP
voters?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011041000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011041000002">I
confess that I am something of a Thatcherite where referenda are
concerned, but I accept, picking up the point that my noble friend Lord
Howell has just made about Lord Salisbury’s remarks 100 years
ago, that we have moved on. The Prime Minister has given his word on
this matter and I accept that. However, in 
<?notus-xml column=1760?>the unlikely event that the British people vote to leave the European
Union, far from it being the end of the game it would be just the
beginning. Following a withdrawal vote, the Government of the day
would, one assumes, enter into negotiations with our former partners on
a treaty setting out the terms and conditions of our relationship with
our largest trading partner. I do not propose today to enter into the
complexity of such negotiations. Suffice it to say that they would
bring into sharp focus the real issues that would arise in such a
situation.</hs_para>

me give just one brief example. Whatever the detailed outcome of the
negotiations might be, there can be no doubt that Britain, like Norway,
would be obliged to follow EU rules on the single market. In reality,
this would mean that any changes in the said rules—they are, by
their nature, constantly evolving—would be made in a forum where
Britain was not represented. Any new directive emerging from it would
be sent to the UK Parliament and we would have 90 days to
comply. It would be goodbye to parliamentary sovereignty. In the trade,
I think this is known as “fax
diplomacy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T11:46:56"></hs_TimeCode>”.
As in so many other walks of life, the devil is in the detail. Those
who believe that a vote in favour of withdrawal would signify the end
of the game are mistaken—the game is just beginning. I mentioned
compliance with single market rules, which is just one of many hugely
complex issues that would need to be settled.</hs_para>

the Prime Minister is right to seek change. Indeed, I believe that many
of our partners would be sympathetic to the proposition that
“one size fits all” is not always the best way to
maintain relations between 28 countries. Again, I give just one brief
example. The principle of subsidiarity needs adjusting to ensure
greater and smoother involvement by national parliaments. Therefore, I

it was a Bill that the Prime Minister wanted to include in the
Queen’s Speech but felt that he did not have the parliamentary
strength to do so. Normally, if Prime Ministers—certainly Prime
Ministers I have known and, I dare say, most other people—want a
Bill in the Queen’s Speech, they tend to get that Bill in the
Queen’s Speech. They have various mechanisms that they can
deploy to achieve this. However, of course it did not go into the
Queen’s Speech because the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=1761?>in charge of constitutional affairs—heaven help us—who is
the Deputy Prime Minister, decided that it should not be in the
Queen’s Speech because he was opposed to legislating for an
“in or out” referendum on our membership of the European
Union. He is also, of course, the only party leader who fought the
previous election on a manifesto commitment to do that. So the
strangeness develops as we go along this

then have what I can only describe as a slightly humiliating process
whereby the Prime Minister keeps all his fingers crossed that one
Back-Bencher will be successful in the private Members’ ballot

his own petard, because what should normally happen in a situation like
this is that the Prime Minister should say, “I can’t do
what I think is in the national interest to do. Therefore I will call a
general election and see whether the public agree with me or
not”. That option has, however, been removed by one part of the
constitutional vandalism of this Government, which is that they passed
the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, said at
Second Reading—he can reread that speech with

Ministers and Governments into a straitjacket. That, of course, is

for the principle of a referendum, I have no problem whatever with the

was, after all, a Labour Government who introduced what at that time
was a brand-new constitutional device: in 1975 we introduced a Bill on
which many of us voted, one way or another, and we had our first ever
referendum. That is the correct thing to do for a matter of
constitutional significance of this kind. For accuracy, I should record
that I voted no in that referendum, and I may say that I have never

I do not have any problem with the principle whatever. However, I do
have a great problem—this was the constitutional point that the

fundamental, and it is particularly so. We have heard several people
ask, “What does this House of Lords got to do with telling that
House of Commons whether it should or should not go ahead with a piece
of legislation?”. My answer is that this House of Commons should
not be telling the next House of Commons 
<?notus-xml column=1762?>what it should be doing. That is particularly true as we are nearly in
the fifth year of this Parliament—we come back to that wretched

that that is the democratic thing to do. It is not democratic for a
Parliament elected in 2010, in what is nearly its fag-end year, to tell
a Parliament that will be elected in 2015 what it should do in 2017.

position clear. I was actively involved with my then boss, Roy Jenkins,
who was president of the 1975 yes campaign in the referendum. I fought
and nearly won a seat—like the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, who won
his—in the October 1974 general election on a pledge that our
future in Europe would be decided either at a referendum or at a
general election. How I wish that we had stuck to a general election as
the way to decide. Unlike my old noble friend Lord Roper, the more
referenda I see, the less I like them. I agree with the noble Marquess,
Lord Salisbury, on this, if on nothing else. Who fixes the 
<?notus-xml column=1763?>topic, and who decides the date? We had a crystal-clear result by 2:1 in
1975. Will we have another referendum every 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50
years? Who decides that, and why? No; referenda are
the coward’s way out. They are an abdication of responsibility
by leaders and parties who do not have the courage to take a decision
and put it to the people. In any case, there is no need for a
referendum on Europe when there is a clear choice at the next general
election. If you want to come out of Europe, you vote UKIP. If you want
to stay in, you vote Liberal Democrat or Labour. If you do not know or
do not care, you vote
Conservative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000137">Nevertheless,
the Commons in its infinite wisdom has sent us this defective little
Bill, so we must do our constitutional duty and scrutinise, amend and
examine it as thoroughly as we possibly can. I will press, with my
noble friend Lord Shipley, one amendment in particular as the Bill
proceeds, to ensure that all the estimated 1.5 million UK citizens
living in the other member states of the EU—that figure is from
the Commons Library—have a vote, if, by any chance, a referendum
comes to pass. Those fellow citizens of ours, 1 million of whom live in
Spain, France and Ireland alone, have made the decision, often many
years ago, to go to work or retire in the rest of Europe in good faith
and in the assurance that we were part of the EU, with free movement of
labour guaranteed, and equal rights with any other European citizen to
live wherever they want in Europe. What a betrayal of their trust it
would be to take away their rights and risk uprooting them from their
jobs and homes, without giving them a vote in a referendum which would
be so crucial to their

my noble friend Lord Roper knows, I supported a referendum in 1972, and

there should be referendum then, in that Parliament of 1972 to 1973. I
think that this is a gimmick, in many respects. However, why are we
here? We are here because successive Prime Ministers have given
commitments to hold referendums and then have not done so. The country
does not trust us. On this issue of Europe, they have seen party after
party manoeuvre and manipulate, and they do not believe it—and
they do not actually believe it, even if they say at a general election
that there will be a referendum. I was told by the parties opposite at

situation in Europe where we could have a referendum in the early part
of next year before there is a general election. That would be the best
thing; we would have a lot of political parties actually trying to get
a serious negotiation. Most people in Europe feel that this issue going

resolved the issue of the eurozone, which is not yet safe. The whole
situation that will come over the next year or so is hanging

I do not have any particular wish to have a referendum in 2017. I agree
very much with what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that
that will not happen. There are juxtapositions of presidencies and
general elections in Germany, which are crucial, and you would not opt
to have it in 2017. So if it comes, it is more likely to be in

along with it; why set up an Electoral Commission and then ignore its
advice? The other thing that is absolutely crazy is to go again with
what was done over the alternative vote and have a whole year in which
you have announced an election. The provision that you must do this by

politics of the Prime Minister’s decision was wrong, I
think—but that is his judgment and one for the Conservatives. It
is a fact that this Bill comes to us not having been contested in the
House of Commons, with great big majorities there. I think that the
largest opposition vote was 240 to 30. Neither the Liberal Democrats
nor the Labour Party wants to break cover and say that they will not
have a referendum, but that is because it is quite obvious that the
general public wants one. So my advice is to do

referendum in 1975 settled the issue for a long time, and was salutary
and important. We were not going into Europe in 1972 with the
whole-hearted 
<?notus-xml column=1765?>consent of the British people—and we did after that. When we were
negotiating and when we held the first presidency in 1977, it was an
inestimable help to have that referendum behind us. So there is another
reason. And then, in the 1983 election, the proposition was put to the
country to come out of the European Union without even a referendum.
That was blown to smithereens in the election. We will never come out
of the European Union without a referendum, and I believe that that is
an important constitutional safeguard. So those who decry having
referendums on anything, like the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, are not
living in the modern world. Referendums are here on constitutional
questions; they have been incredibly helpful in Northern Ireland and
can be stabilising mechanisms if they are used

would vote rather reluctantly for it, because any other vote shows to
the general public that you do not want a referendum and that you are
afraid of it. As to the question of how I vote, I would leave that

members of the social democratic grouping, which is hugely influential
in the European Parliament. That is another thing that has changed
dramatically since 1975. You do not make changes nowadays in European
treaties or make any major reform without the European Parliament. I
regret that, because I think that it has been given too much power, but
the fact is that you cannot get through any substantive reform without
a fair measure of support in the European Parliament. Therefore,
getting a political party like the Labour Party, which can mobilise the

European who found his Europeanism was helped by never attending any of

that the free movement of labour should now be interpreted

assuage the militant Europhobes in his party and has failed. He has

Shipley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I led a debate in your
Lordships’ House in October on the importance of our continued
membership of the EU to our economy and to jobs. I live in the
north-east of England, where our regional economy is hugely dependent
on exports to the EU and inward investment from abroad. As we know from
the warnings of Nissan, Hitachi and others, leaving the EU could cost
us thousands of jobs if we lost the benefits of the single
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000169">I have
no difficulty with the principle of referendums. They can give
legitimacy to constitutional change, they can clear the air when there
are differences of opinion and they can engage voters directly in
decision-making. However, they should be used only when there is an
identifiable constitutional need, when the question to be asked has
been approved by the Electoral Commission and when the franchise
applies to all those who could be personally affected by the result.
The Bill fails those tests: the timing proposed does not reflect
constitutional need; the question needs to be changed because the
Electoral Commission recommends a different question; and many people
likely to be directly affected by the result will be denied a
vote.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000170">I now
pursue this latter issue about who can vote. UK voters who move abroad
can vote in UK parliamentary elections from their last UK address for
up to 15 years after moving, but not after 15 years. So, UK citizens
who have lived elsewhere in the EU for less than 15 years can have a
vote in this referendum if they have a registered address in a UK
constituency. However, what about UK pensioners who may have lived
elsewhere in the EU for more than 15 years? They will be denied a vote.
Yet their pensions, currently uprated, as in the UK, could cease to be
uprated if we leave the EU. They could be treated as UK pensioners
living in Commonwealth countries are treated, where pensions are not
uprated. These pensioners may have contributed all their lives and they
have a right to be involved in a referendum. So do all those working
and living elsewhere in the EU, whether under or over 15
years, since they could lose their rights to do so. So do all those
from elsewhere in the EU working in the UK and paying taxes here. They
should have the same rights in a referendum as they hold for local
elections.</hs_para>

to me that, in the referendum on Scottish independence later this year,
the test for who can vote is residency. A voter must reside in
Scotland, so 790,000 people born in Scotland but living elsewhere in
the UK cannot vote. Conversely, 413,000 people born elsewhere in the UK
can vote because they reside in Scotland. This is a very different
approach, but that difference confirms my view that we need to explore
the matter of who can vote in this EU referendum in much greater depth

that there are, and have been all over my political career, people who
are passionately in favour of Europe and believe that it is too
important and complex an issue to trust the British people to decide.
Those same people, and there have been one or two today, will say,
“Well, they have the right to do that in a general

know that a general election cannot be fought on a single issue. There

because I am confident that there will be a Conservative Government

will be able to ask a sensible question of the British people, to make
a decision between two viable alternatives: “Which way do you

Willoughby de Broke (UKIP):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful
to the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, for introducing this important Bill. It
has been a long time getting here, has it not? It is more than 20 years
since we last debated an EU referendum, when there was a Motion to
approve a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. I voted for it, but we
were defeated, thanks largely to the very successful whipping of the
then Conservative Chief Whip in this House, the noble Lord, Lord
Hesketh—who, I am happy to say, has now seen the light and is a
member of
UKIP.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000181">I have
to say that I am still astonished and disappointed that it was
successive Conservative Governments who started handing over the powers
of Parliament and of the British people, without asking them, to
Brussels. That was enthusiastically followed up by successive Labour
Governments, who were cheered from the sidelines by the Liberal
Democrats, for whom no surrender to Europe and Brussels is ever meek
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000182">Many
of the powers were given away, as I will tell noble Lords in a minute,
without the British people ever being asked whether that was what they
wanted. Treaty after treaty—Maastricht, Nice, Amsterdam,
Lisbon—drained ever more power away from the British Parliament
at Westminster and from the people of this 
<?notus-xml column=1772?>country and channelled it to the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. Very
little that matters is now left to the Westminster Parliament, which
has nothing at all to say about the economy, immigration, energy,

those 20 seemingly endless years, with endless debates about our
membership of the EU, some of us were always against the handover of
powers—the surrender to Brussels of the powers of Parliament and
of the British people. However, in this House at least, we have always
been outnumbered by the Europhile tendency—the Euro-grandees,
who seem unable to see politics except through their Euro-prism. They
accuse those who believe in parliamentary democracy in this
country—the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, was at it today—of
being “little Englanders”, of wrapping ourselves in the
union jack and of wanting to turn back the clock. That is patronising
rubbish. Why are they so blinded by Brussels and the desire for further
integration that they are unable to see the truth?</hs_para>

we should not be too critical of those who wish to extend the debate.

will confine myself to three points that reflect my status as a new
Member of the House as I contemplate, without the advantage of
others’ long service, my obligations as a Peer. The first is
that we are a revising Chamber, with a particular duty to protect the
essential liberties and good government of the United Kingdom, and to
be always mindful of the potential for abuse through the arbitrary use
of executive power in the House of Commons. It is our job to insist
that the House of Commons enjoys legitimacy and public consent for its
actions. This is particularly the case where its actions have
constitutional implications. Here I look for correction from more
experienced colleagues. Would it not be odd for the House to attempt to
block a proposal made in the other place for a referendum? Would it not
be odd for it to be us who removed a check on executive power and ruled
that the people should not be consulted? Should an appointed House
stand between the people and a chance to vote? Surely
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000191">I hope
noble Lords will forgive a further piece of naivety. Is it not also one
of our duties to accept the principle laid down in the manifesto of the
governing parties? Surely it would be almost a breach of the Salisbury
convention for us to veto the principle of an “in or out”
referendum advanced so steadfastly and well by the Liberal Democrats at
the most recent general
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000192">The
same principle should surely persuade noble Lords to embed this
principle in legislation now. New though I am to these things, it seems
to be in the best traditions of the House to act as a guarantor when
previous referendum promises have been made and then ignored. There has
been much talk of UKIP, but we all understand the politics here. We
understand that the Labour Party promised a referendum on the European
constitution. It won an election on that promise and then denied a
referendum on the Lisbon treaty. With the best will in the world, that
was a scandalous event that demands and requires this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000193">My third
point is that this House brings experience to the debate, as today has
shown. If an argument is made, the House has heard it before and knows
its worth. At every stage of Europe’s development, we have been
told that what happens is inevitable, that a better deal is impossible
and that Britain cannot stand apart and insist on its own terms. When
the euro began, France’s Finance Minister said that Britain 
<?notus-xml column=1774?>would pay the penalty for being out of it. We would be excluded from the
councils of Europe. “Monetary union is a marriage”, he
declared forthrightly, “and people who are married do not want
others in the bedroom”. How wonderful the bedroom metaphor was,
given that the Minister was Dominique
Strauss-Kahn<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:39:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Quin (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Liddle, in his
excellent speech on behalf of the Labour Party, reminded us that our
party is not against referendums, and that is certainly the case, as
the record shows. My personal position is a little different in that I
have always been rather concerned about the way that ad hoc and ill
thought out referendums have seemed to become part of our constitution.
Therefore, I was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, reminded me that
my political hero Clement Attlee greatly distrusted
referendums.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000196">However,
I accept that at this stage the genie is probably largely out of the
bottle and, certainly, if we are to have referendums, the major
constitutional issues of the day are, presumably, suitable subjects for
them. Therefore, my objections to the Bill do not relate to the fact
that it calls for a referendum but are much more concerned with other
aspects of it, including the substance of the clauses and, indeed, some
of the political circumstances surrounding the process and passage of
the Bill, which were very effectively described by my noble friend Lord
Kinnock a few minutes

timing issue is a very serious one. To call for a referendum by a
specific date, regardless of the circumstances of the time and whether
we might be in negotiations with other EU countries, is simply crazy. I
am also concerned at the suggestion that we should deal with this Bill
in this House in a completely different way from the way we would
normally deal with legislation, including Private Members’
Bills. I certainly cannot see the justification for that. That point

possible rule seemed to emerge during the debate that we should give
easy passage to items which have been heavily voted in favour of in

proponents of such an approach mean in terms of how many votes would
need to be cast in favour of a measure in the other place for us not to
treat it seriously in this House. However, as I say, I think that it

join other noble Lords in saying that I do not like the fact that the
Bill attempts to bind a successor Parliament. That is quite wrong.
Although it is true, as I think the noble Lords, Lord Howell and Lord
King, said, that Parliaments pass many bits of legislation which may
have effect in the future, this Bill is unusual 
<?notus-xml column=1775?>in singling out a specific date in a future Parliament. I do not recall
that having been done before in quite this way. If we give the Bill

point has been made many times that the general public are very much in
favour of a referendum. I accept that opinion polls show that to be the
case. However, we should also remember that in recent general elections
Europe has been a much lower priority than many other issues, certainly
compared with such issues as the cost of living, health, education and
housing. This was confirmed to me in the most recent spate of door
knocking that I took part in, which was during the South Shields
by-election. While canvassing in different areas over two days, Europe
was not raised with me once although many other issues were, despite
the fact that there was a great deal of media frenzy about it and that
UKIP’s best efforts were deployed to try to raise the issue and
profit from the unpopularity of the coalition

has been made of how much certainty the Bill introduces into the
debate, but I do not think that it introduces any certainty at all. As
I said, Parliament cannot bind its successor. Therefore, there are many
reasons why a referendum held at the particular time envisaged in the
Bill will not go ahead. For that reason, it is very understandable that
businesses in particular are very worried about the uncertainty that
the Bill would create. I agree very much with the comments of the noble
Lord, Lord Shipley. Certainly, in the north-east of England, which has
the Nissan car plant, which is one of the most productive on the
planet, and which is an exporting region—I think that we are the
only part of the country to have a positive trade balance—there
is great fear and uncertainty as a result of this measure. Given the
number of firms involved and the number of people they employ up and

that this House should resile from its normal position as a revising
Chamber. That argument was accurately recounted by the noble Lord, Lord
Finkelstein, in his rather refreshing speech. This House is a revising 
<?notus-xml column=1776?>Chamber and should remain so. I think that there is a clear division in
this House and in the other place as to the desirability, or otherwise,
of this legislation. The only way in which we can proceed sensibly is

It should have its Second Reading and proceed to a Committee stage, at
which no doubt amendments will be put down and debated. It may even be
thought appropriate for some amendments to be passed by this House. The
Bill should then go to Report and Third Reading in exactly the same way
as any other Private Member’s Bill. The idea that somehow or
other the Bill should be given an accelerated and easier passage is to
my mind constitutional nonsense. It should receive proper scrutiny and
proper consideration. The timetabling of legislation in the other place

view that I have held and expressed on many occasions in the past few
years, particularly when this House was actively considering the issue
of House of Lords reform. However, to say that at the end of the day
the House of Commons must be entitled to have its way is not quite
sufficient. This Bill is not at the end of the day but at the

Vinson (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I should like briefly to revert to
why we need a referendum and why this Bill is thus so important. Our
nation has nearly bankrupted itself fighting three wars in Afghanistan,
Iraq and Libya, all of which aimed to give democracy and
self-determination to those three nations. Yet here at home we daily
deny self-rule, even to the extent that last week, contrary to the
views of our own Health and Safety Executive, the EU issued a diktat
controlling the nature of how much spice bakers can put into pastries.
This is a perfect example, albeit insignificant in itself, of how
Parliament has become a charade, as the EU reaches into every nook and
cranny of our nation. Surely, it was never meant to be like that.
Things have moved
on<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:52:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Currently,
thousands of the decisions that widely affect the lives of voters are
taken by anonymous and unaccountable bureaucrats rather than by
parliamentarians responsible to those voters. Is it any wonder that
there is widespread voter
disenchantment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

that the American War of Independence, just over 200 years ago, was
triggered on that famous slogan, “No taxation without
representation”. We are now back to roughly the same position:
we have regulation without rectification. It is virtually impossible to
change EU regulations. Most decision-making has been taken away from
national Parliaments and for virtually everything that matters, from
the economy to immigration, decisions are made elsewhere, many of them
extremely damaging to our national efficiency—not least as
regards the working time directive; and we were told last night in an
excellent speech by the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, of the harm that that

country have been promised a referendum and I hope that they will get

Monks (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there is much mention of people
being told the truth in the European debate. I ask supporters of this
Bill to reflect for a moment on the following truths, which seem
self-evident to me as a former general-secretary of the TUC and the
European TUC. An important truth is that, once the business
world—or certainly those parts of it concerned with
exports—considers that Britain may well leave the EU, thousands
of British jobs will be at grave risk. If the Bill is enacted, the
prospect of that exit will become rather more real and
tangible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:56:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Eurosceptics often say that the British people are not being told the
truth about the EU—there was an echo of that from the previous
speaker—but let us have a go at some of those truths. The first
is that the British economy is closely integrated with the economies of
other countries, not just in Europe but perhaps particularly in Europe.
The 40% share of our trade with the EU is easily the biggest component
of our business. Before nostalgics get too keen on the Commonwealth
connection, they might just bear in mind that the level of our trade
with North Rhine-Westphalia is larger than that with Australia and
India combined. Our trade with China has only recently exceeded our
trade with the Republic of
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:57:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

booming motor industry—all foreign owned—exports the bulk
of its vehicles to European destinations. We certainly import a lot but
the import side is not going to change in a way that threatens the
export side. However, there is a threat because many UK manufacturing
firms are foreign owned, including a huge slice of the City of London.
There has been a big change since 1975 and inward investment would
certainly be affected. There have been several references to Nissan and
its importance to the north-east economy but its importance goes much
wider than that. Siemens has also been mentioned, and Goldman Sachs was
referred to by my noble friend Lord Liddle. We have to start believing
what some of these chief executives say. Others who are not saying it
publicly are saying it
privately<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:58:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

it or not—I address this particularly to the nationalist
tendency here today who are dreaming of a Britain that was perhaps
relevant 30 or 40 years ago but is not relevant today—many of
the levers of power are in foreign hands. They are the sources of much
of the investment, technology, know-how and jobs that help Britain to
pay its way in the world. Mr Farage may not care if an EU exit makes us
all poorer; the rest of us just do not have that
luxury<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:58:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

firms will not have a vote in a referendum but they can surely vote
with their feet if they become worried about the future of this
country. By the way, no Europhobe or Eurosceptic ever seems to complain
about the selling of Britain to foreign owners. That is a much great
constraint on our sovereignty than any Europhile ever dreamt of. That
is the reality and the truth which people on the other side of this
House, particularly those in the Conservative Party, should face up
to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T12:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

if many of the better foreign firms started to wind down their
activities in this country—it would not happen
overnight—new product lines would go to other countries and
outside the EU we would become a sub-contractor to the world, with zero
economic sovereignty and a disappearing tax base. We would become a
bits-and-pieces economy, offering low-paid, transient work to our
people. People knock the Social Chapter and the working time directive,
but do we really want junior hospital doctors to go back to working 100
hours a week? Do we really want to get rid of the four-week minimum
holiday entitlement that workers have been given? That is what the
Social Chapter is about. If those on the other side of the House want
to get rid of things, I hope that they will tell us specifically what
those things
are.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_10_PT_1/D11816FE5EFB80A56443163CB9AEFDDA70C32AD0" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 January 2014">Friday,

Tugendhat (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, as the House knows, I am a
former EU Commissioner and, as such, I look forward to campaigning in
the referendum that the Prime Minister has promised to hold in the
event of a Conservative election victory. Whatever happens to this
Bill, that remains the case. The Prime Minister set out his policy in
his Bloomberg speech and I support that policy. The Prime Minister has
given his word and I am sure that he will keep it. So, in the event of
a Conservative electoral victory, there will be a referendum whether or
not this Bill goes through Parliament. The important thing is that the
referendum will take place because the Prime Minister has said it will,
provided that he of course can lead a successful campaign in the
election<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:01:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011038000223">So
the Bill is, in part, unnecessary. However, I am afraid that it is
also, in part, a bad Bill. A referendum on UK membership of the
European Union will be a major political, economic and constitutional
event. On that point everyone can agree. It should therefore be
organised with the greatest possible care and thoroughness; it should
not be based on a rushed and inadequate Private Member’s Bill.
The Electoral Commission has drawn attention to some of the
inadequacies, as have the reports of the Select Committee on the
Constitution and the Delegated Powers Committee. 
<?notus-xml column=1780?>In the interests of brevity I will not repeat the points made by the
Select Committee on the Constitution, the Electoral Commission or the

would add two further points of my own. One point concerns the position
of Gibraltar. It is bizarre that Gibraltarians should be given the
right to participate in a referendum of this kind. I do not see why
that particular overseas territory, or any other overseas territory,
should be given that right. If Gibraltar has a referendum on its
relationship with Spain, or whatever it might be, we will not have a
vote, and I do not see why it should have a vote here. There is an
element of absurdity in

more serious is the position of the hundreds of thousands of British
citizens who work, live and have retired in other countries within the
European Union. Those people will be directly affected by the result of
any referendum and I think that they certainly have the right to
participate. I do not know what the figures would be but it would not
be impossible to put together arrangements which would enable a great
many of those people to

should perhaps learn from Australia, a country which goes in for
referenda from time to time. It had an important referendum some years
ago on whether or not it wanted to remain a monarchy. Australians
living, working or retired in this country, the United States, the
continent of Europe, India or wherever it might be were able to vote,
under certain conditions and as long as they met certain criteria. Just
as Australians were able to vote on the constitutional future of their
country even if they were not at the time living in Australia, so
British citizens should be able to do the same even if they are not at

conclude, the Conservative Party will ensure that there is a referendum

Liddell of Coatdyke (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we have had a number
of very interesting speeches in the past couple of hours, but the first
few sentences of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat,
absolutely sums the situation up. If the Prime Minister wants a
referendum on Europe before December 2017, he puts it in his manifesto,
goes to the people and, if he is elected, gets his referendum. The
noble Lord, Lord Finkelstein, in his very amusing speech, talked about
leadership—it is not a sign of leadership to cower behind the,
albeit elegant, coat-tails of a Back-Bencher to try to get a piece of
legislation before this House because of fear of UKIP on the one hand
or of what the noble Lord, Lord Garel-Jones, described as the Tea Party
tendency in the Tory party on the other. Nevertheless, I congratulate
the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, on his opening remarks. It is quite
interesting that the ghost of Francis Urquhart is sitting out in the 
<?notus-xml column=1781?>Prince’s Chamber, because that gives the show away—this is
a government Bill masquerading as a Back-Bencher’s Bill. That is
regrettable for two reasons: first, it is here under false pretences
and, secondly, the very fact that it seeks to bind a future Government

oldest and best single market is here in the United Kingdom. Right now,
another referendum is going on—it seems to have been going on
since time began but has actually been going on for only a couple of
years—which seeks to break up that oldest and best single

British political boundaries have never been able to cope with the

deep individual as well as collective questions about who we are, what
kind of country we wish to be and how best we can engineer for
ourselves a decent and effective place in the world. Our free trading

and our absolute belief that we are not and never can be just any old

my judgment, all these impulses and feelings swirl through the Bill
before us, short though it is. Europe is undeniably a first-order
question for our people and for our place in the world. Therefore, it
is necessary that the consent of the British people to our membership
of the European Union should be tested every couple of generations or
so. The bulk of the British electorate has not been asked the
“in or out” question, as the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs,
stressed in his eloquent opening speech. The time is approaching when
they need to be—but how soon? Is it desirable now to fix a
deadline and set the clock ticking? Here, for me, the reservations set
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011041000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011041000019">The
negotiating climate today is far less manageable than in 1975, with our
current EU of 28 members, several of whom deeply resent their
experience of the UK as the permanent awkward squad in Europe, emitting
a constant drizzle of complaint within the Union’s councils. The
climate is different, too, at the very top. It is not the era of
Schmidt and Giscard. To borrow from PG Wodehouse, if you are a 21st
century German Chancellor or French President, it is always easy to
distinguish between a ray of sunshine and a British Prime Minister
bearing a request to
renegotiate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011041000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0001.htm#14011041000020">I
accept that there is never an ideal time for a renegotiation followed
by a referendum. Our economy was in terrible shape in 1975, with
inflation rising above 25%, deindustrialisation proceeding apace and
stagflation everywhere—but the road to a 2017 referendum would
be hard, stretching and sloggy, even if unforgiving and unforeseen
events do not add to the wear and tear of high diplomacy and political
manoeuvre. To legislate now for a date three years away and the other
side of a general election strikes me as not just undesirable but
immensely risky for our country.</hs_para>

certain: even a meaningful and successful renegotiation followed by a
referendum in which the British people showed a continuing desire to
remain within the EU would not settle the matter. There were those

How wrong they were. Even if the UK is still an EU nation in

overturn or delay the will of a democratically elected House of Commons

illusion to imagine that having the referendum would result in closure.

of the spectre of Europe from our body politic. I recall Mr Benn at
that time telling me that it would lead to closure, yet almost
immediately afterwards he was campaigning for an exit from Europe. The
separatists in Quebec, who almost succeeded in the Quebec referendum of
1995, have not suddenly forgotten their separatist ambitions because
they keep on losing referenda. No, the clear message—I see the

most impressed with what the noble Lord, Lord Owen, had to say, and if
I may summarise it to him, although he is not in his place, it was that

them, which seems to be a very peculiar position for us to be in,
particularly when there are two very clear issues that need to be
scrutinised. They are the most fundamental points about any such Bill,
which are, put simply: what is the question, and who gets to vote?
Those are the two that have come up from a number of people. On the
point about who has the right to vote, the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott,
raised an interesting point about the position of the 1.5 million

group of independent experts which it has set up to advise it, and we

answers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000263">A

Giddens (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am a strong and committed
pro-European, and if noble Lords will forgive me, I shall describe the
reasons for that as three Ps and an S.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>, I am a
pro-European because of peace. Many people say that dealing with
conflict in Europe is a thing of the past. That is manifestly not so.
There was a bloody and horrible war in the Balkans some two decades
ago. It is highly important for Serbia, Kosovo, Albania and the Balkan
countries to enter the European Union. Secondly, I am a pro-European
because of prosperity. It sounds an odd thing to say given the travails
of the eurozone, but the single market adds something like 2.6% to the
GDP of its member nations, and the eurozone is in the process of
basically positive reform.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011038000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000265">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>,
I am a pro-European because of power. In our globally interdependent
world, if Europe cannot collectively exert an influence over the rest
of the world, we will live in a kind of G2 world in which we will be a
backwater and will simply be subject to the decisions of others.
Fourthly, and this is important in this debate, I am a pro-European
because of what I call “sovereignty plus”—that is,
because, contrary to what many people seem to imagine, each nation gets
more sovereignty from being part of the European Union than it has
outside it. This was recognised in the Prime Minister’s
Bloomberg speech where he said that in foreign policy we get much more
clout from being a member of the European Union than we would
otherwise. This can be generalised to most aspects of EU
membership.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011038000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000266">I
am a committed pro-European, but I am not one of those who hold that it
would be economic and political suicide for the UK to leave. I think
that the UK could at some point leave the European Union 
<?notus-xml column=1788?>and could survive outside it, but the conditions of doing so would be
extremely damaging indeed. Like most other noble Lords who have spoken,
I think that at some point the people should decide. I am therefore in
favour of a referendum, which would be sensible and democratic to hold
at some point.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011038000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000267">However, no one should
doubt that if Britain were to exit the EU, there would be a wrenching
and protracted process of readjustment. Other noble Lords have drawn
attention to this. The idea that the country would magically retrieve
lost sovereignty is superficial and foolish. What matters in the
contemporary world is not paper sovereignty but real sovereignty in a
world that has been transformed out of all recognition over the past
two or so decades. For example, the European economies and the American
economy are likely to be transformed by the transatlantic free trade
agreement. This is very much on the books; it is likely to happen
within the next two years. There is very strong support from the Obama
Administration. You cannot tell me that if the UK were outside the EU
and had to negotiate individually it would have more sovereignty than
it would inside the EU.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011038000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000268">This is not a trivial
thing; a tremendous process of transformation is envisaged here.
Essentially, the country would have to reinvent itself and the
reinvention that would have to follow would be the opposite of
UKIP’s “beer and cigarettes, back to 1950s”
version of Britain. It would have to reinvent itself not like
Switzerland or Norway but, if you want a really positive model, like
Canada—as a kind of open, small economy, heavily dependent on a
much larger one to which it is adjacent and to which it must orient its
actions, with far less influence in the world than the UK has at the
moment, but nevertheless a society that survives well. That could be a
model for the future but it would be a dramatic process of
transformation. The country would have to be anti-UKIP because it would
have to be much more cosmopolitan and open-looking. There would have to
be more immigration, rather than less, just as Canada
has<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

should be held but only if certain conditions are satisfied. Since
these have been widely discussed in the debate, I shall zoom through
them fairly quickly. First, as many noble Lords have noted, it should
not be driven by short-term political concerns but by the long-term
interests of the country. As I have just stressed, it would be the
biggest transformation that the country has faced for more than 60
years. It would be quite different from the 1975 referendum, which was
held when Europe was in the process of being formed. We would be
leaving an entity of 520 million people, which is still moving forward.
It would be a very dramatic and consequential step to take, and the
whole country should realise
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000270">Secondly,
a referendum should not be held until it is clear what shape the EU,
and specifically the eurozone, will assume. This point has also been
made previously by noble Lords. Europe is in flux and in movement; we
do not know what the outcome will be. What we can be sure of is that
there will be treaty change; I think that is inevitable. That treaty
change is likely to happen within the next five or six years. That is
the process to 
<?notus-xml column=1789?>be monitored at the time when people should be asked to decide in an
“in or out” referendum in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000271">Thirdly—I
feel this very strongly as I am very worried about it and I do not like
the impact of the Bill on it—there must be a full and fair open
public debate. It takes a long time for such a debate to be set in
motion. What really worries me is that the UK could drift out of the EU
without most citizens fully understanding the consequences and
implications. I think a great deal of attention needs to be given to
this because it would be the very worst outcome for
anyone<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000272">In

Wigley (PC):</Member></B> My Lords, it is surely ludicrous that a
debate of this significance is limited to just one day and for us to be
told that we cannot amend the Bill. I make it clear where I stand in
the context of the Bill: I am as passionately pro-European as I am
committed to Wales. Wales is a European nation in language and
religion, in history and culture. We belong to Europe. This year we
remember how, twice in the past century, our continent tore itself
apart in two bloody wars in which millions of innocent people were
killed. The vision of European unity was born to ensure that never,
ever again does that happen. Anyone who mindlessly jettisons the
structures that have helped to ensure peace over the past 60 years does
so at his
peril<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:39:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000274">I
believe in the value of nations but mine is a civic, not a racial,
nationalism. Everyone who chooses to make their home in Wales, whatever
their language, colour or creed, is a full and equal citizen of our
country. Yes, we want to see as many decisions as possible that affect
Wales taken in Wales. That chimes in with the European principle of
subsidiarity, that decisions should be taken as close as possible to
the communities on which they impact, and that principle certainly
needs to be strengthened. But some decisions—environmental ones
and those relating to the single market—must be taken on a
European level, and we must be there, arguing our corner, whether that
“we” refers to Wales or to
Britain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000275">Of
course there are things that need reforming in the EU, but that does
not mean that we chuck our toys out of the pram and throw a tantrum if
we don't always get our own way. It should mean that we argue our case,
without the implicit blackmail that unless we get our own way we quit.
That is the fundamental problem with the Bill: it is driven by UKIP,
which wants only one thing—for Britain to quit the EU. For them,
it is not about getting better terms, less bureaucracy, quicker
decisions, less waste. It is simply about getting
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000276">The Bill
does not attempt to establish what would be the acceptable terms on
which to remain in the EU. It does not accept the logic that if reforms
to improve the EU can be achieved, why should we need a referendum at
all? The Bill will clearly need to be amended in Committee to ensure
that everyone living in Britain, whose well-being may be at stake, can
vote. The Bill as 
<?notus-xml column=1790?>currently drafted does not deal with the possibility of a yes vote in
Scotland’s referendum. It does not provide for the results to be
published in each of the constituent nations of the UK. It is our duty,
as a revising Chamber, to consider such amendments and to make them if
we deem it

fact that the Bill comes to us late in the parliamentary year is not
our fault. Since the Bill proposes a referendum in 2017, there is no
reason why such a Bill should not come next year for proper discussion

steamrollered through Parliament. My fear is that that is what we are

Balfe (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the Bill and look forward
to it passing. However, I also look forward to campaigning for a yes
vote in the inevitable referendum. Although some people have said,
“This isn’t the right Bill”, there is an
undercurrent that there should be a referendum, and there is, again, a
need to get the will of the British people expressed. That, of course,
is one of the inconveniences of living in a democracy—from time
to time you just have to let the people say what they want to do. This
Bill is a vehicle for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T13:42:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000279">I
spent 25 years in the European Parliament and the overwhelming
impression I got was the failure to understand and to engage between
both sides. As an MEP I constantly felt—having, of course, the
joy of serving in both parties—that neither party knew what to
do with its MEPs. They felt that they were a bit of a nuisance and a
bit of an irrelevance. However, seriously, if you look at other
European member states you find a much better level of integration
between what is going on in Brussels and what is going on in the member
state than you do in the United Kingdom. We have consistently failed to
engage, and that comes down to very petty things. When do you ever see
an MEP wandering around this House? I see the former leader of the
Opposition, who will know the Danish Parliament well, and if you go to
the Danish Parliament you will often find MEPs wandering around it
because there is a structure for them to relate to it and be there.

what would happen if people vote no. The question will be, “Do

European People’s Party, which contains a lot of people who have
influence. We need to be in a position of influence, because if we were
on the path to withdrawal—and I sincerely hope that we are

all the former Ministers who have been lined up—the good old
trusties who have been brought in early on to support the

consider amendments. You are not allowed to, the House of Commons is
supreme”. My noble friend Lord Richard dealt with some of this
earlier. “Scrutiny procedures should not be used”, they
said. First, I remind the House that we scrutinised the Bill
relating to the alternative vote and the boundaries review. If the
other place had paid attention to what we said in relation to that,
they would have saved a lot of time and money and another referendum
would not have taken place, with all the cost that that involved. That
was discussed during government time—all that time we took to
deal with the
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000291">What
has happened now is that by asking the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, to bring
forward this Bill, the Government are hijacking Private Members’

artificial timetable, and saying that if we do not get it through this
House by the end of February, it is going to be lost. That is not our
decision; we have not imposed that timetable; it is an arbitrary
timetable imposed upon us. At the same time, they have hijacked all the
time for Private Members’ Bills. Have a look at all the other
Private Members’ Bills that are waiting for a Friday to come
forward. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, that I have kept all my
Fridays free for the next few months—just a little indication to
him. But look at all the other Private Members’ Bills that are

other areas. No, this is a misguided effort, which is why I could not

Suttie (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, like anyone born after 1958 in this
country, I have never had the opportunity to vote in a referendum on
the UK’s membership of the European Union. Some noble Lords,
with all their experience of actual referendum campaigns, may tell me
that I am being a little optimistic, but as a pro-European I have
always believed that a referendum campaign could allow the positive
case for membership of the European Union to be heard—or at the
very least provide the opportunity to correct many of the more
ludicrous Euro-myths that have gained currency over the
years.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011038000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000293">I very
much agree with the speech made earlier by my noble friend Lord
Garel-Jones. He said it is a matter of considerable regret that
successive UK Governments have failed effectively to make the positive
case for EU membership. Instead of arguing for much needed EU reform
from a position of strength as a committed European leader, we have
consistently weakened our negotiating position by giving the impression
that we really do not know whether we want to be in or
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000294" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000294">There is
therefore a good case for a referendum, which is why the Liberal
Democrats supported the 2011 referendum Act and why we are in favour of
an “in or out” referendum the next time there is a
further transfer of power from London to Brussels. I agree with many of
the noble Lords today who have said that they believe that a referendum
is now inevitable. However, the Bill in front of us today is flawed in
many important respects and leaves a great many unanswered questions.

those noble Lords who support the Bill to ask themselves the following
questions. Do they believe that the referendum question in the Bill, as
currently drafted, is genuinely fair? Is it not a leading question? Do
they not agree with the position taken by the Electoral Commission on
this issue? What is the justification for the somewhat arbitrary date
of 2017? Is there not a danger that setting this random date in law
will provoke economic uncertainty at a time when the fragile economies
of the UK and our EU partners are only just beginning to recover? What
is the justification for the inconsistencies of who will actually be
allowed to vote in this referendum? In Scotland later this year, 16 and
17 year-olds will be allowed to vote in the Scottish referendum on the
basis that it is very much their future at stake. Surely the same logic
should apply to a referendum on our membership of the European Union?
Also, should the electorate not be based on local election electoral
lists, as it will be in the Scottish
referendum?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000296">Finally,
and perhaps most importantly, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Grocott, that it is not acceptable for this Parliament to attempt to
mandate a future Parliament on an issue of this magnitude. At the very 
<?notus-xml column=1794?>least, should the enactment of the Bill not be subject to an affirmative
resolution of both Houses following the next general election? I look
forward very much to discussing these and other issues in more detail

issue has infected British politics for the past few decades. However,
I am also a political realist and, like the noble Lord, Lord Owen, I
recognise that it is pretty much the settled will of the British people
that, at some point, there will be a referendum on our future
relationships with Europe. The noble Lord, Lord Balfe, and I shall

with which the Conservative Party approaches the general election;
later on in the year, we will have a referendum in Scotland that will
irretrievably determine the future of the United Kingdom; and with this
Bill and the referendum in 2016 or 2017, we will be voting on something

between all that, we have an old-fashioned general election. As my
noble friend Lord Grocott, who takes a rather different view from me on
Europe, pointed out, no Parliament can bind its successor. It has been
argued on this Bill that the Lords should not attempt to dispute the
will of the House of Commons, but it is the will not of this House of
Commons but of the next one that will determine the nature of the
referendum. This Bill attempts to determine now the timing, the
question and the electorate—although, as the Electoral
Commission and Delegated Powers Committee have pointed out, it fails to
deal with the basis of conduct of that referendum. Whoever the next
Government are and whatever the balance of the next House of Commons,
we will need a new, comprehensive Bill if we are going to carry out any
referendum. In that sense, although we have a very good attendance in
the Chamber today for a Friday, we are all wasting our
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000306">However,
there are aspects of the Bill that I want to address, because, apart
from the valid objections from the Electoral Commission, any referendum
will follow only a treaty change or the outcome of a bilateral
negotiation. Given the turbulence in the eurozone, we do not know what
kind of treaty changes are likely  to be proposed, and we have
no idea, not even from 
<?notus-xml column=1796?>Mr Cameron, what the objectives of any bilateral negotiation will be and
therefore in what context the possibility of a unilateral withdrawal
will arise. The referendum and politics surrounding it will be utterly
dependent on the outcome of one or other of those
negotiations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000307">The
present formulation of the question in the Bill does not allow for any
reference to the outcome of negotiations or to any treaty. The outcome,
will, of course, determine how many people vote. Under certain
outcomes, I would find it difficult to vote for staying in. If the Tea
Party totally takes over the Conservative Party and it wins the next
general election and we opt out of many of the more beneficial aspects
of the European Union, I would hesitate. I would probably still vote to
stay in, but it would be a very different European Union. The outcome
of the negotiations is important, and the way that it is sold to the
electorate will determine the vote. That effectively makes the Bill
redundant, although improvements could be made to it in this House
regarding the conduct of the referendum, the electorate and the
question itself. If the powers that be insist on giving substantial
time—unprecedented time—to the Bill, the House will need
to insist on conducting its normal scrutiny of Private Members’

uncertainty and a reluctance to invest among global investors, as my

am strongly in favour of Britain’s membership of the European
Union. As the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said a little while ago, in
this year of all years we should surely be conscious of the need for an
effective, endurable network linking the member states of the European
Union east and west, and removing the risk of conflict—as,
indeed, the European Union provides. Is it perfect? Of course, it is
not perfect. My noble friend Lord Turnbull explained very elegantly the
defects that it has. However, the European Union entrenches democracy
and the principles of a market economy in much of our continent and, in
so doing, benefits this country, too. I will take just two
examples<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:07:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000310">Membership
of the European Union enhances the projection of our foreign policy.
What would be our influence on Iran, Syria or the Middle East if the
Foreign Secretary were not engaged fully in EU councils, where Britain
and France are by far the most influential countries in the European
Union on foreign policy matters? Membership benefits our economy, too.
Other noble Lords have made this point, but we should imagine the
impact on jobs in Sunderland if Renault-Nissan were to stop investing

our national interest surely lies in working with like-minded partners

prosperity of its members, as, in their rather different ways, Lady
Thatcher and Sir John Major did so effectively when they were Prime

them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>. I would

the mood of the country favours a referendum and that the Commons has

leaves me with two major concerns. The first is timing. The process and
the outcome of the renegotiation are uncertain—but so,

arrangements within the European Union, both looking to our
country’s best interests and to the Union’s. That is what
he is doing and I fully support him. Secondly, we 
<?notus-xml column=1798?>must remember that we are talking about the future and not the past,
whatever problems there have been and whatever mistakes have been made.
In addition, it is important that the public must be able to handle the
goods before they buy. We must know what the options are before any
decision in this direction is
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:12:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Let us
not forget that we had a referendum on EC membership and it did not
bring closure to the issue.</hs_para>

we do must be handled wisely and even-handedly. The problem we face is
that the Bill’s authority has been damaged by the criticisms
made by both the Constitution Committee and the Delegated Powers
Committee, as well as by a number of criticisms made in this debate.
Even if we as individuals think that the criticisms do not matter, many
electors are going to think that they do. Even if the authors of the
Bill do not think that the criticisms matter, millions of people who
will inevitably find after a referendum that the outcome for them is
unsatisfactory and not to their liking will use that fact to keep the
issue alive.</hs_para>

who have spoken. Everybody who has taken part in this debate favours
reforms but we have not had any statement about what those reforms are,
how we are intending to progress them and how we do these things. We
have often been told by people coming back from Brussels that they have
achieved reform. For example, we have had a vast expansion of qualified
majority voting, which in many ways I regard as a reform. Is that what
Members in the Conservative Party view as a reform? It involves losing
our veto, which they seem very much to want to keep.</hs_para>

Lord Kinnock and by me when I was in the European Parliament—to
get a system of zero-based budgeting? It is the only method by which we

want to reply to two people who have spoken in this debate. One is the
noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, who, having given of his wisdom, has now
departed, although I shall make sure on Monday that he reads the bit
that I am going to say about him. He implied that we have no right
whatever to challenge in any way any piece of legislation that comes
from the other place. In fact, that is saying that we might as well
pack our bags and go home. It is always our job to challenge views if
we believe that they are wrong, and nowhere does that responsibility
lie heavier than when we are challenging a major constitutional reform,
fully backed by the Government but wrapped up under the illusion and
pretence of it being private Members’ business. We have to
examine this Bill in Committee thoroughly and fully and, if necessary,
pass amendments to it, irrespective of the significance of any date,
such as  28 February.</hs_para>

their own Bill in the next Session of Parliament, when we will subject
it to full scrutiny, including the tabling of amendments. Of course,
ultimately the Government must get their way on a government Bill, but
that is not the same as saying that we will always bow our knee to
whatever Motion, in whatever form, comes from the other House. This is
a means of trying to cheat the people of this country and it is a
cheating process that we will not go along with. I hope that, having
properly given the Bill a Second Reading, on Report we will take every

Bill. I propose to underline 
<?notus-xml column=1800?>only two points, which have already, of course, been made in this
debate. There are only about three points to be made throughout the

the first point, the Prime Minister has made a clear commitment that if
he returns to office after the election next year he will enter into
negotiations for changes in this country’s relationship with the
European Union with a view to concluding them by 2017 and in time for
the outcome to be the basis for a referendum. He needs no legislative
reinforcement for that commitment, although of course he will be able,
if he wishes, to reiterate it in his party’s manifesto in due
course. If he is returned, he will be able to use his best endeavours
to fulfil his commitment whether or not the Bill is passed. He does not
need to have his feet held to the fire by a
law<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000330">If
he is not returned in the election, his successor will not be bound by
his commitment. It is the established convention that no Parliament can
bind its successor. If another Prime Minister after the 2015 election
decides that a referendum is not necessary or called for, he will be
entitled to invite the new Parliament to pass a new Bill—one of
those mythical one-clause Bills—and guillotine it, repealing
this legislation if it has been passed by this
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:21:56"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Prime Minister’s commitment is quite as binding as it need or

second point I should like to underline—it was made a few
moments ago by the noble Lord, Lord Jay of Ewelme—is that the
Bill is, in some respects, bad policy. Negotiations within the European
Union for major changes in the constitution of the Union can take a
very long time. This is particularly the case at a time when many other
member countries will also be looking for changes and wide-ranging
reform seems likely. It is impossible to predict either the form in
which or the date by which the Union will emerge from the process of
renegotiation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:23:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011038000332" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011038000332">It
is admirable for the Prime Minister to say that he intends to achieve
changes by 2017, but he cannot be sure of being able to do so in
complex negotiations which will involve 27 other member countries as
well as the United Kingdom. It is not likely to be conducive to
constructive negotiations and he is not likely to be assisted in his
negotiations if he goes into them with a time bomb in his briefcase

wants by a fixed date in

that outcome within two years—and I should wish him the best of
British luck in doing so—but the issues at stake for this

conclude by saying that this is a funny old Bill. I am not sure whether
it is a government Bill masquerading as a Private Member’s Bill,

accept the rule—it is not just a convention—that the will
of the House of Commons should in the end prevail, but that should not,
in this case, be allowed to override the duty of this House to exercise
its own responsibility to revise and improve the Bill if it sees fit to
do so. If the Government really feel very strongly that this Bill has
to be completed in this Session and cannot wait, as the noble Lord,

Browning (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord
Dobbs in championing this Bill in your Lordships’ House. In the
contributions today from noble Lords, who clearly hold diverse views
not only on this Bill but on the wider subject of our membership of the
European Union, the common theme has been the recognition that the
people of this country are in the mood for a referendum on the subject.
It is worth drilling down a bit to ask why that is. My own view is that
people now feel so much more strongly about the need for a referendum
because, as other noble Lords have already mentioned, of their lack of
confidence and trust in the body politic, for which many of
us—all of us perhaps—should take some
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000002">On
the specific subject of our membership of the EU, in the quiet corners
of the Conservative Party, when my name is mentioned in conjunction
with the subject of the EU, I might perhaps be described as one of the
“usual suspects”. I agree that that would probably be the
correct terminology, but I have noticed today that the language we use
when discussing Europe and people’s different views on it is not
the language that one would expect to find in a debate on education,
health or any other big political issue. It is very personal, very
subjective and, sometimes, very unpleasant. I am one of those in the
Chamber—looking around, I see other noble Lords who have had
this experience—who have been subject to name-calling over the
years because we have taken a certain view. For example, we have warned
against our membership of the single currency and of the dangers of a
central European bank, and argued that we should not readily give up
our gold to buy up euros in order to prop up that currency. When these
things have been discussed, they have not been discussed in a very
mature way across the parties in either House.</hs_para>

has influenced the way in which the public no longer have any
confidence in what any of us say about promises to do with Europe.
Prime Ministers of both parties have successively prayed in aid their
negotiations in various treaties when they have gone to the electorate
in a general election. We have come up with all sorts of politics-speak
about subsidiarity and things like that, which we hoped would comfort
the general public and suggest that, somehow, we were still in charge
as politicians. However, the nub of this, and the reason why this
referendum and this very specific promise of a referendum are so
important in this Bill, is that the general public out there believe
that the power that they thought they had through the ballot
box—not the power we as politicians have—has gradually
been eroded. We have conspired across the parties to use language to
defuse and to try to subjugate the real discussion that was needed so
that people could have a very clear understanding of what was being
done, in successive treaties, in their name. Gradually you erode from
people the opportunity to hold their elected representatives in another
place to account. Increasingly, when those elected representatives then
quite rightly hold the Ministers of the day to account, those Ministers
have to defuse matters and cannot answer straight questions.</hs_para>

before us in the debate today is the question of our borders. It does
not matter what a Minister says about our borders. No Minister here or
in another place can do anything to control immigration across our
borders as far as EU citizens are concerned, and yet anybody who has
raised that issue in the past few years has been name-called in a way
to stop that debate. In the end, the general public see through that
and realise that they are the loser here. The general public cannot get
answers from their democratically elected representatives, who in turn
cannot get answers from Ministers. That is the end of democracy as we
know it and have understood it for many years. That is why we need a
renegotiation to bring some balance back into what was an agreement
that we voted on in 1975. I put my hand up to being one of those who
voted for us to go into a Common Market, as I understood it, but over
the years the EU has changed. That is why the renegotiation is needed

I love Europe. The problem is that the way Europe is governed, and is

which is absolutely clear after the events of last year. It is quite
clear that if you have a monetary union, you have to have a fiscal
union as well. If you transfer your tax policy, your expenditure policy
and your monetary policy to another institution, you have at the very
least created a circumstance of constitutional change for which a
referendum is highly appropriate. That is in the context of something
being irrevocable, not changeable, written into the treaty

anyone else noticed—because the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, was
saying that it is a bad thing because we were binding another
Parliament, and the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, said that it was a bad

one remaining question: does this apply to Britain? Is Britain, because
of its opt-out, perhaps the only country which does not need a

referendums and we do not. The answer to that, in my view, concerns
something I asked a Question about yesterday: the acquis communautaire.
That is endemic to the treaty of Rome. It states clearly throughout the
treaty that any change in the treaty must be in one direction, towards
European statehood. That is absolutely clear. It is written in there

before we have a referendum. A dynamo already exists in the system, and
if I was keen on preserving a move towards a federal state of Europe I
would just leave things alone as it is all there already. It is a very
strong argument, they usually say, for us to wait for some great event
to happen before we have the referendum. They are absolutely wrong
about that—but right in their own terms because a federal state
of Europe is what they want. If you do not want that then at some point
the British people will have to be consulted. That time should, in my
view, be here as quick as possible, but the Bill is certainly a step in

Goudie (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in the 1975 referendum
campaign, I voted and campaigned for yes. I am strongly in favour of
the European Union but I am not in favour of the Bill that has been
brought to the House today. It has been brought as a Private
Member’s Bill instead of the Government and the Prime Minister
having the courage to take it to the Cabinet and get the Cabinet on
side. In spite of that, I will ensure that the Bill is dealt with in
this House. I will participate in the Committee so that it might be so
and be scrutinised. I really am upset, in a way, that the Bill has been
brought here. Also, having looked at the Bill, there is no
real substance on how we tell the British people what the European
Union is about and what we would be going into a referendum about. It
is 
<?notus-xml column=1805?>wrong for a future Government to have their hands tied. For all those
reasons, I would vote against the Bill at the end of its Committee in
this House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000017">I
agree very much that the European Union needs reform. It has changed
dramatically, in some ways for the good and in some for the bad, since
1975. But the way for us to do that is by giving leadership from the
centre of Europe, not from being on the outside or threatening that we
will leave. We must be there and we have to be part of that. I will not
go into what the right honourable William Hague said in the other
place, because I do not want to take up too much valuable time in this
Second Reading, but I agree with what he said. If we continue to go
down this road, as the Bill would have us do, we will put at risk
everything that Britain has in this difficult economic time. We will
put at risk jobs, growth and investment. We all know how investors are
global and if there is any chance that something is jittery about
Britain plc, they will move out and other companies will not think to
reinvest. All this makes us very vulnerable.</hs_para>

have to remember that part of the reason that the European Union came
together all those years ago, before we were rejected and then allowed,
was because it was about peace and security. It was all about Britain
and Europe’s role in the world. If we were not part of Europe,
the American Government would not look at us a second time and we would
have no traction in the ASEAN countries, as they are today. The
Commonwealth would steer away from us. Where would our trading be?
Where would we be going with our e-learning or our legal learning?
Where would we be in the Middle East? Would they wish to continue to
invest with us? No, we have to be part of the European Union for us to
survive and it is for all those reasons that I feel really strongly
about this referendum

of the reasons why what is proposed in the Bill is in many ways a
dangerous course is that it weakens the diplomatic power and
effectiveness of this country in its negotiating position in Brussels.
We should not make the mistake of believing that there is an indefinite
tolerance among other member states of the British position on this.
The results of a poll published last week stated that only 16% of
Germans and 26% of French believed that they would favour a special
deal for the United Kingdom. Whenever these negotiations take place,
they are not going to be a pushover; they will be really difficult, and
we will have to persuade our colleagues in Europe that it is clearly in
their interests to participate in them and to progress with further
reform.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011043000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000024">In
that, incidentally, the position of Germany is particularly important.
The Germans have gone a long way, as they did over the rebate, to give
support to British positions, but if you say to the German Government,
“Well, here it is, we’d like your full support and if you
do not give it to us we’re going to press the button and we may
be out”, what is the end result of that attitudinal
position?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011043000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000025">If
there is a threat, certainly implicit, to our diplomatic effectiveness
as a result of committing ourselves to an “in and out”
referendum in this Parliament to bind the next, what is the likely
effect on our economic and industrial strength? Many of the figures
have already been rehearsed in this debate, but one struck me the other
day that I had not picked up on before: one-half of all non-EU
companies operating now in Europe are headquartered in the UK. That is
a far greater proportion in total than those headquartered in either
Germany or France. Do we really believe that those companies would
continue to be headquartered here were we to exit from the EU? I very
much doubt it. Goldman Sachs, Hyundai, Toyota, Siemens and so
on—the list is endless and I assure the House that it will get
longer and more strident as this debate continues.</hs_para>

that were the referendum to result in an out vote, it would not be the
end of anything; rather, it would be the beginning of an
extraordinarily difficult, painful and protracted process. That is why
I am glad that my own party, in its own commitment on a referendum, has
been very specific, not generic. We are committed to an “in or

transfer of power from the UK to the EU. That is a specific
commitment.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011043000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000027">I
was glad that the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, said in his fine speech at

statutory power to have such a referendum already exists, so the Bill
is unnecessary.</hs_para>

proposer of the Bill has made a very odd argument. If I have understood
it right, and he also said it on Radio 4 this morning, the reason for
this referendum now is that no one in the UK under the age of 60 has
had a chance to vote on EU membership. If you think about other vital
elements of our 
<?notus-xml column=1807?>constitutional and societal arrangements in this country, in many cases
no one alive today has ever voted on them either. Have we voted on the
Hanoverian succession? Have we voted on the monarchy? Do we need to do
both in order to legitimise the present position? I do not seriously
think that anyone would propose that in this House.</hs_para>

years—indeed, since the Maastricht treaty ground its way through
another place when my noble friend Lord Spicer and I were in opposite
corners—advocated an “in or out” referendum to

of whom I have individual affection and regard, a little queer. If your
Lordships’ House found itself the butt of criticism, the Liberal
Democrats would quite welcome it, because it would advance their case
for abolishing this House and replacing it with an elected second
Chamber. Therefore, do not let us be deceived by those who sit by our
side and let us not be seduced by those who sit opposite. Let us say
that this Bill is imperfect and has got here by a most peculiar route,

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Dobbs, made an excellent speech in introducing this Bill, as he
invariably does. He is a very respected and popular Member of this
House and I quite understand why the Prime Minister asked him to be his
standard bearer in bringing this difficult piece of legislation before
us. I hope, therefore, that he will not think it in any way a personal
attack on him if I say that the Bill he has brought before us is a very
bad Bill. It is not a good Bill at all. It is a very dubious Bill that,
in at least three respects, purports to be something that it is not.
There is an English word for that but it is not a parliamentary word so
I will not use it. It is, at the very least, a cynical Bill, which we
should treat with considerable
scepticism<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:56:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Bill purporting to be something that it is not has not escaped the
attention of many colleagues in the House on both sides. We 
<?notus-xml column=1809?>have already discussed it at length today. It is the fact that it is a
Private Member’s Bill that is really a Prime Minister’s
Bill. Prime Minister’s Bills that are whipped through the House
of Commons and will be whipped through the House of Lords—and
are said by the Prime Minister of the day, to his supporters, to be
essential for the credibility of the Government, as has been said in
this case—are not Private Members’ Bills. If the
Government have chosen to bring the Bill forward in this camouflage,
two things
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:57:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000040">First,
they must accept the rules of the game—the rules that apply to
Private Members’ Bills. They have chosen that route; it is their
fault. Under no circumstances should we allow ourselves to be
blackmailed by being told that there are difficulties with Private
Members’ Bills but the Government need to get this one through
by 28 February, otherwise there will be difficulties. It was the
Government’s decision to bring forward this Bill as a Private
Member’s Bill and they must take the consequences. Under no
circumstances should we be blackmailed along those lines. Indeed, if I
am still speaking at 3 pm, which I probably will be, I hope someone
will interrupt me. If they do not interrupt me at 3 pm, I hope that
will be established as a precedent for future Private Members’
Bills going through this House, which should equally be allowed
additional time if there is particular interest in speaking on them on
the part of the House as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T14:58:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000041">The
second thing that follows from the Government’s voluntary
decision to bring this forward as a Private Member’s Bill is
that, clearly, we should not treat it with the respect and regard with
which, normally and naturally, the second, unelected House treats
government initiatives. Normally, we operate on the basis that we can
hold up legislation—we can put forward proposals for amendment
to the House of Commons—but, at the end of the day, the
Government of the day tend to get their business through. This is not,
by the Government’s own choice, a government Bill. We therefore
do not need to regard it with quite the same respect and consideration
that we would give a government Bill. We should, of course, be
sceptical and we should do our duty. If we come to the conclusion that
the Bill needs to be amended, we should be even more confident of our
duty to amend it than we would be if it were a government

second aspect of the lack of straightforwardness to which I
referred—of the Bill being presented as something that it is
not—is again a matter that has, unsurprisingly, received quite a
lot of attention in this debate. This is a Bill that purports to be a
democratic, altruistic initiative designed to give the public their
say. That is a phrase that we have heard several times. In fact, it is
nothing of the kind. Only 18 months ago, both the Prime Minister and
the Foreign Secretary, William Hague, were bringing forward arguments
for not having a referendum in this Parliament. They were powerful
arguments, which have already been referred to—some of them have
been quoted today. I had it in mind to bring in a whole sheaf of
quotations, but I thought I would not burden the House with them
because it is very familiar with the words concerned. Only 18 months
ago the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and other members of the
Tory party in the 
<?notus-xml column=1810?>Cabinet said that we should not have a referendum in this Parliament,
giving all those reasons—uncertainty of the economy, and so on
and so forth—why we should not do that. They were absolutely
right about that.</hs_para>

did they suddenly switch? We all know why—there has been a
purely party politically orientated initiative to try to buy off the
Eurosceptics in the Tory party and keep them quiet until after the
election and to prevent Conservative voters slipping over to
UKIP because UKIP is offering a referendum, so the
Government thought that they had to offer one too. Of course, no sane
or sensible person would ever go to the public and ask them to decide
on something and say, “It’s important that the public
have their say—but you can’t do it for the next four
years”. Nobody knows what will happen in the intervening four
years; in fact, there is quite a large probability that there will be a
new treaty under negotiation—not concluded—by 2017. It
cannot possibly be concluded in practice before the French and German
elections in that year, which have already been referred to. How absurd
it would be if we had a legal obligation to hold a referendum before
the end of 2017, but there was another treaty in gestation and we were
part of that negotiation, so we would have to have another referendum
on that in 2018 or 2019. That would be absolutely absurd.</hs_para>

a practical point of view the whole idea is ridiculous and any sensible
person would have been able to see that it was ridiculous. Indeed, I
have no doubt that the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary know
that it is ridiculous, and that that is what they would have said a
year and a half ago in public. However, they have decided on this
slightly squalid party political ploy, which is why we have the Bill

is a third aspect to this lack of frankness about the
Government’s legislative proposal this afternoon, which has not
been referred to at all. That is, although the Government purport to
wish to give the public a free choice, to consult the British public
about our future in the European Union, there is one obvious
choice—not just a coherent or a theoretically possible choice,
and not even a practically possible one. It is an obvious choice that
has been the default choice, the consensus choice and the automatic
choice of 17 out of the 28 members of the European Union. That choice
is to be a full member of all aspects of the Union: to be a member of
the core, if you like, of the Union—which, of course, means

that that is an appalling prospect, and they are entitled to feel that.
However, they cannot deny that that is a possible choice. They also
cannot deny that that is a choice that many of our partners in the
Union—the majority of them—have taken. They cannot fairly
deny that there are good theoretical arguments for all those proposals.
It might very well be argued that now would be a very good time to join
the euro, before interest rates and the parity go up, but we are not
having that discussion today. However, that choice is being denied to
the British people. Other

both parties in this rather squalid transaction between the extremist
Eurosceptics in the Tory party and the Prime Minister have been at one,
I am sure, in wishing to exclude any possibility of going down that
road, which they would call the federalist road. So democracy has not
reached that far, and democracy will not include giving the opportunity
for that particular choice to be expressed in the referendum. There may
be practical reasons: people would say, “Well, you can’t
have more than two questions in a referendum”—but that is
nonsense. If there was an aggregate majority of those who were in
favour of our joining the core of the European Union on the one side
and those who were in favour of joining the Union with the various
derogations negotiated by the Prime Minister on the other, and if those
two votes together came to a majority of the vote, clearly you could
not argue that there was a majority in favour of our leaving the
European Union. So in practical terms this is a very real

regret to say that, despite advice to the contrary from many
distinguished colleagues on this side of the House, I remain
unconvinced that we should accept a Bill of this importance without
proper consideration. Opposition to giving the electorate a referendum

in its current form may well be detrimental to all our
interests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000054">I
share with other noble Lords at
least<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T15:07:51"></hs_TimeCode> two
concerns about the Bill. The first is about the question, which has
been referred to many times. It is clear from the report of the
Electoral Commission that it has concerns about the neutrality and
clarity of the question. My noble friend questioned the consultation,
but with respect he cannot question the unambiguous recommendation, and
no doubt this will be pursued in
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T15:08:21"></hs_TimeCode>. If
there is indeed a referendum and a future Conservative Government are
campaigning in favour of the United Kingdom’s continuing
membership, they may well find themselves at a disadvantage if the
question leans against a yes vote, since I fear that it is almost
certain that the Conservative Party will not be united behind a
recommendation to stay in on any terms which retain the essential
principles of the European Union. I do not seek a question which leans
the other way, merely one which is neutral and
fair<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T15:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000055">My
second concern relates to the date. This could put a negotiating Prime
Minister at a huge disadvantage if critical negotiations were not
complete by the time when the date for the referendum arrived. The
timescale is in my view unrealistic. If we are seeking significant
changes, which may well involve treaty change, the fast-track procedure
in the Lisbon treaty will not be available, and the normal procedures
under Article 48 take time. I have asked in previous debates how it is
anticipated that this will be resolved in two years, between 2015 and
2017, but I have not received an answer. I hope that the Minister or my
noble friend Lord Dobbs may address that when

those reasons and others, I do not believe that we should abandon our
usual scrutinising role. I know—I am not comfortable about
it—that many of my noble friends will consider this an act of
considerable disloyalty to the party but, more importantly, detrimental

perhaps we might examine the history of this issue without calling into
question anyone’s motives. Originally the Prime Minister
resisted calls for a referendum but after a large vote, against a
three-line Whip, it was promised for the next Conservative manifesto.
Those who, like me, question the wisdom of referenda generally accepted
the position, as I do today, although I would campaign for a yes vote
and for the UK to stay in the European Union. A Bill to provide for the
referendum was then demanded and when it was not included in the
gracious Speech, government Members in large numbers, unusually, voted
against their own gracious Speech. A Bill was then produced, to be
taken up by any Member successful in the Private Members’
ballot.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011043000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000058">The
question in that draft Bill was very close indeed to the suggestion and
recommendation of the Electoral Commission, unlike that which is in the

accusations that concerns about the Bill, if it is pursued, amount to
an attempt to deny the people a vote. The pressures of time were not of
our making but of those who precipitated a Bill despite the original

that I find that unacceptable, and therefore my unwillingness to accept
the Bill as it stands, and that, upon reflection, my noble friend Lord

saying to Angela Merkel and Mr Hollande, “I have got
only 18 months to come back with the goods, you must help me”,
is that really the best sort of diplomacy? Other colleagues have put it
in terms of an unrealistic, artificial timetable but I would like to
put it in terms of the personal relationships between the party
leaders.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011043000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000062">I

I was listening to the noble Lord, Lord Jay of Ewelme. It is now
exactly 100 years since the misunderstandings—let us put it that

on the origins of the First World War which have been published in the
past three or four months show that the total absence of a context of
regular meetings between Russia, Serbia, Austro-Hungary, France,
Germany and Britain had a considerable impact on the causes of this
catastrophic event 100 years ago in Europe, with 50 million, or
whatever, killed as a consequence. Even leading up to the declaration

think, did all the other Prime Ministers from Edward Heath

Conservatives had a problem in that they did not have any money,
because you could not get any money for a vote of that sort. So what
did they do? They turned to the treasurer of the Conservative Group for
Europe, who with his secretary found himself in difficulty. I suggested
that we should hold a great event. We managed to get the Banqueting
House—Geoffrey Rippon was very kind and helpful—to hold a
big event for the first time so that those in industry and the

outstanding feature of this debate so far has been the total failure of
the Bill’s supporters to address, let alone answer, any of the
flaws in the Bill repeatedly identified by speakers around the House.
The Bill will need serious amendment if it is to serve any purpose
beyond that of attempting to quell unrest within the ranks of the
Conservative Party. To appropriate a matter of such high constitutional
importance for so narrow a purpose is, in my view, not worthy of the
senior partner in a coalition

on these Benches will apply to this Bill what we apply to any other
Bill before us, which is a thorough scrutiny of it clause by clause
throughout its legislative passage through this House. We will table
sensible and responsibly framed amendments which we judge would
materially improve the Bill, and seek their acceptance. That is our
constitutional duty. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, appears to
disagree. I found his intervention on this point incredible, coming
from someone with such a long career in
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000077">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T15:26:04"></hs_TimeCode>
is absolutely no reason or justification for granting the Bill special
treatment, which is what its promoters seek in their efforts to ensure
that not a single word or number in the text is amended. What is so
sacred about this text that it has its promoters so paralysed by fear
of any attempt to tamper with it? From the degree of panic visibly
permeating their ranks in the face of this perceived vandalism, one
might think that we were daring to rewrite the opening bars of the
Fifth Symphony or draw a moustache on the face of the Mona Lisa. No, we
are not vandals, and they know that. The cause of their fear is of
their own creation. Mismanagement of the timing of the Bill has
resulted in a time-bind that could lead to the loss of it. If that is
the outcome, they will have only themselves to blame, and the prospect
of that can neither excuse this House from its duty to scrutinise
properly nor deprive it of its right to propose amendments to improve
the Bill. The Bill cannot possibly be allowed to go on to the statute
book in its present form. There are serious questions surrounding: the
timing of a referendum; the almost unfettered powers granted to the
Secretary of State to appoint the day on which the Act would come into
force; the wording of the question to be put to the people; the need to
spell out a turnout threshold and a voting age; and the Bill’s
inappropriately restrictive policy on voter eligibility—and

of the amendments will be tabled, and supported, by Members drawn from

troublemakers bent on 
<?notus-xml column=1817?>obstructing the Bill’s passage to the statute book. However, I
ask them to consider carefully this: are they going to toss aside the
conclusions and recommendations of such important Lords committees as
the Constitution Committee and the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee on such crucial questions as the exercise of the
powers conferred by the Bill on the Secretary of State? Are they going
to reject the Electoral Commission’s recommended wording of the
referendum question? I cannot believe that they would follow such a
risky course but, if they do so, it will confirm in my mind, at least,

his judgment, increase his electoral chances. You would be mad if you
thought that the SPD in the German coalition which will be in office
for the first half of 2017 would be likely to agree to the changes to,
say, the human rights or social elements of the treaty, or to the free
movement of persons, all of which government spokesmen have told us in
the past four weeks are to be elements in our renegotiation strategy.
The noble Lord, Lord Owen, also made the important point that it would
be quite a good idea, if renegotiation were intended, to start now
defining what we want rather than going with whatever the <I>Daily Mail

renegotiation.</hs_para>

that the reforms we need are changes to the treaty, we have to go
through four stages. First, we have to secure a simple majority. That
means that we need to find 14 member state Governments who agree with
us. We have not started that task and it looks as though we are not
going to start it until after the election. Secondly, we have to get a
consensus in the necessary convention. The last convention took
18 months. The third stage is that we have to get unanimity

need to get ratified whatever changes we secure. We need to buy their

functions in human rights and the rule of law ought to remain as they
are and thus should not be tampered with by a reformed European Union?

the Court of Human Rights, and in political democracy, owing to that

revision of the rules and practices of the European Union, something
which has not really divided us today either, and we look forward to
having elaborate discussions on the matter later on. We are instead
concerned with the very

streams, rockeries and rose beds, but also animals, including monsters.
The referendum is the monster which we have now discovered, to our
surprise, is in our garden. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Oakeshott, on the subject of referenda. He seemed to place the position
of the monster of a referendum very clearly. I largely agree with what

curiously foreign concept to all political philosophers whom we know

Churchill and Disraeli. None of them has anything to say about

we look up the subject in encyclopaedias, to rely on the Swiss or,
perhaps, if we are lucky, Napoleon III. Noble Lords may say that the
names I have mentioned are from very long ago but, nevertheless, most
of us would think that the definition of the relationship between a
Member of Parliament and his constituents was put better by Edmund
Burke than by anyone else. Mr Callaghan—Lord Callaghan as he was

Oakeshott, would not agree. The risks of a referendum in normal

central Europe, centralised countries, decentralised countries, small

of this country. However, to look at the interests of this country in a
calm, rational way, one has to have regard to the timing of political
events. The Bill looks at the timing of political events in this
country. We are not alone in having political events; political events
are occurring all the time. I cannot find it in my heart to accept any
argument that we here ought to agree that other people will fall into
line with our timing, our needs and our wishes just to suit a Bill
which has not even got the title of a government

the past—certainly during my membership of the Liberal

about internationalism first and our own nation second. As a party, we
have grown up. We have gone through that adolescent stage. We are now a
party of government, but a party that puts things in proportion. I
regret that our coalition partners seem to have gone in the opposite
direction in terms of obsession which, together with our popular press,
gives a very tempting and addictive formula that means that the issue

are those other concerns? The economy and jobs, welfare payments,

in Parliament reflecting public views, I might ask: what about all
those constituencies who want important decisions, whether different
decisions or to endorse decisions on those areas? I see no request for

clarify the Liberal Democrat position again. My noble friend Lord
Watson of Richmond did that absolutely adequately but there seem to be
some questions about it. Before I do that, let me move on to two other
things. A number of proponents of the Bill have said that we should not
in any way contest the sovereignty of the House of Commons. Clearly,
that is a good principle. However, I remind a number of those
proponents that there was a Second Reading vote in the last Session of
Parliament which had a parliamentary majority of 338. That was for the
House of Lords Reform Bill. Why did that not come into this House? It
was because a cabal of Back-Benchers within the Conservative Party had
a discussion with the Prime Minister and that Bill went no further
whatever. So I question the sanctity of majorities in the other House.
I believe they are important, but in that case it certainly did not
happen.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011043000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000121">In
terms of amendments to the Bill, I, too, agree that until this House is
abolished or changed—I would certainly welcome a
change—it needs to carry out its responsibilities. We are always
reminded of the Dangerous

some Members of the other place would see it more as the dangerous
frogs Act in this case, given the difficulties that we have with some

that now in legislation, having worked with our coalition colleagues to
deliver it through this House. We were successful as a coalition in
passing that legislation. We as a party have always said that it needs

also agree that Europe requires change and reform, whether on budget
expenditure, the ridiculous situation of having two parliamentary
seats, the common agricultural policy or employment issues.
There is also the obtaining of all those worldwide free trade
agreements, such as the one with North America. That started with
Canada and we wish now to conclude it with the United States. All those
are important but we need to negotiate with our 27 other partners. We
saw under the fiscal pact back in December 2011 what happens when you
tell your partners that you will do something different—they
will go off and get on with it themselves, except maybe for the Czech
Republic on that occasion. We were then isolated and that is not the
way to approach these matters. I suggest that there is also a golden
rule in negotiation: that you do not insult the citizens of the nations
that you are trying to negotiate with, because internal conversations
and debates within the United Kingdom are looked upon carefully in
other member states.</hs_para>

moment is that, yes, we will at some point have to have a referendum
about the EU. That is a Liberal Democrat policy and I believe in it
strongly. We need to lance that boil. We also need a negotiation which
is led through real leadership to show that we are a European nation
that can meet the expectations of our partners, let alone our own. So
we should show real leadership, obtain a real negotiation and a real
improvement for all of Europe. Rather than having a referendum now, we
can achieve one then. I am sure that it will be positive, but I am also
willing to take the risk that it might be
negative.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_10_PT_1/C2D80350192DE2ABD61B752D0B732E9252C9F4AC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 January 2014">Friday,

Lawson of Blaby (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that the whole
House will be delighted that we are close to the end of what has been a
very long debate. It has been a good one, with a number of very
interesting contributions. A number of noble Lords have referred to the
problem of those British subjects who live on the continent of Europe.
As someone who lives in France, I strongly support the principle of
this Bill so ably introduced by my noble friend Lord Dobbs.</hs_para>

the other contributions—unfortunately, there is not time to
mention many—I shall refer to two. To show my complete and
customary impartiality, there 
<?notus-xml column=1826?>will be one from each side of the House. I single out those noble Lords
because they made good points that, remarkably, have not been made by

them.</hs_para>

made by the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, who alone referred to the
importance of banking, finance and the City of London to the British
economy, and the relevance of the regulatory proposals that are coming
out of Brussels that will affect us. However, he then said that if
there is something we do not like there, we can veto it. I have to tell
the noble Lord and indeed the House that we simply cannot do so. This
is a very serious point because in my opinion the destiny of this
country is not European; it is global. In the City of London, we have
one of the only two global financial centres, and it is the only one in
the European time zone, which is tremendously important. I have to tell
noble Lords, and to some it might come as a shock, that even if we were
to leave the European Union we would still be within the European time
zone. Our global reach is particularly important—this point has
frequently been made by my noble friend Lord Howell—given the
great opportunities that will continue to arise in the coming decades

other point was made by my old friend— I do not see him here but
I am sure he is—my noble friend Lord Garel-Jones. Oh, he is
here. He likes to come close to me, I know. He made the important point
that there needs to be a debate about how we as a nation are going to
conduct ourselves should there be a referendum and should we choose
out. That needs to be considered. His mistake was to say that we will
be in the position of Norway. No way Norway! I have a high regard for
Norway and the Norwegians. I got to know them very well when I was
Secretary of State for Energy and we had a lot of discussions about
North Sea oil, which we shared. They were very amicable discussions and
I was immensely impressed by the calibre of the Norwegians. But Norway

projections suggest that within a few years’ time, because of
the declining population of Germany and the increasing population of
the UK, this country will be the largest in Europe in population terms.
Even now, the Americans are interested in a free trade agreement with
the EU, and I hope that this happens. Even today, before we are as big
as we are likely to become, exports from the rest of the EU to the UK
are even greater than exports from the rest of the EU to the United
States. We are an even more important market than it is, so to compare
us with Norway is ludicrous.</hs_para>

has been raised is that we should not have a referendum. The noble
Lord, Lord Thomas, was very much against referenda. In most cases, that
is a perfectly valid argument, but not in this case. I recall my maiden
speech in your Lordships’ House some 20 years ago. The subject
on which I made it was an amendment proposed by Lord Blake calling for
a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Lord Blake was a distinguished
political historian and a very eminent constitutional authority. He was
an old friend of mine. When I was an undergraduate at Oxford his were
among the very few lectures I bothered to go to. He set out with
constitutional propriety why this was the kind of issue on which it was

Lords ask why now, as there has been no specific change. There has been
a huge change, a sea change, in the nature of the European Union since
the 1975 referendum. It is not just the passage of time. I agree with
noble Lords who think that that alone is not a reason for having a
referendum, but the people of this country want a referendum and they
are right because of the huge change that has come about following the
creation of the European monetary union and the political consequences
of that decision. This is fundamental. People say there is now no
specific event which would trigger a referendum. The fact is that a
major and fundamental change, even if it is incremental, is still major
and fundamental. There does not need to be some specific event to
warrant a referendum on the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011043000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110-0002.htm#14011043000135">Some 25
years ago, when I was Chancellor, I warned in a speech at Chatham House
how fundamental it would be were the countries of Europe, who were
thinking about it, to move to a monetary union and what the enormous
political consequences would be. That has happened, and it has been
disastrous, but there it is. However, there are consequences not just
for those countries which are members of the eurozone. It has changed
fundamentally the nature of the relationship between this country,
which rightly decided not to join the common currency, and those
countries that are part of the eurozone. That is a fundamental change.
This divergence is going to increase. There is no way that we can stop
that unless we are prepared to embrace the common currency, which I do
not think any of us, or very few of us, with the exception of the noble
Lord, Lord Davies, wishes to do.</hs_para>

the cost of lending are still serious issues. The costs of maintaining

have had today has been on the question that would be put on the paper,
on the constitutional position and the binding of a future Parliament.
Some of the debate has focused on trading quotes of what different
Members from different parties have said at different times. There has
been some questioning of motivation, but I can say that the number of
speakers, the interest both inside and outside Parliament, the passion
and deeply held views all show that this is an important political
issue of our time. Some, like my noble friend Lord Oakeshott of
Seagrove Bay, said that there was no need for a Bill because it could
be dealt with in manifestos at the next general election. Well, I can
say on behalf of the Conservative Party that, in our manifesto, there
will be a commitment to have a
referendum<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-10T16:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

neither from the Labour Party nor from our friends in the Liberal

The points that have been made about the franchise and extending it are
of course arguable, and I have some sympathy with some of those
representations, but all these matters are a balance—we always
have to draw a line somewhere on them. The arrangements in the Bill are
not unfair. What would be unfair would be to hide behind this issue to
deny everyone a

with the wording of the question, mentioned by so many noble Lords,

my noble friend Lord Bowness, and very eloquently by the noble Lord,
Lord Kerr. The Electoral Commission has not declared that the proposed
question is unfair. It says that it is simple and easy to understand.
It has concerns that a few might be confused and might not be aware
that we are members of the European Union. That is a matter of
judgment. Whether that confusion would remain after the lengthy and
fiercely fought referendum campaign I happen to doubt. Tellingly, the
Electoral Commission was unable to come with a single alternative but

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> A more diverse judiciary is important
in retaining the public’s confidence and trust in justice, and
better reflecting the society it serves. This Government has made a
number of changes through the Crime 84 Courts Act 2013 that we believe
will promote judicial diversity. We have introduced part time working
in the senior courts, including the Supreme Court, we have enabled the
equal merit provision for judicial appointments to allow protected
characteristics to be taken into account where two applicants are of
equal merit, and a statutory duty for the Lord Chancellor and Lord
Chief Justice to encourage judicial
diversity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011042000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140110w0001.htm#14011042000028">A
