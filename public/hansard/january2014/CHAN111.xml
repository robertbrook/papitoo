make a small change, but one that will  be very important for
those affected, to the law on the process by which tenants can take
advantage of the right to participate in collective enfranchisement and
extend the leases of their flats. I am conscious that the Bill was not
debated in the Chamber on Second Reading and that this morning provides
the only opportunity to explain its purpose and the reasoning behind
it. For the benefit of the House, I will set out the current position
and the change the Bill seeks to make.</hs_Para>

I fear, a rather complex and technical measure, but I will endeavour to
explain it as simply as possible. We are fortunate that the issue in
question has been the subject of litigation, although I am sure that
the participants in the litigation did not think that it was at all
fortunate that they were so involved. It does mean, however, that we
can use a real-life case to illustrate the problem that the Bill seeks
to solve.</hs_Para>

who presented the Bill as I was not able to attend the House on the

the Bill’s title. I must apologise to the many people outside

had rather more ambitious aims for this Bill, and I regret that they
might be somewhat disappointed by its lack of
content.</hs_Para>

rather than putting the load of necessary leasehold reform and so on on
to this Bill, which would not get through the House if it were
expanded, we ought to try to ensure that we in this House, the
Government and the property chamber bring together the problems, abuses
and difficulties that leaseholders face and see whether we can find
simple ways of making their lives easier and
better?</hs_Para>

interest in leasehold reform. He is right to draw the House’s
attention to the fact that this area of law is complex by any measure.
Many outside the House also feel that it would benefit from
simplification, whether by the Law Commission or by the Government of
the day pulling together the different pieces of legislation that
govern the leasehold tenure provisions. There is plenty of scope for
improvement, and I think he would agree with me on that.</hs_Para>

fear that those outside the House who have an interest in this area of
law had rather ambitious hopes for the Bill when they saw its title
appear on the Order Paper. However, as my hon. Friend will know, it is
not really appropriate for a private Member’s Bill to try to
deal with all the matters that he may have in mind and would like to
see resolved in future; it would run into all sorts of problems in the
House if it
did.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000066">Hon.
Members will appreciate that private Members’ Bills are fairly
narrow; they have to be, if they are to make progress. It is not usual
for them to make whole-scale changes to a particular area of law. I
should add at this point that unusually for a private Member’s
Bill that has reached this stage—Third Reading, the final stage
in its legislative process through the House—this is a genuine
private Member’s Bill. I say that not in any way to belittle
private Members’ Bills that contain legislative proposals
suggested by the Government of the day, because
invariably—indeed, as we have seen in every Session of this
Parliament—those Bills contain sensible measures, which are
welcomed by those affected. However, this legislation demonstrates that
it is entirely possible for a Bill to make progress through the House
even though it was not originally conceived within
Government.</hs_Para>

referred to the Bill as a genuine private Member’s Bill.
However, I must pay tribute to the work of the Association of Leasehold
Enfranchisement Practitioners, which brings together both solicitors
and valuers who act on behalf of landlords and tenants in respect of
collective enfranchisement and lease extension matters. It seeks to
promote best practice and has been campaigning for improvements to the
legislation dealing with leasehold tenure, which, as I said, is a
particularly complicated area of law. In particular, I wish to place on
the  record my thanks to Mr John Midgley, the property
enfranchisement partner at Seddons solicitors and a member of the
advisory committee of ALEP, for his sage advice and
assistance.</hs_Para>

traditionally two types of tenure of land in this country: freehold and
leasehold. An owner of the freehold interest in land may either retain
the right to occupy that land themselves or choose to allow someone
else to occupy the land for a fixed period. The terms and conditions
that govern the relationship between the freeholder and the holder of
the lesser interest in the land—the leaseholder—are set
out in a document that we all know as a lease.</hs_Para>

owners of long leases of dwelling houses were given the right to buy
the freehold interest in the land on which the dwelling house was built
by virtue of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. However, that Act applied
only to houses; people who lived in flats were excluded. Some 26 years
later, long leaseholders living in blocks of flats gained what was
called a collective right to buy the freehold of the blocks they lived
in under the terms of the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban
Development Act 1993. That Act also provided for a leaseholder to
acquire a new lease to extend the period of years for which they held
the
property.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000070">To
commence the process by which the right of collective enfranchisement
can begin it is necessary for a tenant to serve on their landlord a
notice pursuant to section 13 of the 1993 Act. A similar notice is
required under section 42 of the Act to trigger the statutory 
<?notus-xml column=560?>procedure to enable a leaseholder to acquire a new lease. Currently,
where a leaseholder wishes to give notice under either section 13 or
section 42 of the 1993 Act, section 99(5)(a) provides that any notice
served pursuant to either section 13 or section 42 must be—and
this is the crucial part of the Act that we are hoping to
remedy—</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14012435000071" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000071">“signed

I will explain, that statutory provision has been interpreted by the
courts to mean that the notice must be signed personally by the tenant.
Normally, solicitors can, and frequently do, sign legal documents for
and on behalf of their clients. It is also normally possible for any
person who chooses to do so to execute a power of attorney to appoint
someone else to act on their behalf and sign legal documents on behalf
of the donor of the power.</hs_Para>

my experience, this is one area of law where even a person holding a
valid power of attorney would be prohibited from signing the notice on
behalf of the donor. As the House can doubtless immediately imagine,
that could have potentially devastating consequences for the affected
person. Incidentally, the same problem would arise where someone was
appointed by the Court of Protection to manage the affairs of someone
else who, by reason of mental incapacity, was unable to manage their
own affairs. That would happen if an individual became mentally
incapable of managing their own affairs but had not previously entered
into an enduring power of attorney, or what is now called a lasting
power of attorney; the difference between the two terms is of little
relevance.</hs_Para>

proceed further, it may assist the House if I refer to St.
Ermin’s Property Company Ltd. <I>v.</I> Tingay, the leading case

2000, the tenant moved out of the flat into accommodation in which her
needs could be better attended to. In anticipation of her deteriorating
health, this elderly lady had done what we would think of as the right

counter-notice that made four points, one of which was that the notice
did not appear to be in the correct form. The landlord then commenced

the method of signature of notices under s 13 or s 42 on the one hand,

submit to the House that there are five simple reasons why it is right
that the Bill should be passed. First, the problem does not apply to
leaseholders seeking to exercise their rights under the Leasehold
Reform Act 1967. Someone living in a house does not have a problem; it
is only leaseholders of flats who are affected by the provision in the
1993 Act. Secondly, in respect of flats, the requirement for personal
execution does not apply to landlords, so why on earth should tenants
be disadvantaged in such a way when landlords are
not?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000091" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000091">Thirdly,
the Bill does not apply to other notices required to be served under
the 1993 Act. It is purely the initial trigger notices that have been
found to need a personal signature. Fourthly, the Bill will remove the
disadvantage faced by tenants who, perhaps because of mental incapacity
or physical disability, are unable to sign. Fifthly, the Bill removes
the problems faced by tenants who are temporarily absent from the
country, be that on business or on holiday. Bizarrely, if a
tenant dies having occupied a qualifying property for two years prior
to their death, it is possible for the executors or administrators of
their estate to serve a valid notice on the landlord, provided that
they do so within two years of the issue of a grant of representation,
so someone cannot sign a notice validly if they are alive,
but their executors can if they are
dead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000092">The
House will be aware that the Bill was amended in Committee. I place on
record my thanks to all those who agreed to serve on the Committee. The
Committee’s sitting will always live in my memory and was
particularly poignant because it was the very last time that I spoke to
Paul Goggins, the late Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East, who
graciously agreed to serve on the Committee. I remember that, as I left

amendments agreed to in Committee essentially made two changes to the
Bill. First, they provided that the Bill would not apply to Wales.
Since the 1993 Act was enacted, housing matters have been devolved to
the Welsh Assembly. Consequently, even if the Bill reaches the statute
book, the requirement for tenants to sign notices personally under
sections 13 and 42 of the 1993 Act will remain in Wales, unless the
Assembly chooses 
<?notus-xml column=563?>to pass a similar measure. The second small change
made in Committee provides for the Bill to come into force two months
after the date on which it receives Royal Assent, rather than the one
month stated when the Bill was first

to aid the understanding of Members and the wider public, explanatory

minor changes made in Committee and in order to bring the explanatory

Sawford</B> (Corby) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I congratulate the hon.
Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall) on championing the Bill through its
various stages. I  also congratulate the hon. Member for
Kettering (Mr Hollobone), my constituency neighbour, who is
the Member in charge of the Bill. Although there are many matters on
which we differ, instead of rehearsing our disagreements, as happens
all too often in this place, we are focused on those causes on which we
can agree, particularly our joint campaign to improve our local
hospital. I am pleased today to find common cause with him and with the
hon. Member for Bury North, who has spoken so strongly in support of
the Bill and has set out why the change is
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000099">As
the hon. Member for Bury North said, this is a simple but important
Bill that seeks to address a technical issue that can be frustrating
for leaseholders trying to exercise their rights to collective
enfranchisement or to a lease extension, without unduly affecting
landlords in the process. The Bill aims to remove the need for 
<?notus-xml column=564?>individual tenants to sign notices personally, and he has set out a wide
range of cases in which that has been a real difficulty for people, no
doubt including my constituents. Although I have not been approached on
this subject directly, I am sure from his examples that many people
across the country have been
affected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000100">The
Bill would give solicitors, or someone else duly authorised on a
tenant’s behalf, such as an attorney, the ability to sign the
notices. It is more than 20 years since the Leasehold Reform, Housing
and Urban Development Act 1993 was enacted, since when there has been
significant amending legislation: the important Commonhold and
Leasehold Reform Act 2002, which was passed by the previous Labour
Government. The 2002 Act gave important new rights to tenants, but over
the years it has become apparent that there are still anomalies in the
law that should be addressed. One of those anomalies, as the hon.
Gentleman said, relates to the signing of notices under sections 13 and
42 of the 1993 Act. Currently, the notices must be personally signed by
the individual tenant, which can cause problems, for example when a
tenant has a disability and has given power of attorney to a third
party, or when notices need to be signed by tenants based overseas. In
many other areas, it is possible for a solicitor or other authorised
representative to sign on an individual’s behalf, but as the law
currently stands, that is not possible for signing notices under
sections 13 or 42. The Government have been encouraged in this brief
debate to consider other areas of the law in which that is a problem,
but it must be right that, having so clearly identified the anomaly as
a problem in respect of leasehold, we take action.</hs_Para>

cannot sign personally, no claim for a lease extension can be made. In
the case of collective enfranchisement for the acquisition of a
freehold, that may be prejudicial to getting a sufficient number of
people involved. We therefore welcome the Bill making the necessary
changes, and we will support its passage through the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000102">I
very much support the view expressed by the hon. Gentleman that it is
right for Back Benchers not only to scrutinise and seek to improve
legislation initiated by the Executive, but to seek to introduce
legislation in this House in the interests of their constituents and
the country. I fully support him in hoping that not only this but other
private Members’ Bills, including my Bills, which are further

who has brought to it and to this House his extensive professional
experience in the law, acquired before he entered the House, and his

morning’s debate, Mr Speaker, you will have seen how short they
are. We have two pieces of 
<?notus-xml column=565?>paper—a green piece for the Bill and a white piece that explains
it. The Bill is short, effective and to the point, and it does what it
says on the tin. It exemplifies legislation that is
drafted by Back Benchers and brought to the attention of the Executive
of the day, draws on the advice and expertise that Government counsel
can provide to tweak it to make it perfect, and is then steered through
this House. I hope that its commendable example will be followed in
relation to other Bills brought before the

extremely interesting and informative remarks, my hon. Friend the
Member for Bury North quoted at length from the legal judgment that
made the case that legislation had to be defined as either personal or
via an agent. This Bill has been introduced to the House via an
agent—namely me, in the good name of my hon. Friend—and
it will have the effect of changing the legislation for those who seek
to enter into property matters. That has a nice symmetry that is
entirely the responsibility of my good friend, my hon. Friend the

Peter Bottomley</B> (Worthing West) (Con):</Member> Some will know of
the controversy there can be over Speakers. No one can be sure whether
George Thomas was an avuncular member of the establishment or a
firebrand maverick, but what is certain is that his name is associated
with the leasehold reform of 1967. The conclusion of leases on houses
in Wales had led to a terrible injustice, and he fought and gathered
the forces to make reforms.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall) said, flats
tend to be held under leases. It is fairly clear from the census that
there are 5 million leaseholds. With, let us say, one and a half people
per flat, that amounts to 7.5 million leaseholders. Half the properties
in London are held under leasehold, and a growing proportion of new
ones will be leasehold as well. We know about the scandals in the
retirement sector. I will not go into the Office of Fair Trading report
on what Peverel and Cirrus did in ripping off their leaseholders
because it is not relevant to the Bill.</hs_Para>

change proposed in the Bill, we consider how two Government Departments
and two extensions of Government ought to come together. What happens
in the courts is mainly a matter for the Ministry of Justice. Some
property issues are considered at leasehold valuation tribunals when
there is a dispute between the leaseholder and the managing agent
acting on behalf of a freeholder, and those bodies reach their
conclusions. However, there is no method whereby Siobhan McGrath, who
heads the MOJ’s property chamber, and the Department for
Communities and Local Government can come together to consider what is
coming up through the courts, the issues brought forward by Members of
Parliament on behalf of their constituents, and what comes from the
Government agency, LEASE, which is a source of information for
leaseholders in trouble.</hs_Para>

Friend said, this Bill, which I hope will shortly become an Act, cures
an unexpected court judgment over an unintended use of words which
describe, though 
<?notus-xml column=566?>accurately, a false distinction between what a landlord or freeholder
can do and what a leaseholder or those acting on their behalf can do.
The arguments for the Bill have been put very plainly, and I will go no
further in that respect. I will say, though, that matters of
professional standards should be considered. I hope that those who look
after the professional standards of lawyers—solicitors and
barristers—and of accountants and surveyors will give guidance
to their members as to whether they should use the nit-picking parts of
the law as they see it while bouncing cases between the first-tier
tribunal—the property chamber—and the county court, which
leads to costs going up. That allows a very wealthy, well-resourced,
clever, tricksy freeholder, or the managing agent working for them, to
confound a leaseholder or an ordinary tenant. I would expect people in
training for these revered professions to be told that if their conduct
is clearly unjust—though it may be lawful—the
professional standards bodies would consider a complaint against
them.</hs_Para>

Friends, with the co-operation of Opposition and Government Front
Benchers, are curing one injustice, but many others need to be
addressed. Over the next year and a half, we should aim to set up a way
of gathering information on what can easily be done to make changes
that improve the lives of ordinary people. We must ensure that those
who are powerful, often greedy, and sometimes corrupt cannot make their
living by ruining the lives of ordinary people, many of whom are
elderly, vulnerable, poor and ill.</hs_Para>

may sometimes wonder why in Parliament we go through very small details
and take great pains to explain them, but that is important in enabling
us to get on and get things done quickly. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Bury North said, this Bill is a good example of that. It originally
went through without debate, so when the courts looked at these issues
they were unable to see the intent that Parliament had as regards their
ability to qualify personally in any way other than that which they
already had. The Bill is also a good example of why making a small
difference is sometimes a very big deal for the people it
affects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000114">In
thinking about the help that this Bill can provide, particularly to
vulnerable leaseholders, we should recognise that, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) pointed out, the
residential leasehold market is a large, growing and important part of
the housing sector. Leasehold plays a vital part in a functioning
housing market, providing opportunities not only for home ownership,
but for private renting. CentreForum’s recent useful report,
“A new lease of life”, estimates that there are
approximately 2.5 million leasehold properties across England, so a
substantial number will potentially be affected by the
Bill.</hs_Para>

its estimate, I think it would now accept that the census data mean

Lewis:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point. The reality is
that, with every day that passes—certainly with every month that
passes—the number of people accessing the market is likely to
grow. That highlights the importance of the Bill. It appears, on the
face of it, to be short and simple, but it is actually an example of
the way in which Parliament sometimes has the ability to make a

have strong feelings of protection. I assure the House that I am aware

attorney that had been executed, giving them general authority to act

the lease of the flat using the statutory rights to ensure that the

them when they are incapable of signing themselves? Broadly speaking,
they tend to be the most vulnerable, such as the old, the infirm and
people who have a condition that makes it impossible for them to write,
even though they may have all their senses. For example, I have a
constituent who has lost both his hands. How would he sign, except
perhaps with a mouth brush? One way or another, the judiciary has to
accept, or Parliament should enact, that unless a court believes there
is a specific reason why signatures should be made personally, a
signature should be allowed to be made on someone’s behalf if
they are incapable or unwilling to do it themselves but wish the act to

this debate as a chance for all hon. Members to put the clear intent of
Parliament on the record. The requirements on signatories do not appear
to have been debated during the passage of the 1993 Act, which is a
good reminder of why it is sometimes important for parliamentarians to
put clearly on the record why we do things, not just to assume that our
intent in passing legislation is clear and obvious. It is a great

existing restrictions perhaps aim to ensure that the individual
leaseholder is fully aware of the commitment they enter into, given the
significant financial liabilities that arise from serving the notices
concerned. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bury North has outlined,
the Bill will enable legal notices to be signed on the
leaseholder’s behalf and that change will help, among others,
those physically disabled, seriously ill or mentally incapacitated
leaseholders who are currently unable to benefit financially and

clearly focused on helping a particular group of leaseholders, many of
whom are likely to be elderly and vulnerable. As such, it has received
warm words of support from both sides of the House, which I am sure is
appreciated by my hon. Friend. That reflects my hon. Friends’
efforts in gathering support for the Bill, and in highlighting the
benefits that it will enable some currently frustrated leaseholders to
enjoy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000144">The
changes made by the Bill to the 1993 Act may affect only a relatively
small number of leaseholders of flats in England, but they might be
very important for those leaseholders currently unable, for one reason
or another, to sign the requisite legal notices in person. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Kettering has rightly pointed out, the Bill
applies only to England, so I hope that the devolved Assembly will look
at the provision and perhaps introduce it in Wales. As I have said,
those helped by this Bill will often be elderly and more vulnerable
leaseholders. The removal of current restrictions will also help those
who are charged with looking after the financial affairs of a
leaseholder. The example of relatives acting under a power of attorney
was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing
West.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000145">One
sad situation that was brought to a colleague’s attention
concerns an elderly leaseholder living in a leasehold retirement
development who, because of severe illness, unfortunately had to go
into a nursing home to be cared for. I give this example because it is
important to provide some colour and life on exactly how the change
will make a beneficial impact to people’s lives. The
leaseholder’s relatives were looking after her financial affairs
under a power of attorney, and could therefore deal with almost all
matters that needed taking care of. As she became more unwell, it was
necessary for her leasehold property to be sold to assist in paying the
care home fees. That is where her relatives reached what can only be
described as a bizarre situation: they could sell the flat using the
power of attorney, but they simply could not act on her behalf to
extend her lease. They therefore had the frustration and sadness of
being unable to make the most of their elderly relative’s assets
for her benefit simply because they were not permitted to sign the
vital leasehold paperwork on her behalf. Had they been able to do so,
it is very likely that the flat, with the attraction of an extended
lease, would have secured a higher selling price, and maximising the
value of their relative’s assets in that way would have helped
meet the fees of a suitable care home for her final
days.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000146">It
is important to give more examples of the people who will be helped by
this Bill. For instance, limbless or severely injured Army veterans
face many problems. They may wish to extend the lease on their home and
to enjoy the financial benefits that such action could bring, but,
owing to their disability, they might no longer be able to hold a pen
and to sign vital papers. As the law now stands, for that reason alone
they are frustrated from exercising their important legal right as the
leaseholder. There is no way that that was the intent of Parliament
when the Act was passed, and it is right to get through this Bill for
that reason
alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000147">The
Bill may help leaseholders living abroad who need to sign notices. For
example, work may take the leaseholder of a flat abroad for a prolonged
period. Without the ability to have someone act, with the 
<?notus-xml column=572?>appropriate authority, on their behalf in respect the property, it may
be difficult for them to exercise their statutory rights. Again, that
was clearly not Parliament’s
intent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000148">The
Bill might also help an aid worker serving overseas in a remote
location, where postal services are infrequent and unreliable. If they
want to extend the lease on their property back home in England, they
will need to receive a paper copy of a document, and they then have to
sign and return it. In some parts of the world, even in today’s
modern age, that can take months, involve worry and delay, and create
problems about getting the work done. If the absent or incapacitated
person is the sole leaseholder, even their husband or wife cannot
validly sign notices on their
behalf.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000149">If
an individual leaseholder who lives or works abroad is hindered in that
way, it could have an unfortunate knock-on effect on other leaseholders
in their block. For example—we have examples of this in this
country—a group of leaseholders may want to exercise their
collective right to acquire the freehold of their block, but to satisfy
the qualifying criteria they may need one or more leaseholders who live
or work abroad to sign the documents. Although the Bill would not make
any change to leaseholders’ actual rights—we must be
clear about that—it could helpfully remove a practical barrier
to the efficient exercise of those
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000150">Let
us also consider an elderly person who is physically fit, but who for
years has been accustomed to relying on their long-standing family
solicitor to act for them in all legal and administrative affairs. They

their much-loved home, but in that case, the solicitor simply could not
validly sign the documents on their
behalf.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000151">Since

the leaseholder to take the major step of assigning the lease of their

appropriately drafted. In particular, a small amendment was made so

discussed in Committee, however, without better measures in place to

have serious adverse effects on marine communities, specifically
hydrothermal vent communities, which were only discovered in 1977, 
<?notus-xml column=575?>and seamounts, which have taken 10,000 years to develop and have low
resilience to change. As home to the largest reservoir of marine

would reverse the burden of proof in section 5 of the 1981 Act, in line
with the precautionary principle that if there are indications of
likely but uncertain significant adverse environmental impacts, an
activity should not be authorised to proceed. The amendment would
require environmental impact assessments to be carried out before
exploration or exploitation takes place, and for the process to be
transparent so that it can be publicly evaluated. That would also
address the serious weakness in the system that if a contractor
considers the environmental risk of mining to be too high prior to the
environmental impact assessment, that concession could still be offered
to another contractor.</hs_Para>

transparency in the system would also help to address weaknesses in
monitoring the compliance of companies with environmental regulations
and the terms of licences. It is difficult, as one can imagine, to make
site visits in deep sea areas to ensure that work is carried out
correctly, and the current process is not properly independent of
contractor influence. NGOs will not know whether an activity authorised
by licence is damaging, and it would be up to the contractor to stop
and self-assess.</hs_Para>

Food and Agriculture Organisation’s committee on fisheries
defines vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas where bottom

McCarthy:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Indeed,
my understanding is that at the moment a company does not even need a
licence to explore. Ideally, we would want everyone to go through the
ISA regime, and a respectable and reputable company would want to do
that and follow the correct procedures, but I understand that there is
nothing stopping them doing that. It is an ideological debate that we
could have at great length in relation to many different areas of
policy. We could look at labour terms and conditions, for example, or
health and safety rules. I do not think that we should be involved in a
race to the bottom—actually, perhaps that is exactly what we are
talking about. We want to ensure that the UK sets an example by
requiring companies to act responsibly. Our natural resources are
incredibly precious, and I think that we should be taking the lead in
trying to ensure that we protect the
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000180">The
timing of the Bill is slightly strange, as was the timing of the 1981
Act. The Act was introduced a year before the United Nations convention
on the law of the sea was finalised, although it then took about eight
years to come into effect. The ISA will look at its 
<?notus-xml column=577?>regulations, which will obviously apply on a wider basis, next year, so
in some ways the Bill pre-empts that. Perhaps there could have been
better co-ordination. It is also slightly strange that we have been
talking about updating the 1981 Act since 1982, so it has taken an
awfully long time to reach this point. I think we need to drive the
agenda forward. I accept that we do not want to disadvantage British
companies, but we want to ensure that there is a reputable and
reasonable regime in place.</hs_Para>

the amendment is made, I do not think that it would make the regime
overly burdensome. As I have said, the proposal is moderate and

boost one of the Government’s reasons for introducing the Bill,
which is to help to increase the UK’s influence in current
negotiations and in determining standards, as I said to the hon. Member
for Bury North (Mr Nuttall). I appreciate that the ISA regulatory
framework is of greater importance because it applies to all deep sea
mining, not just those activities that get sponsorship from the UK. In
which case, let us apply the environmental standards that we would like
to see agreed in the negotiations, rather than keep the 1981 version.
They are workable standards that we hope will be applied at ISA level
to enable sea bed mining to go ahead without causing irreparable
damage. As I mentioned, I did not get a direct response from the
Minister in Committee on the level of environmental safeguards that the
Government are seeking to get common agreement on during the ISA
negotiations, although I was pleased that he made it clear that the

Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Hugo
Swire):</Member></B> I was interested to hear some of the suggestions
made this morning, as I have attended some, although not all, of the
consideration of the Bill as it has made progress. The Government
completely understand the sentiments that have led the hon. Member for
Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) and the hon. Member for Brent North
(Barry Gardiner) to table the amendment —the hon. Gentleman is
not in his place today, but he has been an assiduous attendee
previously. The Government are committed to ensuring that the highest
environmental standards are followed when exploration and exploitation
of the deep sea bed take place. As the hon. Lady said, we are
often—pardon the pun—in uncharted waters: this is new and
exploratory, so environmental considerations need to be at the
forefront of our
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000189">As
hon. Members will know, the Government were approached 18 months ago by
a major commercial company, Lockheed Martin, to sponsor its application
to explore for minerals on the deep sea bed. When we received that
approach, we took great pains to ensure that the environmental
standards were the best that could be devised. The Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was closely involved, as were two
eminent scientists from outside the Government. When the application
reached the council of the International Seabed Authority, the
environmental aspects were generally praised by delegations. At the
meeting of the council last year, when the first discussion of the
possible shape of future regulations took place, the Government made it
clear that they would expect those regulations to incorporate
environmental provisions of the highest
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000190">The
British Government have already spoken and acted in a manner that will
ensure that the highest environmental standards are adhered to, and I
know that the need to protect the natural environment has 
<?notus-xml column=579?>universal support across the House. However, the Government cannot
support the amendment, and I shall try to explain
why.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000191">Section
5 of the 1981 Act, to which the hon. Member for Bristol East and my
hon. Friend the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)
referred, already includes clear provisions on the need to protect the
marine environment. I know that on Second Reading the hon. Member for
Brent North suggested that section 5 might not be
sufficiently up to date, but we do not believe that to be the case.
Section 5 is worded in a general manner and can accommodate changes to
environmental
perspectives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000192"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kerry McCarthy" PimsId="4810" UID="14012435000364" xid="812" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000364">Kerry
McCarthy:</Member></B> The point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Brent North and I have been making is that post 1981 it has been
clearly established that the precautionary principle, agreed at Rio,
should apply, and it is missing here. It is the reversal of the burden
of proof that will be missing if we stick to the 1981 Act. It is
important to reflect in the Bill the extent to which the precautionary
principle has been
accepted.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012435000289" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000289">11.15

Swire:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is right, but we also want companies
to come here, and therefore we want to ensure that our environmental
protections are the best and are in place. We are convinced they are
and that section 5 of the 1981 Act is worded in a general manner that
can accommodate changes to environmental perspectives. We do not
believe that the amendment would add anything to the
legislation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012435000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000194">On Second
Reading, the hon. Member for Brent North referred to the precautionary
approach in principle 15 of the Rio declaration. But the International
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea made it clear in its 2011 advisory
opinion that sponsoring states should comply with the terms of
principle 15, as well as best environmental practices. In exercising
his functions to issue licences under the Act, the Secretary of State
would have to comply with those
provisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000195">In
addition, by replacing the whole of the current section 5, the
amendment would lose two key elements. The requirement at the end of
subsection (1) for the Secretary of State to consider any
representations would be lost, as would the power in subsection (2) for
the Secretary of State to include in licences provisions about
protection of the marine environment. On those two technical grounds
alone, the amendment cannot be
supported.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000196">More
substantively, the amendment would require a full environmental impact
assessment, even before exploration is carried out. However, as the
hon. Member for Bristol East conceded, exploration of the deep sea bed
involves minimal disturbance of the marine environment and no
commercial company would be expected to undertake a full environmental
assessment in those circumstances. The Bill should not be about
preventing responsible companies from undertaking responsible
exploration. On the contrary, the Government believe that we should
actively encourage exploration of the deep sea bed. That is because the
scientific information obtained through exploration will be an
essential element 
<?notus-xml column=580?>in considering the environmental aspects of mining when it does take
place. As the hon. Lady acknowledged in Committee, mining on the deep
sea bed will eventually take
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000197">The
amendment refers to a number of other international instruments. The
Government are entirely conscious of the current developments in
international environmental law, and have for example been at the
forefront of international action on climate change—as is well
recognised. It is clear therefore that international developments will
be, and will have to be, taken into account when decisions on whether
to issue licences are eventually made. But we should not limit
ourselves in this way. There may be national developments, or
developments in the European Union, that should also be taken into
account. The current text of section 5 of the 1981 Act already allows
for this and indeed, in this respect, is wider in its ambit than the
amendment. For that reason, the Government do not support the
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000198"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kerry McCarthy" PimsId="4810" UID="14012435000366" xid="812" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000366">Kerry

agreed over time would be
included.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000200"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Swire" PimsId="4192" UID="14012435000367" xid="577" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000367">Mr

course the Government will continue to expect that the International
Seabed Authority, in its decision-making process, should work towards
meeting agreed international standards with respect to protection of
the environment, and should utilise the latest information about the
importance of marine areas. The Government recognise that the work
being carried out under the convention on biological diversity to
identify ecologically and biologically significant areas, along with
the identification of vulnerable marine ecosystems, provide
authoritative information that needs to be taken into account within
the processes of the International Seabed Authority. Furthermore, let
me assure hon. Members that the secretariat of the ISA is highly expert
and, in particular, well aware of international developments in the
environmental field. I think, therefore, that the House can have
confidence that these developments will not be overlooked.</hs_Para>

conclusion, the Government sympathise with the reasons that have led
the hon. Members for Bristol East and for Brent North to table the
amendment. We have had an interesting debate, but as I have said, the
Government cannot support it and are satisfied that section 5 of the
1981 Act is sufficient. In the light of this, I hope that the hon. Lady
will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</hs_Para>

McCarthy:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his response, although
he has not entirely set my mind at rest. I would have liked the Bill to
build on the environmental protections set out in the 1981 Act, given
that we have moved on considerably since then, and I would have liked
the precautionary principle firmly established in the Bill, because
that is where we are at now with environmental protection
internationally, but I do not intend to press 
<?notus-xml column=581?>the amendment. With respect to the Minister, however, he is the third
Minister to deal with the Bill—there was one Minister on Second
Reading, one in Committee and now another on Report and Third
Reading—and there will be yet another Minister in the Lords.
Furthermore, I am the second Labour spokesperson to deal with it. I
hope in the Lords, therefore, there will be an opportunity for detailed
scrutiny to ensure that we tie things together and take the Bill
forward properly.</hs_Para>

McCarthy:</Member></B> Certainly, we have moved on from the stage when
probably not a single Member knew what was meant when we referred to
hydrothermal vents, polymetallic nodules, a cobalt-rich crust or any of
the other things we have been discussing, so we have been significantly
enlightened. Nevertheless, I hope that the Lords will further
scrutinise the environmental provisions and perhaps pull some of this
together and table some amendments. As I have said, however, I do not
intend to press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw

is a good Bill and an important one for the UK economy. It is also
timely. As my hon. Friend the Minister mentioned, in 2012 the UK
sponsored its first licence application to the ISA for a UK company to
explore the deep sea for polymetallic nodules in the Pacific ocean. No
one has learned more than I have about not only polymetallic nodules
and cobalt-rich crusts but polymetallic vents and how some of them are
dead, while others are smoking and look like they have their own
ecosystems—those are the ones we all want to
protect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000210">The
UK Government sponsored the last licence issued under the 1981 Act, but
that Act is restricted to exploration for polymetallic nodules; it does
not allow exploration for other things, which is why it is essential
that it be updated. As the hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry
McCarthy) mentioned, the Act predates the UN convention on the law of
the sea and the subsequent implementing agreement on part 11 of the
convention on deep-sea mining. In some small, niche areas, it is not
entirely consistent with the convention, such as on the enforcement of
decisions on sea bed disputes in the chamber of the international
tribunal for the law of the sea, established under the
convention.</hs_Para>

important for the UK that we put our legislation in good order, not
least because we are strong proponents of the convention. It is also
important economically. As many UK companies have expertise in the
area, it could provide many benefits to the UK economy. I was
delighted, therefore, that in Committee we extended the Bill to cover
Scotland, which also has a lot of expertise gained through our
exploration and exploitation of North sea oil. It will also benefit my
own part of the country in the south-west and south of England.
Plymouth university 
<?notus-xml column=582?>and Southampton university have departments looking into and gaining a
lot of expertise in this area, which is unknown to many of
us.</hs_Para>

mining has enormous potential. Scientists know that lying on the sea
bed, at great depths, are valuable new sources of nickel, copper,
cobalt, manganese and rare earth elements. These metals are being mined
to extinction on land, so we need to find new sources. Metals such as
nickel, used in superalloys, cobalt and manganese, used in energy
storage technology, which will obviously benefit everybody, and rare
earth elements, which are strategically important, are used in
low- carbon technology, lasers, sub-conductors and many
telecommunication applications. There are large quantities of these
metals, and it is right that the UK benefit from its share of this
groundbreaking new technology, which I hope will benefit UK companies
considerably.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000213">On
11 March last year, the Prime Minister attended an event at the ExCeL
centre celebrating the granting of an exploration contract by the ISA
to the UK. He spoke of the benefits to the UK and of the supply chain
jobs likely to be created across the UK. As I mentioned, he said that
jobs could be created not just in Plymouth and Southampton but in
Portsmouth, Bristol, Liverpool, Newcastle and Aberdeen, in sectors such
as engineering and the manufacture of high-tech remotely operated
underwater vehicles and ship stabilisation systems. He also said that
that was estimated to be worth up to £40 billion to
our economy over the next 30 years. At this point, I should correct
some information that I gave in Committee: I said that it would be
worth £30 billion by 2030.</hs_Para>

no excavation of rock. It involves no use of explosives, and the
nodules lie on the sea bed very much like the fish that my husband used
to harvest in his nets. The techniques that are used to mine the
nodules are likely to involve scooping or vacuuming them up. I do not
pretend that the process will be environmentally neutral, but it is
potentially less environmentally damaging than land-based mining for
the same

polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich crusts is a different matter,
because it would involve the excavation of rocks. Mining for those
minerals is even further off than mining for polymetallic nodules, and
in that context the principles that might apply to nodules would have
to be considered again. I am determined, and I know that the Government
are determined, to ensure that the highest environmental standards will
be applied to any exploitation of the minerals to which the hon. Lady
has referred, and she has implied that she shares that determination. I
can inform her that international regulations governing the exploration
of those minerals have been agreed and were in place in advance of the
issuing of any exploration contracts, and that various regulations have
continued to be reviewed and updated in the light of new developments
and considerations.</hs_Para>

I speak for both this Government and previous Governments in saying
that the United Kingdom prides itself on taking a close interest in

following the ratification of various treaties. The United Kingdom was

is a good Bill, and it is important for the United Kingdom’s
economy. It is all the better now following the passing of amendments
to extend its provisions to Scotland. We engaged in some interesting
and thought-provoking discussions on Second Reading and in Committee,
which were all the better for the points raised by the hon. Member for
Bristol East. There is clearly a common understanding of the fact that
the exploitation of minerals in the deep sea is beyond any
state’s jurisdiction, and will inevitably take place in the
future. It is, therefore, important for the United Kingdom to be at the
heart of it, and to assist the development of international regulations
on deep-sea mining. I am glad that the Bill appears to have general
cross-party support, and I hope that that support will continue in the
other

McCarthy:</Member></B> I do not intend to speak for long. Let me begin
by congratulating the hon. Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll
Murray). It is always challenging to take a private Member’s
Bill through all its parliamentary stages, not least when the Bill
contains as much technical detail and covers as many new areas as this
one. However, I understood from the hon. Lady that this was her second
experience of the process. She  
<?notus-xml column=584?>is a great deal luckier than I have been, because in my nine years as a
Member of Parliament, I have never been successful in the ballot for
private Members' Bills.</hs_Para>

Labour Front Bench do not oppose the Bill, because we accept that deep
sea mining is inevitable. We could not prevent or even delay it even if
we wanted to. We agree with the Government and the hon. Lady that it is
important for the United Kingdom to be at the forefront of the benefits
to be had from the industry. However, we want to be at the forefront
not just because of the business opportunities afforded to the UK, but
in order to be able to determine standards for ourselves rather than
leaving it to others who may not consider environmental protection as
important as we
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000225">I
understand that the Government conceded privately that the Bill was not
needed quite yet, and perhaps was not quite ready. A number of
amendments in Committee extended its provisions to Scotland because
discussions had not yet taken place. We accept that this Bill is a work
in progress, but we think that it is, perhaps, a little bit rushed. It
could perhaps have been dealt with as a Government Bill. We know the
Government have supported it from the outset and, given that we have
very little legislation going through Parliament at the moment, we had
an ideal opportunity to discuss this as a Front-Bench Bill on the Floor
of the House with several days of
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000226"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sheryll Murray" PimsId="5731" UID="14012435000375" xid="1187" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000375">Sheryll

have been presented without Scotland measures if
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000227"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kerry McCarthy" PimsId="4810" UID="14012435000376" xid="812" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000376">Kerry
McCarthy:</Member></B> My point was not specifically about the Scottish
amendment. I was just using that as one example to make my point. The
discussions with Scotland took place, or were finalised, after the Bill
had been introduced. My understanding was that the Government had
conceded that, and, because the ISA regulations are being debated next
year and because of other developments, the Bill might be slightly
premature and a little bit rushed. It might have been given more
consideration. We are where we are now, however, in terms of the
parliamentary process. I hope the other place has the
opportunity to scrutinise the Bill in detail and perhaps
make further amendments that would improve
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000228">I
want to make one further point, which arose from the Committee
discussions. It remained unclear how the finances of this will work and
whether the UK would in fact get a share of the profits. We have been
told that this is very much about wanting the UK to benefit from being
in the vanguard of the exploration. As has been mentioned, the Prime
Minister has claimed that sea bed mining could be worth a staggering
£40 billion to the UK economy over the next 30 years,
although I have not seen any detailed analysis to support that
estimate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000229">I
appreciate that it is slightly jumping ahead of even where the ISA is
currently at, because it has not drafted its regulations yet, but the
issue of operator profits is critical to this debate. I understand that
the UK would benefit from corporation tax from those UK companies 
<?notus-xml column=585?>or foreign companies, such as Lockheed Martin, with UK subsidiaries
which get sponsored by the UK, although once their profits have been
understandably offset by their exploratory costs and the costs of
environmental assessments, this amount could be quite limited.
Certainly in the case of UK subsidiaries, profits may go to the parent
company, but unlike the tax regime on North sea oil revenues, the
British Exchequer will not be plugged into the profits, as the riches
of the sea bed do not belong to the UK; they belong to what is
described as the “common heritage of mankind” and those
resources do not belong to any one state, and no one state would have
the right to claim ownership.</hs_Para>

my point about this Bill being slightly premature, I understand that
there are discussions about a possible sovereign wealth fund, created
from a fee that could be charged on output. That could be used for the
benefit of developing countries, but again discussions on this are at
an early stage and we do not yet know much about it. Again, I would
have liked to have had more clarity on this. More than 30 years have
passed since we last considered legislation on this topic with the 1981
Act. Given that it has taken us so long to get to the point where we
are revisiting the matter, I would have liked to have had more clarity
on that issue and on the environmental issues. We are where we are,
however, and I hope when the Bill gets to the Lords there can be more
clarity. We will support the Bill at this stage, however, because we
think that if deep sea mining is to go ahead, there ought to be some
sort of licensing system in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012435000292" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000292">11.44

previous centuries mankind has gone off exploring the world in pretty

mankind goes digging around on the deep sea bed causing who knows what

exploration is carried out in a carefully controlled manner and causes
as little damage as possible to the delicate ecosystems of the deep sea

decide and form the opinion that our legislative framework is too
onerous, prescriptive and complicated. I hope that that is not the
case. Certainly, it would not have my support or the support of the
Government or anyone in the House if we felt that it was the case.
There is a delicate balance to be struck between trying to protect the
environment, maximising revenues and encouraging exploration for the
benefit of mankind. They are all worthy things to do, and the Bill in
its own way seeks to strike that careful balance. It is not an easy
task to pull off, because if we go too far in one direction, we will
upset something else. There is a balance to be struck between mankind
exploiting for the benefit of us all the resources that are in the deep
sea in the other parts of the world and protecting the environment that
is down there. I sincerely hope that this Bill will receive its Third
Reading and that when it reaches the other place, it will have a speedy
passage. I wish it

fact that it has been handled by a number of different Ministers

generations—indeed, from before Roman times—but is of
course a great maritime county. My hon. Friend has always been a strong

it was her secret number. I remind her gently that recordings of this
place are, as we speak, being broadcast to the four corners of the
world. Who knows, one day they might be broadcast to the sea bed as
well, so Captain Nemo can watch them. Quite a lot of people will
remember 336 now and, with her indulgence, I shall be tempted to use
some of those numbers when I next fill in my national lottery form as
they have brought her such luck in the

is deep sea mining such a prominent issue just now? One or two comments
have been made to the effect that the Bill is in some way premature and
that the industry is in its infancy, and some have asked why we are
doing this now. It is worth recalling that in the 1980s there was a
great deal of interest in deep sea mining, although I must confess that
I was not aware of that myself. There were expectations then of a major
boom in deep sea mining and pessimism in many quarters that
an internationally agreed regime could not be achieved. It was against
that background that the Deep Sea Mining
(Temporary Provisions) Act 1981 was passed.</hs_Para>

of the words “Temporary Provisions” to that Act now seems
ironic, as here we are 33 years later and the Act is still in force.
That, presumably, gives a new definition to the word
“temporary”. Let us hope that the same use of the word
does not apply when we talk about other parties
“temporarily” holding on to seats that should be ours in
the south-west—we do not envisage that going on for 33 years,
Madam Deputy Speaker. In recognition of the fact that deep sea mining
is here to stay, we will remove those words from the short title. I
imagine that that is probably the most uncontentious thing I could
say.</hs_Para>

Swire:</Member></B> I am making as much haste as I possibly can, Madam
Deputy Speaker, given the complexities of some parts of the Bill. I was
alluding back to the ’80s because of the commercial side of the
issue. The commercial companies that showed an interest in deep sea
mining at that time ceased to do so and although the idea lived on, it
did not seem likely to become a reality any time
soon.</hs_Para>

Nuttall:</Member></B> Does the Minister know why, over the intervening
three decades, cross-party agreement has arisen on these matters? If we
look back to the debates on the 1981 Act, we can see that it was pretty
contentious, with Divisions on Second and Third
Readings.</hs_Para>

Swire:</Member></B> I think that is for two reasons. First, such ideas
are becoming a reality, whereas in the 1980s they were a distant
prospect, and, secondly, our understanding of the management of the
environment, not least the marine environment, has improved in leaps
and bounds. Marine conservation zones and ecological balancing mean
that we are way ahead of where we were then. No doubt you would rightly
stop me going down memory lane to the 1980s, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I
shall not continue along that line, but I hope that I have answered my
hon. Friend’s questions as best I can.</hs_Para>

part of the prediction also turned out to be incorrect. We were able to
achieve an internationally agreed regime for deep sea mining. However,
the road to achieving that was not straightforward. When the United
Nations convention on the law of the sea was first adopted, the United
Kingdom, in common with other industrialised countries, could not
accept the provisions on deep sea mining. Those were included in part
XI of the convention and were not attractive to commercial companies.
The industrialised countries stood aloof from the convention, even
though—apart from part XI—the provisions were
satisfactory. Indeed, they were of great advantage to industrialised
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000254">As
the date for the convention’s coming into force grew closer, the
developing countries appreciated that a convention with no
participation from industrialised 
<?notus-xml column=589?>countries would not be to their advantage. Negotiations began to revise
part XI or, in the diplomatic speak of the time, to set out how it
would be implemented. I am pleased to note that United Kingdom
representatives played a prominent role in those negotiations. The
result was the so-called part XI agreement, which met the concerns of
the industrialised countries and paved the way for the United Kingdom
and other industrialised countries to ratify the
convention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000255">Let
me say now that the British Government consider that the convention,
read with the part XI agreement, represents an excellent platform for
the future development of deep sea mining. There is a need to ensure
that the commercial terms encourage commercial companies, which are
rightly hard-headed about the process, to invest the large sums
necessary to make deep sea mining a reality. My hon. Friend the Member
for Bury North (Mr Nuttall) elegantly made the point, in a
well-balanced argument, that there is a balance to be struck. We want
to encourage deep sea mining and ensure that companies come here to
register for the licences, but we do not want to give them false
expectations; they can spend huge amounts of money before they mine
anything. That is one reason why we were unable to accept the
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000256" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000256">Ultimately,
the deep sea is, as the convention says and as the hon. Member for
Bristol East said, the common heritage of mankind; that is the phrase
that has been universally used. It is a ringing phrase, which means a
great deal to many people around the world, particularly those who are
nervous about the concept of touching the sea bed. Ultimately, the
benefits of deep sea mining should be shared with all members of the
international community. That is recognised by the convention, and we
are happy to endorse
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012435000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012435000257">The
hon. Lady and my hon. Friend talked about profits and which country
should benefit from any money made, which is perhaps slightly putting
the cart before the horse. Apart from the licence fees, the issue of
what direct benefits will accrue to sponsoring states is one of the
many that will need to be considered during the development of the
exploitation regulations. However, the indirect benefits are likely to
be substantial. Deep sea mining is a significant opportunity for UK
industry, especially in the light of the technological advances made
during the development of the oil and gas industry in the North sea. We
look forward to UK industry making full use of that
opportunity.</hs_Para>

into particular consideration the interests and needs of the developing
states. In other words, the ultimate intention, although we are
probably a long way away from this, is that the economic benefits of
deep sea mining should, rightly, be shared with developing countries.
Talk of the precise nature of how the money will be held and disbursed,
and of where sovereign wealth funds should be located and who should be
involved with them, is somewhat
premature.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000017">Nevertheless,
a balance is needed between the requirements of the commercial
companies and those of the beneficiaries in the international community
as a whole. It would be counter-productive to fix payments 
<?notus-xml column=590?>to the international community at a level that would deter the
commercial companies. In other words, we must ensure that the
international community secures a reasonable rate of return without
putting off the commercial companies without which there would be no
mining at all—ergo no revenue, no sovereign wealth fund and no
ability to share any profits with developing countries because, by
definition, there would be no profits to
share.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000018">I
am perhaps getting a little ahead of myself because, at present, there
is no mining on the deep sea bed—that is a statement of fact.
There have been only applications to explore for minerals. So far the
International Seabed Authority has approved 19 such applications. Four
more were held over from its 2013 session, and at least three new
applications will be considered during the coming
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000019">The
pace of applications has increased markedly in the last few years, as
we might expect. There may well be many reasons why, but there is no
doubt that there are two in particular: first, the development of
technology, much of it by British companies that have been working in
the North sea for many years, as their unrivalled expertise in deep sea
drilling has a knock-on effect for their understanding of deep sea
mining; and, secondly, the exponential economic growth in certain
countries, which I need not name, that has fuelled a significant
increase in their demand for metals and precious minerals. It follows
that deep sea mining for mineral deposits on the sea bed is close to
becoming technically and economically viable. It is also a truism that,
with an increasing world population and finite resources, we will need
to look to the oceans to provide additional sources of support for our
growing needs and demands. We need to be acutely aware of changes in
our ability to produce energy and extract minerals. I refer the House
to the need for a serious look, from an environmental perspective, at
the exploitation of shale gas, which has had hugely beneficial effects,
especially regarding the cost of energy, in countries such as the
United States that are well ahead of us on that practice.</hs_Para>

should explain to the House how the system set out in the United
Nations convention on the law of the sea works. Any application to
explore for mineral resources on the deep sea bed requires sponsorship
by a state party, which must be able to exercise sufficient
jurisdiction over the company it is sponsoring. It is worth saying that
an advisory opinion in 2011 by the International Tribunal for the Law
of the Sea helpfully elucidated the duties cast on a sponsoring state
by the convention, which include a requirement to adopt a precautionary
approach to environmental
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000021">Once
a company has secured the sponsorship of a state, its application goes
to the International Seabed Authority. I am pleased to note that the
authority’s headquarters are in Kingston in Jamaica, a fellow
Commonwealth country. I am the Minister for the Commonwealth, so I have
a further excuse to go and inspect the headquarters
personally—if the cold weather continues, I shall be going
sooner rather than
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000022">The
application will then be considered by the legal and technical
commission of the International Seabed Authority, which is composed of
experts from across the world and gives technical advice to the
ISA’s council. Once approved by the commission, the application
is forwarded to the council, which is composed of a 
<?notus-xml column=591?>number of member states that have a particular interest in deep sea
mining. It is then for the council to approve the
application.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000023">The
final step is that the contractor and the International Seabed
Authority enter into a contract that has a number of standard
provisions, including on the reports that the contractor must make to
the authority. Effective regulation of the contractor will be secured
through a combination of those provisions and the domestic law of the
state sponsoring the application. The authority is at present concerned
only with the exploration of the deep sea
bed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Nuttall" PimsId="5664" UID="14012436000348" xid="1228" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000348">Mr
Nuttall:</Member></B> The Minister may be aware that the original
convention on the law of the sea established a body called the
Enterprise, the purpose of which was to serve as the authority’s
mining operator. As far as I am aware, no steps are being taken to
bring the Enterprise into operation. Is he aware of any moves in that
direction? Will the ISA take control of this
itself?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Swire" PimsId="4192" UID="14012436000349" xid="577" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000349">Mr
Swire:</Member></B> I am not aware of any such rules, but I commit to
writing to my hon. Friend once I have clarified that point. I am
pleased that the ISA’s secretariat is thinking about the
regulations that will be necessary once exploitation begins. The United
Kingdom delegation at the authority’s most recent session made
clear the importance that we attach to the development of those
regulations, which will be an important step for the authority and one
in which the United Kingdom is determined to play its full part. There
are important environmental issues to be resolved, but there is also a
financial issue relating to the amount of any payment to the ISA, to
which I have already
alluded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000026">What
of British involvement in deep sea mining, which is really what the
Bill is about? I am pleased to say that the United Kingdom has now
sponsored two applications. The first was approved by the ISA’s
council in 2012, and consequently a British company will cover an area
of sea bed twice the size of Wales and 4,000 metres deep.
Disappointingly, the legal and technical commission did not have time
to consider the second application at its sessions last year, but we
hope it will approve the application at its session beginning in
February, and that the council will approve the application when it
meets in
July.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000027">Deep
sea mining is a very exciting and pioneering industry, and the

its development. Last year, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister
spoke at an event in London to celebrate the signing of the contract
between the United Kingdom’s sponsored contractor, UK Seabed
Resources Ltd, and the ISA. Our colleagues in the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills organised an industry day at which more
than 80 British companies participated. British companies have
developed expertise and technology through their activities in the
North sea, much of which is transferable to deep sea mining. We hope
that significant benefits to the British economy will be forthcoming
over the next 30 years. We have heard figures of anything up to
£40 billion bandied around this morning. In the
Government’s view, it is essential that the United Kingdom does
not ignore these potential benefits. As I have said—it is also
the assessment of the International 
<?notus-xml column=592?>Seabed Authority—we are at the threshold of a new era of deep sea
mining. This new frontier presents a valuable opportunity to contribute
to the prosperity of the British people, of British

nodules, as I am sure we are all now fully aware, contain a higher
concentration of valuable metals—up to 28% more, or 10 times the
proportion usually found on land. Many of the metals contained in these
sea bed deposits are considered to be valuable “technology
metals”, which are increasingly important in high-technology
industries that benefit us all, including electronics, clean
technologies such as hybrid cars and wind turbines, and the
construction and aerospace industries. The strategic importance of this
source of minerals and metals should not be underestimated, not least
as they contain trace metals such as rare earth elements used in
electronics, where it is important that land-based sources should face
competition from potential sources on the deep sea bed. Such an amount
of previously untapped wealth can create vital jobs for the British
economy, not only in deep sea mining but in the supply chain supporting
the industry, such as the engineers developing machines to harvest
polymetallic nodules in an environmentally sensitive
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000029">As

the money will come from following the loss of the short-selling case
at the European Court of Justice. Will it come from estimates or
otherwise? The Government are now obliged to pay all the costs and,

welcome sign of my party’s commitment on this important issue. I

will not repeat what I said last year, but I want to talk briefly about
the first two clauses. Clause 1, which would amend the Criminal Justice
Act 2003—the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) has already
mentioned criminal justice—simply says that an assault on a
member of the armed forces or their family that is motivated by their
service to our country should be treated as an aggravated
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0001.htm#14012436000054">The
House will recall that the noble Lord Ashcroft, who I suspect is in the
other place—I understand that a minor issue is being considered
at that end of the Building—carried out a survey, with the
support of the Ministry of Defence, of some 9,000 serving personnel
across the three armed forces in 2012. Some quite astonishing and, dare
I say, horrific figures came out of that survey. About 5% of members of
our armed forces reported that they or their family had suffered
physical or attempted physical assault during the previous five years,
while 18% or 19% of them reported that they had been the victim of
verbal abuse in that period. I am sure we can all think of the type of
abuse that, regrettably, is hurled by a mindless minority at members of
our armed forces, and I will cite one example that my hon. Friend the
Member for Gedling might also refer to.</hs_Para>

ago the Royal Anglian regiment came back, I think in 2010, for its
homecoming parade, and an extremist organisation called Muslims Against
Crusades organised an attack on that parade, which I think crossed the
line between free speech and intimidation. The survey by Lord Ashcroft
also reported that almost one in five members of the armed forces have
been refused service in shops, pubs and clubs for being members of the
armed forces, and clause 2 of the Bill covers that
issue.</hs_Para>

uniform, which I think is outrageous. It is only a few years since the
armed forces have started to wear a uniform again. I remember when they
were encouraged not to wear their uniforms in Northern Ireland, and it
is welcome for the point to be clarified. People should not verbally

I want to mention one specific case. A young soldier from
Bolton—coincidentally, he was also called Lee—phoned in
to a Radio 5 Live programme on the morning of the BBC’s day of
coverage on the issue. He said that he had returned from a tour in
Afghanistan for a couple of weeks of well-deserved rest and
recuperation and to see his family. It was the first time in three
months that he had been home from deployment. He got off the train at
Bolton quite late on the Saturday evening. He was in his uniform and
had his bags with him. He was set upon by four or five drunken yobs.
When the police caught them, the reason they gave for the assault was
that they wanted to prove “how hard they were”. Those
five brave yobs had attacked one soldier going about his business,
having returned from service. I hope that answers, to an extent, the
question the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)

how hard they are is certainly not in the same category as the
appalling murder of Drummer Rigby, or indeed in the same category as
discrimination. I know that I am a lawyer, but those are different
jurisprudential matters and there is a real danger, especially with
this type of legislation, of confusing the issues. I will explain that
later in my speech, but I wanted to set the record straight that I was
not shaking my head for the reason that was alleged, but because I

contacted me, particularly since the summer. Indeed, there are people
in the House service who have told me only this week how delighted they
are to see the Bill coming forward. It is about sending a clear signal
that we stand with those who risk their lives for our country to
protect our freedoms and that it is unacceptable to attack, physically
or verbally, a member of the armed forces because of that

to try to take the Minister’s argument apart just yet—I
will hear what she has to say first—but I suspect that on this
occasion the Ministry of Defence, building on her point, will say that
it is very difficult to look into somebody’s mind. With the
greatest respect to her, this is an amendment to an existing criminal
justice Act. Actually, the hon. Member for Shipley makes a valid point
about this being a criminal justice matter. If the Minister wishes to
go to the Library and get out the <I>Hansard</I> report from 2003, she
will see that the debate was had then about how in principle to go
about determining the motivation. The key point is that the Bill is a
simple amendment of that existing principle. The Minister—and I
forgive her for being a lawyer, as I am sure the whole House
does—knows that it is the job of lawyers to prosecute and make
their case. It will be a matter for the Crown Prosecution Service to
set out why the motivating factor was the fact that the victim was in
uniform rather than a general disagreement or some other
factor.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_24_PT_1/CFF4D90A883CE945D65EDC205778A1EB74AE39AE" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 January 2014">Friday

Docherty:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman leads me on to the point that
I was about to make. I have mentioned physical assault already, but
clause 2 would extend the prohibition on discrimination to what are
colloquially called “trade and sales” issues. For
example, a pub, restaurant or shop cannot refuse to serve a member of
the armed forces simply because they are a member of the armed forces.
Again, this is not about whether it is possible for lawyers to make a
case on motivation, because the clause would amend an existing Act, on
which very smart lawyers have already built cases successfully. This is
a debate about whether the principle should be extended.</hs_Para>

Lord Ashcroft, carried out with Ministry of Defence support, reported
the problem, but I also have two specific examples that happened
relatively  
<?notus-xml column=599?>recently. The first was in Edinburgh, so not far from my constituency.
The warship HMS Edinburgh was in dock in Leith to
receive the freedom of the city in a civic ceremony at the city
chambers. At the end of the ceremony, a group of crew members, in their
dress uniforms, visited a pub called the Ensign Ewart. I do not know
whether you are familiar with that pub from your visits to Edinburgh,

young sailors, in their dress uniforms, visited that pub in the middle
of the day having just received the freedom of the city. The irony that
the pub is named after one of the heroes of the Napoleonic conflicts is
not lost on me, and I am sure that the House can guess what happened
next: the landlord refused to serve them because they were members of
the Royal Navy. The city council and most people in Edinburgh were
indignant. The <I>Edinburgh Evening News</I>, the local daily
newspaper, ran a huge campaign saying it was absolutely ridiculous and
an embarrassment to Scottish hospitality, which I know the hon. Member
for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) enjoyed a few years ago in
central Fife. That is one good example of the ridiculousness of the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Rory Stewart" PimsId="5667" UID="14012436000378" xid="1225" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000378">Rory

which is an absurd argument to put forward. I am sure that the Minister
and I will agree that there is no reason to expect that men and women
who are proud to be wearing their uniform at a civic event will cause
trouble. The Bill is narrowly drawn—I am grateful to the
redoubtable Kate Emms for her assistance, as ever, in drafting
it—and very clear: it would amend existing legislation. Under
the Equality Act 2010, a publican can still turn down somebody if they
are drunk or if they have a genuine reason to believe they are likely
to cause disruption. I stress, again, that this is not a debate about
whether there should be exemptions under the 2010 Act, but whether
those exemptions should be extended to cover members of the armed

owner, publican or restaurateur to turn down someone’s custom if

“Would the Crown Prosecution Service have an ability to
demonstrate this in the courts?” That is already covered in the

Stewart</B> (Penrith and The Border) (Con):</Member> I congratulate the
hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty) on
introducing a Bill that obviously reflects a deep intuition, a deep
sense of respect for the military, and a deep desire to show the public
admiration for the military for the service they provide and the
sacrifices they make. So I begin by acknowledging that the Bill has
been introduced with the best of intentions and to reflect that public
respect.</hs_Para>

to say that discrimination legislation can, in the right place and at
the right time, make a very useful contribution to society. It can be
difficult, is often controversial, and has been a huge problem over the
last 50 or 60 years, but, in the right place and at the right time,
discrimination legislation can be hugely important. However, what I
hope briefly to say is that unfortunately I do not believe,
notwithstanding the hon. Gentleman’s good intentions and the
importance of showing respect for the military, that discrimination
legislation is the correct way of addressing this problem.</hs_Para>

three reasons why: the first is to do with the inherent nature of
discrimination legislation; the second is to do with the other forms of
policy measures we can take to support the military and veterans
without having to invoke discrimination legislation; and the third is
the more complex and deeper issue of the kinds of values and attitudes
that would be encouraged by introducing discrimination legislation, in
particular the fact that it would begin to portray soldiers and
veterans in the guise of victims, which would be very dangerous for our
public policy relationship with the military in
general.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000111">There
are four major issues around discrimination legislation that need to be
addressed, notwithstanding the fact that discrimination legislation has
been useful. The first of them is the complexity of discrimination
legislation. It is extremely difficult and complex to operate. We get
in trouble with it all the time in the courts on any number of issues.
The second is the problem of futility: the number of cases in which
discrimination legislation actually turns out to be futile because it
does not address the problem concerned. 
<?notus-xml column=603?>The third is the problem of perversity: the way in which
discrimination legislation of the wrong sort can in fact have a
negative impact on a whole series of elements in society. The fourth is
what I call the problem of jeopardy: the way in which discrimination
legislation can in fact rebound on the very group it is attempting to
protect and actually increase
prejudice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000112">This
is not an argument against discrimination legislation in general. It is
simply an argument that it should be done only in the most specialised
and careful circumstances. Discrimination legislation in general,
although controversial, has been hugely successful. Probably one of the
greatest contributions our society has made—one of the things I
hope we will be remembered for in the future—is the introduction
of legislation protecting people on the grounds of race, gender,
disability and age. We must remember that that is not a small thing.
There was a time in this country when it was legal for a landlady of a
bed and breakfast to put up a sign saying, “No blacks
admitted”; when women in this country could be paid
three-quarters of the amount that men were paid; and when so-called
public bars could exclude people on the basis of their gender or race
and were not open to them.</hs_Para>

Hoffmann said in justifying discrimination legislation, the basic idea
that similar cases should be treated in a similar fashion and that
different cases should be treated differently is a basic axiom of
rationality. It is based on two fundamental principles: the fundamental
principle of equality, which is the idea that people should be treated
as ends and not means to ends; and the fundamental principle of
rationality, which is that only relevant characteristics should decide
how somebody is treated. However, the problem is that although we have
made huge progress in those areas, legislation is a last resort. It is
an incredibly complex and frequently counter-productive form of law to
introduce, so much so that it should be limited to cases only where
there is such a deep-seated prejudice extended over so many centuries
that there is no alternative measure open to us. If we were to
introduce such legislation in relation to the armed forces, we would
have to go through a legal nightmare over the succeeding decades in
trying to work our way through such
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000114">Broadly
speaking, discrimination legislation—I am not a lawyer—is
based on five grounds. We need to determine the ambit of the
legislation; the prescribed ground of the legislation; that unequal
treatment has taken place; an analogous situation; and exactly what the
justification is. The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife will
point out that, in relation to the armed forces, at least three of
those measures are relatively straightforward, including the ambit of
the definition in the case of the armed forces. In other words, is this
discrimination in employment or in private life? The prescribed grounds
in this case could be, although this will be more difficult to define,
in relation to gender or disability, and they involve a relatively
straightforward determination of what somebody’s gender is or
what their ethnic background is. He could argue that it should be
reasonably straightforward to determine whether or not someone is a
member of the armed forces or has served in the armed forces. Unequal
treatment requires the definition that this individual who comes from
these particular prescribed grounds and operates in this particular 
<?notus-xml column=604?>ambit has been treated unlike someone else would have been treated
in—and this is the fourth
condition—an analogous situation and, fifthly, that that is
unjustified.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000115">We
can all see again and again—we only have to open a copy of any
newspaper—that hard cases and bad law have led to a situation in
which discrimination legislation appears to go in the face of what has
been normal practice. Hard cases will emerge again and again, and we
have seen it. We can see it in things that everybody will have
discussed in this House over the years. I am talking about, for
example, whether or not it is possible for a Church of England school
or a Jewish school to discriminate on the basis of religion; for a
single-sex school to discriminate on the basis of gender; or for the
police or the immigration authorities to discriminate on the basis of
Roma ethnicity—that was a Supreme Court judgment. If we were to
define the armed forces as one of those categories, a whole series of
cases would begin to emerge in case law in which anybody who served in
the armed forces or was a veteran of the armed forces would begin to be
able to claim discrimination in everything from education through to
employment. Importantly, it would not be possible simply to limit
discrimination legislation—we would be struck down in
Strasbourg—to admission to a public
house.</hs_Para>

the Equality Act 2010 are flawed. Will he be clear that what he is
referring to is not the principle of discrimination law? As I
understand it, his problem is that he does not think that those laws
should be extended to our armed forces. Is that his central
argument?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000117"><B><Member ContinuationText="Rory Stewart" PimsId="5667" UID="14012436000400" xid="1225" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000400">Rory
Stewart:</Member></B> My central argument is that a general protection
exists for all citizens. The general principle that we do not create
special categories of citizens is central to our notion of equality. We
should only create special categories of citizens in the most extreme
hard cases. My argument, to get to the nub of it, is that there have
been over the centuries such extreme examples of sexism, chauvinism and
discrimination on the basis of disability that despite the general
principle of equality, and despite our general objection to special
treatment, there are certain categories where that difficult decision
has been correctly made, landing us in a nightmare of complexity but
done for the public good. Including an individual’s occupation
among the prescribed grounds for discrimination would be a very serious
error and would open the floodgates to huge
complexity.</hs_Para>

Docherty:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman must have heard my opening
remarks, in which I said that the statistics from the noble Lord
Ashcroft, produced with the support of the Ministry of Defence in the
largest ever study of attitudes to and within the three services, show
that one in five members of the armed forces has been refused service
and one in four has been the victim of physical or verbal assault. If
the hon. Gentleman can point out to me another example of a type of
employment where that goes on, I want to hear it. Otherwise, I fear

Stewart:</Member></B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, that is not
exactly the point I am making. I do not deny that members of the armed
forces can be treated unfairly, 
<?notus-xml column=605?>nor do I deny that because they are going somewhere in uniform they are
likely to be identified as a special category and
treated unfairly as such. My argument is based not on the notion that
there are no examples of unfair treatment but on the general assumption
that expanding discrimination legislation is a very dangerous thing for
this House to do. It is not simply that as a Conservative I feel that
we already produce too much legislation and that we feel the effects of
excessive legislation, but that extending discrimination legislation,
in particular, should be done only in the most extreme
situations.</hs_Para>

Stewart:</Member></B> A whole body of case law exists exactly to
resolve such issues of discrimination of any sort that we have not to
date felt a need to resolve. Discrimination can already happen in the
United Kingdom against people who are not in protected categories. It
is possible, for example, to take legal redress as a white male former
member of the armed forces. My hon. Friend himself would be able to
seek legal redress in many situations in which he felt that he had been
unfairly treated. The particular question of the rights of publicans to
admit or not admit people into their establishments is another area of
case law.</hs_Para>

question for the Edinburgh courts; it is not for me to determine what
the publican did. My sense, as regards the publican’s right to
do what he did, is that in this case the publican’s argument was
not the argument that the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife has
suggested; the publican’s argument was not that he believed that
the people in uniform were going to cause trouble, but that he had had
a lot of experience of the other people in the pub causing trouble and
attacking people in uniform when they came in. In other words, he
believed that it was an exacerbating factor and he was in no way
criticising the people in uniform. He was trying to protect against
violence breaking out in his pub on the basis of experience of that
happening in the past. Unless the hon. Gentleman has a deep
understanding of exactly how much violence has happened in that pub and
why the publican, who would have an interest in trying to generate
income from alcohol sales, excluded those people, it would be difficult
to judge in this

that is not my point. My point is a bigger one about the kinds of
things for which we introduce discrimination legislation. Hard cases
make bad law. It would be unfortunate if what happened in a single pub
in Edinburgh, or indeed many scores of times up and down this country,
were to lead to the introduction of something almost unprecedented: to
add, suddenly and out of nowhere, an entirely new category based
on occupation to the broad categories of inherited
characteristics—gender, race, sexuality, age and disability.
That could be the beginning of something that all of us in the House
would regret.</hs_Para>

additional points: futility in legislation; jeopardy in legislation;
and counter-productive legislation.</hs_Para>

about futility in legislation, particularly in relation to
discrimination, I mean whether introducing this form of discrimination
legislation would address the basic problem. Criticisms have been made
of all discrimination legislation during the last 40 years; it has
frequently been said that the law may not be the best way to address
deep-seated cultural prejudices or inherited attitudes.</hs_Para>

concrete. Addressing discrimination against the armed forces should be
attempted in the first place through policy, by ensuring that the
correct social attitudes are promoted in schools and through how
Government and public policy makers talk about the armed forces, so
that we address exactly what the prejudices are. If there is an
existing prejudice that members of the armed forces have certain
characteristics, it is incumbent on the many armed forces
charities—wealthy and well-supported charities, which enjoy a
huge groundswell of positive public opinion—and the Ministry of
Defence, as well as the regimental associations, to try to establish
what those prejudices are and to address them.</hs_Para>

point is about jeopardy. Introducing new discrimination legislation
imposes a huge element of cost. That cost was justified in relation to
gender, race, disability, sexuality and age. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman
would like to consider the costs of legislation to deal with employment
discrimination. He would need to reflect on the exact implications for
a small or medium-sized business that employed somebody from the armed
services, and for the human resources department of a company that did
the same.</hs_Para>

me expand on this a little for the hon. Gentleman. This is a question
of proscribed grounds for discrimination, which is one of the five
aspects of discrimination legislation that I set out. One needs to ask
what the proscribed ground for discrimination is, and the Bill would
add to gender, sexuality and disability the ground of occupation in the
military. If the law accepts philosophically that there is an
additional category in the proscribed grounds for discrimination, it
would not be possible—no judge would consider this
possible—to limit that simply to the provision of hospitality
and not extend it to employment law, because the precedent of a
proscribed ground of occupation would have been
created.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000139"><B><Member ContinuationText="Thomas Docherty" PimsId="5686" UID="14012436000412" xid="1052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000412">Thomas

during our consideration of the Defence Reform Bill, when I think that
the Minister was a member of the Defence team. That Bill includes
measures on employment discrimination, but things have not gone the
other way. The Ministry of Defence is confident that the Bill’s
measures on anti-reservist discrimination will not roll on in the way
the hon. Gentleman describes. Additionally, the Scottish Parliament is
working on measures regarding the assault of NHS employees, but it is
confident that they will not fall foul of the Strasbourg Court. The
hon. Gentleman’s argument does not hold up because there is

Stewart:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. May I
perhaps make a little progress? Some of what the hon. Gentleman wishes
to achieve could be achieved without discrimination legislation.
Without getting into all the arguments on the appropriate ambit of
legislation, unequal treatment, analogous circumstances, justification
and prescribed categories, many other things could be done to achieve
the same objectives. Importantly for the House, there is a fundamental
distinction between what can be addressed through discrimination law
and what can be addressed through sensitivity to context and culture.
Saying that we do not wish to create a special category of soldiers or
veterans who are treated differently from other citizens is not the
same as saying that the House cannot come up with any policies that
might provide more support for soldiers and veterans, that acknowledge
the obligations that we owe them and the unique service they have
performed, and that find concrete ways to help
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000146">I
shall give an example that might interest the hon. Gentleman. Without
introducing discrimination legislation, it is possible—the hon.
Member for Barnsley Central (Dan Jarvis), the shadow justice spokesman,
has proposed this—to consider ways of working with military
personnel and veterans in the criminal justice system without defining
a proscribed category of discrimination. It might involve,
for example, ensuring that a police officer is aware that someone they
have arrested has served in the armed forces, not so that the police
officer could give them lax or special treatment, or because they
should somehow be immune from prosecution, but because awareness of
their context or background could lead to more constructive engagement
between them and the 
<?notus-xml column=609?>police officer. The same could be true in the prison system, with
military mentors working with prisoners with a military background, so
that they may be able to develop a more constructive rehabilitation
programme. If the probation service paired ex-military probation
officers with ex-military released prisoners, that might radically
reduce the chance of reoffending. For example, in Buffalo, New York,
where such a system has been applied, reoffending rates among veterans
and soldiers have dropped to 0%, and across the United States the rate
has dropped to 20%. That is not discrimination legislation or special
treatment; it is an understanding of the
context.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000147">I
appear to be losing the attention of the hon. Member for Dunfermline
and West Fife so I will move on to the final stage of my speech. We
need to be careful about discrimination legislation for a third, more
difficult reason, which is that—I appeal to my hon. Friend the
Minister here—we should not begin to have an unrealistic
attitude to our relationship with the armed forces. We must balance
carefully showing respect for people’s sacrifice and service
with realism. We cannot begin to create a sentimental context in which,
through special treatment, by which I mean treatment that is not
justified on the basis of people’s service or sacrifice, it is
not possible for us to engage realistically with the military. What do
I mean by that? This is important: the danger of this discrimination
legislation, apart from the problems of complexity, futility and
jeopardy, and apart from the fact that we have alternative policy
solutions, is that it reflects a cultural attitude that, though
understandable and admirable, is sometimes in danger of portraying
soldiers and veterans as victims.</hs_Para>

words, there is a danger of sentimentalising soldiers and believing
that they need to be treated with kid gloves. More
dangerous—this is particularly relevant in relation to how we
deal with policy in Afghanistan and Iraq—is the idea that we
should not criticise the armed forces and that they need such special
treatment as to affect the job of this House, which is often to hold
soldiers and generals vigorously and aggressively to account, to
disagree with the policies that they propose, and sometimes to make an
even more difficult decision to withdraw soldiers from combat
notwithstanding the fact that there will be a huge public outcry
demanding to know whether soldiers have died in vain. Putting forward
soldiers as victims and talking about their sufferings can become very
dangerous for the soldiers themselves and for the public policy
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000149">What
we need, and what I am afraid this Bill goes against, is a realistic,
respectful attitude towards the armed forces—not an attitude
that treats them with kid gloves or suggests that they are suffering
the form of discrimination from which minority ethnic groups, disabled
groups and women in this country have suffered, but one that recognises
their sacrifice and recognises that it can often be difficult to be a
soldier or a veteran. It is an attitude that puts in place concrete,
plausible policies—for example, in the criminal justice
system—to help soldiers and veterans as they reintegrate into
society; shows, through the forces charities, memorial days, poppy
collections, the media, documentaries and the things that are said in
this House, our immense admiration for the armed forces; and continues
to improve this country’s cultural attitudes towards the armed
forces, which, incidentally, have never been so positive. This is not
the

armed forces, as shown in every opinion poll, now constitute one of the

this legislation is exactly the wrong thing to do. It would prove to be
a nightmare for us, opening the door to the introduction of other
special occupational categories and involving us in complexity,

sentimentalising of soldiers that also uses them as a means to a
political end, and that it is an attempt to portray them as victims
when they are in fact autonomous, independent, confident individuals
capable of holding their own with anyone else in society. If they
require special treatment from this House, it is not through
anti-discrimination legislation but concrete, small, focused measures
that can easily be introduced by the Ministry of Defence and the

necessary not only to promote the sort of cultural change that he
talked about, but to legislate to give effect to it. That is what this
debate boils down to. We all agree that we can change practice through
education, debate and encouraging people to reflect on their attitudes.
We tell people, “It is wrong for you to act in this way,”
in the hope that social pressure will change how they
behave.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000157">In
my view, the majority of people respect members of the armed forces

that of the hon. Gentleman—sometimes educational policy and
cultural change alone are not sufficient and need legislation to back
them up and to lead society in the direction we want it to go. That is
what the Bill does, in a narrow way. As the hon. Member for Beckenham

that was most reflected in the record attendances at the recent
Remembrance day services. The turnout—if that is the appropriate
word; perhaps “attendance” is better—including by
very young people who understood the significance of what was
happening, was a fantastic tribute to them all and spoke well of our
society and communities. The coming together of people to reflect on
services done and duties that will be done gave an opportunity for them

Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) has just said? Sending a signal is a
strange reason to introduce a highly complex form of discrimination
legislation. Nobody in this House would disagree in any way that we
should show immense respect for the military and do all we can
culturally to enhance that. Does the hon. Gentleman agree, however,
that discrimination legislation must be introduced on much more
detailed and serious grounds than simply being a symbolic act that
sends a
signal?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000171"><B><Member ContinuationText="Vernon Coaker" PimsId="2647" UID="14012436000428" xid="122" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000428">Vernon
Coaker:</Member></B> Like the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) I
both agree and disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Of course we should
not introduce this measure just as a way of sending a signal, and we
must have a reason for doing it other than symbolic purposes. In a
minute, however, I will come to some of the evidence we have seen and
why I think this is more than a symbolic gesture—yes, I regard
this as a sign, but it is also necessary. That is where I and the hon.
Member for Beckenham disagree with the hon. Member for Penrith and The
Border. The issue is not about the regard in which anybody holds the
troops, or any such thing; it is just a disagreement about how best to
take forward the issue and deal with some of the things that we know
occur.</hs_Para>

introduce this Bill in 2008. They did not, but it is fair to say that
we all sometimes reflect on decisions that we did or did not make.
After the past two or three years, and particularly after the evidence
provided by Lord Ashcroft, we must clearly reflect on whether, in the
light of new evidence, we should continue to hold our current position.
The 2012 report, “The Armed Forces &amp; Society”,
described worrying incidents of verbal and physical abuse, and we must
therefore reflect on that and consider whether further legislation is
necessary.</hs_Para>

that is a reason for not extending it further. Precisely because of the

extending the discrimination legislation to allow an assault against a
member of the armed forces because they are a member of the armed
forces to be an aggravated offence. Of course, if we have
anti-discrimination legislation, that does not mean—this might
answer the point about being in a pub—that all the other laws
that normally apply to people would not apply. For example, if somebody
breaks the law by being drunk and disorderly, by fighting or by
stealing, of course other laws apply, but we are specifically dealing
with people being discriminated against simply because they are members

Stewart:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again;
he is being very generous. On the specific question of aggravating
circumstances with regard to violent assault, it is difficult to
understand how the hon. Gentleman would propose to limit it simply to
members of the armed forces. It would be relatively easy for the House,
and indeed for any judges or campaigners, to think of many other cases
in which there could be an aggravated assault against an individual on
the basis of their occupation, for example against a train conductor
because they are an employee of a railway company, or against an
individual because of their relationship to some aspect of the
emergency services. Given that he is arguing that this extension to the
armed forces would not open a floodgate of precedents for its
application to many other restricted occupations, how does he expect to
limit it and ensure that many other categories of aggravated assault
will not be introduced as a result?</hs_Para>

protect employees of train companies under existing legislation. If a
conductor on a train is assaulted, they are protected under the
legislation that also protects a soldier from being assaulted. But once

people from being assaulted. The point that we are making is that

either that members of the armed forces—he gave
examples—have faced discrimination for being members of the

attack on or discrimination against service personnel based simply on

we follow the hon. Gentleman’s logic, however, we could name all
sorts of categories of people who might say that their category has

already protected characteristics that my hon. Friend the Member for

they had been discriminated against in the workplace because they were
bald, fat or had ginger hair, or for all sorts of other reasons. I am
sure that the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife accepts that
many people in those categories have said that from time to time they
have faced discrimination that has been totally unfair, without merit

that we could go somewhat further. We have probably all come across
evidence of people working in jobcentres who have faced terrible abuse
because they have had to turn someone down for a benefit. As I have
said, we all appreciate the work done by our armed forces, but I
struggle to understand why attacking someone for being a member of the
armed forces—bad though that is—should necessarily be
considered any worse than attacking someone simply for being a member

that there is a slight irony in the Bill and I want to highlight it.
Clause 2, on the prohibition of discrimination, is designed to ensure
that members of the armed forces are treated equally with everybody
else in the country. It is a perfectly laudable aim that people should
be treated equally. It is one that I agree with. However, clause 1
tries to ensure that members of the armed forces are not treated
equally compared with everybody else, but that in some respects they
should be treated differently from other people in the eyes of the law.
I have always thought that an essential tenet of the law is that
everybody is equal in the face of it. I think that should apply to
victims as well as people who commit crimes. We should not be trying to
separate out different categories of people. We should look at the
offence committed and prosecute people based on the seriousness of the
offence, and the victim should be treated equally whoever the victim
happens to be, based on what happened to them. When we start trying to
pick and choose and say attacks on one category of people are more
serious than those on another, we are going down a dangerous
road.</hs_Para>

protections. Also, what he does not refer to in making that point is
that this Bill’s reach goes way beyond people who are currently
in service. It talks about people who have been in service. It also
talks about relatives of people who are in service, and the
Bill’s definition of a relative specifies that it “shall
mean any relative.” We are not even talking about parents or
siblings, therefore; we are talking about any relative no matter how
distant they may be. I am not entirely sure on what basis my hon.
Friend thinks they should be protected compared with everybody else. I
see absolutely no justification for that, yet there it is on the face
of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman has made a special case for any
relative, which I think goes way beyond what even my hon. Friend
believes is reasonable. It worries me that what the hon. Gentleman is
doing is trying to send a signal—make a political
point—rather than provide a serious basis for what the law of
the land should
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000216">I
want to make a couple of other brief points, explaining how I think the
hon. Gentleman would be better served. First, offences against people
in the public sector and in public service is already an aggravating
factor in the law. Given the Minister’s background, she will
know all about that. The sentencing guidelines on assault, for example,
have as an aggravating factor an offence committed</hs_Para>

public.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14012436000217" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000217">Given
that that is already in the sentencing guidelines, I am not entirely
sure why we need a new law. Judges can take that into account as an
aggravating factor when it comes to passing sentence. On that basis
alone, the Bill is
unnecessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000218">There
is a great irony. Although it is not like me to get party political
about such matters, I have to say that the hon. Gentleman represents a
party which, when it was in government, introduced a law that insisted
that people who were sent to prison had to be released—not had
to be eligible for release—halfway through their sentence
irrespective of the crime they had committed. The shadow Minister was
part of that Government and so is more culpable in that
matter.</hs_Para>

is aimed at people who commit assaults and attacks on members of the
armed forces, it would be far better and more productive if the hon.
Gentleman 
<?notus-xml column=621?>were to work to scrap that law passed under the previous Labour
Government, to ensure that when people are sent to prison they serve in
full the sentence handed down by the courts. That would ensure that
those people whom he wants to see spend longer in prison actually do
spend longer in prison. If he wants to go down that line, it would be
far more productive if we ensured that everybody served their sentence
in full.</hs_Para>

the country was absolutely horrified at what happened to Drummer Lee
Rigby. I am not sure whether that was what prompted the hon. Gentleman
to introduce this Bill. The Government have already changed the law in
relation to those who are convicted of the murder of transsexuals and
people with disability. The starting point for their life sentence and
the minimum sentence they should serve has gone up. If that is what he
wanted to do—to make the starting point for a conviction for the
murder of a member of the armed forces 30 years as it is for those
other hate crimes where a murder is involved—he should have
tried to ensure that we rejected the ruling of the European Court of
Human Rights on life sentences and followed the line that if someone is
sentenced to life in prison for murder, they serve the rest of their
life in prison.</hs_Para>

Gentleman really wants people who are committing those particular
offences to serve the time in prison that we all want them to serve, it
would be far better to ensure that life means life and that prisoners
serve their sentences in full. That would achieve what both he and I
want, which is for serious offenders to be treated properly no matter
who the victim is. That would suit the people in the armed forces who
are victims of these crimes; they would see that justice had been
done.</hs_Para>

can all agree with the sentiment behind the Bill—that we should
support our armed forces and that we think any attack on them or
discrimination against them is unjustifiable and unnecessary—I,
like my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border, think that
passing a Bill to send a signal is not what this House should do. On
that basis, I cannot support it. I hope that the Minister will come
down on the side of my hon. Friend and me, and not think that this Bill
is the right vehicle with which to
proceed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_24_PT_1/4C8FC16A2B1868159F687694F177461105C723EA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 January 2014">Friday

Like the hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker), I thank and

observation that this has been a very good debate. In particular, let
me single out my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border
(Rory Stewart), who made one of the best speeches that I have had the
pleasure of hearing in this place. He said that he was not a lawyer,
but he spoke with all the jurisprudential knowledge and understanding
of one. I fully endorse all that he said but, if I may, let me make
only one criticism. Every time he said soldier, I would add,
“sailor, airman or airwoman” to reflect all members of
our armed forces.</hs_Para>

with my hon. Friend, however, about what he would call the downside of
those great Acts of Parliament that have sought to end discrimination

<?notus-xml column=622?>our country. The Race Relations Acts and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975
are huge achievements that have changed our society. I was brought up
in Worksop and I well remember what it was like when I was a child. I

said “No blacks.” It is inconceivable. My children cannot

enough—was that that legislation has, of course, been one of the
great achievements of our age and something of which we should be proud
as a civilisation but it was also cumbersome, difficult, sometimes
futile and sometimes perverse and should therefore not be extended too
widely. As an achievement, it has been extraordinary. The change to
cultural attitudes is something of which we should be deeply
proud.</hs_Para>

in our society in the UK that is being suggested, I would not hesitate

Soubry:</Member></B> I shall deal with the Ashcroft study in a moment,
but let me make it absolutely clear that I listen to any arguments that
are made. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that there
is no clamour at my door at all. My understanding is that there is no
demand among our armed forces for such legislation. I understand that
we disagree, but let me explain one important point. My hon. Friend the
Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) made an extremely important point
about the law and protections that already exist. It is incredibly
important that we remember that. Of course, an assault is an assault,
and where the police believe that there is evidence to support a
charge, they charge, and in due course the Crown Prosecution Service
considers the evidence and decides whether to proceed to a full court
hearing.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Gedling that the CPS’s own documentation makes
it clear that the CPS has a duty, when it believes that there has been
an assault on somebody because of their public service, to bring
forward a prosecution and to do everything it can to ensure that that
prosecution is successful. In its code of practice, the CPS recognises
that it should pursue prosecutions for assaults on public
servants.</hs_Para>

reflected in the sentencing guidelines, which my hon. Friend the Member
for Shipley has already referred to. Perhaps this point is not
understood widely and I hope to ensure that people understand it: when
a judge considers sentencing, they consider the mitigating features
that might be advanced on behalf of the defendant and then the
aggravating features that might be advanced by the prosecution. It is
absolutely clear that an offence against those working in the public
sector or providing a service to the public is an aggravating feature.
That means that, if the custodial threshold is passed, any sentence of
imprisonment is automatically increased by the judge.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Shipley has already made the point about people
working, for example, in jobcentres or accident and emergency units,
including nurses and security staff, who are sometimes assaulted.
Indeed, there was a spate of assaults against nurses and other workers
in A and E units, and the provisions about the aggravating features in
the sentencing guidelines were highlighted, so that judges were left
under no illusion whatever that if someone assaults an individual
purely because of their public service—including, of course,
members of our armed forces—that is a seriously aggravating
feature.</hs_Para>

that should not cloud our minds into seeing people in our armed forces

based on a survey of about 9,000 service personnel that was conducted

to see you in the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to have
secured this debate, which I asked for after Dan Henderson, a
constituent and National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers
local representative at Caledonian MacBrayne ferries, visited one of my
constituency surgeries. He highlighted CalMac’s positive work in
my constituency, such as the apprenticeship scheme that it is now
running after two years of very hard work by the RMT, the Scottish
Trades Union Congress, Scottish Union Learning, Skills Development
Scotland, the Maritime Skills Alliance and CalMac. I am a member of the
RMT parliamentary group, which is perhaps partly why Dan Henderson came
to my surgery. I thank the RMT, particularly Dan Crimes at its head
office, for the briefing it has provided for this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000294">The
work of unions such as the RMT with CalMac resulted in CalMac
successfully offering 10 apprenticeships, including to two of my
constituents who are aspiring seafarers. The 10 places were hugely
oversubscribed, with over 1,000 applications received, testifying to
the high level of interest in these opportunities, particularly among
young unemployed people in Scotland. This exposes the myth that is
often peddled in the shipping industry that no one in the UK wishes to
go to sea as a rating any
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000295"><Member ContinuationText="Mr David Hamilton" PimsId="3725" UID="14012436000484" xid="249" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000484"><B>Mr

must be congratulated on leading the way in taking on the 10 trainee
ratings. I hope that this is the first of many new intakes into the
industry in Scotland. The 10 apprenticeships started with a course at
South Tyneside college last October. CalMac has committed itself to
training 10 ratings through the Scottish apprenticeship route in the
year to 2015-16 and to recruiting 45 officer cadets during the same
period. CalMac has invested over £7 million in seafarers’
training in the six years to 2012-13, and that must bode well for it
when the Clyde and Hebrides ferry service contract is re-tendered,
which we expect to happen in 2016. The Scottish Government claim that
EU law obliges them to re-tender these lifeline ferry services. That is
of particular concern in my constituency, where we have five harbours
with ferry services—Ardrossan, Brodick, Lochranza, Largs and
Cumbrae—and where CalMac operates lifeline passenger and freight
ferry services for island communities to and from the
mainland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000298">One
of the problems that CalMac and other companies have had is that none
of the six Scottish colleges named as partners in the modern
apprenticeship framework was able to offer maritime occupations
training in Scotland. Indeed, they were unable to offer anything,
despite 
<?notus-xml column=629?>being named by the Scottish Government as the appropriate providers.
Therefore, South Tyneside college, which is not a named provider, is
offering training for the apprenticeships, which are designed and
accredited in Scotland. Even after extensive representations about this
issue, the only colleges that the Scottish Government say can give
accreditation are Orkney and Shetland. Anyone who knows the part of the
world that I represent will appreciate that those colleges are a very
long way from my constituency and, indeed, a very long way from where a
lot of people in Scotland
live.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000299">The
UK Government could usefully engage with the Scottish Government over
this. The Maritime Skills Alliance, although it sets the standards, is
not formally recognised as the sector skills council for the maritime
industry in Scotland. The recommendation of the Richard review
commissioned by the UK Government was to abolish the frameworks for
apprenticeships in individual industries, and it is believed that this
is causing problems regarding the adoption of a collaborative approach
between the two Administrations. I ask the Minister to try to see how
to improve the relationship with the Scottish Government to ensure that
we achieve
results.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000300">The
public sector is clearly leading the way in training the next
generation of seafarers, because CalMac is a public service company,
while the private sector has a sorry tale to tell. However, these
public sector apprenticeships in Scotland took far too long to
achieve—and of course, if I may say so, they are a drop in the
ocean. They will not make the contribution to recruiting the next
generation of seafarers to the industry that is needed if we are to
avoid witnessing the catastrophic collapse of the UK maritime skills
base that was forecast in the SMarT—support for maritime
training—review of 2011.</hs_Para>

difficulty have been features of obtaining any maritime apprenticeships
in England. The number of maritime ratings apprenticeships being taken
up throughout the UK is extremely low. The Merchant Navy Training Board
estimates that a maximum of 12 deck and nine engineering
apprentices would enter the industry each year as a result of new
apprenticeships. It estimates that in 2012-13 there were about 20
ratings apprentices and no officer apprentices, which is extremely
disappointing, given that the apprenticeships were launched in
Parliament in June 2011. The total number of trainee ratings for the
whole of the UK is believed to be about 30, although such data are not
collected by the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000302">To
put those figures in context, in 2012-13 there were 25,700 apprentices
in Scotland and nearly 860,000 in England. One step the Government
could easily take is to start including the number of trainee ratings
in the annual seafarer statistics produced by the Department for
Transport at the end of
January.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000303">The
seafarer statistics show that in 2012 there were 2,160 officer cadets,
which is significantly less than the estimated 3,900—or 1,300
per year—that are needed. The RMT and Nautilus unions are united
in their concern about the future of maritime skills, the falling
number of UK ratings and officers, and the ageing demographic of
seafarers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000304">The
most significant development in UK shipping  in recent years
was, of course, the previous Labour Government’s introduction of
tonnage tax, which led to a significant increase in the number of UK
registered  
<?notus-xml column=630?>ships. Yet, despite that growth in the number of ships and, indeed,
jobs, as well as the mandatory requirement to provide training for
officer cadets, there has been a decline in UK seafarer numbers and the
position of ratings is particularly desperate. The number of jobs on
qualifying ships nearly doubled, but only a couple of hundred of those
jobs went to UK
ratings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000305">The
main reason for that, of course, is the exclusion of seafarers from
employment and equality laws and, in particular, the application of
minimum wage legislation. Stena Line—the biggest employer of UK
seafarers—is systematically undercut by low-cost operators in
the Irish sea who crew their vessels as cheaply as possible by using
loopholes in UK law to recruit Estonians and other non-UK seafarers,
paying them below the minimum
wage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000306">Stena
is abiding by the minimum wage legislation, and in a recent meeting
with the RMT and Nautilus it cited that as a cause of its higher
crewing costs. It is now threatening to adopt the crewing practices of
its low-cost competitors. Essentially, the Government need to apply
their own guidance on paying the minimum wage to seafarers or face a
catastrophic further loss of UK seafarer jobs and further damage to the
UK maritime skills
base.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000307">To
illustrate the problem, Irish Ferries operates passenger services that
pay seafarers wages as low as $4 per hour. Crews live on ships for the
entirety of the four-month contract, with no shore leave. The routes
are from Dublin to Holyhead and Rosslare to Pembroke, and the crews are
largely Estonian. Sea Truck operates freight services and also pays
below the minimum wage at a rate of $6.06 per hour. P&amp;O ferries,
which operates near the area I represent, provides services from Larne
to Cairnryan, Larne to Troon and Dublin to Liverpool, and they also pay
$6.06 per hour in crewing costs. It is vital that the Minister works
with his colleagues in the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills to ensure that the problem is addressed as a matter of
urgency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000308">To
return to apprenticeships, I understand that BIS met the Maritime
Skills Alliance earlier this year about the apprenticeship
trailblazer opportunity, which will supersede all existing
apprenticeships in England, and I understand that there were
discussions about apprenticeships for ratings. Will the Minister update
the House on his Department’s role in those
discussions?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000309">UK
Government policy is to increase the number of UK seafarers through
maritime apprenticeships. At present, as I have shown, such
apprenticeships are practically non-existent. How does the Minister
intend to address that? Will he outline the resources and funding that
the Government are providing to address such challenges, as the
response from the private sector has so far been pitiful? The

is the Minister doing to address the unfair competition, which I have
outlined, that CalMac, Stena and others that employ UK

an island nation, we have a long maritime tradition—from our
Royal Navy and our historic maritime universities to the many museums
that record our maritime history—but shipping is not just part
of our past; it is a vibrant and dynamic part of our present and our
future. It is worth up to £14 billion a year to our economy, and
it is steadily growing, despite increasing competition from abroad. The
maritime sector provides employment for about 250,000 people; 95% of
goods by volume entering and leaving this country are handled by our
ports; and London remains the largest maritime centre for professional,
business and financial services in the world. The maritime industry is
vital to many areas of the UK, not least Scotland, as the hon. Lady is
well aware, and my  own county of Yorkshire—indeed,
shipbuilding still happens in Whitby, the home of Captain Cook, in my
constituency—both of which have contributed to the success of
our shipping industry. In fact, gross tonnage has more than trebled on
the UK shipping register in the past
decade.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000316">If
the sector is to carry on thriving and to build on its position as a
global maritime leader, it needs to attract a new generation of
seafarers. Historically, there has been a decline in the number of UK
seafarers, as the hon. Lady said, so the Government have made it a
priority to train seafarers to the highest standards to help reverse
that decline. Maritime training is of particular importance to the
Government. There will be a substantive item about it at the next

the Merchant Navy Training Board, the Maritime Training Trust, the

requires each shipping company to recruit and train one officer trainee

That proposal is currently being given serious consideration by
Ministers. Tonnage tax has been particularly successful in creating a

investment to this country. It recognises the industry’s need

alternative provisions had to be found on Tyneside. Skills

developing a framework that met the rigorous requirements of our
apprenticeship legislation was quite a challenge and we had to work
hard with the sector to ensure that the framework complied with the
specialised nature of maritime regulations, employment 
<?notus-xml column=633?>and training. Legislation requires that apprentices are employed, but
many trainees in the maritime sector are treated differently from other
apprentices. For example, rather than being employees, share fishermen
take a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of the catch.</hs_Para>

requirements of the convention on  standards of training,
certification and watchkeeping for seafarers, trainee maritime cadets
must be counted as supernumerary and therefore cannot be employed.
Nevertheless, apprenticeship legislation allows exceptions to that
employment requirement in specific circumstances, which are called
alternative completion conditions. Those conditions are set out in
secondary legislation and any additions must be debated in both Houses.
Exceptions are allowed only after thorough consideration. Officials

first set of alternative completion condition regulations came into
force in May 2012 and included occupations within the sea fishing
industry. The regulations were amended following a second round of
debates last July to include apprenticeships within the Merchant Navy.
A robust case for inclusion was made, and it was agreed unanimously for
both levels. However, the need for regulations meant there was a delay
between the publication of the framework and Merchant Navy apprentices
being able to register and begin their training.</hs_Para>

been working to make sure that training meets the needs of maritime
employers. The entrepreneur Doug Richard conducted a review of the
entire apprenticeship system in England in 2013. He found that current
apprenticeships do not always meet employer needs or expectations. As a
result, we are changing the 
<?notus-xml column=634?>way that schemes are developed, assessed and funded. In future,
employers will have a bigger role in developing and assessing new
apprenticeship standards, which means that the industry will have
greater scope to develop programmes that meet its specific
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000328">The

CalMac, Stena and others when employers undercut pay and conditions. Of
course, the primary problem to which attention has been drawn is the
national minimum wage legislation. Although employees can bring an
employment tribunal-type case, seafarers may fear dismissal in those
cases. I know that the unions involved have written to the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills and copied the letter to the
Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for

conclusion, one of the key strengths of UK shipping is its people. If
we want to maintain our position as a global maritime leader, we need
to recruit a new generation of people who can take the industry
forward. Today’s apprentices are tomorrow’s leaders. That
is why we are so committed to maritime training and to making
high-quality apprenticeships available in a wide range of skilled jobs.
That is why we will continue to work with the industry to increase the
number of youngsters choosing a shipping
career.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012436000330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140124/debtext/140124-0002.htm#14012436000330"><I>Question

the then Government’s unsustainable and environmentally damaging

an out-patient clinic) or one mainly or entirely accessed via telephone

offenders are rehabilitated in order to tackle high reoffending rates
that currently see almost half of all prisoners commit further crime
within a year of release. It is imperative we move ahead now to reduce
reoffending. However, we will be taking a phased approach to
implementation which will enable us to make sure the system works. The
Department is overseeing the reforms in a way which ensures that public
protection is at the 
<?notus-xml column=354?>heart of our reformed system. The programme has been engaging closely

trusts all the information, resources and support they need to
successfully transition to the new

of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range
180-220.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><I>Key:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>*
