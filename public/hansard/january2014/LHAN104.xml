esteem is critical. The Government are very intent on holding NHS
England completely to account on parity, which is woven into the NHS
outcomes framework and the mandate. As I said in my Answer, the
Department of Health is working very carefully and closely with NHS

figures for the sake of them. Can I seek her reassurance 
<?notus-xml column=972?>that those discussions will include finding a way not just of measuring
psychological treatments against other treatments in mental health, but

in this matter. He will know that NICE has recommended in its
guidelines a whole range of psychological therapeutic interventions.
Available therapies include interpersonal therapy, brief dynamic
interpersonal therapy, couple therapy for depression, counselling for
depression and behavioural family therapy, as well as cognitive
behavioural family interventions. These therapies are all delivered by
IAPT services and are included in IAPT training. Since 2010, more than
1,000 therapists have been trained or are currently in training. With
regard to new therapies, I assure my noble friend that the IAPT
programme will consider evidence-based therapies recommended by NICE
for anxiety and depression as they
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T14:40:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Patel of Bradford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree
that the first step in developing and delivering effective mental
healthcare services is the collection, analysis and dissemination of
high-quality data that managers, practitioners and service users can
understand, and that, without these, service development will be
severely hampered? A case in point is the Count Me In census, which for
five years collected high-quality, focused and detailed information on
services for minority ethnic mental health patients. The Government did
what they are doing again now—that is, incorporating that data
collection system into a wider system. An invaluable tool has
effectively been lost and that has severely hampered service
development in this area. Can the Minister assure me that this data
collection system will be brought back into this area of

Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford,
is another expert in this field. It is important to keep information
about types of mental health conditions and about the ages involved.
Currently, data on age are not collected; there is only information on
what category people fall into. There is some merit in looking at
ethnic background. I have no briefing on that but it may be sensible if
I talk to my honourable friend Norman Lamb and ask whether he can have
a conversation with the noble Lord about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T14:42:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> I also welcome the noble Baroness
to the Front Bench for Questions. Can she confirm that the data
collected will cover child and adolescent mental health services and
the outcomes from the different interventions in that age group? Those
in that group are particularly vulnerable and there are many influences
on them, from both education and their social
background<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T14:42:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Jolly:</Member></B> Child and adolescent services are certainly
critical. The Government have put £54 million into child and
adolescent IAPT services, and IAPT 
<?notus-xml column=973?>waiting times are being looked at slightly differently. Those services
will be provided in two stages. The first stage will involve not just
the first appointment but an agreed programme of
care. The second stage is that a second appointment
has to be in the book within 28 days of the first
appointment. We have looked at trying to make the waiting times
slightly more rigid and non-virtual. I emphasise the
Government’s concern about child and adolescent
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T14:43:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

down now for 19 consecutive months. Long-term youth unemployment has
also been going down at a very sharp rate, and the number of young
NEETs is the lowest for a decade. We have been pumping up the number of
apprenticeships, with 1.5 million places created; work
experience is vital—there are 113,000 places. The

recession, and that was built under  the previous Government.
To remind noble Lords, the latest ONS figures for the 2008 recession
show that GDP fell from top to bottom by 7.2%. That compares with the
1930s, for which the NIESR show a fall of only 6.9%—it was worse
than the 1930s, a terrible smash. We are pulling it back and the
figures in the north and round the rest of the country are showing an
improvement. In all of those regions the private sector improvement

Gaza is precarious. There is a significant danger that food, water and
fuel will run out later this year. The UK is a leading provider of
humanitarian support, which includes supporting the UN Relief and Works
Agency, UNRWA, to provide basic services, providing food vouchers to
vulnerable households, supporting the International Committee of the
Red Cross to provide humanitarian assistance and supporting the UN
Access Coordination Unit to assist the passage of personnel and

Falkner of Margravine (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my
noble friend for that response. The humanitarian aid is terribly
important, particularly when the 1.7 million people in Gaza are now
living life at breaking point, with 11,000 people displaced by last
month’s floods. Fuel shortages are such that donkey carts have
replaced cars as a means of transport, the streets are overflowing with
raw sewage and, with nearly 50% unemployment, the situation is like a
tinderbox. The United Nations has said that Gaza will be unliveable by
2020, so what are Her Majesty’s Government doing to facilitate
Hamas and Fatah talks, and more importantly talks between the
Palestinian Authority and Israel, so that a final settlement can be
reached for people to live in civilised form next door to each
other<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:02:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Gaza as being currently in a state of de-development. It does indeed
predict that by 2020 the place may be unliveable. The recent blockades
and closures of the tunnels have seen the further loss of 20,000 jobs
in a dire situation. We strongly support the peace process. Meanwhile
we are of course asking Israel to ease the blockade immediately, but in
supporting the peace process we hope to see a two-state solution. The

over what is taught in schools both in Israel and the Occupied

improvements there, and in lessons, but there is still a long way to

massive amount of assistance, which is much needed in Gaza for the
reasons the right reverend Prelate has given. Gaza
has suffered a lot from the closure of the tunnels. However, the
tunnels themselves help to fund Hamas and this is an opportunity to
encourage Israel to open the borders there and to support the moderate
elements in Gaza. Certainly, at the moment, the international

some families have only 12 hours of power a day. The most vulnerable
families are suffering terrible burns from using inadequate heating and

in our previous debate on this matter that anti-social behaviour in the
housing context was of a different order. Victims cannot be expected to
have the same degree of tolerance to anti-social behaviour where it
takes place on their doorstep or in the immediate vicinity of their own
home. It is simply not reasonable to expect the victims to move home in
such circumstances in the same way as they could walk away from
anti-social behaviour in a shopping centre or public park. The
amendment passed on Report accepted this by retaining the
“nuisance or annoyance” test for residents in social
housing. Following discussions with the noble Lord, these government
amendments extend that principle and protection to those who live in
other housing
settings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401272000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000067">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>

clearly breaking out after a slightly more difficult passage of the
Bill at earlier stages. We should all be pleased that the outcome of
this has been to strike a compromise between the very real concerns
that the noble Lord, Lord Dear, my noble friend Lady Mallalieu and
others expressed about the original provision. That had to be balanced,
as it was in debate, by the real concern about problems faced by many
tenants in both the public and the private sector, and I think that the
Government have sought to strike an acceptable balance. To strike the
slightest of sour notes, I think it was clear that that balance had to
be struck from our debate in Committee, a very full and detailed
debate. Perhaps, had the Government come forward with precisely this
formulation at an earlier stage, they would have avoided a defeat. I
also wish that a similar attempt to try to meet the genuine concerns of

fruit before we got to this

the helpful way in which he approached taking on board the will of your

annoyance to be taken into the housing setting and residential areas. I
am grateful for his acknowledgement that it was the Opposition who
raised time and again during the passage of the Bill the fact that so
much of it is not tenure-neutral. We felt that those who rented their
accommodation rather than owned it were getting a bit of a raw deal. In
the amendment, the Government have sought to address that problem, so
that those suffering from anti-social behaviour in the form of nuisance
and annoyance, whether the people who are causing the problem live in
public rented accommodation, private rented accommodation or are
owner-occupiers, can ensure that that problem is tackled. I am grateful
for the Minister’s
acknowledgement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:20:31"></hs_TimeCode>
of that because we have raised it several times during consideration of

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, child sexual exploitation is
an abhorrent crime and we are determined to tackle it in whatever form
it takes. Grooming and child sexual exploitation happen in all areas of
the country and can take many different forms. They are never
acceptable, and we all need to work together to ensure that these
sickening crimes no longer remain hidden. On day two of Report, I
undertook to give sympathetic consideration to an amendment tabled
by the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon,
which sought to strengthen the powers available to
the police to close premises used for child sexual
exploitation. As I set out then, given the serious nature of these
crimes, we believe that the Sexual Offences Act 2003 rather than the
closure powers in this Bill, which relate to anti-social behaviour, is
the most appropriate place to address this issue—a point that my
noble friend Lady Hamwee made very well on Report.</hs_para>

now reviewed the existing powers in Part 2A of that Act in
light of the debate on Report. The existing closure powers relate only
to prostitution and child pornography offences. This means that the
police cannot at present close premises where other sex
offences against children have been or are likely to be committed. I am
sure that noble Lords will agree that this is not right.</hs_para>

8 and 18 will ensure that the police are able to close premises
associated with a much wider range of child sex offences. These include
not just the specific child sex offences in Sections 5 to 13 of the
2003 Act and offences relating to indecent images of children under the
Protection of Children Act 1978, but other offences where the victim is
under 18, including rape and sexual
assault<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:25:07"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
that these offences relate to some of the most vulnerable
members of our society, the amendments would
also modify the conditions relating to the use of the
closure power to enable the police to close premises quickly in cases
of urgency. The police will be able to issue a closure notice when they
have reasonable grounds for believing that in the past three
months the premises have been used for activities
related to a specified child sex offence and, importantly,
when the premises are likely to be used for such
activities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:25:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there should be safeguards to ensure that these powers are used in the
right circumstances. That is why we will retain the existing safeguards
in Part 2A of the 2003 Act, which are similar to the safeguards on the
power to close premises due to anti-social behaviour in Part 4 of the
Bill. Although an initial closure notice can be issued by the police, a
court must decide whether to make a closure order within 48 hours of it
taking effect. The police must also have regard to any guidance issued
in relation to these powers. Furthermore, 
<?notus-xml column=987?>a closure notice cannot prevent a person who regularly resides on or
owns the premises entering or remaining on them.</hs_para>

the premises, and any other person who has an interest in the premises,
may contest a subsequent application to the court to make an order.
This would mean, for example, that if the police received evidence on a
Friday night that premises were to be used as a venue for abusing
children that weekend, they could, in addition to their existing
safeguarding powers and actions, temporarily close the premises. This
could provide the police with a powerful tool to disrupt and tackle
child sexual
exploitation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:27:07"></hs_TimeCode>.
These amendments will enhance the ability of the police to protect the
public from sexual harm and will complement the steps that we have
taken elsewhere in the Bill to strengthen the system of civil orders
used to manage the risk of sexual offences, and to give the police
additional powers to tackle child sexual exploitation taking place in

child sexual abuse. Therefore, I know he is well aware of the range of
attempts that these people will go through. “Evil” is an
odd word to use because there are all sorts of corruptions to do with
what has happened to those people. We have to remember that young
people themselves sometimes are sexually abusing because of what is
happening to them. The Minister saw that whole spectrum, and this is
just one other step that can be taken to block those who intend to
abuse children. I reinforce what was said by the noble Lord, Lord
Cormack, about the use of the internet and virtual abuse. It will be on
the increase if other avenues are closed down because we know this is
an addiction—but not necessarily—with an evil outcome
that we need to deal with in many ways. I thank the Minister for all

that was not previously in place; I hope that it will now be put in
place. I reassure both speakers that my colleagues in government are
linked up on this. When this amendment was drafted, it was subject to
the usual write-around in government, which is the procedure that now
applies to more or less all government decision-making. If it reassures
noble Lords, I will make sure that this debate is drawn to the
attention of my colleagues with particular responsibility in this area.
I hope noble Lords will understand that what is particularly helpful
about this amendment is that it arose from a police and crime
commissioner writing to the shadow Minister here, the noble Baroness,
Lady Smith, who raised it with me. It shows that the Government and
Opposition facing difficult issues—not controversial issues, but
issues that are difficult to handle—can work together to achieve
something. I am grateful for the initiative that the noble Baroness,

any prosecution may be undertaken. It would first go to the police; the
police would then refer it to the prosecutor who would apply the two
prosecutorial tests, et cetera. I absolutely understand the generality
of prosecution, but perhaps the noble Lord will allow us a greater
degree of specificity about how this offence will be prosecuted. I know
that that is very much awaited among many of the NGOs and others, which
are still worried and perplexed. They are concerned not only that the
prosecution of these offences will entail the proof of the substantive
offence—which would amount to coercion, violence or
threats—but that there would be the additional barrier of forced
marriage with a lesser offence. I know that the Government take that
very

Thornton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this amendment, to
which I was very pleased to add my name. Many months ago, when we
started down the route of discussing the Bill, I had a meeting with
some of the brilliant organisations that work to prevent forced
marriages and to support those who are escaping from them. Almost in
passing they mentioned to me that they were concerned about the
capacity issue. I looked at the record of the Commons debates and the
discussions that took place in Committee there and  I noticed
that my honourable friend Gloria De Piero had raised the matter there
and that she received the sort of response from the Minister there that
I received in Committee here. It is a very good example of the way that
Ministers in this House conduct themselves. I thank noble Lords,
particularly my noble friend Lord Harris, for supporting me in pressing
this matter on Report when we persuaded the Minister, as it were, to
look at the matter again. I am very grateful that he did so. We have
reached a very happy
conclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:42:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401272000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000107"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="1401272000379" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000379">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who
spoke in the debate and echo the words of my noble friend Lord Taylor
of Holbeach: this debate and provision have again demonstrated the
qualities and nature of your Lordships’ House. When we say that
it is not just lip service—we genuinely listen from this
Dispatch Box—and as my noble friend Lady Hamwee said, the issue
of forced marriage certainly concerns us all. Anyone who has come
across this particular coercive practice in any shape or form is
disgusted by it and it is important that we unite to address it. I
remember going to the Forced Marriage Unit and talking to some of the
practitioners there, and exactly this issue of mental capacity arose.
There was a live case which concerned immigration and it was tragic to
see the consequences of how it was playing out.</hs_para>

pay tribute to the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, as I have
done throughout all stages of the Bill. I genuinely mean it when I say
that she has made an incredible effort in addressing this issue. Her 
<?notus-xml column=992?>setting up of the Forced Marriage Unit was supported across all parties,

focus our
activities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:44:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
Perhaps I may pick up on a question that she raised about guidelines.
The CPS will revise its existing legal guidance on forced marriage and
honour-based violence and will develop an e-training element for its
prosecutors ahead of the introduction of the new legislation. This
amendment will be captured and reflected in the revised legal guidance.
As she and many other noble Lords are aware, the CPS also has a number
of specialist prosecutors. Their specialist skills and knowledge will
ensure the understanding of this new
legislation.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1401272000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000279">3.45

to the conclusion of this particular element of the Bill, I reiterate
that ultimately we are seeking to mitigate risk. I am sure that the
greatest statistic we would call upon is that there have been zero
prosecutions, not because people are not aware of the law but because
people have been deterred from the practice. I have taken on board the
comments both of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, and of
the groups which still express concern—although I am pleased to
say that these groups also work with the Forced Marriage Unit to ensure
that the steps we are taking are shared by the communities and put into
practice. I assure the noble and learned Baroness that, as she knows,
the Government have fully taken into account the points that she has
raised as we have developed the Bill, and we will continue to take them
into account in our work as we move towards implementing the
provisions.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, with Amendments
15 and 16 we turn again to the subject of littering from vehicles. This
is a matter which this House has discussed several times in recent
months, and it is clear from those debates that the House is united in
its displeasure at seeing litter along our roadsides, and at the
thoughtless and uncaring behaviour of those inconsiderate individuals
who left it there. By far the majority of those who have spoken on this
issue have supported the proposal by my noble friend Lord Marlesford
for councils to have the power to fine the registered keeper of a
vehicle from which litter is seen to be thrown. Therefore, on Report I
undertook to bring forward a government amendment to provide the
Secretary of State with an order-making power to enable councils to do
just that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401272000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000112">We
know, of course, that it will not always have been the registered
keeper—himself or herself—who threw the litter. For that
reason, the power enables 
<?notus-xml column=995?>provision to be made for litter authorities to issue fixed penalties for
littering from vehicles but does not impose any criminal liability on
registered keepers. Provision could be made for an
unpaid fixed penalty to be recovered as a civil debt. However, a
registered keeper could not be prosecuted under Section 87 unless he or
she were the actual offender, as is the case
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401272000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000113">As I said
on Report, these powers are intended to make life easier for local
authorities. It will therefore be important to ensure that we get the
details of this scheme right, to be confident that they will work as
intended and will meet local authorities’ needs in a way that
the current regime of criminal sanctions for littering may not. For
that reason, rather than rushing into detailed primary legislation in
haste, Amendment 15 will place a duty on the Secretary of State to
ensure that regulations address important matters such as the size of
the fine, the form and content of the penalty notice, exceptions to the
keeper’s liability—for example, if the vehicle has been
stolen—and matters relating to representations and appeals.
These are all matters on which we will want to seek local
authorities’ and others’ views before bringing forward
draft regulations for approval by both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401272000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000114">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T15:49:40"></hs_TimeCode>
power to issue these civil penalties will be conferred on the
“litter authority” for the land where the offence is

certain major roads the responsibility lies with the Highways Agency.

confer these powers on those who need them

(6) of proposed new Section 88A, which provides the Secretary of State

consequence of any provision made under these regulations. This is to
ensure that the interaction between the new regime of civil penalties
and the existing regime is clear, and that there is no question of
duplication or double jeopardy. My noble friend is to be commended for
his persistence on this issue. All of us in this House share his views

However, local authorities are not normally in that position and I
therefore counsel my noble friend and the department concerned, when
drawing up these regulations, to think about the route to prosecution
by individual walkers or other car drivers who could complain to either
the Highways Agency or local authorities. Clearly, there is still work
to be done but I, like my noble friend, hope it will have a very
satisfactory outcome.</hs_para>

Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill we have, given the
amendments today, a sense of achievement. However, if I am
honest—and I think the Minister would agree—there is a
sense of some relief. I entirely concur with his comments about the
support from around the House and his civil servants in the Box. The
Bill has had a long and sometimes tortuous journey. There were times
when I thought perhaps we needed injunctions for nuisance and annoyance
and for these to be employed in your Lordships’ House. There
were a number of scheduling changes which, fortunately, did not
interrupt the Minister’s birthday party. However, they did cause
some anxiety 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>in ensuring that we were properly prepared for each stage of the Bill.
We coped with all those and I am grateful to him and to his Front Bench
colleagues, the noble Lords, Lord Ahmad and Lord Faulks, for their
support.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1401272000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000136">When

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords,
the Government have prioritised growing the economy and improving the
environment. This Water Bill contributes to both of these priorities.
There are two important parts to the Bill; first, to reform the water
industry to ensure it is fit for the long-term, and, secondly, to
provide a solution to deal with the availability and affordability of
flood insurance for households at high risk of flooding.</hs_para>

should declare some interests. A tributary of the River Thames runs

Water Bill has three aims: to build the resilience of our water
supplies without damaging the environment; to encourage and contribute
to economic growth; and to give customers greater choice. These are
important issues for noble Lords across the House and I look forward to
discussing them in the coming weeks. I am very grateful to noble Lords
who have already taken the time to talk to me about these aims. Their
views have given me real food for thought and I will continue to work
with them to try to address their concerns and answer their questions.
I look forward to a similar, strong level of engagement during the
Bill’s passage through your Lordships’ House. I value
enormously the debate and scrutiny that this Bill will receive in this

shall set out why this Bill is before us today, the issues we are
addressing and why it is important. Water is essential to life. We need
clean and plentiful water resources to supply our homes and to support
a growing population and economy. Water is also critical for a healthy
and flourishing natural environment. That natural environment is the
essential foundation for sustaining our economy, for prospering
communities and for our individual well-being.</hs_para>

2011 water White Paper, <I>Water for Life</I>, set out the
Government’s ambitions for a sustainable, resilient and
customer-focused water sector. It outlined the plans for delivering
substantial improvements in the health of our rivers through improving
water quality and tackling unsustainable abstraction. Let us be frank:
we must acknowledge that a growing population and the impacts of
climate change pose risks to our water resources and the ecosystems
they support. We need to take these challenges seriously to avoid
causing irreparable damage to our environment.</hs_para>

the challenges for the water sector through to 2050. This Bill is one
part of our policy response, which is designed to drive long-term
changes to ensure a secure and sustainable water system. Delivering
this long-term change requires action by government, Ofwat and the
Environment Agency, the water sector and users of water across the
economy. We have put this challenge at the centre of the policy
framework we have set for Ofwat through the strategic policy statement.
We are reinforcing that through the new resilience duty in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401272000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000145">We are
driving change in water companies through our guidance on water
resource management planning. This Bill includes a new power for the
Secretary of State to direct in advance the level of resilience a water
company must plan for. We are using the Bill to extend competition to
drive innovation, bringing new players with new ideas into the sector.
Competition will keep a downward pressure on the costs customers pay.
This is about safeguarding our water supplies for the long-term future.
Ensuring a resilient supply system will require action to develop new
water resources and use them in a different way, and to manage
demand.</hs_para>

Bill will change behaviour and change the focus of the water sector. It
will hardwire future resilience into its regulatory framework. This is
resilience in a broad sense. It encompasses water networks and water 
<?notus-xml column=1004?>resources. It includes the environment from which companies draw their
supplies. Resilience was a central theme of our White Paper and is a
key theme of the Water Bill. We will return to it time and again in our

The floods and indeed droughts we have experienced in recent years

flooding but on one in every four days we were in drought, putting our
water supplies under great pressure. The water White Paper recognised
these challenges and set out the Government’s strategy for a

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:14:24"></hs_TimeCode>That is why we
are taking action now, including in this Bill, and developing detailed

of the water industry. The Bill will remove the regulatory barriers
that discourage or prevent new firms competing in the water industry.
This is not competition for competition’s sake. It will provide
real choice for non-household customers and bring new entrants into the
market. Competition between companies will drive improved customer
service as companies will need to work harder to attract and maintain
customers. As we go forward, this competition will exert a downward
pressure on bills for all customers.</hs_para>

successful in attracting investment that has improved infrastructure

this investment—the stability of the market—cannot be
overstated. We must maintain the attractiveness of the water sector. We
are talking about evolutionary change. We have been careful not to risk
stability by forcing through sudden and dramatic

First Milk became the first multisite customer to switch to Severn
Trent Costain. The two companies are working together to improve First
Milk’s water efficiency and lower its environmental impact.

should like to talk about affordability for households. We are all
conscious of the impact of water bills across the country. It is not
possible for us to discuss a Water Bill without mentioning water bills.
Let us be clear. Water is a price-controlled sector. Ofwat sets an
overall cap on the total amount that each water company can recover
from their customers. It is Ofwat’s responsibility to ensure
both that charges are fair and that the companies are able to finance
their
operations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401272000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#1401272000160">Ofwat<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:19:29"></hs_TimeCode>
estimates that the current price review  could reduce pressure
on bills by between £120 million and £750 million a year
from 2015. Water companies 
<?notus-xml column=1006?>themselves are taking action. A number of companies have already
committed to keeping bills below the price cap for 2014-15. Water
companies already help households struggling to pay their bills and
most are planning social tariffs for 2015 that are designed to reflect
local circumstances. It is important to recognise that the independent
regulator is doing its

Through this Bill, we are also taking important steps to address the
affordability of flood insurance for households in areas at high risk
of flooding. I know that future arrangements for flood insurance are of
great interest to noble Lords. The recent extreme weather has served to
highlight the important role that the insurance industry plays in
helping people to get back on their feet after flooding. The measures
in this Bill bring forward powers to provide affordable insurance for
those at high risk of flooding. Both Government and the insurance
industry recognised that there was a need to bring forward new measures

preferred approach, a reinsurance scheme which is known as Flood Re,
will limit the amount that high-risk households have to pay on the
flood insurance element of their premiums and excesses. The effective
limit on the premium would vary according to council tax band, rising

targeted towards lower-income households, providing more support for
those who need it the most. To fund this, an industry-backed levy would
be introduced. It is initially expected to be £10.50 per policy.
The Association of British Insurers has assured us that this will be
achieved without increasing bills for those people at low or no risk of

take this opportunity to draw noble Lords’ attention to the fact
that arrangements for flood insurance are designed to be transitional 
<?notus-xml column=1007?>measures. Over time, there should be a gradual transition towards more
risk-reflective prices, based on robust evidence of local risk, to
increase the incentives for flood risk to be managed over the longer

of your Lordships’ House who has served on the boards of both
Ofwat and the Environment Agency, albeit rather briefly in the case of
Ofwat, so I have some experience of this interesting industry. I am
afraid that that experience leads me to conclude that the Bill is not
really up to the job of sorting out a strategic future for the sector.
However, I can tell the Minister that the Opposition will not
fundamentally oppose the main elements of the Bill. We will be
vigorously querying them, and will make some propositions, but the real
problem I have with the Bill is what it
omits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000003">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:28:26"></hs_TimeCode>
one sense, that is slightly surprising. As the Minister said, two years
ago, admittedly under a different Secretary of State—one who
actually believed that climate change was occurring—the
Government produced a very good White Paper, <I>Water for Life</I>.
That White Paper dealt holistically with water as a resource, as an
environmental force—for good or evil—as an amenity and as
an economic and infrastructure system. The White Paper was positively
received by the industry, environmental groups, consumer groups, the
regulator and politicians of all parties. It was therefore assumed that
the Government would produce a Bill which implemented all elements of
that strategy. Instead, the Government produced a much thinner
Bill—thin in content rather than in volume, I have to say to the
noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. The initial Bill was even thinner and was
roundly criticised by the Select Committee in another place under the
leadership of the redoubtable Anne McIntosh MP. The Government then
produced a slightly better Bill, which is what we now have. It went
through the House of Commons fairly quickly and, just before Report,
the Government introduced the key element, to which the Minister has
referred, on flood insurance. We will be taking quite a rushed job on
the Bill, but a number of issues need some pretty thorough
examination.</hs_para>

terms of what is in the Bill, there are three main objectives. First,
on flood insurance, as the Minister said, foremost in our mind must be
the distress and suffering caused by the recent floods, and their
impact on families, farms and businesses. Part 4 of the Bill sets up
the Flood Re system, which the Minister described. I congratulate the
Government, particularly the Minister’s former colleague,
Richard Benyon, on reaching a conclusion with the insurance industry,
which I know is not the easiest of negotiators. We will support the
overall concept of Flood Re and the contingency provisions under the
flood insurance scheme—my noble friend Lord Grantchester will
expand on our position on that later on. Noble Lords will be aware that
a number of representations are being made by groups that feel excluded
from the scheme, and no doubt we will have an interesting time in
Committee, but I strongly support the
concept<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000006">The
second main element of the Bill is retail competition for non-domestic
consumers, which is the flagship policy here. We support that
objective—indeed, attempts were made to introduce competition in
the 2003 Act and in the 2010 Act, but they never really materialised
under that regime and only four instances ever occurred. However, in
Scotland, where there is a different structure and a state-owned
wholesale company, we have seen rapid development of a retail
non-domestic market, which is working for the public sector, for
businesses and for charities, particularly those which operate on
multiple sites. They have seen benefits in terms of bills, water
efficiency and customer service. Although only about 5% of non-domestic
consumers have switched in Scotland, the very fact of competition has
had a beneficial effect on the rest of the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recognise the limitations involved. Theoretically, 1.2 million
customers will now be able to choose alternative retailers, but, in
practice, the option is likely to be most attractive to entities such
as supermarkets which operate on multiple sites or to public sector
bodies such as local authorities and universities which have a lot of
bills that they would wish to consolidate. It is unlikely that there
will be anything like 1.2 million people taking advantage of the
market; the majority of small businesses, for example, are even less
likely to switch—as we have seen from the energy
market—than are domestic consumers. Although competition is
important and puts an edge into the industry, we should not exaggerate
the degree to which it is
transformational<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000008">Moreover,
we have to consider carefully the effect on household consumers. Twenty
million household consumers will continue to rely on regulation rather
than competition to get them a better deal. We will have to strengthen
protections in the Bill to ensure that domestic consumers are not
disadvantaged by the fact that part of the non-domestic market is
getting a better deal. The Minister gave an assurance to that 
<?notus-xml column=1009?>effect in that Ofwat has the tools, which I think is how he put it, but
those need to be strengthened and made clearer in the

where there is effective competition and some choice, the provisions do
not fully deliver an effective, functioning market. I shall take just
two or three issues. Entry into the market appears to be largely by
negotiation with the incumbent company rather than by open and
transparent price competition, as would be the case in most markets.
Even more surprisingly, there is no provision for exit from the market.
Surely provision for exit from the retail market by poorly performing
competitors or incumbents is essential for a properly functioning
market. Most stakeholders seem to favour providing for it, with
safeguards to protect the consumer, so we will be looking at whether we
should provide in the Bill for exit from the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:33:56"></hs_TimeCode>. We also
need tighter provisions on non-discrimination by incumbent companies to

there is a resilience duty in the Bill. This caused a little bit of
manoeuvring in the Commons and I am not entirely clear that the
resilience duty that the Government have come up with goes as far as we
would wish. Historically, there has been a dual system of regulation in
water, with Ofwat being the economic regulator—sometimes very
narrowly defining what that meant—and the Environment Agency
being the environment
regulator.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000011">Synergy
and cohesion have got better in recent years. Since 2003, Ofwat has had
a secondary sustainability duty. Nevertheless, the record shows that
Ofwat has in its price review tended to give greater priority to things
that related solely to the economic side and less to what was needed
for the environmental or resource-conservation side. We need to look
again at that. That is why I think that green NGOs and many of our
colleagues in the Commons were pressing for sustainable development,
which is currently a secondary duty, to be elevated to a primary
duty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000012">The
resilience duty is, in a sense, the Government’s response to
that. Resilience is undoubtedly important, and the Minister said that
it will be interpreted in a broad sense, but it is a bit vague.
Resilience certainly does not cover the range of subjects that
sustainable development does, and it is still criticised by some NGOs.
The Government have strengthened the position since they first
introduced it into the Bill, and we need to take account of that, but
we will still want to probe whether resilience is really the better
expression or whether, as I suspect, it could exclude key aspects that
are covered by sustainable development—especially, to take an
obvious example, social sustainability, which is an important aspect of
how the water market works. We intend to probe those issues in

covers what is in the Bill, but there are some massive things which are
not—two very large elephants in the room. First, there is the
bizarre financial structure of the industry, which has been commented
on in the press in a timely way in the past few days. Secondly, there
is the management and regulation of the physical water system, the
movement of water from precipitation 
<?notus-xml column=1010?>right the way through our streams, rivers, culverts and pipes to our
taps or to the ocean. We know that it is a huge and risky
system—the past few weeks have told us that, and only a few
months earlier we were talking about the scarcity of water in certain
parts of the country. The existence of scarcity or excess crucially
affects our ecology, our agriculture, our way of life and our
communities. Those are huge issues; they were addressed in the White
Paper, but not really reflected in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000014">I shall
take the economic structure of the industry first. The Minister says
that privatisation has been a success and, in the limited sense that we
have had substantial investment, it has—and we do not want to
jeopardise that—but this is an odd industry. It is dominated by
regional monopolies which are themselves vertically integrated. Some of
them have been subject to takeover and they are now mostly owned by
overseas-based investment funds. I do not decry that, but it means that
their structure for raising finance is odd for a public utility. They
are also highly profitable. On some calculations, there has been a
return of 17.5% on asset value since privatisation. They are, as the
newspapers have pointed out in the past couple of days, very high
payers of dividends, with nearly 90% of profits returned as dividends
last year.</hs_para>

sector is very highly geared, for the most part. On average, well over
70% of capital comes from the markets, not from equity sources, as was
assumed when we first privatised the
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>. The
industry also has a fairly poor record on innovation, as some of your
Lordships’ Select Committees have pointed out over the past few
years. At the far end, over the past 10 years there has been
a 55% increase in prices to the consumer. The industry has also been
relatively poor, although improving, on customer service. That does not
describe either a modern, dynamic, innovative market or an effective
delivery mechanism for a general social good. Although delivery of
investment has been important, those other aspects need
addressing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000016">The
system of regulation needs a pretty fundamental rethink. In the past
few months, Ofwat itself has recognised the need to change. The
regulator is proposing significant changes in the coming price review
and has already implemented a significant improvement in consumer
engagement. I welcome that, and the role of the Consumer Council for
Water in that. In the price review, however, Ofwat is going to put less
emphasis on capital expenditure and have more flexibility between
different forms of expenditure, which I welcome. It is taking a
longer-term view on investment and more emphasis is likely on
interconnection, water efficiency and demand management and on
environmental measures. I welcome pretty much all those Ofwat
initiatives, but they are within a framework which does not necessarily
push them in that way. The initiatives need to be embedded because they
will be seriously challenged by some of the operators and undertakers
within this industry. The system of regulation needs review and the
Government need to be a bit more radical. They need to look at whether
there are stronger measures which can ensure that the companies
actually deliver, including perhaps addressing fundamental issues such
as the proper and full separation of the wholesale from the retail
market.</hs_para>

odd way in which we pay for water, with most domestic consumers still
operating on a rateable value which is several years or decades old.
The result is that its affordability to our citizens and businesses is
very much in question. In the household sector, more than 12% have very
serious problems with affordability. The previous Government’s
2010 Act provided for social tariffs to make water more affordable to
vulnerable families, but I am afraid that first the regulator and then
the industry have been slow in taking them up. The Minister said that
they will have them the next year or the year after, but the fact of
the matter is that the record at the moment is not very good. If we add
all the schemes together, including the WaterSure scheme which the
Government promoted for large families or those with serious medical
conditions, there are only 70,000 or 80,000 people covered in total.

2 million having problems with
affordability<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T16:41:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
Since the companies appear to be so recalcitrant in coming forward, we

problems with the water system itself. There is a huge loss and
misdirection of water both in its supposedly natural movement, which

management, and in the engineered part of the system. Inappropriate
land management, deforestation at the top of water courses,
the changing and dredging of natural watercourses and the loss of
natural water meadows and flood soaks all have the effect of pushing
more water downstream, just at the time when it should not be.
Excessive man-made abstractions of water, currently and historically,
threaten the system itself and some of our key geological features. For
example, we are destroying our chalk streams from Yorkshire down to
Dorset—a landscape and geological feature which is almost unique
to England. In economic terms, excessive abstraction means not only not
enough storage in the winter to provide for the needs of agriculture
and society in the hotter months but that the whole management of the
system becomes difficult. Meanwhile in the engineered part of the
system, increased floodwater leads to sewage leaks, with their
attendant risks, and increased leakage from the clean water
system.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012721000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000019">All
those issues were covered in the White Paper, but they are not in the
Bill. However, there is one thing in the Bill which threatens effective
achievement of a better system of water management as a whole. That
concerns upstream competition being provided for in the Bill before we
have properly regulated and introduced a new system of abstraction
reform. The present system of abstraction licensing is 50 years old and
even then has grandfathered ancient rights. I have been arguing for
radical abstraction reform for well over a decade. The Bill rightly
ends compensation to water companies for the modification of
abstraction licences, which is an issue that the Environment Agency has
been trying to modify within the current structure over recent
years.</hs_para>

upstream competition to be introduced. The Government have said that
this will not happen before 2020, but nevertheless to introduce
upstream competition before we have actually reformed the extraction
system is highly dangerous. Abstraction licences are not used to their
full; only about 42% of water allowable under such licences is actually
abstracted. That means that there is a lot of potential water to be
abstracted under the present system. If we introduce competition and
the ability to source that water differently, the effect may well be
that we create scarcity in those areas where there is not already
scarcity. It is already a problem that a majority of our water
catchment areas are overextracted. Upstream competition and trading
could work if there were a limit on abstractions, but until we get to a
proper system I think that the Government are wrong to provide for
upstream competition even in the way that it is provided for on a
contingency basis in the Bill. It must be clear by the time the Bill
leaves this House and goes on to the statute book that upstream
competition is dependent on there first being a proper regime for
abstraction; otherwise, we will have the worst of both
worlds.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012721000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0001.htm#14012721000021">I

presently on a water meter, and current water company plans aim to
reduce water usage by just 5 litres a day per person by 2020. Metering
gives consumers greater control over their water consumption and the
chance of improved affordability. It also helps water companies target
households using large amounts of water, provide water efficiency
support and tackle leaks. The case for smart water metering, combined
with advice on how to reduce water usage and social tariffs which
minimise affordability issues for disadvantaged heavy-use households,

widespread switchover to metered charging. This conclusion was

reflect the Liberal Democrat view that to successfully manage flood

institutional responses, with their infrastructure plans for flood
defences and installing huge pipes. Moreover, given that a number of
new clauses were added in Committee in the Commons and therefore lacked
pre-legislative scrutiny, I and my noble friend Lord Shipley, who sadly

that much of the Bill is left to regulation. So much, in fact, that the

that through the Bill communities and property owners might

welcome. They need to be re-enfranchised. However, communities will
need guidance, some powers and, above all, resources. Their efforts
will need durability and continuity if they are to have any effect on

the scope of the roles of the Environment Agency and Defra on flood

revisited. When it comes to that, what about the legacy of flood
defence infrastructure and responsibility for its future management? I
refer, of course, to the system of levees, dykes, channels and so on,
some of which have been in place for hundreds of years, which serve to

people have put their trust in public stewardship, but in recent times
watercourse management has been compromised by environmental objectives
with failure to dredge, objections to spreading mud and silt on
adjacent land, or cutting back vegetation. This needs to be rebalanced.
Of course, environmental considerations are important, but so is the
risk of flooding and the competence of these installations. Outside
internal drainage board areas there is ignorance of the rural drainage
network, its layout and capacity. There is a lack of any obvious
responsibility for things such as roadside ditches or for preventing
watercourses being compromised or

CLA expressed concerns to me that in many instances liability for flood

is implicit in the Flood Re proposal. Remarkable though it is that it
has taken so long to get to this point, the fact remains that universal
cover for flood risk by an informal process of mutualisation is being
broken up. Based on this we are told that the genie cannot go back into
the bottle, and I agree with that. However, it is not known what other
risks may be singled out in future. What about windy locations, or
areas subject to possible landslips because they are on steep

issue is well illustrated on the Association of British
Insurers’s own website. Like it, mortgage lenders are risk
averse and expect borrowers to insure against all the “standard

Government, to give them their due, have made a brave fist of
quantifying the outcomes in their impact assessment, but the reality is
that all such calculations are replete with highly sensitive variables
which cannot be accurately quantified. Indeed, the impact assessment

“what-ifs” that arise under the various options. Precise
numbers of properties at significant flood risk or actually affected by
exclusion from Flood Re is a matter of speculation. I did not see much
property valuer input to all this—I declare an interest

insurance’s industry need to use automation, do not entirely
convince me.</hs_para>

form of market segregation of its own; the assumed continuation of risk

risk top-slicing, better knowledge and changing responses to risk are

despite the fallback provisions, I wonder about the Government’s
agency cost recovery implications on the Flood Re fund. The list of

band H houses, all small businesses, homes built after 2009 and more
will not come within Flood Re. It does not mean that they cannot get
insurance of some sort. But all sorts of numbers of properties that
would be most severely affected have been suggested. Whether or not
they are excluded from Flood Re, the numbers that will thereby lose
access to conventional loan finance—with or without an actual
flood risk—is entirely unclear. We need to get to the bottom of
that. It is the fact of exclusion that will start people worrying about

of value write-downs, though scant, I believe is none the less real. I
recommend that the Government urgently look into this in more detail,
together with lenders and property professionals, so that Flood Re does
not result in adverse consequences on the rebound of what we may put in
place under this Bill. That said, and in the absence of any better
ideas, I am bound to admit that for all its imperfections and
limitations Flood Re as a concept is the only solution currently on
offer, and I support it on that basis. I wish there was something that
would deal with the bits that it does not include. On that basis I can
assure the Minister that he has my general support at this juncture,

sustainable development as central to the work of the economic

those who paid water bills, and the environmental regulators, and to

closely in Committee; but I am green with envy that the regulators in

companies’ statutory right to compensation for losses resulting

be removed, with companies apparently compensated through the Ofwat

The Environment Agency regulates abstractions, and Ofwat is required to
consult the agency before issuing a water supply licence. So far, so
good. But—and it is a big but—very good though all this
sounds, there are a number of complications, some of which have been
referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, on the opposition Front
Bench. The upstream reforms set out in the Bill will make it easier for
new players to enter the water sector, possibly using new water
sources. What impact will that have on abstractions? The Government are
considering how to bring exempt abstractors into the licensing regime.
Furthermore, over a longer period the Government intend to reform the
abstraction regime to make it more flexible and resilient to the
challenges of climate change and population growth. Those reforms are
not part of the Bill and consultation is taking place. Information
about the amount of groundwater available for abstraction is not
reliable, and fresh research is being undertaken.</hs_parafo>

authorities, ignoring advice about the probability of flooding, going
ahead with large projects in places where they should never have taken
place and then complaining that flood defence precautions were
inadequate. Definitions of “high flood risk” and

Kennedy of Cradley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am new to thinking
about the issues surrounding the water industry. Therefore, like my

his officials for all the briefings and materials they have provided to
increase our understanding of this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000066">I have
learnt a lot but I am not completely reassured by that or by what I see
before me in the Bill. The water industry is huge and complex, with
impervious structures. It is made up of regional monopolies, which pay
little or no corporation tax and whose focus is turned towards their
shareholders rather than their customers. This all leads to the water
industry having a negative public image. Therefore, I believe that we
need a water industry that is better managed and better
regulated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000067">We
need to do more to modernise the industry, encourage innovation and
change the culture. We need to develop a water industry that looks
outwards towards the needs of its customers and deals adequately with
water affordability. That is what I expected to see in a Water Bill put
forward by the Government. After all, as has been mentioned, in the
Government’s own White Paper, <I>Water for Life</I>, there was a
whole chapter on developing a customer-focused water industry.
Therefore, while there are measures to be welcomed in the Bill, it is
disappointing that a focus on the customer is missing, especially as
water bills have increased by almost 50% in real terms since
privatisation. According to industry figures, 23% of households in
England and Wales spend more than 3% of their income on water and
sewerage bills, with 11% spending more than 5% of their
income. To me, that illustrates that the current approach to keeping
water affordable for all is
failing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000068">First,
there is a low take-up of the WaterSure scheme, which was introduced by
Labour to help households that have a high level of water use due to an
illness or because they have three or more children. According to the
Consumer Council for Water, only a fraction of families that are
eligible for help actually receive it. Why is that? It is because
customers do not know that help is available to them. Although there
has been an increase in take-up over the past six years, as Dame Yve
Buckland from the Consumer Council for Water said, it is merely a
“drop in the ocean”. Take-up has happened, and been shown
to increase, only when water companies are proactive. Whether they are
is, however, a matter for that company because it is voluntary.
Therefore, the Bill should include measures that require water
companies to promote the WaterSure scheme. Should we not have
arrangements with the DWP so that people who are entitled, and consent,
get the help they need?</hs_para>

nature of the establishment of social tariffs by water companies is
inept. Water companies are able to design social tariffs to help
customers most in need of support but only three have such schemes,
helping just 25,000 households. As it is voluntary to have a social
tariff scheme, many water companies have not bothered to set one up and
some have no intention of doing so. Whether or not you get 
<?notus-xml column=1023?>help with your bill therefore depends on where you live. That cannot be
right or

provision for the Government to require landlords to give
tenants’ details, but this has not been enforced. Why did the
Government choose to take a voluntary approach? I understand that the
new database for collecting tenants’ details will be ready next
year. The Bill should require landlords to use it or be held liable for
that debt. We also need to give Ofwat powers to act against water

do not work. As we will see, the voluntary approach to collecting
tenants’ details from landlords will not work. It is surely time

briefly to the issues of metering and new infrastructure projects.
Voluntary switching to water meters is on the increase. Around
one-third of properties have meters and this is set to rise to a half
by 2015. The Bill therefore needs to make sure that we protect
unmetered, low-income households from unaffordable bills that may arise
in areas with high levels of metering. Billions of pounds-worth of
infrastructure projects are already planned and the costs of these are
expected 
<?notus-xml column=1024?>to be passed on to customers. Do the Government know the overall impact
that this planned infrastructure will have on customers’ bills?
This Bill is a chance to ensure that we get to know the impact on
future bills, that everyone is getting value for money, and that there
is greater transparency in the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000075">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T17:29:45"></hs_TimeCode>
addition to water affordability I want to raise one other issue of
concern, which is borne out of my personal and local experience. As set
out by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, one of the Bill’s main
aims is to make it easier for new businesses and landowners to ensure
that the water market is providing new upstream services. Inevitably,
that will lead to new infrastructure, which is where my personal
experience leads me to suggest that more provision for public
consultation and public involvement is needed around any such future
infrastructure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000076">Where<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T17:30:22"></hs_TimeCode>
I live in Deptford, significant controversy surrounds Thames
Water’s proposed placement of the 46-meter shaft needed for the
Thames tideway tunnel. The proposed site is vehemently opposed by local
residents, and consultation on the site and where it is placed has been
inadequate. Thames Water’s promotional material illustrates how
the construction of the tunnel will be by the riverside, which it
largely is until we get to Deptford. Initially, the preferred site
promoted by Thames Water was by the river but, curiously, it changed
its mind and the site was moved inland to Deptford Church Street and
Crossfields Green. That is despite this being one of the only green
spaces in that area, being next to a listed church and a residential
estate, and being right next to a primary school. This has led to
nearly 1,000 local residents signing a petition against the proposed
site and some being involved in the campaign group, Don’t Dump
on Deptford’s Heart. It is estimated that up to 32 heavy goods
vehicles a day will be needed to service this site, causing road
closures, traffic mayhem and road safety fears. Obviously, there will
be an increase in the level of noise and air pollution.</hs_para>

is most disappointing is that Thames Water has confirmed that it is

that one of its justifications for choosing this site is that the local
people already suffer from noise and pollution, so they will not be

perfectly viable alternative exists. I hope that the flaws in Thames
Water’s plans will be recognised by the Planning Inspectorate.

I want to reiterate my central point regarding water affordability.
When dealing with rising energy bills, we may be able to heed the
advice of other Ministers to wear more jumpers but for water we cannot
take our buckets to the Thames. We all need 
<?notus-xml column=1025?>water to live. We therefore need the charging system to be urgently
brought up to date. We need a system that is affordable, fair and
sustainable. I agree with my noble friend Lord Whitty that we need a
review of how we all pay for water and how we use it. We need less
voluntary measures and more requirements for action. We need to deal
with bad debt, to increase the take-up of WaterSure, to insist on
social tariffs and to develop a national affordability scheme. The

making it a primary duty of Ofwat to secure the long-term resilience of
water supply and sewerage systems. But should there not be a national
policy statement for water?
We<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> already have
one for waste water, so why not one for water supply—our most
precious

will talk mainly on the Flood Re scheme, but before I do, I would like
to make two points. First, the Government are trying to encourage
landowners, such as farmers—I farm in Norfolk—to build
reservoirs and then sell excess water to the water companies. At first,
that seems a great idea, but I am sceptical about whether it will work
as on-farm reservoirs will probably be too small to make any meaningful
contribution. Even if they did, the quality of the water from the
on-farm
reservoirs<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> may
not be very good, as it may have high levels of nutrients, pesticides
and metaldehyde. There may also be problems for farmers piping excess
water from their reservoirs across other people's land to a treatment
plant<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000082">We
need the water companies to build more large reservoirs themselves to
store the necessary water. In the south-east of England, the last time
a reservoir of any size was built was probably the Bewl Water
reservoir, which holds 7 trillion gallons of water over a site of 1,200
acres. It was built in the early 1970s; 40 years ago. Since then, the
population and number of houses in the south-east have risen
dramatically and will no doubt continue to rise dramatically. It is
alarming that the Office for National Statistics estimates that if the
current trend persists, the population of this country could double
over the next hundred years—a frightening
thought<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. If we
do not build more reservoirs to capture water in times of plenty, all
that will happen in times of drought is that the water companies will
continue to extract water from the rivers, which by then will
themselves be gasping for

I share the concerns of those who say that it is cackhanded to be
bringing in upstream competition in water trading before the existing

have been an insurance underwriter, including home owners’
business, and I have worked in the London insurance market for about 30
years. Hundreds of underwriting businesses make up the London insurance
market and getting all those underwriters who write home owners’
business to make considerable compromises and agree willingly to this
deal has no doubt been no mean feat. I have no doubt that negotiations
have been very fragile and it has taken three years to get this far.
The not-for-profit Flood Re mutual, which will be owned and managed by
the industry, will offer flood insurance to the 500,000 home owners
most at risk, with an excess of £250 and a premium of between
£210 and £540, depending on council tax band.</hs_para>

solve many of the current affordability problems, but there are a few
exceptions. The first is that homes built after 2009 will not be
covered. That is not a new exclusion. Every developer has known that
under PPS25 homes should not be built in flood risk areas from that
date. Underwriters were insistent that they did not want anything in
the scheme that would encourage unwise or irresponsible development.
Also, the Government emphasise that where the Environment Agency
objects to a development on the grounds of flood risk, 97% of those
risks are refused by planners, so that is good news. Or is it? Of the
455,000 planning applications, the Environment Agency looks at only
6.6%. Obviously, it cannot look at all of them, but 6.6% does seem
worryingly

second exclusion is small businesses, which buy commercial insurance

able to take the necessary actions to reduce their flood risk. Happily,
my band H home is not in a flood risk

Re is a good scheme. It might not be perfect, and we could probably all
pick holes in it, but it will offer flood insurance to the vast

first concern is our being tempted to pass amendments to this scheme
with the best intentions that might render it unworkable. For instance,
we might want to include small businesses in the scheme, because, after
all, the Federation of Small Businesses reported that 20% of small
businesses were affected by flooding in 2012. The Association of
British Insurers and the Government looked at this and concluded that
it threw up more problems than it solved, hence the agreed

second concern is that there is significant scope in this Bill for the
Government to make secondary legislation. I do hope that this
Government, or indeed, a subsequent Government, are not tempted to
bring in any secondary legislation without first having consulted 
<?notus-xml column=1027?>and agreed with the Association of British Insurers, so that any rules
or refinements needed use Flood Re’s own procedures. We might
then get the intended

third concern is the clauses relating to the flood insurance
obligation. I understand that the Government feel that these are
necessary in case Flood Re proves unworkable, but the obligation would
be a very unusual measure that would effectively force a private
insurance company to sell a product whether or not it wanted to do so.
I hope the Minister can reassure the House that every effort will be
made to get Flood Re up and running, so that the obligation will never
be needed. I look forward to debating these and other matters in

the whole, I think that this is a good Bill which is much needed to
ensure that our watercourses, our water supplies, our water environment
and our water management safeguards are all in good condition to face
the future. Water, although not very highly valued by most people in
this country—particularly in one of the wettest Januarys for
years—is in fact the most valuable commodity on the planet. Ask
any scientist looking for signs of life in the universe or any African
farmer struggling with climate change, and you will find that water is
indeed the key to

is much good in the Bill, but to my mind it is lacking in
ambition—a point on which I shall expand. My main point is that,
even if the Government are right to proceed on a softly-softly basis, I
for one should like to see more enabling clauses that permit the water
industry to make more competitive and environmental progress without
having to wait for another water Bill, which, after all, is unlikely to
come along for a decade or
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000094">Let me run
through various aspects of the Bill to show what I mean. First, retail
competition for commercial customers is a good idea. As many noble
Lords have said, it has been beneficial to more than half the
businesses in Scotland, even if most of them ended up staying with
their existing supplier. The reforms in Scotland have also resulted in
household customers benefiting from the thought processes that such
non-domestic retail competition has provoked in the water companies,
but surely the end game must be to have retail competition across all
water customers, commercial and domestic. I am therefore surprised that
it appears we have to wait for another water Bill before such household
competition can be introduced. There ought to be some enabling clause
in this Bill to allow progress on this front, as and when it becomes
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000095">Having
said that, I for one would want to ensure that any future competitive
structure was to the benefit of all customers and did not lead to
de-averaging, and thus the unfair exploitation of rural and remote
rural customers. I am told that competition can happen without
de-averaging. Equally, it is important that water-saving activities by
retailers do not result in anti-competitive activities by wholesalers.
In other 
<?notus-xml column=1028?>words, the Bill before us lacks the “no detriment”
provisions of the Scottish legislation which protect both customers and
the
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000096">Moving
on to the next lack of ambition, I think that there is a total absence
of foresight over the question of metering. Southern Water, which
covers the most metered area in England, believes that 100% metering
would result in a 12% saving in water. That is a gigantic amount of
water to remove from the system day in, day out. This could be the most
environmental part of the Bill—if only it were there.
Furthermore, the current voluntary-only metering actually puts the
price up for those not metered and thus has proven negative social
implications. I realise that if there was a universal tariff for every
litre of water used, some poor households with large families, and
others, would find themselves worse off under 100% metering. However,
with transitional tariffs, social tariffs and even block tariffs and
the like, and with the meter in the house and not at the end of the
garden, it is perfectly possible for everyone to benefit from 100%
metering. There is absolutely no doubt that the environment would win
hands down—I repeat that there would be a 12%
saving.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000097">Furthermore,
100% metering results in retail water companies having a better and
more direct relationship with individual customers. So metering is good
for the environment and should also be good for customers. However,
there appears to be nothing about metering in the Bill. At the very
least, as I have said, there should be an enabling clause for greater
incentives for water suppliers to work towards 100% metering—if
that makes sense for their customers. The Government need to show some
leadership in this field. For instance, the current barrier of having
to prove the existence of a water-stressed area before promoting
metering is totally
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000098">Moving
on, I will touch on abstraction. Again, so far so good: upstream
transfers—good, in my book; the flexibility of buying water from
farmers’ winter storage reservoirs—good; and the free
surrender of unused water company abstraction licences—very
good. The latter unused licences have been hanging over the proper
economic and environmental management of our river basins for far too
long, and I am glad we are finally gripping that particular
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000099">However,
looking deeper at future plans for abstraction, I read the Defra
consultation document <I>Making the Most of Every D</I><I>rop</I> with
interest. It is rightly ambitious in its proposals and I would go with
either of the two main proposals that are in it. This is an important
subject as water becomes more and more valuable to a growing British
population, who are subject to ever more extreme climate events and yet
possesses an admirable desire to protect their environment. However, I
worry about the timetable. Why, as the consultation suggests, do we
have to wait until the 2020s before implementing any changes? This
would seem to be unnecessarily cautious. What guarantees do we have now
that anything is going to happen at all? Again, why can we not have an
enabling clause in the Bill or, at the very least, a time limit by
which any new scheme has to be introduced? I urge the Government to be
brave and to grip this issue firmly to bring about reforms as soon as
they can.</hs_para>

far, my comments have been largely about saving water and benefiting
the environment, but I want to cover two other areas. The first is
Flood Re, which I think is a good scheme and will work well. While I
suspect that many of us would prefer it to cover band H properties and
even SMEs, I recognise that the more it covers the greater will be the
cost to ordinary householders, so I support the boundaries as currently
proposed.</hs_para>

I am not sure that the cut-off date of 2009 can be quite so easily
defended. We have to bear in mind that a large number of people outside
the Westminster bubble, who bought houses in good faith which were
built after 2009, would have been unaware that an Act would be
introduced in 2014 which would make it impossible for them to benefit
from a government flood insurance scheme. After all, those houses were
built with the approval of local government through its planning
system, and it is quite possible that central government even
encouraged those people to buy them through its Help to Buy scheme. It
therefore seems grossly unfair to impose on largely unknowing
householders a retrospective date of 2009 for a scheme introduced in
2014. I think that people will be amazed to find that they are
ineligible, so it would be better to set a date in the future, or at
the passing of the Act, rather than holding the line on
2009.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000102">My last
point has not been mentioned so far in the debate but it came up in
Committee and on Report in the Commons. It is to do with the protection
of water supplies and the environment from fracking. I am very much in
favour of fracking. I wish to see the multitude of boreholes necessary
for a successful industry to be able to come into being in this country
with the minimum of fuss from the public. One of the great concerns of
the public is that their water supplies will be contaminated by stray
gas concentrations from the fracking process. The industry assures us,
and I believe it, that this is virtually impossible. All I can say is
that, in that case, the public liability insurance bond will not cost
them very
much.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000103">Meanwhile,
the Minister in the other place assured us that such a compulsory
insurance bond was unnecessary because the Environment Agency already
has powers to make the polluter pay in the case of any required
pollution clean-up and that, anyway, rigorous financial tests would be
carried out on the fracking companies which would ensure they were as
safe as the Bank of Scotland, so no government bailouts would ever be
necessary. Quite<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T17:52:18"></hs_TimeCode>
apart from the fact that not all the companies currently involved in
fracking exploration have totally pristine balance sheets—in
fact, in some instances, it is very much the opposite—I do not
believe that the public have confidence that the Government will not
have to step in to protect water supplies and the environment. So why
not insert a clause into this Bill which reassures the public that the
companies will take on their own liabilities through an insurance
bond—as they say, it should not cost them very much? I believe
that that would go a long way to reassuring some potential objectors
and thus help get the fracking industry off the ground, which I am keen
to see.</hs_para>

There is the reform of the abstraction system—much referred to
by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, my noble friend Lord Crickhowell and
others. There is the delivery of basin management plans with suitable
mechanisms for community participation. I recognise that since 1996, we
have made very little progress from the start made by my noble friend
Lord Crickhowell. There is the resolution of long-standing management
issues concerning sustainable drainage systems and investment in
catchment-sensitive farming schemes. All those are outside the Bill but

choice in the retail sector and a more joined-up approach to regulation

long-term pressures on the water sector and the environment. Frankly,
in previous years, after the time of the NRA but during the time of the

between Ofwat and the Environment Agency. I did not think that I would
ever feel sorry for the water companies, but I did when I understood to
what extent they were being regulated in contrary directions by those
two

and Wales must, in all humility, recognise that Scotland has been ahead
of us—and indeed of most of the rest of the world—in
promoting competition at the retail level, having introduced a retail
market for the supply of water and sewerage systems to non-household
customers in 2008. I was interested to hear from the Water Industry
Commission for Scotland of the significant benefits. We have heard some
figures cited. Those benefits have permeated not just to commercial
customers but down to household customers indirectly in terms of better
services, innovation, reduced environmental impacts and lower bills.
Indeed, one could say that the water companies in England have
benefited, because they have been able to compete as new entrants in
the Scottish retail market, and a number of them have done so. The
lessons learnt will no doubt prove invaluable once competition is
opened up in the English and Welsh retail
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000111">It is
important that we now at last achieve consistency between the Scottish

have drawn attention to four issues which need to be addressed in the
Bill adequately to reflect the lessons learnt in
Scotland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000112">The
first and foremost is an issue referred to by the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, which is the failure to have an exit provision for retail
companies which have, frankly, either lost interest, are losing money
or have failed adequately to provide a service that customers want. The
Government for some mysterious reason simply bottled out of the
inevitable conclusion of what happens when you introduce competition
and encourage innovation: some companies just have to drop out. The
EFRA committee, in its pre-legislative scrutiny, strongly recommended
that those companies should be allowed to exit the market, but the
Government—I simply do not follow this—have said that
they cannot accept that that is the sensible thing to do, but they
should contract out their retail services. Having read carefully the
Government’s response to the pre-legislative scrutiny, I remain
to be convinced and I am sure that we will have to look at that
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000113">The
other three issues raised by the Water Industry Commission for Scotland
are matters of more detail, concerning what is implied by a level
playing field between incumbent companies and new participants, and the
need to protect customers in remote areas from being discriminated
against by a two-tier pricing system. I recognise that the Government
have it much in mind to prevent just these things happening but there
are some detailed recommendations, which are perhaps best left for
Committee. I simply note that these concerns come from a background of
the successful delivery in Scotland of precisely what the Bill seeks to
deliver in England and Wales on retail competition. Any improvement to
the Bill suggested as a result of this experience should be
helpful.</hs_para>

Each has a role to play if new ways are to be developed for achieving
effective water management and mitigating the risk of surface water

sewerage undertaker to include the building and maintenance of SUDS

undertaker has to negotiate the right to discharge or else compulsorily
acquire the rights to discharge. Before 1989 sewerage undertakers had a
statutory right to discharge, as still exists for highway authorities.
If the Bill could extend that right again to sewerage undertakers, it
would encourage them to build and adopt SUDS rather than surface-water

Northumbrian it means “red river”. That is probably from
the iron oxide that has leached into it, but I prefer the definition

a Back-Bencher I enjoy the fact that you can focus on one issue alone.
This Bill is quite light on issues. I will not be focusing on many
other parts of the Bill, but I would raise the issue of competition.
Many noble Lords have talked about the value of competition in driving
down prices and, as the Scottish example has shown, there could be
short-term gains through competition. However, we should take on the
lessons learnt from the energy sector that the short-term gains might
turn into very long-term problems, especially with the issues of
extraction.</hs_para>

particularly welcome in the Bill, though, is the Government pushing
forward issues around the capex and opex problem and introducing the
new word “totex”, which is quite an ugly expression but
certainly may well help to deal with some of the fluctuations brought

issue that I want to focus on particularly was flagged up in the White
Paper as one that the Government were going to look at under concern,
but that dropped out of the draft Bill: the question of whether there
should be a duty on Ofwat in sustainability. Having watched the
pictures of flooding on the television this morning, and I think that
everyone who has ever dealt with a flood knows just how horrendous that
situation can be, I cannot believe that we do not face an issue with
climate change. We were facing a drought last summer. They said,
“If we don’t get a 200% normal rainfall pattern, we will
have to have hosepipe bans through the whole of 2013 and 2014”.
Luckily enough, we had over 200% of normal rainfall. Perhaps it is only
me who thought, “Over 200% of normal rainfall is not a normal
situation”. Now, of course, we have gone from drought to a
flood. With climate change, drought and flood are two sides of the same
coin, and we are going to face that in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:08:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government have come forward and said, “We don’t need the
word ‘sustainability’ as a duty because we’re
looking at resilience”. I believe that there is a massive
difference in how people view the terminology between
“resilience” and “sustainability”.
Sustainability is already written into the Bill—there is a
clause on sustainable drainage—but not as a duty for Ofwat. Why
do I believe that that is important? Because the regulator sets the
terms of the tariff that we pay and therefore what the water companies
can use that money
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000124">Unless
the regulator takes looking at sustainability in the long term really
seriously, we tend to end up with a much shorter-term decision-making

talking about only 20 years, or perhaps even less in some of the
assessments. I plan to be a water customer in 20 years’
time—with my family history, I probably will not be—and
it is quite possible that as a customer in 20 years’ time, I
will be paying a much higher bill because of the decisions we are
making now about the cost of living. When we talk about the squeezed
middle classes, I understand that water bills are going to be higher.
However, if we do not take those measures, the cost of water in a few
years’ time will be a great deal higher.</hs_para>

that much of what has gone in the White Paper is business as usual:
“We have always had a lot of water. Water is fine. We can deal
with it, and there will not be a problem”. That is not really
the case. I manage a private water supply—I have a
borehole—and it focuses your mind on some of the problems with
water. One of the major problems with water is the cost of extraction.
The cost of extracting water through a borehole is very high in energy.
Of course, water companies are some of the highest users of energy in
the country, so when we are talking about price sustainability, we also
have to think about how much it will cost us in energy terms, and
energy prices are going up quite dramatically.</hs_para>

about the fact that we tend to forget that the price covers not just
the extraction of water but the treatment of sewage. Dealing with a
blocked septic tank on a freezing cold Sunday morning in December
focused my mind on the problems of sewage on a personal level. We
should realise that as much energy is used in getting clean water to us
as is used in dealing with sewage and reprocessing the water.</hs_para>

that the water companies understand that sustainability is an issue.
That is where I have a slight disagreement with Ofwat. Ofwat has a
secondary duty of sustainability, not a primary duty. Many noble Lords
have talked about the regulator’s sustainability duty, but it is
secondary to economic regulation and means that sustainability has not
been as important. The issue is slightly more important now because
there is a real problem with which duties are undertaken by which
regulatory authority. In Committee in another place, the constructive
tension between the environmental regulator and the economic regulator
was referred to as leading to an optimal outcome in the periodic review
process. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, indicated that that might have 
<?notus-xml column=1035?>been the case in the past; however, the Environment Agency no longer has
a policy role and, while it gives guidance, it relates to statutory
duties and it no longer actively promotes an environmental agenda with
water companies. At the same time, the Environment Agency has been
given a duty to promote economic growth. No commensurate duties or
functions have been placed on Ofwat. This means that the creative
tension really no longer exists.</hs_para>

good for resilience—and I stress that I do not underestimate the
importance of a resilience duty—but it does not by default mean
that it is an environmental duty. Waterwise and other green NGOs feel
that there needs to be something stronger, such as a primary
sustainability duty on Ofwat to ensure that issues such as water
efficiency and catchment base solutions, which have been mentioned by
many noble Lords, and energy management come to the
fore.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012721000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012721000129">An issue
that often gets overlooked and was always overlooked in the energy
debate is that it is no longer business as usual. We are going to have
to change our habits in relation to water. We will have to start
thinking about water efficiency. We are one of the highest users of
water in Europe. We waste potable water—drinking water—by
washing our cars with it. That water has an energy cost that has been
processed and an environmental cost. We are going to have to start
changing fundamentally how we look at water efficiency. A water
efficiency duty placed on Ofwat would be a start to meeting that
sustainability agenda. The water companies already have a water
efficiency duty placed on them, but the water regulator tells them how
they can spend their money. If they are to change their attitude, then
we have to change the attitude of the
regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>. There
would be a question as to whether that should be through a primary duty

to be taken seriously. We could be facing a hosepipe ban now due to the
drought of 2012. We are going to see a great deal more of this
flip-flop between flooding on the one hand and drought on the other. I
do not think that hosepipe bans are going to be the worst of our
problems. When we go back to standpipes we will have a real issue. I
hope that this could be looked at. I first started having this argument
with Ofwat a number of years ago. One of the problems is that nothing
moves quickly in the water sector. The decisions we make now will have
fundamental implications for the future of the water industry. I very
much hope that the Government can look favourably upon a sustainability
amendment and, if not that, upon a water efficiency duty—I
understand the reliance duty incorporates issues of climate
change—and an energy duty. If not, I would feel that that had to
be imposed upon the

brought to life by measuring and comparing the efficiency of each
integrated water company, incentivising the least efficient companies
to narrow the gap. The Bill before the House today builds on the
discipline of the marketplace by providing a positive incentive to the

non-household customers are separated out is just not borne out by the

has a positive net present value of around £330 million.
Business Stream has improved both the quality and the price of retail

of more efficient companies and the replacement of the less efficient
ones. The ability of multi-site customers to contract with one or 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>two national retail service suppliers could lead to a reduced number of
bills and administration costs and improved comparability of
consumption information. For example, reducing one customer’s

that the noble Lords, Lord Selborne and Lord Cameron, have both raised
a number of points I wanted to cover, including the importance of
de-averaging, I would be interested to know of the Minister’s
views on two further issues. First, I am concerned by the desire of
both the Government and the Opposition to add additional duties to
Ofwat’s remit. The sectoral regulators exist to perform specific
functions that are generally economically focused. Ofwat was first
established to protect customers, because of the natural monopoly
nature of the water and sewerage sectors after privatisation, and to
ensure the continued delivery of the essential services those companies
provide. In contrast, organisations like the Environment Agency exist
specifically to protect the environment. Ofwat’s primary
statutory duties therefore require it to balance keeping
customers’ bills down with service quality at an acceptable
standard while still securing that companies have enough money to
continue to operate and deliver those essential
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000010">Economic
regulation works best when the focus of the regulator is narrow and
targeted: to protect consumers and to ensure that investors can earn a
fair return from an efficient company. To introduce a new primary duty
around resilience, or, as we have heard proposed, to elevate the
sustainable duty to a primary duty, could suggest that the Government
wish to water down those core functions. That was precisely why a
similar change to Ofgem’s duties was resisted during the passage
of the Utilities Act
2000<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:23:22"></hs_TimeCode>. My concern
is that the new duties and greater role for the Secretary of State will
inevitably increase the level of political involvement in the
activities of the regulator and will water down Ofwat’s focus on
protecting
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:23:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

retail market needs all participants to have access to clear and
accessible prices, clearly defined and common levels of service and
standard terms and conditions. We must ensure that incumbent water
companies are obliged to deliver a genuinely level playing field and
that the market codes are common for all participants in any particular
appointed area and do not have to be negotiated separately. Some
licence changes will inevitably be required to promote a level playing
field in the market between exiting companies and new
entrants<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:24:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000012">My
second concern is that existing legislation does not provide Ofwat with
the ability to modify water company licences on the basis of majority
agreement, as occurs in other regulated utilities. Instead, there is a
requirement for the individual agreement from all monopoly
companies—an approach which allows monopolies in the sector to
block sensible changes that would deliver a more effective market and
benefit
customers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000013">The
impact of this absence is perhaps best illustrated by my example about
retail exit. The OFT recently described “exit” as a vital
part of an effective market. This perhaps explains why 76% of water
companies support voluntary retail exit. However, this statistic is
important, because it also reveals that 24% of companies are
indifferent or opposed to something that will support the effectiveness
of the market. The point I want to make is that, under the current
arrangements, 24% of companies could stop progressive changes. This is
because each individual company would have a substantial influence over
the provisions that Ofwat needs to put in place to establish a level
playing field for all market participants. This change was a specific
recommendation made by David Gray to the Government when he reviewed
Ofwat in 2011. It is disappointing to see that the recommendations of a
regulatory expert have not been taken forward in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000014">I agree

when we look at the detail, my noble friend the Minister will be able
to reflect on some of the key issues surrounding the recommendations
being made to the House. Initially promoted as all embracing, the Flood
Re scheme was expected to exclude only a few households, but the latest

levelled by many in your Lordships’ House against the putative
wealth tax, whereby an increasingly elderly population, including many

tax” was covered by Anna Walker’s review in
2009—which, by the way, I recommend to your Lordships as
essential reading in this context—which recognised that the
rateable value of a property bears little relation to a

to small businesses, I note that none is to be protected, on the

available to them at all. As John Allan, national chairman of the
Federation of Small Businesses, recently warned, one in five small

the middle of the 19th century for a period of 100 years, the water
utilities in the UK and elsewhere became progressively concentrated
under public and municipal ownership. Then, in the UK in 1989, the
process was reversed through privatisation. Now the UK water utilities
are owned almost entirely by private profit-seeking firms, of which the
majority are in foreign ownership. The motives for privatisation in the
UK and elsewhere were both ideological and fiscal. By the late 1980s,
the water utilities were in a parlous state. Successive Governments,
who had been intent on limiting public expenditure, had been unwilling
to afford the necessary capital expenditure that was required 
<?notus-xml column=1040?>for maintaining the water network. The water mains were corroded and the
sewerage system was in a state of

effect of privatisation was to release the water industry from this
burden of financial stringency and to allow it to fund its investment
by borrowing from the financial markets. Soon, the beneficial effects
of the increased capital funding became evident. There were significant
improvements in the state of repair of the water network, and the
cleanliness of our rivers and beaches began to approach the standards
that had been mandated by European legislation. In the six years after
privatisation, the companies invested £17 billion,
compared with the £9.3 billion that had been invested in the six
years before

proponents of privatisation regarded the improvements as a validation
of their philosophy. However, the improvements were at a cost to the
consumers. Tariffs increased by 46% in real terms during the first nine
years after privatisation. Operating profits increased by 142% in the
first eight years, which is to say that they more than doubled. The
private profitability of the water industry has increased in the
ensuing years and has reached astonishing levels, but now there is an
impending crisis in the provision of the services. Our water supplies
are coming under increasing pressure as a result of a growing
population and a changing climate. The summer droughts and the winter

is appropriate, at this point, to examine what has happened to the
ownership of the industry since it was privatised, and to explain why
the Government can have little influence over its investment decisions.
The firms of the water industry have become vehicles for financial
profit-seeking by owners who have used their 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>guaranteed profitability to pay exorbitant dividends to themselves. In
fact, the ultimate ownership of the firms is often obscure and has to
be traced though hierarchies of holding companies back to private
equity companies, which often reside in offshore tax havens, or to
sovereign wealth funds. The tenure of ownership is often
fleeting—five years being a typical
duration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000028">The
owners have used the equity of the water companies as a means towards
some highly leveraged borrowing of funds that can be used for purposes
that have nothing whatever to do with the financing of investment in
the infrastructure of the water industry. The attraction of the water
companies to the financiers has been on account of the highly assured
income streams that they generate. There is no likelihood of a
reduction in the demand for water, and some generously remunerative
water tariffs are fixed for five-year periods by the regulator Ofwat.
Such circumstances are liable to lead to favourable appraisals by the
credit rating agencies, which enable the borrowing of funds at low
rates of interest.</hs_para>

a result of their borrowings, the leverage ratios of the water
companies, which are the ratios of their total borrowings to the
enterprise value—which is the sum of the borrowings and the
equity capital—have reached astronomical levels. It is reported,
for example, that the leverage ratio of Thames Water reached 80% in
2013; and figures as high as 95% have been reported for other
companies. On<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
the eve of privatisation, virtually all the enterprise value of the
water companies was in equity capital, which is to say that their
leverage ratios were close to zero. A high leverage ratio constitutes a
significant tax advantage. It implies that the debt servicing of the
company is predominantly via interest payments as opposed to dividend
payments. Interest payments are regarded as part of the operating costs
of the company and are deducted from the income before the residue is
taxed. By contrast, dividend payments enter into the calculation of the
tax liabilities.</hs_para>

disadvantage of a heightened leverage ratio is that it is liable to
prejudice the credit rating of the company. Given that variations in
the size of the dividend payments can provide a significant buffer in
the event of a loss of profitability, the financial vulnerability of a
highly leveraged company is increased and, therefore, its ability to
borrow is decreased. In consequence of its heightened leverage ratio,
Thames Water is facing financial difficulties and cannot borrow the
money it needs to finance the Thames Tunnel project. As a private
equity company it is unwilling to raise more equity, since this would
entail a loss of control in favour of the shareholders. Instead, it is
asking for help from the

activity<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T18:42:18"></hs_TimeCode>. One
characteristic of the Conwy river is that it rises very quickly and can
subside equally quickly, particularly after a high tide, but the flood

Members have spoken about sustainability, and they may be interested to
hear of some work that has been carried out in the area of the source
of the river Conwy. Some £300,000 has been allocated to
restoration work on the threatened Migneint upland peatbog on the
Conwy-Gwynedd border. The scheme has been funded by the National Trust
and Natural Resources Wales and supported by many volunteers. This
project, which is aimed primarily at saving a threatened Welsh
ecosystem which can store more greenhouse gases than the Amazon
rainforest, is recording impressive results according to scientists.
Miles of ditches dug on a large area of peatland over the past two
centuries have been filled with the aim of storing carbon and, at the
same time, reducing flooding in the valley below. Already, some
evidence is pointing to a slowing down of the rate at which the river
rises, as the run-off from the slopes of the Migneint and Berwyn
mountains is retained for longer in the
peatlands.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000040">Because
of the severity of the floods that we suffered in the Conwy valley in
2004 and 2005, we saw massive schemes put in place by the Welsh

Neville-Rolfe (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend the
Minister has persuasively outlined the case for this Bill and has been
very helpful in providing advance information to all sides of the
House, for which I thank him. I was especially struck today by the list
of innovations that he and my noble friend Lord Moynihan outlined.
These are just the sort of things that improve life for business and
consumers in a quiet way.</hs_para>

technical subject. We have a 230-page Bill to scrutinise and I know
that many noble Lords are better versed in the intricacies than I am.
However, I want to make three general points. I come to the subject as
a businesswoman, including a directorship in a UK company, 2 Sisters
Food Group, that uses water in its production, and as a farmer’s
daughter. We had two large lakes on the farm where I was brought up, a
constant menace to generations of adventurous children like ourselves.
The Bill offers the prospect of making such lakes valuable assets in
which to invest rather than simply a dangerous
liability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000048">One
of my main interests is improving UK competitiveness, so that we are
not left behind in the global race. One key to competitiveness is good
infrastructure and investment in things like water. Water is, of
course, a central part of industrial production in a range of sectors,
from beverages, such as whisky, to car manufacturing. I have chosen
these examples because they are both important export industries too.
Water is important in many businesses and, as others have said, is
essential to life and to civilisation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012729000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000049">With our population
expected to rise to 70 million by 2027, our water infrastructure will
come under huge pressure, especially in the south and east. That brings
me to my first point. Are we doing enough? Does the Minister think that
this Bill will encourage the large-scale investment that we need? Many
believe that in decades to come we will need major strategic and
co-ordinated investments in the water sector; for example, by providing
for large-scale movements from 
<?notus-xml column=1045?>surplus to deficit areas. Are we doing enough in this Bill or,
crucially, somewhere else to provide for this
possibility?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000050">If
you have visited the Pont du Gard, Rome or Bath, you will know that the
Romans had the right approach to the subject. Can we learn from
experience overseas? I have talked to the Californians about the
problems of raising revenue for water schemes for both consumers and
agriculture in the Napa Valley. I have talked to the Spanish about the
more successful catchment investments that they have made to support
salad and other crops in southern Spain, which serve the UK market in
winter. I recognise that the Bill is not seeking to do everything but
it is important for your Lordships’ House to understand the
wider strategic
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000051">Secondly,
I am concerned about the quality of our regulatory regimes. Water is an
important example and, as it is a natural monopoly without substitutes
of the kind you find in energy or telecoms, the regulatory regime is
even more important. I am very glad to see the increase in competition
that will be encouraged and to hear today of the positive experience in
Scotland. However, I have a concern that the new regime for competition
with its new market operator, appeals to the Competition and Markets
Authority, charging guidance and charging codes, and any new
regulations made under the new powers, when fitted together with the
existing Ofwat regime and the work done by the Environment Agency could
be bureaucratic and therefore prone to
error.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000052">Having
too many layers and agencies can risk regulatory arbitrage, confusion
and excess bureaucracy. More expensive people will be hired and they
may waste resources chasing each other and having endless meetings.
Consumers, business, the water industry and Parliament will not be
quite sure who to hold to account on what. Will the Minister let us
know what steps are being taken to prevent overlap and confusion in
this vital utility and perhaps comment on the scale of new staff and
administrative costs that he expects to be
incurred?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000053">My
third and final point relates to how we ensure the right balance
between the all-important current consumer and investment for the
long-term resilience of the system. Ofwat is to be given a new
overarching duty, on which many speakers have touched today. Under this
resilience objective, Ofwat will have to secure the long-term
resilience of water supply and sewerage
systems,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012729000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000123">“as

all comes at a cost. No doubt the regulatory formula for the water
companies, many of which are now unfortunately owned abroad, will be
adjusted to take these duties into account. Let me share my concern. I
am not sure whether to worry more that the incentives will be too low
for proper investment in our water infrastructure or the
opposite—that too much investment will go into resilience and
sustainability at a guaranteed 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>high rate of return. Certainly, as my noble friend Lord Crickhowell
suggested, it will take time to see how the system pans
out.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="14012729000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000055">Major
infrastructure always raises such intergenerational issues, as my noble
friend Lady Parminter suggested, because the necessary investments are
so long term. It is a real dilemma suitable for the forthcoming debate
in your Lordships’ House. I support the Bill because it is
taking this sector in the right direction. I look forward to my noble
friend the Minister’s reply on the three points that I have
raised and to participating in

I will restrict my remarks to three fairly high-level points. First, a
number of noble Lords have referred to the question of the interface
between the range of regulatory bodies involved in the areas of water
provision, water discharge and flood containment. It would be of use to
the whole House during further consideration of the Bill if the
Minister were to agree to concisely put down, perhaps in a note in the
Library, the present view of the responsibilities of the agencies
involved and the accountability between them. One thinks immediately of
Ofwat, the Environment Agency, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, Defra
itself and, certainly in the discharge of water, the whole range of
organisations involved in sustainable urban drainage
systems—SUDS, as referred to by the noble Earl, Lord
Selborne—and other related matters. It is hard to find this in a
coherent and consistent manner at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000061">I
turn now to the question of a high-level, long-term national water
strategy. I am not clear where the responsibility for that lies. I have
searched the websites of the various regulatory bodies and Defra in
vain to find an answer. I may have simply looked in the wrong places
and not found it, but it is clear, to me at any rate, that we need a
long-term strategy to deal with the challenges of climate change and
increasing urbanisation. We need to be looking at a range of possible
future 
<?notus-xml column=1047?>scenarios for 25 or more years ahead. We may indeed find that the
resilience criteria need to be changed and that more major
infrastructural developments are needed as we understand climate change
better<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
reason for doing this now is that infrastructure developments are
extremely slow to build. It is a long, slow

is also worth pointing out that because moving water is expensive, the
first solution to water problems should be sought within each catchment
area. This does not mean that there ought not to be water transfer
around the country. However, it is likely to be an expensive solution
if done on any large scale. It does mean that we have to look hard at
local solutions, and these have to start, as many have said, with
reducing waste and leaks, or other
deficiencies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:00:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000063">Beyond
that, desalination has to be considered. The plant built by Thames
Water in the Thames estuary is an example. To declare an interest, a
company of which I am a director is providing the desalination plant
with renewable energy. In many urban situations, however, as the
Minister pointed out, particularly those located away from the sea, the
solution may well lie in regenerating and purifying sewer water to
potable standards. In this way a city could make an approach to being
water self-sufficient. There is of course, as the noble Lord, Lord
Redesdale, has pointed out, a serious energy penalty. Enhanced storage
of water will also have a role to
play.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000064">A good
example of both long-term strategic thinking and a resilient system is
Singapore. Again I have to declare an interest, having for some time
co-chaired the Public Utilities Board’s advisory committee on
water and environment. Singapore now has what are described as four
taps: water imported from Malaysia by pipeline, rainfall water from its
own catchments, water from desalination, and so-called new water
produced by the reprocessing and purification of waste water. The
outcome of this long-term strategic programme is a resilient system
implemented by private

I shall say a few words on R&amp;D. The UK water industry has had a
poor record in recent years. Investment in water R&amp;D has given a
number of countries, some of them small, major positions in the
international water industry—an industry that will necessarily
grow with the world population and with the increased expectations of
that population for higher living standards. Two examples of small
countries that have built international reputations in water science
and technology are the Netherlands and Singapore. For our part, we have
had a regulatory regime imposed by Ofwat that made significant
investment in long-term fundamental research virtually pointless, and
indeed impossible. I understand that Ofwat has now changed its policy,
but there is a lot of ground to make
up<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>. A second
problem is that, with the investor profile described partly by the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, but also in the recent document by the New
Policy Institute, the UK water companies tend to be seen simply as
reliable and steady sources of income rather than as companies that
should explore new technology that might lower costs, let alone earn
from their
R&amp;D<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000066">It
is sufficient to say that at the most recent major international water
meeting that I attended there were nearly 1,000 companies exhibiting
their products. Among them I found only three from the UK, all
concerned 
<?notus-xml column=1048?>with pipelines. I have already drawn attention to the energy cost of
purifying water to potable standards. This is now largely done with
reverse osmosis membrane technology. The challenge is to devise
membranes that will have lower energy demands. Singapore is one of the
global leaders in this field. This is one example but there are a host
of other examples of useful and applied research where this country has
little or no presence, meaning that we are simply going to be
followers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000067">The
relatively small R&amp;D capacity of UK water companies means that many
do not have the competence in-house to be an intelligent customer for
new technology and, as a consequence, tend not to use or exploit new
technologies. That means that they will not be able to achieve the
efficiencies and consumer price reductions that are urgently
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000068">Water<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:05:16"></hs_TimeCode>

is the greatest national threat that the UK faces, and the risk is
rising. In recent years, this increased risk has been reflected in the
number and cost of major flood events that property insurers cover. In
the 1990s, there were two flood events with a claim cost of more than
£150 million for insurers. In the first decade of this century,
there were five such events, including the 2007 floods, which cost

welcome the fact that Flood Re will effectively limit what most
high-risk households should have to pay for the flood component of
their home insurance. Although the current statement of principles

sure that the clarity for those customers whom Flood Re will cover will
be most welcome. Prices will be set according to council tax bands so
people will know the maximum that they could be asked to pay. Moreover,
it seems perfectly fair that those who are in smaller properties should
not have to pay as much for flood insurance as some of those in larger
houses. Support would be targeted at those who need it most, and the
level of excesses charged by insurers controlled. The fact that the
levy on all home insurers that will be used to fund the scheme in

for those excluded from Flood Re, there continues to be genuine concern
about both the availability and affordability of flood insurance. Some
criticism has been levelled at the Government for these proposals based
on the fact that Flood Re will not cover houses built after 2009. A
cut-off date is needed to maintain a signal to planning authorities
that all developments must be appropriate and resilient to flooding.
However, a 2009 cut-off is unnecessary, as policy planning statement 25
has been in force since then. There is not a significant number of
properties that have been built in flood-risk areas since 2009. These
have been subject to planning policy statement 25. An alternative
cut-off date of 2014 would mean that home owners in flood-risk areas
would get the protection they need without materially affecting the
ability of the scheme to deliver its
objectives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000076">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:12:10"></hs_TimeCode>

a cause for concern to the Federation of Small Businesses, the British

ultimate goal of Flood Re is to pave the way for a smooth transition to
the free market. If that were successful, it would be most welcome,

free market for flood insurance which successfully preserves widely
available and affordable flood insurance for those at high flood risk
without some form of government involvement. With that in mind, I seek
further explanation from my noble friend on how the transition in the

an eventual free market will be

what, if any, safeguards will be in place to ensure that premiums do
not rise considerably once a free market is established? I look forward
to my noble friend’s answer on that issue. Although a
contingency plan in the form of the flood insurance obligation is being
legislated through the Bill, I know that from the industry perspective
there is strong feeling that that must be avoided. Perhaps that is not
a bad thing, because it makes the incentive for Flood Re to work even
greater. However, there are real concerns about placing an obligation
on each insurer to take a proportionate share of high flood-risk
households. The obligation would be the first time that insurers were
forced to provide a type of cover to a high-risk home owner-occupier

would force insurers to compete with each other for the business of
high-risk households in order to meet their targets, there is a danger
that that could make some insurers withdraw from the market, reducing
capacity, competition and choice, and resulting in increased prices. I
believe that there is a risk that this measure, intended to help
customers to shop around, would in fact limit their ability to do that
very thing. It could also negatively affect those at low flood risk, as

competition, I will concentrate on Part 4 of the Bill concerning flood
insurance. Here, I must declare an interest, or a residual interest,
because I was, until June, the chief executive of a Lloyd’s
insurance company and a London market reinsurance company, which was a
member of the ABI. Although I am not now an employee, I am still the

available and affordable to all, as is the intention of the Bill, is a
common problem in many countries and the temptation to interfere in the
open market is fraught with difficulties. In the United States, for
example, the National Flood Insurance Program was created in 1968 and
allows property owners in participating communities to buy protection
from the Government. The problem with government schemes is that the
correct risk-adjusted rate is not charged, so the program is now about
$30 billion in deficit. When you try to correct it, as the
Biggert-Waters Act of 2012 was seeking to do, you get huge rate
increases. In this case, there were increases of up to 400% for some

body. In agreeing to this, recognition should be paid to the insurance
industry for agreeing to maintain the statement of principles until
Flood Re is up and running. The industry has an incentive to make the

Re will be an improvement because it makes affordable insurance
available where it is not today. All insurers, new and old, are on a
level playing field. Of course, there is nothing to stop an insurer
keeping high-risk flood properties and not ceding them to Flood Re if
it can get what it judges to be the correct risk-adjusted rate. That
happens in many countries. There are, however, a number of potential
problems, which will no doubt be addressed in Committee.</hs_para>

that, in the early years, a large-scale flood or series of floods over
several months could exhaust Flood Re’s resources. That is a
possibility although an extremely remote one. Like all insurance
companies in the Solvency II world, Flood Re will be capitalised to a
one in 200 level. In other words, it will have enough resources with an
appropriate level of reinsurance—and assuming that the internal
model is correct—to cover 99.5% of the losses that it could ever
expect to face. This takes into account possible model errors and a
host of other variables, which have to be documented and validated
before the internal model is approved by the PRA. One in 200 is far
more remote than any recent losses. Even the floods of 2007, which
would have had an estimated £400 million cost to Flood Re, would
have had to be six times worse—to be accurate, the reinsured
loss amount would have to be about six times higher—to exhaust
the likely level of the reinsurance
programme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000092">In
the event of a shortfall, the member insurance companies could be asked
for a top-up levy to enable Flood Re to pay out its contractual
aggregate limit after which, like any reinsurance arrangement, the
liability falls back on the insurance companies that wrote the original
business. The insurance industry has accepted this risk. While not
incurring any contractual liability, the Government have affirmed in
the memorandum of understanding with the industry that they bear
primary responsibility for dealing with a flooding event with a greater
than one in 200 return
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000093">Secondly,
there are exceptions that Flood Re will not cover. These are mainly
areas that are not covered anyway today by the statement of principles,
such as houses built after 2009, to which the noble Lord, Lord Cameron
of Dillington, referred, commercial properties and SMEs, and
potentially genuinely uninsurable properties, although this will not
happen at the outset of the scheme. If the intention is to move to
free-market pricing, albeit over 25 years, it would surely be odd to
increase the scope of the market intervention at the
outset<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:25:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

details to be addressed before Flood Re can begin operations, which
makes mid-2015 an ambitious target. The reinsurance protections will
have to be bought in the open market. Flood Re will have only a finite
amount of ceded premium and levy available to pay for that reinsurance,
and whether or not the market will provide the required aggregate limit
at an acceptable price remains to be seen. The fact, too, that it has
to be bought under public procurement rules makes the exercise more
time consuming. June 2015 is an ambitious timetable, with more than
170 open work packages to complete. Anyone who has been
involved with Solvency II preparation, the validation of an internal
model and the approval of the very onerous documentation requirements
will know that is not trivial and that timely authorisation from the
PRA should not be taken for
granted<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Nor, by
the way, should EU authorisation for state aid, and I would be

and, to me, worryingly, it seems that Flood Re is going to be the most
regulated company in the insurance market. It has been set up
deliberately as a private regulated insurance company, but there will
also be public arrangements for oversight due to the levy that will
raise an estimated £180 million. Because of that, all the
panoply of public supervision will be imposed in addition to the normal
regulation that Parliament and the European Union have seen fit to
impose. Actually, £180 million is really not a great deal of
money—to put it in context, insurance premium tax alone raises
more than 16 times as much. Nevertheless, as a result, Flood Re will be
regulated by the PRA and the FCA. The National Audit Office will assess
the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of its operation. There will
have to be a responsible officer directly accountable to Parliament.
There may well be scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee. Defra will
be held accountable to Parliament because Flood Re will be part of its
accounts, with obvious implications for Flood Re’s compliance
and governance costs. Commenting on this, Defra’s briefing note

risk of severe flooding to get affordable insurance following the end
of the statement of principles with the insurance industry that has
been in place since 2000. As others have commented in the past, my
accent betrays my heritage. In Somerset, as all can see from television
and newspaper coverage, especially today, the landscape changes
dramatically in winter, sometimes for short periods but currently for
much longer ones. This has always been a problem for the levels, but it
is definitely getting worse. In the winter of 2012-13, the village of
Muchelney was cut off for weeks, and it is now cut off again. The fire
brigade has done a brilliant job ferrying people to and fro, and the
county council has assisted in building a pontoon for villagers to
access boats so that they can do their shopping and get to work. The
great British community spirit has risen above all the difficulties.
Nevertheless, residents in long-term flooded areas are suffering stress
and the beginnings of mental health
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000115">While
welcoming the proposals for Flood Re, like others, I am concerned about
some of the exclusions. Many small businesses that operate on the
Somerset Levels will find it impossible to get insurance if they are
not included in Flood Re. At a time when the economy needs every job it
can get, it seems short-sighted in the extreme to be putting the
viability of those businesses at risk. As I understand the Bill, some
mixed hereditaments are included in Flood Re, but this seems to be
dependent on whether they are assessed for business rates. Similarly,
private rented and leasehold households are excluded. When everything
we know about housing is that it is in short supply, to again
jeopardise that supply by pushing private landlords out of the market
could be discriminatory. It is generally a requirement of mortgage
lenders that insurance is in place. To have insurance that excludes
flooding is not wise. Are the flood-prone areas therefore to become
devoid of population as people are forced to move to higher ground in
order to be able to get the insurance cover needed to have access to a
mortgage?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000116">Internal
drainage boards comprise local people who know their area and its
problems. They can often see what solutions might be needed and could
implement fairly low-cost works to alleviate some of the flooding.
Disaggregating the drainage board levy from local authority council tax
is vital to enable the boards to operate effectively and efficiently.
Enabling them to assess what is required and then raise the necessary
levy in order to carry out remedial works is key in helping to restore
public confidence that the issue is being taken
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000117">Lastly,
I wish to raise the issue of the value placed on agricultural land. As
can be seen on our television screens, acres of agricultural land are
underwater for large portions of the year. This is affecting
farmers’ ability to earn a proper living and placing their
families at risk. Again, there is a risk to mental health as well as to
health and well-being. When it comes to flood defence works, to what
extent do the loss of earnings and devaluation of the land figure in
the calculations about which areas qualify for flood alleviation works
and which do not? How does adequate funding for repairs get taken into
consideration? Some form of 
<?notus-xml column=1055?>financially sustainable system needs to be in place in order for the
land to be farmed effectively. Land cannot just be left fallow year
after year. Land does not look after itself, as I am sure all the
farmers here know. It needs constant managing in order to get the best
out of it. Farmers need encouragement, not obstacles and difficulties.
This is a very real issue and one that I hope we can address during the
passage of this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000099">I

Borwick (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, first, I welcome this Bill as a
much needed change to the legislation. I thank South West Water, which
invited me to a water works and sewage works in Exeter to brief me on
the industry and show me how it works in practice. I little thought
that on entering your Lordships’ House my first visit to a
company would be to a sewage
works.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000101">There
are several challenges facing the supply and regulation of water in the
UK, and the Bill sets out eminently reasonable reforms to ensure a
long-term plan for improving our infrastructure and for providing
better value for customers. The best way to improve the efficiency of
suppliers and to drive down costs for customers is of course to allow
more competition. Of course, the real task for any new competitor is to
understand the legislation, the rules and regulations. The length of
the Bill hinders that somewhat. Perhaps we are, oddly, overregulating
to allow more
competition<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:35:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bill seeks to allow new entrants into the market with more upstream
competition and more competition for business customers. However, I
wonder if this extension of upstream competition is slightly out of
sync with reform for abstraction licences. The Government are concerned
that the water supply is limited and are rightly looking at reforming
these licences, the system for which was set up in the 1960s. Reforms
will make abstraction more sustainable, but this probably is not
happening for another two years or so; indeed, a consultation was
launched only last month. Even with a more competitive market and more
upstream competition, we may not have the surge in new entrants that we
want until they have more certainty on the future of abstraction
licences. It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>
would be disappointing if good reforms were hindered in the short term
because they are not aligned with other important steps being taken.
However, I am sure that hindered reforms are better than no
reforms.</hs_para>

specifically covered in the Bill, I will talk briefly about the issue
of identifying tenants, which surely must be an area of future
consideration. At present, there is a premium of around £11 per
household on all water bills because of bad debts. Water companies do
not know who the occupiers are, as they are often short-term renters.
Sometimes a property will have a high turnover of tenants, too, making
the problem worse. Enabling legislation to make landlords identify the
tenants who are liable for unpaid bills does exist but has not been
implemented. This may seem like more bureaucracy for landlords, but it
would arguably add no more burden than the checks they already have to
make to make certain that 
<?notus-xml column=1056?>they get paid the rent, and information they already give—for
instance, to the immigration authorities. Ultimately, everybody pays
for the failure to successfully recover unpaid
debts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000104">There
are two causes of bad debt for water companies: those who cannot pay
and those who will not pay. For those who cannot pay, we already have
mechanisms in place. The social tariff exists, in most water companies,
for customers on an income below £15,800. That tariff is usually
applied to those in arrears, if they can demonstrate that they cannot
pay. For those who will not pay, marking their credit rating will at
least reduce their ability to take credit in the future, to the benefit
of future
lenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000105">Perhaps
we also ought to look at reduced flow measures. Essentially, those who
will not pay their water debts would receive a water supply only
sufficient to enable them to drink. However, the reduced flow would
make it inconvenient to use the supply in other ways, such as for
baths. Such measures were made illegal in the Water Industry Act 1999.
However, they are applied in certain Australian states, so measures
like this ought to be considered. After all, I am sure that we would
like to see a reduction in the bills of ordinary and honest families.
This could be a way to achieve
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000106">It is
good to see the Government addressing the affordability of flood
insurance for those in high-risk areas. However, I have one small point
of concern with the flood reinsurance scheme. While flood reinsurance
seems to be backed by industry, perhaps we need to think more
fundamentally about where many areas of housing are located. We would
all argue that it is simply not a good idea to have lots of housing in
an area of high risk and frequent
flooding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012729000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012729000107">As
the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, referred to shot foxes: the Bill has
simple aims, and indeed, it was summarised in only four pages. However,
it is 230 pages of dense text, including 81 clauses in four
parts, and has no fewer than 12 schedules. Is it possible that the
drafting team for the roughly 700-page Finance Bill, having taken a
rest after passing their Bill through the other place, leapt to what
passes for immediate action to draft this particular legislation?
Battalions of people have been interpreting the Finance Bill for a
living, but they are threatened by the welcome creation of the Office
of Tax Simplification. I hope that they do not believe that this is an
employment scheme to ensure that they will be able to find their metier

I must say that it is a rare thing indeed for a Bill to have so much
support from the industry concerned. That is not to say this Bill is a
gift to the industry, to the customer’s detriment. It rather
suggests that quite sensible and thorough reforms are contained in the
Bill. Credit must go to the Government—and to the

Grantchester (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Water Bill has very much
to commend it, and has been commended around the House. I will start by
declaring my interest, 
<?notus-xml column=1057?>albeit a very minor one, as a dairy farmer. I am very aware of the price
rises that have come through in recent years, and due to my experience
in the dairy industry I am not at all surprised that a milk
co-operative of farmers is leading the way in some of the advantages in
Scotland. I thank all Members today for their contributions, the
Minister for his introduction, and thank him and his officials for the
helpful discussions he has conducted with all sides of the House. We
have also received many briefings, which have been very helpful,
especially the information from and discussions with the Water Industry
Commission for Scotland. The noble Earl, Lord
Selborne<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:42:20"></hs_TimeCode>,
underlined the importance of understanding the benefits achieved and
the lessons
learnt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012733000002">All
sides of the House have come forward with a general welcome, but I am
sure that the Minister is in for a very heavy and intense Committee
stage, as all noble Lords expressed concerns when they got into the
detail of what is involved in the Bill. My noble friend Lord Whitty
outlined our approach, and his description of the industry shows that
reform is required. The need for reform of the industry was echoed
throughout the Chamber. There is a welcome choice for businesses and
household customers by allowing them to switch suppliers. The noble
Lord, Lord Cameron, called for more ambition, and competition without
de-averaging was brought up around the House, especially by the noble
Lord, Lord Moynihan, and other noble
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:43:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012733000003">Improved
services and innovation were a key focus of many comments, and there
was also<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:39:29"></hs_TimeCode> a keen
focus on customers, which my noble friend Lady Kennedy deemed to be
missing. She mentioned the WaterSure scheme and the necessity of a
change of culture. The ensuing downward pressure on prices was also
welcomed around the House, especially by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter. That leads to improved
infrastructure, which was a keen focus of the noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T19:43:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Neville-Rolfe, whose speech I would sum up as a cry of, “We can
do better”. I look forward to many of the Minister’s
replies on the infrastructure and resilience of the water provision.
That was an important part of the speeches by the noble Baroness, Lady
Parminter, the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, and the noble Earl, Lord
Cathcart. Indeed, there was a general call—in particular from
the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, my noble friend Lady Kennedy, and
the noble Lord, Lord Borwick—for a sharpening up of real action
to be applied through the use of databases, metering, and the achieving
of a more ambitious leadership, which the noble Lord, Lord Cameron,
also
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012733000004">The
Minister will need to explain to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, how the

hospitals, and multisite companies, will also benefit from dealing with
one supplier, and from an invoice rationalisation. Extending the scope

important reason for this Bill is the introduction of the Flood Re
scheme. One half of the question to the issue concerns flood defences,
a matter addressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Humphreys. We support
the Flood Re scheme and encourage measures to make insurance
affordable, just as we hope the Government will ensure that water bills
are affordable for all. Households in areas of risk from flooding can
find it difficult to obtain affordable insurance. Various aspects of
this were of keen interest to the noble Earl, Lord Lytton. That is why
the previous Government began negotiations with the insurance industry
to establish a levy-funded insurance pool for households at high risk
of flooding, aimed at keeping premiums affordable.</hs_para>

of properties at high risk of flooding. The main risk is not static,
with the Government’s own figures showing over the next
15 years alone, 1 million more people could be put at
significant risk of floods because of climate change. The Government
have rejected clear advice from the Committee on Climate Change that
the flood reinsurance scheme fails to take into account the likely
increase in numbers of at-risk properties as a consequence of climate
change, and fails to incentivise flood resilient repairs to at-risk

flood damage since 2000 has increased 200% on the previous decade. At a

he agree that having only 25,000 homes on a social tariff is vastly
insufficient? Labour would like to see the introduction of a national
affordability scheme with a single eligibility criterion for assistance
with bills, and which requires all companies to participate in and fund
the scheme. Regulation of the existing regulatory price control regime

environmental safeguards will be in place regarding upstream reform. In

unsustainable abstraction or deterioration in the catchment, or it

these important points and that some noble Lords who have spoken and
stakeholders such as Blueprint for Water have welcomed the changes.
This new duty is an important contribution to the regulatory framework.
It will ensure that regulation of this sector takes appropriate account

achievement of sustainable development since 2005. We have also issued
statutory guidance, which states clearly that sustainable development
is central to everything that Ofwat does and must be fully embedded
throughout its regulatory decision-making. We have thought carefully
about how to change Ofwat’s duties to support action to address
the long-term challenges facing the sector and encourage better
outcomes for customers and the environment. The best means of doing

Ofwat already has a primary duty to protect consumers, and this

fair way to pay. We want companies to do more to promote metering to
those who would benefit, although it is important to remember that some
struggling customers would see their bills rise. Therefore, water
companies are best placed to find the most appropriate local solution
in discussion with their customers. The costs and benefits of metering
vary from region to region, depending on the level of water stress. As
the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, said, and to answer the noble Baroness,
Lady Kennedy, metering has winners and losers. Some bills go up and
some go down. The evidence suggests that there is not a very good

and I need to be absolutely clear about this. It is not something that
we have completely ruled out for the future, but at present the risks
of retail exit outweigh the potential benefits. First, we feel strongly
that water companies must continue to be responsible for all parts of
the supply chain. They must have a connection with their customers.
Secondly, there is a risk that retail exit would be forced on the
sector. That is not a risk we are prepared to take: it should be for
Ministers and Parliament to decide whether or when separation should
take place. Thirdly, we must not forget household customers, who will
not be able to switch. If we allowed retail exit, householders could be
left stranded with a water company with little incentive in investing
in customer service once it had washed its hands of its business
customers. This would effectively create a two-tier water market, with

pay a share of the total costs of running the network.</hs_para>

distinguish between the different kinds of costs that are reflected in
water bills. It makes sense to share the costs of maintaining the
network on which all customers rely—more than 90% of water
charges—across all customers, regardless of their location. The
use of average pricing for such charges is common practice in
comparable sectors such as gas, electricity and telecoms where
regionally averaged network prices have remained the norm following 
<?notus-xml column=1063?>liberalisation of those industries. However, I think that many noble
Lords would agree that there could be real benefits from increasing the
cost reflectivity of charges for different sources of water. It would
reflect the environmental costs of supply, which is especially
important in water-stressed areas or for business users that use large
volumes of water. Our charging principles make it clear that the
Government’s detailed charging guidance to Ofwat will place
limits on the scope of any de-averaging of
prices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0002.htm#14012733000031">The
noble Lord, Lord Cameron, and my noble friends Lord Selborne and Lord
Moynihan referred to the Scottish model. The vast majority of our
approach to retail competition is very similar to Scotland, but water
is a devolved matter and the systems are different. Scotland has no
upstream competition; the Scottish market is much smaller than the
potential retail market for England; Scotland has only one incumbent
retailer and one wholesaler. There are 19 integrated incumbent water
companies in England and Wales. Our approach to retail competition is
being developed jointly with the industry, along with the Scottish and
English regulators and others. This group is well placed to identify
the conditions that will work best in England, building on the Scottish

incumbent companies act appropriately. They must not be able to abuse
their dominant positions. We have carefully considered the issues

am running short of time. Noble Lords have raised important issues
about the various categories of exclusion. I hope that noble Lords will
forgive me if I confine my remarks to saying that Flood Re is designed
to help those who are struggling most to afford rising insurance
premiums. Flood Re targets financial support to those at the lower end
of the income spectrum by providing proportionately more support to
those in council tax bands A to C. In designing Flood Re, a balance has
had to be struck between supporting those at the highest risk and
managing the impact on those at low risk. Including additional policies
within Flood Re could not be achieved without decreasing the level of
support going to those most in need or increasing the levy paid by all
households. Perhaps we can talk further either before or during

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Nash)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this order enables the Secretary of State
to extend and amend the pilot scheme made under the Special Educational
Needs (Direct Payments) (Pilot Scheme) Order 2012 that allows the
testing of direct payments for SEN provision in the SEN pathfinder
areas. The pilot scheme has demonstrated the potential for SEN direct
payments to make a positive—“life-changing”, to
quote one parent—impact on families. I have seen first hand the
benefits that direct payments can bring. When I visited the
Hertfordshire pathfinder I met another parent who used a direct payment
to pay for a personal assistant to take her disabled child swimming,
allowing her to focus on spending time with her other child. Other
examples of the use of direct payments are for transport, one-to-one
learning when the child is not well enough to travel to school,
personal assistants coming into the classroom or the purchase of
equipment. It is this choice and innovation that we are bringing to SEN
provision and why, as noble Lords will be aware, we have taken forward
the learning from the pilot in provisions for personal budgets in the
Children and Families
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000052">The Bill
is now reaching the end of its journey through your Lordships’
House and through Parliament so it is important to set out why it is
also necessary to amend and extend this pilot scheme. There are two key
reasons. First, extension is necessary to allow the arrangements
established with families under the pilot to continue until the
provisions in the Children and Families Bill are commenced. Extension
will also provide a transitional period, up to the end of September
2015, to move these families from statements on to the new system of
education, health and care plans and the associated offer of a personal
budget that entails. As I have already said, many of the families that
have 
<?notus-xml column=1068?>taken advantage of the scheme have seen real benefits. Failure to extend
the order would mean that these families would need to revert to more
traditional, and in their cases, less effective forms of service
delivery.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000053">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T20:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>,
the extension will allow the authorities named in the order to enter
into new arrangements with families and refine how best to operate SEN
direct payments right up to the point of implementation of the reform
programme. This will ensure that we have the best possible evidence
base ahead of implementation. It will inform both the work of the
personal budget champions and the thematic evaluation of personal
budgets, including direct payments, being undertaken as part of the
evaluation of the pathfinder programme and due to be published in the
summer. Removal of the right to request a direct payment under
paragraph 3 of the schedule to the 2012 order after 31 August 2014 will
provide for the formal closure of the pilot to new entrants from 1
September 2014. I should stress that all other articles in the pilot
scheme remain
unaltered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000054">To
conclude, this is a simple transitional provision that bridges the gap
between the end of the pilot scheme as set out in the 2012 order and
the introduction of the reforms as set out in the Children and Families
Bill. As such, I hope that noble Lords will give it their
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-27T14:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Morgan of Ely" PimsId="5924" UID="14012733000076" xid="2134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000076">Baroness
Morgan of Ely (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that all noble
Lords will welcome any effort to develop a system that would lead to
improvements in the effectiveness of the provision of services to
individuals with special education needs. The educational requirements
of individuals with special educational needs are, by definition,
likely to be varied and need to be special. Intuition would tell us
that these needs may best be fulfilled by services that are chosen and
arranged specifically for each individual. Placing the responsibility
of managing funds with families gives decision-making power to those
who care most about their children—parents or carers with
children with special education needs. That can, in principle, help to
improve the suitability of services and result in better educational
outcomes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000056">When
advocating autonomy for those individuals receiving direct payments, we
do, however, need to bear in mind a few issues. It must be ensured that

most well organised local authorities at the moment. This is a known
concern of many parents and professionals in the sector

the principle of allocating discretion to families is a positive one,
there are no guarantees that providing families with the discretion to
organise their own services will necessarily deliver adequate
educational outcomes. Reports from the ongoing pilot have suggested
that real benefits to the young people concerned and their families
occur mainly from the enhanced control regarding the organisation of
transport. Further evidence 
<?notus-xml column=1069?>from the pilot is needed to ensure that, if this is indeed the case,
benefits are restricted to the organisation of transport. We need to
see that the scheme is sufficiently
justified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000058">Some
individuals may have no desire to organise their own service provision.
This may be due to the individual already receiving suitable support of
a high standard or because the family concerned feels unable to arrange
a better service itself. In such cases, the direct payments scheme must
not be made mandatory. In cases where direct payments are requested,
sufficient support must be made available to ensure that individuals
who may experience difficulty with implementing their own arrangements
can do so effectively. Concerns were raised regarding this issue when
the Minister of State for the Department for Education shared the
worries expressed by respondents to the initial consultation regarding
these
proposals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000059">Assurances
must also be given to taxpayers regarding the value for money provided
by the direct payments initiative. When specialist services are
provided from small markets with limited choice, such as those which
exist in the provision of transport for people with a physical
disability, it must be ensured that a limited market does not inflate
prices. The interests of the taxpayer must also be safeguarded from the
inevitable fragmentation of budgets caused by dividing funds between
service providers, which may cause losses from diseconomies of
scale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000060">However,
the need for an extension is accepted. The slow progress which the
direct payments pilot scheme has experienced has necessitated its
extension. It also makes sense to wait until the Children and Families
Bill has gone through its legislative process. If more time is needed
for the assessment of this scheme before a potential larger-scale
rollout, the time must be used to develop confidence in the practical
successes of devolving SEN provision budgets. If this confidence is
instilled, progress can be made in realising the implementation of the
scheme on a countrywide scale, but it would make sense to wait until
the pilot has had an extended
run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012733000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140127-0003.htm#14012733000061">When the

conclusions of this pilot study are produced, the concerns aired by the
critics of this piece of legislation will need to be considered with
respect and reason. In the mean time, it is essential that the concerns
which have been highlighted today are borne in mind. Further evidence
gathered from the pilot scheme must demonstrate that the direct
payments method for SEN provision indeed provides value for money and
delivers high-quality services, yielding acceptable educational

far as ensuring that direct payments do not affect other services,
paragraph 11(c) of Schedule 1 requires local authorities to consider
the impact on services for other users before they can agree an
individual arrangement. We do not have any evidence from the pilot that
this has been an issue. We will take forward similar protections in
regulations to be made under Clause 49 of the Children and Families
Bill. The noble Baroness is quite right that, so far, transport has
been the main area that direct payments have been used in. However, it
is early days and it is inevitable that people will be slow to take
this up. It is also clear that there are many other areas where people
have benefited. In addition to allowing transition and continuing the
scheme for those people who have already taken it up, it is important
to continue with the

entirely agree with the noble Baroness about making sure that we
achieve value for money for the taxpayer. My conversations with local
authorities in relation to both the local offer and direct payments
have so far been surprisingly positive in the sense that some people
may have thought that allowing more flexibility would increase costs.
Allowing a more discursive and inclusive arrangement for this kind of
provision seems in many cases to have led to less contention and
therefore less costs.</hs_para>

should use caution when travelling in India. Reported cases of sexual
assault against women and young girls are increasing; recent sexual
attacks against female visitors in tourist areas and cities show that
foreign women are also at risk. British women have been the victims of
sexual assault in Goa, Delhi, Bangalore and Rajasthan and women
travellers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and
physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual
attacks involving Polish, German and Danish women travellers have been
reported so far in 2014. Women travellers should exercise caution when
travelling in India even if they are travelling in a
