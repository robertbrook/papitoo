how critical it is to keep girls at school. Will the Minister tell us
what progress has been made to retain girls in secondary schools so
that they can go on to complete their education? How does the
Girls’ Education Challenge particularly address the obstacles of
keeping girls safe on their way to and from school, as sexual violence

Northover:</Member></B> I congratulate my noble friend on her first
Question in the House. She is absolutely right: educating girls is one
of the best investments to reduce poverty. As many noble Lords know,
educating beyond primary level, which is what she is flagging here,
improves a girl’s life chances and delays early motherhood so
that she is more likely to have healthy, better nourished
children. In fact, ensuring that girls have between seven and 10
years’ education has a decisive influence over whether they can
choose whom they marry. The Girls’ Education Challenge is
concentrating particularly on supporting girls to progress through
secondary school. My noble friend is absolutely right: ensuring that
girls are safe on their way to school and at school is extremely
important, but this is being

Kinnock of Holyhead (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister
share my concern that DfID’s business case for the Girls’
Education Challenge fund actually fails to list tackling violence
against girls as one of its critical success criteria? Given that
millions of girls are 
<?notus-xml column=448?>sexually assaulted at or on their way to school, does she agree that
tackling gender-based violence and the need for social norm change
should be priorities and should surely be included in the interventions

violence against girls, as I have just addressed, is extremely
important. It is no use trying to encourage girls to come to school if,
on the way, they are attacked or will be attacked within the school. As
the noble Baroness knows, dealing with this is a high priority right

Armstrong of Hill Top (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure the
Minister recognises that even at primary level it is frequently
difficult to keep young girls in school, partly because poverty means
that they are needed at home. What will the Government be doing to make
sure that this issue is really addressed in the post-2015 agenda and
that we do not assume that, because it has been part of a millennium
development goal so far, everything is okay? The reality is that,
unless the quality of the education is really good, the family loses
faith in the worth of continuing to send a young girl to
school<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T14:42:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> The noble Baroness is right, and that is one of
the lessons from the MDGs. Looking forward beyond 2015, it is not just
a case of getting children into school but of making sure that they
stay in school. DfID built into its programmes consideration of the
results—that is, ensuring that children stay in 
<?notus-xml column=449?>education and that they learn while they are there, and that teachers
and educational programmes are in place. One reason for there being a
focus on secondary education is that children are required to have gone

good because, as she says, the Bill has its First Reading here today,
and I welcome its arrival. As she and noble Lords will know, DfID
already puts girls and women front and centre, and this Bill, which I
am sure will have all-party support, will ensure that that continues to
happen. It will ensure, for example, that the 2006 international

incursions with the Spanish Government. Their response is that the
waters were not ceded to the UK in the Treaty of Utrecht. We remain
confident that the waters are British, as sovereignty flows from land.
We have also raised concerns about the additional border checks. Spain
maintains that the checks are necessary to prevent smuggling, while HMG
considers them to be disproportionate, politically motivated and
therefore unlawful under EU law.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the sectors are very
different. The private rented sector seeks to make profit out of
people’s housing benefit. That does not apply to social housing.
Social tenants hit by the bedroom tax, through no fault of their own,
are now trapped. They are unable to move to smaller social housing as
it does not exist. They are unable to move to private housing because
private landlords are rejecting or evicting them. They are unable to
get discretionary housing payments because most are refused. Debts are
mounting and lives are being destroyed. Will the Government please at
least apply the bedroom tax only to new tenants who can cope with the
new rules, as in 2008, perhaps over a transitional period until we have
enough new housing to meet housing need?</hs_para>

biggest thing that the Government can do to promote the continued
reduction in unemployment and long-term unemployment. Youth

I would remind him that the Government are introducing in the National

£2,000 which will benefit every firm but particularly small

purpose of the Government’s Bill that we are
considering—I am sure the Minister will have told us this many
times—is all about reducing crime and anti-social behaviour.
Indeed, as we know, overall crime has declined in the past 15 years or
so, and the trend in burglary is particularly marked. Yet, unmentioned
in the Bill, the Government are seeking to undermine the progress that
has been made. During the past two decades, new developments, including
homes—both new build and refurbished—schools, play areas,
hospitals and many others, have increasingly been informed
by and have adopted the principles of Secured by
Design<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T15:10:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401204000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000073">What
has been achieved under this initiative carried out under the auspices
of the Association of Chief Police Officers? First, Secured by Design
developments— that is, those which use products and materials
that it has approved—are half as likely to be burgled, and show
a reduction of 25% in criminal damage. Secondly, the additional cost of
using Secured by Design standards in the average home has worked out at
only £170 per dwelling. In one year alone, some 700,000
burglaries could be thwarted if appropriate security devices were
installed, representing an annual saving of more than £1.97
billion. Indeed, the Association of British Insurers has estimated that
the Secured by Design standards across the UK would bring more than
£3.2 billion-worth of savings to the economy over 20
years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T15:11:08"></hs_TimeCode>.

it in Committee. Why, then, if it ain’t broke, are the
Government taking it to pieces anyway? The Department for Communities
and Local Government 
<?notus-xml column=458?>issued a consultation document in the depths of last summer, seeking
views on a recent review of building regulations and housing standards.
The proposals that it put out to consultation
were for a two-tiered standard for security—a basic minimum
level that would be generally required and a so-called enhanced
standard. The basic standard is demonstrably inadequate and has been
shown to have little security benefit. Specifying stronger locks is not
much of a deterrent if the door is so flimsy that it could be kicked in
with one firm
kick<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T15:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401204000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000075">The
requirement for the lock itself, on the basic standard recommended by
the Government, is based on a 26 year-old standard. It does not even
require the British Standards kitemark lock. Instead, it requires a
lock with only 1,000 key variations, vulnerable to the most basic forms
of attack. Even the British Standards kitemark standard, which protects
against drilling and cutting—I believe that these are the
technical terms involved—is having to be revised upwards to
allow for two increasingly prevalent forms of attack: lock snapping and
lock bumping. For those who are not familiar with these techniques, I
am told that there is a handy YouTube video that tells the aspiring
burglar how to do it. The Government are therefore recommending a basic
standard of security that does not even meet the British Standard, even
though the British Standard needs to be revised because of standard
attacks that are made on locks in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T15:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401204000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000076">In
Committee, the Minister made much of what a step forward it was that
this proposed basic security standard would now be a core requirement.
It is not much of useful core requirement if the standard is totally
inadequate. In 1999 and 2006, research studies compared burglaries on
estates using the security standard for locks contained in the
Minister’s core standard with those using Secured by Design
locks. The latter suffered 70% less crime. The Government’s core
standard is woefully

enhanced standard that would be available in certain circumstances?
Even this would be lower than the existing Secured by Design standards.
However, it could be required by a local authority only where what is
described as a “compelling case” exists for this higher
standard to be the norm. To make this compelling case, a local
authority will have to demonstrate that the development will be subject
to an elevated rate of burglary and that there will be a higher than
normal impact of burglary on the tenants. It goes without saying that
this test is almost impossible to pass in respect of a new development,
and the test has to be applied site by site in a way that is likely to
produce confusion and added uncertainty for developers, who will not
know when they submit a proposal whether the authority will attempt to
apply the enhanced standard.</hs_para>

night when we last considered the Bill, the Minister spoke movingly of
the Government’s commitment to localism. Here the Government are
implementing a policy that is the antithesis of localism. They are
preventing local authorities from deciding to use enhanced security
standards—those that are recommended by our police service. The
antithesis of localism: centrally driven dumbing down of standards.
What is more, it is putting communities and householders at risk. It
puts at risk the progress made over the past 20 years in reducing
crime, especially burglary.</hs_para>

Committee put forward a number of arguments that said this amendment
was not necessary. He argued that there was no need to give the police
a statutory duty to advise on security standards because they do this
already. However, this amendment is not about giving police the power,
but about giving local authorities the option to accept and act on that
advice. Therefore, I am afraid the Minister misunderstood the purpose
of the amendment. In Committee, the Minister argued that local
authorities have powers already—as though this was a
substitute—to consider the location and layout of sites. Nobody
is arguing that they do not. The issue is whether they will have the
power to prescribe adequate security standards to protect the residents
in those locations and on those sites.</hs_para>

us that the intention of the enhanced standard was to mirror those of
Secured by Design—except that the enhanced standard does not do
so. In a recent meeting with Secured by Design,
officials—indeed, Ministers—conceded that it was a lower
standard but said that there was nothing they could do about it.
Therefore, it is simply untrue for us to be told that the enhanced
standard will mirror the Secured by Design
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T15:18:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401204000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000082">In
any case, access to the enhanced standard would be permitted only where
there was a suitable evidence of need. Why does that requirement have
to be prescribed centrally? Again, it is the antithesis of localism.
Surely each local authority should be allowed to decide the standards
it thinks are appropriate for its area, and if it wants to accept the
advice of Secured by Design or any other recommendation put forward by
the police, it can choose either to do so or not to do so. Surely that
is what localism should be about and what the Government ought to be
committed to.</hs_para>

forward as a simplification of the planning process, with the argument
that somehow Secured by Design standards have been the cause of stalled
developments. What evidence is there that this has happened? None.
Local authorities should be able to choose the level of security
standards that they consider appropriate for the communities they
represent. What is the problem that Minsters think they are going to
solve by preventing that local democratic
discretion?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401204000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000084">As

<?notus-xml column=460?>crime, reducing burglary and making anti-social behaviour harder being
put into reverse. It is an act of vandalism—anti-social
behaviour of the worst sort. It risks adding to the cost of the

them that I have tabled the amendment. It requires the Home Secretary
to ask ACPO or a successor body to draw up Secured by Design
guidelines. It requires those guidelines to be produced following
appropriate consultation, and it gives local planning authorities the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T15:29:33"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
shall speak briefly in support of this amendment and make three points.
First, during my life, I have worked in some of London’s most
insecure areas and seen insecure estates in the rest of the country. In
north Brent and Brixton, crime was rife and burglary, in particular,
was at a very high level. On a huge estate—I will not name it,
because it has improved so much and I do not want to give it another
bad name—I saw design improvements which removed some of the
interconnecting corridors and looked at locks, considering the way in
which the whole design process was put together so that it reduced
crime substantially. If we start with design and local authorities have
the option of putting design in place, we will ensure from the
beginning that we do not create new estates where problems begin and
residents suffer great
dismay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401204000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000096">My
second point is the localism argument, which has already been made very
successfully. The third point is that anything that prevents burglary
anywhere must be supported. Like other speakers, I do not understand
how it is possible to assess where burglary is going to take place
before an estate has gone up. In any case, people should be protected
equally. Anyone who knows people who have been victims of burglaries,
particularly some of the most vulnerable, will know that we should do
everything in our power to prevent the emotional trauma—it is
almost like rape—that they feel when they go into their homes
and find tremendous damage. It is not just that things have been
stolen; it is the feeling of intrusion into their lives.</hs_para>

lighting, sight lines and corridors, mentioned by the noble Baroness. I

would like to ask the Minister some questions relating to this. Perhaps
he can explain to the House, and flesh out a little, the extent to
which the security issues which we have been discussing can be taken
into account in the refusal or imposition of conditions on planning
consent currently made by a planning authority. Are there material
considerations? I am asking whether the planning authority can

I respond in detail to the noble Lord’s amendment, I should like
to emphasise that the housing standards review, which is the project
under consultation at the moment and at the centre of the noble
Lord’s concerns, was not initiated to cut standards irrespective
of impact or to agree to a lowest common denominator approach. I cannot
emphasise that enough. Its clear objective was to review a number of
the voluntary standards—there are a number of voluntary
standards—most frequently called up by local authorities. The
aim was to identify opportunities for simplification, clarification
and, if appropriate, those standards that are so important that they
justify inclusion in a possible national standard or building
regulations, which is a situation that may not always exist at
present.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1401204000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000114">We

think, also in agreement that it is important to ensure that the police
can continue to contribute their intelligence on crime to the

diminution of the role of the police in that respect. The new clause
that the noble Lord proposes would place a mandatory duty on a body
representing chief officers of police to publish guidelines on
designing out crime that local planning authorities may then require
builders to follow as a condition of granting planning
permission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401204000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401204000115">As
the noble Lord will be aware, the Government have spent considerable
time tidying up the policing landscape to create a set of bodies with a

<?notus-xml column=465?>defined purpose. The Association of Chief Police Officers fulfilled an
important role as the professional voice of the police service for many
years, but as policing is changing, so too must ACPO. Many former
functions of ACPO have transferred to the College of Policing and, in
the light of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners’
review of ACPO, there will be further consideration of the future
delivery of some additional national functions. I am not persuaded that
it would be right to pre-empt those considerations by designating a new
or existing body, as the noble Lord is proposing

different expert groups have a role to play in the design, building and
construction of the places where we live and work. Although I recognise
that the noble Lord’s intention is to ensure that guidelines are
drawn up in an open and transparent way in discussion with experts, I
believe it should be left to the police and others to decide on the
most appropriate groups to consult according to subject area. As a
matter of good design, technical building standards and standards for
the design and layout of the wider built environment are often
considered together. That is indeed the approach taken by Secured by
Design. However, in regulatory terms, the former are the domain of
building regulations while the latter are matters for planning. Of
course, the role of planning and building regulations needs to be
understood in the broader context of crime overall, and on that matter
I should like to offer some points of clarification.</hs_para>

these matters, the noble Lord set out a range of figures to exemplify
the importance of security standards in new homes. While I have no wish
to extend the debate unnecessarily as these figures have become a
matter of public record, I think it is only right that we ensure that
they are placed in context. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, suggested that
if appropriate measures were installed some 700,000 burglaries could be
prevented each year saving nearly £2 billion. According to the
latest crime survey estimates, not only is this more than the total
number of burglaries in England and Wales in 2012-13, it reflects
burglaries in both old and new housing. The housing standards review
sets out standards only for new development, not existing homes.
Furthermore, the housing standards review does not propose stopping
bodies such as Secured by Design bringing their own standards to the

professionals are able to give advice in this area. As a result of the
advice given, the benefits associated with those measures are unlikely
to be adversely affected. I mention this because, as with all matters,
there is an issue of proportionality. Without in any way
underestimating the impact of burglary on households, we should guard
against overstating the potential impact of the proposals within the
housing standards review. The noble Lord’s amendment suggests
that a designated body of police develop guidance following
consultation with local authorities, builders and developers. As I have
already said, it is clear that the police should have a role in
gathering intelligence and advising on standards, but while the police
are experts in security, the Government are better placed to use the
evidence that we are gathering in formulating standards for use either
at a local or national level.</hs_para>

purpose of this amendment is to give local authorities the flexibility
to set higher design standards, if that is what they want to do. The
Minister has said that nothing the Government are doing is intended to
weaken the security standards and that the housing standards review was
not intended to bring about the lowest common denominator, but that is
what it is doing, in practice. He talked about supporting the police in
advising on a layout of a development, but this is not just about the
layout of a development—it is about the
security measures physically built into the development, which I do not
believe can be part of a planning approval at

automatically within the purview of a local authority; they can be
outsourced. Therefore, you can have any number of commercial companies

local body, to have choice and impose when appropriate the standards

Minister talked about this proposal applying only to new developments.
The point is, over time, all developments would be covered by these
arrangements. That is how you get to the figures in terms of burglaries
that one might be talking about. He said that it does not stop Secured
by Design from bringing standards to the marketplace. But the problem
is that he would not be able to require something if, at local level,
local authorities thought that it was necessary. Planning law simply
does not allow this to happen. I am afraid that somewhere, lost between
the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Home
Office, a very important principle has been destroyed—the
principle that local councillors should be able to set a higher
standard for security if they think that their local residents need it

Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 92A, in the
name of my noble friend Lord Rosser and myself, would make provision on
“Long-term police authorisations requiring independent
approval”—in other words, police authorisation for covert
or undercover operations. The Minister knows of our concerns and
interest in this issue, as we flagged it up at Second Reading and my
noble friend Lord Rosser proposed a very similar amendment in Committee
as well. I know that the Minister agrees with us that meaningful action
has to be taken to address how covert police operations are authorised
and managed, but it seems to us that the Bill provides the ideal
opportunity to address the issue, given that it is the
Government’s flagship Bill on crime and
policing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000002">I
welcome the Government’s recognition that there is an issue
here. In his letter to my noble friend Lord Rosser on 21 December, the
Minister outlines the powers that the Government are taking and have
taken already, so the Government recognise that changes have to be
made. I welcome those changes and do not decry them, but they do not go
far enough in addressing the seriousness of the problem to provide the
degree of oversight and monitoring that we feel is necessary. I do not
think that it is enough to give guarantees or assurances if people are
to have confidence that such operations are properly authorised and
monitored when they are ongoing. I shall come on to explain the
differences that we
have<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:10:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:10:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000003">I
reiterate the point made by my noble friend Lord Rosser in Committee
that we support undercover policing and recognise that it is essential
in dealing with organised crime and terrorism. We recognise the
dedication and bravery of those officers who undertake this work, but
we can only repeat that such operations must be subject to the highest
of ethical and operational standards. That is essential both
for their operational effectiveness and for public confidence, which is
why we place such store on getting accountability absolutely right in
this area.</hs_para>

criminality must be dealt with proportionately and not in excess of
what is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I do

first case is that of Mark Kennedy, known in his undercover name as
Mark “Flash” Stone, who as a police officer infiltrated
left-wing protest groups over a period of seven years. These groups
were involved in lawful demonstrations—there is no evidence that
they were involved in crime. In that role, he had relationships with
women in the protest movement and travelled to eco protests across
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000006">When
HMIC reviewed Mark Kennedy’s activities and those of other
undercover officers, it stated that his actions led to the collapse of
a trial of environmental protestors. The report said that he defied
management instructions, but it was never clear what those management
instructions were. Indeed, he took the view that his superiors knew
what his activities were, so there seems to be a lack of clarification
on whether his actions were authorised or whether he just thought that
somebody knew about them so it was okay to behave in the way that he
did<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>. The HMIC
report also suggested that an independent body should be required to
authorise such undercover operations, as he had been inadequately
supervised and the oversight had to be
strengthened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000007">In
such cases, we question not only the ethics of Mr Kennedy and others,
but the proportionality of their actions and their cost. I do not know
whether there has ever been an assessment of the costs involved in such
cases, but clearly neither the costs nor the methods—the
ethics—could be
justified<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:12:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000008">The

Clarendon, who is now a Member of your Lordships’ House. After
her son was murdered in a racist attack, Peter Francis, who was then an
undercover police officer and a member of the highly controversial

also refer noble Lords to a book by Rob Evans and Paul Lewis,
“The True Story of Britain’s Secret Police”, which
illustrates the extent of the problems. There have been a number of
cases in which women were conned by these men—seven police
officers, acting under cover—into believing that they were
having a genuine relationship. They had sexual relationships that in a
number of cases led to children being born. It appears that those men,
who had been acting under cover, shed their responsibility to their
children as easily and as quickly as they shed their undercover

Government have brought forward secondary legislation to deal with the
issue through an order, which Damian Green in the other place said
would enhance oversight. However, I have two concerns. First, I do not
think that secondary legislation gives this House the opportunity fully
to examine the proposals 
<?notus-xml column=474?>before it. It would have been helpful to have included any such
proposals in the Bill, as we could then have had the opportunity to
fully discuss whether the measures were appropriate. I think that the
Government’s proposals go a long way towards dealing with the
problem, so I welcome them, but they do not go far enough. We are not
convinced that the Surveillance Commissioners are really the
appropriate body to provide independent

amendment would also leave open the period of time involved. We
envisage that any operation of three months—or possibly six
months, but certainly much less than the 12 months proposed by the
Government—should be subject to independent oversight. To say
that the only operations that could be subject to or require
independent oversight and authorisation would be those lasting more
than 12 months seems to us to be completely inadequate. A lot can
happen in those 12 months. In the least case those involved could have
formed relationships and had a child, given what has happened in the
past. We propose a much shorter period, of possibly three or six
months, to be decided by both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000012">We
believe that this amendment would protect the integrity of the
investigation. It would avoid the problems that we have had in other
cases, which have fallen because the integrity of the evidence has been
compromised. The amendment would also protect the integrity of the
officers because, if operations are checked after three or six
months—I am relaxed on that; I would prefer three months, but
six is not impossible—that will offer protection to the officers
involved, in that the required checks and balances, the monitoring and
the reporting back, will have taken place. That would provide for
genuine oversight and
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:16:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

admitted there is a problem and have sought to address it, but they

during my time as commissioner did I approve, authorise, acquiesce or
have any knowledge of, or give any encouragement to, any of the actions
suggested by Peter Francis in his book. Investigations are currently
under way to try to establish the truth of all those matters. If I, as
commissioner for seven years, had no knowledge of the sort of
allegations that have been made by Peter Francis in his
book—assuming that he has made those allegations on, hopefully,
the basis of some element of truth—that shows that there is a
need for reform and for much closer scrutiny of these operations. I am
now in my 15th year of retirement so I am long past knowing what the
current environment is like, but I still sense an enormous need and

Hamwee (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, we had the opportunity to consider
the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Covert Human Intelligence
Sources: Relevant Sources) Order 2013, which the Minister sent round
after the previous debate and is now in force, as I understand it.
Any<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:23:09"></hs_TimeCode> of us could
have prayed against

need to understand as a House that we are not at the point in the
development of this—“work” seems to be the wrong
term—matter that one might think from looking at the amendment.
That is not to say that I do not have sympathy with the amendment. One
of the times when I was most shocked at work since becoming a Member of
your Lordships’ House was on hearing recordings of the
testimonies of women, and their families, who have been affected by
activities under CHISRS. I remember the family of one woman saying,
“We treated this man as our prospective son-in-law; we welcomed
him into our family”. It was very
moving<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:24:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000024">That
causes me to say that what matters more than anything—although I
do not know how you deal with it other than by putting formal technical
oversight in place—is a change in practice and culture. The

legislation in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:24:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000025">The
12-month period for approval before review is required seems on the
long side and I look forward to the Minister explaining it to the

much at fault as anyone—why 12 months was chosen, rather than
six months or even three months.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a worthwhile
debate, although we have discussed this matter before. As the noble
Lords know, the statutory instrument has come into effect, so we are in
a different regulatory regime from the one we were in when we discussed
this in Committee. In no way do the Government endorse activities to
which the attention of the House has been drawn in the speeches of
noble Lords. I am grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling the
amendment. I agree that covert techniques are sometimes necessary to
protect the public from harm or to prevent or detect crime. I think all
noble Lords will accept
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:26:08"></hs_TimeCode>. These
techniques need, however, to be closely supervised and constantly
reassessed to ensure that they are

deployments are authorised under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act 2000. RIPA provides a strong set of safeguards. As I said in
Committee, we have recently brought forward secondary legislation,
further enhancing this oversight of undercover deployments by law
enforcement agencies. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Covert
Human Intelligence Sources: Relevant Sources) Order 2013 came into
effect on 1 January
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:27:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that, in our debate last time,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:27:14"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord,
Lord Rosser, might not have been aware of this order, so, following the
debate in Committee, I wrote on 21 December 2013 to draw it to his
attention and to that of the noble Baroness. As a negative instrument,
there was the normal opportunity for the Opposition or any noble Lord
to pray against the order, perhaps on the ground that its provisions
fell short of what was needed. Unfortunately, however, it is a matter
of record that no such step was taken. The order, which has now been in
force for some three weeks, provides a number of additional safeguards
to ensure that the technique is used only when it is just to do so. I
will give some examples of what I
mean<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:28:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000029">First,
law enforcement agencies must notify the Office of Surveillance
Commissioners, all retired senior judges, of all undercover deployment
by law enforcement
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, an authorisation can be renewed beyond 12 months only with
the prior approval of a surveillance commissioner, who, I remind your
Lordships, is someone who has held senior judicial office. It may be
that the original deployment is not authorised for 12 months.
Thereafter, if it is to be renewed at 12 months, a
surveillance commissioner will be required to pre-approve all renewals
for long-term deployments every 12 months.</hs_para>

addition, we have increased the rank of authorising officer.
Deployments of undercover law enforcement officers now need to be
authorised at assistant chief constable level or equivalent. Any
deployments lasting longer than 12 months will be authorised by a chief
constable or equivalent as well as by a surveillance commissioner. The
seniority of those who are now required to authorise these deployments
is an indication of how seriously the Government take proper oversight
of undercover law enforcement activity. I hope I can reassure my noble
friend Lady Hamwee that all authorisations are notified to the
commissioners at the outset. They monitor the cases during their normal
inspections. Each case is approved specifically after that 12-month
interval. It reflects the existing legislation and implements the HMIC
recommendation to increase oversight of long-term deployments. As I
have said, deployments can be for shorter terms, but they still have to
be notified to surveillance
commissioners<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:31:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000031">We
believe that the new arrangements will create a regime that contains
considerable safeguards while not hampering operational effectiveness.
We should allow them to bed down and be given a chance to prove
themselves. We will of course keep them under review. Given these
recent changes, I do not believe that this amendment, well intentioned
as it is, is required. I therefore invite the noble Baroness to
withdraw

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> Perhaps I should explain to the noble
Baroness and the Minister why we did not pray against the order when it
was laid. The order made changes that improved the position and it
would have been rather churlish for us to say at that time,
“We’re going to pray against this because it
doesn’t go far enough”. The order has improved the
position, but I have a serious issue with the 12-month period. I know
that the Minister said that we should give the 
<?notus-xml column=478?>new regulations, which came into force on 1 January, the opportunity to
bed down, but why not get it right first time? This legislation
provides us with the opportunity to do so. I agree entirely with the
noble Lord, Lord Condon, that it is about getting the balance right. A
12-month undercover operation is a long undercover operation. If there
is no independent monitoring and approval before that 12-month period
comes to end, a lot can happen. This amendment is about the integrity
of the operation concerned and ensuring that nothing is going wrong. As
the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said, if the integrity of an operation
is compromised, it can mean that a court case fails. We have seen that
in other cases involving long-term covert operations. That is a very
serious matter. Further, those who have been undercover have thought
that activities were authorised when they had not been explicitly
authorised. It goes back to authorisation by commission or
omission—it seems to have been authorisation by omission in the
cases of some undercover
operators<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:33:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000033">I
take the point that the order represents an improvement, but the fact
that 12 months can elapse before any further oversight or independent
monitoring take place represents a serious error. For that reason, I
hope that the Minister will understand why I feel the need to test the
will of the House on this
issue.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="1401207000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000145">4.33

recent correspondence with the Minister about this amendment. I have

turn first to the amendment. Noble Lords may recall that a longer
amendment to this clause, then Clause 126, in the names of the noble
Lord, Lord Condon, the noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, and
myself, was discussed on 4 December last year. The noble Lord, Lord
Condon, and I now return to the same issue in a much more restricted
but still very significant way. The issue needs a certain amount of
explanation and, as it is concerned with national security, it is not
trivial. It is concerned to ensure that no one can be appointed to the
post of Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis without being
subjected to developed or equivalent security vetting. Its context is
the whole of Clause 128, which, like its predecessor, deals with a
complete innovation for British policing—the appointment of
suitably qualified police chiefs from abroad to senior posts in
policing in England and Wales.</hs_para>

the last occasion, that neither the noble Lord, Lord Condon, who will
speak later, nor I have any objections in principle to the appointment
of senior officers from abroad, notably those from Commonwealth
countries, to UK police positions. To object would be hypocritical in
that senior UK officers have reasonably often and recently commanded
police forces in Commonwealth countries including Australia. However,
we are concerned about the Met Commissioner.</hs_para>

original amendment arose because, however well meant, the measure
appeared to raise a serious concern when it was applied to three very
senior Metropolitan Police posts, namely those of the commissioner, the
deputy commissioner and the assistant commissioner specialist
operations, who are all deeply embedded in the national security
structure of the United Kingdom. We therefore sought an explanation
from the Minister of how this could occur when these postholders need
to be security cleared to a very high level, known as developed
vetting, a process difficult to achieve when it involves a foreign
national.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1401207000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000038">I
think that the Minister will recall that an interesting and at times
somewhat unusual debate followed. The principal development was that in
winding up he produced one surprise and one promise. The surprise was
that the then Clause 126 referred only to the commissioner and to
provincial chief constables but not to other metropolitan ranks,
however senior. The promise was about vetting, the subject of
today’s amendment. The Minister

to me on 23 December, copying the letter to a number of other
interested Members of your Lordships’ House. The letter
absolutely confirmed what he had said in the debate about vetting in
these terms:</hs_para>

substance of your concerns, as I indicated in the debate, there is no
legal requirement for the Commissioner of the MPS or the chief
constables of police forces outside London to be British citizens.
However, we would always expect successful candidates to undergo the
appropriate vetting procedures. There is no provision in legislation to
say when this should be subject to developed vetting. A decision is
made … on the type of information an individual will have access
to. We would expect the Commissioner and chief constables to undergo
developed vetting”.</hs_quote>

and given that the Minister indicated both on the Floor of the House
and in correspondence that a successful conclusion to the developed
vetting process would be required for such an appointment to the post
of commissioner, I might be forgiven for hoping that the Minister would
accept this amendment today. But no—he wrote to me last Friday
to say that he would not. He will speak for himself, but he seems to
have given three reasons. First, it would be inappropriate to have
developed vetting on the face of the Bill in case the scheme should be
renamed or its criteria changed. Secondly, he does not think it
appropriate to single out the commissioner’s post alone for such
a measure. Thirdly, he does not believe that primary legislation is
where a level of vetting should be set out. I hope he will think that
that is a fair summary of his position.</hs_para>

Minister’s first objection is already covered by the
amendment’s being drawn slightly wider to refer to
“developed (or equivalent) … vetting”, to take
into account a future change in nomenclature or, as I will come to
shortly, a reliance on foreign vetting by certain friendly
powers.</hs_para>

the Minister’s second and third objections, this clause as a
whole represents an entirely new departure for UK policing. In itself
that is fine, but within this legislation sits one position of a
different order to the rest, and the noble Lord, Lord Condon, and I
believe that that needs to be recognised in the Bill. The
commissioner’s responsibilities are of a completely different
category to those of other chief constables. He or she sits close to
the very heart of the UK’s national security apparatus.
Appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, he or she is
in overall charge of all national counterterrorism police activity. He
or she sits in the Cabinet Office briefing room during national
emergencies and has direct personal responsibility for the protection
of the Queen, the Royal Family, the Prime Minister, other senior
Ministers and some ambassadors to the UK.</hs_para>

matter with the Minister he remarked that no one had previously exposed
concern about security issues—which, put another way round,
means that the Home Office had not considered the difference between
the duties of this postholder and those of other chief constables. I
believe that not only consideration but action is necessary. If
legislation allowing this post to be held by a foreign national is to
be passed then surely the law should require—and it should be
firmly in the Bill—that such an appointment should be subject to
the very vetting which the Minister says it will.</hs_para>

my second point, which refers to something that may have to be
addressed at Third Reading. The noble Lord’s same letter of 23
December contained another surprise, albeit one to which he
had referred briefly but had not been able to confirm during
the previous debate. The letter stated that there
is,</hs_para>

requirement for candidates for appointment as Deputy or Assistant
Commissioner to have served as a constable in the UK, so the changes
made by clause 126 are not relevant so far as those posts are
concerned”.</hs_quotefo>

surprising indeed to the four Members of your Lordships’ House
who have been Metropolitan Police Commissioners and who were present at
the debate on 4 December, and it is very surprising now. The deputy
commissioner, also appointed by Her Majesty the Queen, is—as the
phrase has it—a heartbeat away from being the commissioner, and
has the same powers and responsibilities in the absence of the
commissioner<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:54:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
But it gets worse. I have spoken to the current commissioner, Sir
Bernard Hogan-Howe, and it appears that this situation now
pertains to all of the 35 or 40 chief officers of the
Metropolitan Police, of commander and deputy assistant commissioner
rank as well as those more senior. None of them has to have any
previous police experience. Both Sir Bernard and the president of the
Association of Chief Police Officers, Sir Hugh Orde, regard this
situation as totally
untenable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>, as do

police positions are not that different from any other significant
professional position. If you, like me, would prefer the pilot of your
aircraft or the brain surgeon to whom you have been referred to have
some relevant experience, then perhaps you will understand why I have
written to the Minister to ask him to do three things—to arrange
for his officials to discover 
<?notus-xml column=484?>whether this position exists in law, not only in the Metropolitan Police
but also to assistant and deputy chief constables outside London; to
consult the Home Secretary and the Mayor of London; and to bring to the
House a suitable new clause to rectify this anomaly at Third
Reading<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:56:10"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
taken the liberty of suggesting to him a form of wording for a short
new clause to address
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000047">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:57:59"></hs_TimeCode>

before<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:56:27"></hs_TimeCode>. The
replacement of police authorities by police and crime commissioners
outside London and by the mayor’s office for policing in the
capital has placed enormous patronage in the hands of individual
politicians and the commanding officer, whom they appoint and can
dismiss. I hope that the Minister will agree to the proposal to rectify
this at Third
Reading<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:56:47"></hs_TimeCode> when he

now to the amendment, I should point out that this whole proposal is
widely regarded within the police service as having been concerned with
the desire in some quarters to appoint the widely respected former
commissioner of the New York Police Department, Bill Bratton, as the
Met Commissioner. Wherever that desire may have come from, it has been
frustrated as he has just been reappointed to the NYPD and is no longer
available<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:57:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:57:17"></hs_TimeCode>.

said earlier that I would mention foreign vetting. In closing, perhaps
I may offer one further piece of advice to the Minister. In his letter
to me of 23 December he suggested that foreign vetting might
be an alternative to developed vetting. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1401207000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000126">“There

am not so sure. If “case by case” includes Bill Bratton,
I would advise the Minister not to rely on his example. After he was
forced to resign from the NYPD in the 1990s, he was appointed chief of
the Los Angeles police department. Shortly after his arrival, Bill
Bratton appointed a Mr John Miller as his chief officer in charge of
counterterrorism. To say the least, this was an unusual
appointment—although only the kind of one that, unless we change
things right across the command ranks of the Met, might happen
here—in that John Miller’s previous role had been as head
of press and public relations for the NYPD. Before that he had been a
senior journalist with ABC News and was very well known for being the
last American journalist to interview Osama bin Laden in
1998<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:59:01"></hs_TimeCode>. In his new
post in Los Angeles, it was necessary for Mr Miller to be
vetted by the US authorities. When I visited John in his office in Los
Angeles there was a prominent photograph on his wall of him with Osama
bin Laden, taken during that interview. John told me that the
photograph had been there when he had been visited by the FBI vetting
officers to consider his suitability for such an important
counterterrorism post. They had not asked about the photograph. His 
<?notus-xml column=485?>appointment was, however, approved.

for the reasons that my noble friend Lord Blair set out. This issue is
beginning to feel unnecessarily adversarial, and I do not think it

point throughout has been only to draw to attention to the fact that,
having been a chief constable and the commissioner, I know that in
relation to national security and to the protection of Her Majesty, the
line of succession and senior politicians, the posts are of a totally
different magnitude. The commissioner holds a unique position at the
centre of national security issues and in the protection of the
monarch. My desire throughout has been simply to draw attention to that
distinction and to ensure that if an overseas officer or someone with
overseas police experience is appointed to the commissioner’s
post in future, we will have taken due cognisance of the difference,
the importance and the significance of the security roles et

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister may recall
that on a previous occasion, when this matter came up in relation to
Clause 126, I spoke very briefly in support of the amendment that was
then being proposed. The reason I spoke was because two 
<?notus-xml column=486?>Members of this House, who are not present this evening, made speeches
which—to put it as gently as I can—cast doubt on the
confidence one should have in the police. I got to my feet not because
I agreed with them but because it seemed to me that there was an
underlying issue that ought to be mentioned. It is public confidence.
It may well be that, because of the very high profile of the posts we
are talking about, particularly the post of commissioner, public
confidence will be of the greatest importance. For that reason, which I
hope the Minister will recall was discussed last time, I will make the
same point again, this time in relation to this much more focused and,
I hope, more helpful
amendment.</hs_para>

amendment. I was quite surprised to hear the noble Lord, Lord Blair,
say that the Minister was going to resist the amendment, because when I
read it, especially after our previous debate, I assumed, possibly
wrongly, that it reflected what the Minister had said in previous
debates and therefore set out the position for clarity in the Bill.
Clearly, nobody in your Lordships’ House has criticised in any
way the possibility of a police officer from overseas, suitably
qualified, becoming a chief constable or the Commissioner of the
Metropolitan Police. That is not at

at issue is that they should be subject to the same conditions and

police officer comes from overseas, particularly in the role of

unnecessary. The Government take this matter seriously—and take
his amendment seriously, too. As I said when responding to similar

while vetting is vital, I do not believe that primary legislation is
the place to set out the level of vetting. It is not the place where
the level of vetting should be determined. Nor do I see the case for
singling out just one chief officer post—namely that of
Metropolitan Police Commissioner. As I said in Committee, no Home

appointment to the post of Metropolitan Police Commissioner that would
put national security at risk. Furthermore,

I have listened very carefully to the arguments that the noble Lord put
forward, and there may be some merit in setting out vetting
requirements in regulations. It is right for the College of Policing,
as the body that sets the standards for policing, to take the lead role
in considering whether to propose such regulations. As noble Lords will
recall, Clause 111 makes statutory provision for its formal role in the
preparation or approval of regulations. I will undertake to draw this

noble Lord also highlighted the possibility that in a few years’
time we could find that all the chief officer equivalent posts in the
Metropolitan Police, and indeed in other forces, could be filled by
persons who have previously never served as a police officer in the UK.
I have to say that such a possibility is, at best, theoretical, and I
think that the noble Lord would admit that. Under the existing law, it
could already be the case that every officer from commander through to
deputy commissioner could be a person with no previous policing
experience in the UK. That was not the case when the noble Lord, Lord
Blair, was commissioner and, in practice, I see no possibility whatever
of that happening in

of the College of Policing and asking it to consider what level of

is what he is saying—I shall, in a moment, ask leave to withdraw
the amendment. However, I suggest to the Minister that the idea that a
person could be appointed to a senior police position who has never
previously been a police officer is pretty difficult to contemplate. I
was never suggesting that all 35 would be like that as I
cannot imagine anybody doing

However, just the possibility that somebody who has never previously
been a police officer could be appointed deputy chief constable seems
to be a pretty odd state of affairs. Perhaps the Minister and I could
talk about that outside the Chamber just to see whether that is not
also something about which we could ask him specifically to ask the
College of Policing. I beg leave to withdraw the

Amendment 93 on littering from vehicles an amendment that we discussed
in Committee. I remind your Lordships of the need for the amendment,
which was discussed very fully in Committee. It is a sad fact that
Britain is a particularly dirty country in terms of litter. Not only do
we compare very unfavourably with most of our peer group in Europe, we
sadly compare unfavourably with a number of other countries that are
much less privileged than us but make much more effort to see that
there is not litter. The contribution to litter by people throwing
litter out of vehicles is a serious and significant part of the problem
of
littering<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:16:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:16:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment is to close a loophole. Although littering from vehicles is a
criminal offence, nothing can be done under the present law unless it
is possible to identify exactly who threw the litter out of the
vehicle. I am trying to supplement that arrangement—not replace
it—by saying that if litter is thrown from a vehicle, then the
keeper of that vehicle should be subject to a civil penalty on rather
the same 
<?notus-xml column=490?>basis as a keeper of an unwisely parked vehicle is subject to a fine of
£80 or so and it is up to them whether they recover it from the
person who was driving the vehicle. It is a civil offence intended as a

the amendment has been around a long time, but I know that there have
been differing views inside Whitehall as to whether it should happen.
There tends to be an inclination by civil servants in one department to
take up a position and be reluctant, perhaps, to change their position.
This sometimes causes a problem, with Ministers having either to
overrule them or to accept their advice. Life is busy and there is
often an inclination to have a quiet life. I am afraid that this is too
important for Ministers to have a quiet life over

constructive and helpful discussions with the Minister on several

Marlesford. I think that everyone agrees that litter is a scourge and
that it is getting worse. Were it not for the street cleaners, who are
the unsung heroes of our local communities, we would realise how
terrible is the amount of litter that is thrown and
discarded<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:23:10"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
partly a matter of disfiguring the environment but it also poses a
potential serous danger to other drivers on roads. Therefore, I hope

just one thing to the attention of the Minister, who I understand is
going to be extremely helpful: this is a symbol of trying to do the
things that everybody wants done. The most frustrating thing in life is
that there are many things which everybody wants done but which the
Government always find impossible to do. I am afraid that the phrase
“Better not, Minister” is one of the most dangerous that
civil servants tend to use. Often, one should say, “Better to do
things, Minister”. It is better to try and better to see whether
we can solve this problem rather than have constant debates of this
kind.</hs_para>

he raised this issue in Committee and at Second Reading. He is wise not
to rely on the Private Member’s Bill route at present, since we
have a number of Fridays when we are discussing just one Bill, which
crowds out every other Bill that noble Lords wish to bring forward. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Deben, about “Better not,
Minister”, or “Better, Minister”. I think that the
phrase in the “Yes Minister” series—which I heard
myself as a Minister—was, “That’s very courageous,
Minister”, which, from civil servants, is not praise. I hope
that the Minister has not had to be too courageous in accepting the
principle behind this amendment.</hs_para>

of thoughts, because this is a big issue. The cost to councils is
enormous. I come from a generation that came home from school or from

one concern. As I understand it, the Minister will bring forward an
order-making power at Third Reading, but I take the comments from noble
Lords opposite that we need assurance that the order will not be
delayed and will be fairly swift. We all know how long orders can take.
Given that they are unamendable—though they have to be consulted
on—it should not take too long. If the Minister can give
assurances or any guidelines on the timescale in which he expects to
bring the order forward, that would be helpful. Otherwise, I am
delighted with the news that the Minister accepts the principle of this

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I have sat listening to
noble Lords’ expectations thinking, “No pressure,
then”, so I hope that I do not disappoint noble Lords. I am
grateful to my noble friend for bringing forward his amendment. All
noble Lords share his concern about littering; indeed, as all who have
spoken in this debate have said, it is anti-social, causes a nuisance,
is an eyesore for the communities in 
<?notus-xml column=493?>which we live and can cause harm to the environment and, potentially,
other road users. It is unacceptable behaviour and should be treated as
such.</hs_para>

describes his amendment as a simple measure to “fix” a
problem. I have not heard the words quoted by my noble friend Lord
Deben—“Better not, Minister”—in all my

longer time in office and perhaps had to deal with slightly more
weighty matters than I have. When my colleagues who work with me on
this Bill talk to me, they demand not “courage” or
sensitivity to other considerations that they do not believe to be

I think that my noble friend Lord Marlesford will accept that the

my noble friend’s amendment were to proceed, it would be
necessary to consider whether it would be a matter that is reserved to
Westminster or one that is devolved. For example, the subject matter of
the Road Traffic Act 1988 and other road traffic matters are
reserved under the Scotland Act 1998, but responsibility for matters
relating to the environment is generally devolved to all three of the
UK’s devolved Administrations. We can already see some of the
complexities that
arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0001.htm#1401207000093">Our
colleagues in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should therefore
have the opportunity to consider whether or how a civil penalties
regime should apply to them, and how to deal with cross-border issues
if they decide to take a different approach to that in England. Given
that there is now insufficient time to secure any necessary legislative
consent motion, my instinct is that any provision at this stage ought
to be confined to England only.</hs_para>

as importantly, as it is currently drafted, the amendment does not
actually replace the criminal offence of littering from vehicles with a
civil offence, which I believe is my noble friend’s intention.
Instead, it places an additional civil liability on the registered
keeper, whether or not the actual litterer can be identified. If the
litterer and the registered keeper are the same person, that individual
could find him or herself facing both the criminal and civil sanctions
for the same offence. That would raise some questions about which
regime should take precedence. I do not seek to answer those questions
in this debate, but I pose them as relevant to the complexity of the
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:32:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401207000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#1401207000095">I
think that the provisions would also benefit from setting
out more clearly certain other matters relating to the civil penalties
themselves, including how the income from penalty charges under this
regime could be used. It would also be helpful to clarify
the identity of the responsible authority referred to in subsection (7)
of the proposed new clause, particularly since responsibility for
keeping major

Highways Agency rather than with local

of these issues is insurmountable. What I can say to my noble friend is
that the Government accept that councils may need the power to issue
civil penalties to the registered keeper of a vehicle from which litter
is thrown. Given that Third Reading is only a week away, there is now
insufficient time to work up a detailed scheme. Indeed, I note that my
noble friend’s amendments left issues in relation to appeals to
secondary legislation. I do not believe that it would be sensible or
appropriate to rush into detailed primary legislation on this issue

that we are about to make a great step forward. As to where it applies,
I will happily buy England only so as not to delay it and, indeed,
perhaps it could become a minor or major issue on the future of
Scotland. They can discuss what part they will play. In the light of
what my noble friend so graciously and kindly said, I have pleasure in

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I can be brief with the
government amendments in this group. The substantive one is Amendment
96AC, which implements a recommendation made by the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee in respect of a delegated power in the
Bill’s provisions on child sexual exploitation at hotels. The
committee recommended that the regulation-making power in Clause 132
should be subject to the affirmative procedure, given that it confers a
power for the police to gather information about hotel guests and that
there is nothing in the Bill to restrict the use that may be made of
information provided to the
police<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:39:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012016000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012016000002">This
power is already limited to the information that can be readily
obtained from guests and does not impose a requirement on guests to
provide the information. However, we are happy to accept the point made
by the committee and place an additional safeguard on this power. The
amendment to Clause 167 therefore ensures that regulations specifying
additional categories of information should indeed be subject to the
affirmative procedure. The other amendments in this group simply
transfer these provisions to Part 9 of the Bill, which is a more
appropriate home for them than Part 11. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14012016000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012016000040">Amendment

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, Schedule 7 to the Terrorism
Act 2000 is an important part of the UK’s counterterrorism
strategy. The amendments to that schedule in the Bill were made in line
with our ongoing commitment to ensure that respect for individual
freedoms is balanced against reducing the threat of terrorism to the
public here and to British interests overseas. We understand, even from
our recent debates, that there remain aspects where we could go further
in reforming the operation of the powers in Schedule 7.
Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:40:55"></hs_TimeCode> me set out
the basis for the Government’s amendments in this group and I

93F and 93G, which relate to England and Wales and to Scotland
respectively, clarify how the right to consult a solicitor as soon as
reasonably practicable, privately and at any time, may be exercised by
a person detained under Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act. These
amendments make clear that a detained person who exercises the right to
consult a solicitor may not be questioned until they have consulted a
solicitor or no longer wish to do so. This is an important
clarification and will put beyond doubt that examining officers must
not question a detained person who has requested to consult a
solicitor.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012016000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012016000005">In
the distinct context of a person detained at a port, an airport or an
international rail station, consultation with a solicitor will
ordinarily be by telephone, video call, text message or e-mail. The
amendments provide that an examining officer may question a detained
person who wishes to consult a solicitor if the officer reasonably
believes that postponing the questioning would be likely to prejudice
determination of whether the detained person appears to be a person
concerned with the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of
terrorism. That is unlikely, other than in circumstances where a
detained person insists on speaking with a particular solicitor who
remains unavailable set against the statutory time limit for conducting
the
examination.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012016000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012016000006">The
amendments also clarify that a detained person is entitled to consult a
solicitor in person. This is an entitlement, not an absolute right.
Where a person is detained at a port, an airport or an international
rail station there may not be suitable facilities available for a
personal consultation. These places are not police stations. If a
detained person wishes to consult a 
<?notus-xml column=497?>solicitor in person, the examining officer will have to have regard to
the facilities available for a private consultation and the time it
will take for a solicitor to arrive at the port and to access the
secure area where the person is detained. Where escort officers are
available, and without detracting from the policing of the port, the
examining officer may decide to transfer the detained person to a
police station to facilitate a consultation in person, although that
will extend the duration of the person’s
detention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012016000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012016000007">Similar
provision is made to allow an examining officer to question a detained

portion of the limited time available for the examination. In that

Amendments 93J and 93N. These respond to a commitment I gave in
Committee to further consider an amendment tabled by my noble friend
Lord Lester of Herne Hill which sought to build on one of the key
changes we are making in the Bill, namely the introduction of a
statutory review of detention under Schedule 7 to the 2000 Act. On
reflection, we agree with my noble friend that the periods for the new
review of detention should be specified in primary legislation rather
than in a code of practice. The amendments provide for a first review
of detention by a review officer no less than one hour after the start
of detention and for subsequent reviews at intervals of no more than
two hours.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:46:13"></hs_TimeCode>, the
Government’s amendments in respect of the review of detention go
further than that. We are providing not only a new statutory review of
individuals’ detention under Schedule 7 but additional new
safeguards to ensure that persons whose detention is subject to review
will, for the first time, have a right to make representations about
their detention and a right to be informed of any rights that they have
not exercised. I beg to

concern the power to detain people at ports and airports and the power
to copy and retain their personal electronic data, and propose that
these powers should be exercisable only if the officer reasonably
suspects that the person concerned is involved or has been involved in
acts of terrorism. Your Lordships will know that the application of the
existing powers is currently the subject of litigation in the David

of detention of persons and retention of their electronic data must be
subject to greater safeguards. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has
so recommended in its very helpful reports, most recently in its ninth
report, published on 6 January. The Terrorism Act 2000, which Schedule
8 to this Bill would amend, allows for detention without any need for
the officer to have any suspicion, reasonable or otherwise. The Bill
would allow for detention for questioning for up to six hours—a
very substantial interference, on any view, with individual

Anderson concluded that the threshold should be subjective suspicion on

an amendment to introduce even that limited test, but, in any event, I
do not think that such a control would be adequate in the context of
the detention of persons and the copying and retention of personal
electronic data. As the Joint Committee concluded, a subjective
suspicion threshold is no safeguard whatever. Simply to require that an
officer in fact suspects provides no independent scrutiny of the
officer’s
reasoning<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:51:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Rights. However, as many lawyers will remember, there have been a whole
series of cases in Strasbourg with names such as Klass against Germany
and Malone against the United Kingdom where the Strasbourg court has
said that it is necessary that there are adequate safeguards against
the abuse of powers, including police powers. This amendment addresses
the need for more adequate

Joint Committee has considered this twice—once in its original

view that these safeguards are necessary. If the Government were to
reject that opinion today, all I can say is that if I were in
Strasbourg arguing for the Crown I would find myself in some difficulty
because I am convinced that the Strasbourg court will scrutinise the
reasons the Minister will give in deciding whether there are adequate
safeguards. In other words, I think Mr Malik will lose but it would be
a pyrrhic victory for the Government unless they were able to convince
that court that there were adequate safeguards. I would rather avoid
that today by putting the adequate safeguards into the Bill instead of
waiting for another defeat in Strasbourg, in effect, and having to do
it on a further
occasion.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14012020000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012020000164"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:00:08"></hs_TimeCode></I>6

for the timetable, it is appropriate that this should be in the Bill.

give the police the power to detain somebody prior to arrest. In that
provision, the timetable was set out. It had to be amended
in the light of recent developments following the case of
Salduz, but again the timetable was in the Bill. I believe that, for

perception of what amounts to terrorism can vary according to what
their perception is of what is going on and where
these activities are being conducted. It is not

justify what he did?” That was how the power given to the police

a protection. It is that protection which is absent at the moment and

Lloyd of Berwick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I could just have
a brief word on Amendments 93A and 93B. There has been much discussion
over the years as to whether the right to stop under Schedule 7 should
be available only on reasonable suspicion. I am glad that the amendment
now before the House does not go that far. The arguments in favour of
and against the power to stop without reasonable suspicion are all very
well set out in the excellent recent report of David Anderson, the
reviewer. Unfortunately, that particular question was not included in
the public consultation which took place in 2011. My view has always
been in favour of the power to stop without reasonable suspicion. There
is no real analogy with the power to stop under Section 44 of the
Terrorism Act. But the power to detain—that is, the power to
detain under paragraph
6(1)(b<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:09:54"></hs_TimeCode>)—seems
to me altogether different.</hs_para>

is exercised, the person in question will have been questioned for up
to an hour. All the benefits of the power to stop without suspicion,
which I strongly believe in, particularly the deterrent effect of that
power, will by then have accrued. Moreover, the examining officer will
have had ample time during that hour to explore whether there are
grounds for reasonable suspicion. The balance of arguments seems
therefore to shift decisively in favour of reasonable suspicion being
the test at that stage. For that reason, I support the
amendment.</hs_para>

has been reduced from 24 hours, as it was when I was considering these

Avebury (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I also want to add a word in
support of the amendment which was moved so comprehensively and
powerfully by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. I am disappointed that the
Minister has not had time to make any observations about the two cases
that I cited at an earlier stage. The first was where a distinguished
imam was stopped at Heathrow Airport, made to give a DNA sample and
fingerprints and detained for some time. It took me 15 months to get
the DNA sample removed and his name expunged from the records. The
second case was of a gentleman who was stopped three times within the
space of months, indicating, to my serious concern, that there must
exist a blacklist of people who are to be stopped when they pass
through airports or sea ports. That is a very serious development on
which I had hoped the Minister would be able to make some observations

now<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012020000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012020000023">Amendment
94ZA in my name would delete the whole of new paragraph 11A from

but papers, photographs, videos or audio cassettes, and to keep a copy
of that material for as long as it is considered necessary for the
purpose of determining whether a person falls within Section 40(1)(b);
that is, that he is or has been concerned in the commission,
preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. It is clear that the
vast majority of people who are held at the ports of entry have nothing
to do with terrorism whatever. When this matter was discussed on 11

that statement was not the whole story, as the Minister knows, and it
was a little disingenuous of him to omit the rest of Mr
Anderson’s comments in his evidence to the Home Affairs Select
Committee on 20 November. He recommended that the power to copy and
retain data from electronic devices should be exercisable only if a
senior officer was satisfied that there were grounds for suspecting
that the person appeared to be concerned in the commission, preparation
or instigation of acts of terrorism. Mr Anderson went on to compare the
indefinite retention of those data with the period of 48 hours that
applies to the retention of documents copied under reasonable suspicion
powers such as Section 43 of, and Schedule 5 to, the Terrorism Act
2000. He did say that electronic data can be held for very long periods
under the management of police information regime, a practice that had
recently been criticised by the courts and which is in marked contrast
to the rules and guidance that exist under the Protection of Freedoms
Act 2012. There should be some consistency between these different
regimes while allowing a margin of appreciation in cases where there is
a reasonable suspicion of
terrorism<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:17:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

things, the implications for press freedom of the extraordinarily wide

should demand is that, as David Anderson finally recommends, the
Government ensure that private electronic data gathered under Schedule
7 are subject to proper safeguards governing their retention and use,

preface my remarks by noting that we continue to await the judgment of
the High Court in the judicial review proceedings brought by Mr David
Miranda, following his examination under Schedule 7 in August last
year. Although the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David

made some recommendations in relation to Schedule 7, we will not have
the benefit of his report on the detention of Mr Miranda and any
further recommendations he may make until after the judgment is handed
down. Consequently, the debate on Schedule 7 will continue beyond our
proceedings today and beyond this Bill. I am certain that we will
return to these matters in detail in the future. I am grateful to the

examinations are not simply about the police talking to people they

talking to people travelling to and 
<?notus-xml column=506?>from places where terrorist activity is taking place or emerging, to

threshold. Ensuring an appropriate threshold that is clear in its

a matter the Government continue to reconsider. We shall reflect

the matter, I discovered that there was an even greater issue for those
who were trying to have a service within Westminster Abbey. The sadness
is that most of those who would be demonstrating would be very upset if
they realised that their noise meant, for example, that the
wedding day of someone who had looked forward to it, either in St
Margaret’s or in Westminster Abbey, would be destroyed because
it would be impossible to hear. A number of those who demonstrate have

in which one can avoid that is what might be called pre-notification.
Indeed, that is to be encouraged, but we live in a democracy and it is
right that people should protest. I would be the last person to seek to
restrict protest wherever possible, because it is part of the whole
fabric of a society in which human rights matter. Our debates on the
Bill have been illuminated by lawyers and non-lawyers insisting that,
however tough the threats to this country through terrorism may be, we
must always be concerned to protect the rights of the

discussions with various authorities which showed that, until now, the

faulty. There have been difficulties in putting together the roles of
the Royal Parks, which controls part of the area, and of Westminster
City Council, the Metropolitan Police and the London Assembly, all of
which have a say in this. It has therefore been very helpful to put the
mechanisms on paper as we have before us today. I thank the Minister

have wanted me to go further and have compulsory pre-advice when anyone
was going to have a protest. There are temptations to do that, because
it is a reasonable thing to ask for in most cases. But it is not always

when we debated my noble friend’s amendments the first time,
that there are already sufficient powers, including within existing
Westminster City Council and Royal Parks byelaws, for the police,
Westminster Council and the Royal Parks to deal with noise issues
around the Palace of Westminster. From the Government’s
perspective, the issue is not so much an absence powers, but the
effective enforcement of the powers that are currently

is true that there are some differences between the provisions that
apply to Parliament Square under the Police Reform and Social
Responsibility Act 2011, and those that apply to the area we are
talking about

currently no pre-authorisation requirement for the use of amplified
noise equipment in areas other than those covered by the Royal Parks
Regulation. In addition, the offence under the 2011 Act attracts a
higher maximum penalty of a £5,000 fine, compared with the
Westminster City Council byelaws where the maximum fine is £500
and the Royal Parks byelaws where it is £200 or £1,000
depending on the offence. Your Lordships may take the view that a
single set of harmonised controls in the vicinity of the Palace of
Westminster might assist the enforcement agencies to deal with noise
disruptions more effectively. However, the need for effective
enforcement would remain.</hs_para>

of Parliament. The key features of this protocol are that it sets out a
clear process for dealing with noise issues around the Palace of
Westminster; provides a single, adequately resourced contact number for
complaints, which will be followed up; sets out a process for the
police and Westminster City Council to liaise with protest organisers
in advance and inform them of the legal position as regards the use of
amplified noise equipment and their responsibilities; and sets out an
agreed process for the police and Westminster City Council to work
together to deal with noise issues arising from planned potential
disruptive demonstrations. The enforcement agencies have also produced

important to affirm absolutely both the right of protest, with the
human rights which are involved in being able to protest, and, at the
same time, the right and duty of the Abbey to maintain its pattern of
prayer to God, particularly in view of the way in which it stands for
the spiritual nature and concerns of this nation, and of our monarch
and the Royal Family. Our daily prayers here with your Lordships stress
particularly the needs of this realm and of the monarch. Westminster
Abbey is a unique testimony to prayer for those needs, and there is a

Just hearing the outline of the different authorities involved when

for his general support for the steps that we have taken to try to
resolve this issue. As I said, it is a matter for the House. The
interests of those demonstrating are, I believe, best served by the
facility of pre-booking a demonstration based on availability, which
this protocol will provide for. It is not essential and there is no
attempt to say that this will be the only way in which people can
demonstrate. There is no imposition on people demonstrating, other than
that they obey the requirements of the by-laws in respect of the noise
made through amplified sound. This provision is made explicit by my
noble friend Lord Deben’s amendment. Throughout, the right to
demonstrate and to assemble has been seen as a key feature of what we
consider to be proper here at this end of Parliament, as it is in
respect of Parliament Square.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Rosser, also asked why the enforcement of noise
by-laws has not been effective. The one thing which came out of our
first, extremely productive, general meeting with everybody present was
that people were in effect operating in their own little silos. If I
explain that responsibility for the George V statue and the paved area
in front of it lies with Westminster City Council while responsibility
for the green part beyond it lies with the Royal Parks, your Lordships

is almost complete agreement across the industry, and certainly in the
Home Office, that the licensing of individuals working in private
security has had a beneficial effect in driving up standards and
increasing public confidence. Regulation has been a force for good, as
the industry has argued, by marginalising criminality and giving
confidence to the purchasers of security and to the general public that

is increasingly important as private security firms take on more and
more responsibility for 
<?notus-xml column=520?>safeguarding public space and looking after sensitive national
infrastructure. For three years now the industry has been arguing for
business licensing to build on what has been achieved in the past
decade and to provide effective regulation of a sector that plays such

alongside the police, in counterterrorism activities, and with a wide
range of public

reason that no progress has been made since 2010 is clear. Within the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Cabinet Office
there is a determination—one might say almost an ideological
fixation—that no new undue burdens should be placed on
businesses, regardless of considerations of public safety and public
confidence, and of the benefits of combating the criminality that still
lurks in the industry. Any regulatory changes, they insist, must be
proportionate and targeted; and this part of the Government has yet to

I believe, is why the Home Office is proposing two possible alternative
routes for progress in this matter; both, in my view, profoundly
unsatisfactory. The first suggestion of the Home Office is to introduce
business licensing of private security companies through secondary
legislation. The disadvantage of this approach is that it cannot be
enforced by a range of appropriate and effective sanctions. Regulation
without enforcement is worse than the existing situation, because it
plays into the hands of the unscrupulous and the downright criminal,
and penalises conscientious and law-abiding businesses. The essential
feature of regulation is that it must be effective. The industry has
legitimate concerns, and has made its view clear, that business
licensing introduced through secondary legislation cannot be
effectively
enforced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012033000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000020">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:05:14"></hs_TimeCode>
second Home Office proposal is to find an MP who comes high up in the
annual ballot for Private Members’ Bills in 2014 to agree to
introduce business licensing by this route. The cynicism of this
suggestion takes my breath away. How many Private Members’ Bills
ever make it over the many hurdles put in their way to the statute
book? Is this the way to engage with an important industry that turns
over up to £6 billion annually? The Home Office must know that
without government support this route is extremely unlikely to yield
any concrete result, yet blithely suggests that this is a credible
option owing to its own inability to overcome the objections of the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills department and the
Cabinet Office and bring in primary legislation.</hs_para>

is the dilemma that my amendment is aimed at resolving. What it seeks
to do is to license, in the first instance, companies with contracts,
or that are seeking contracts, to work alongside or with public
authorities. That would almost certainly include all approved
contractor scheme companies, which covers around 70% of those working
in the sector. My amendment backs this up with a full range of
enforcement powers and the ability to exchange information about those
companies licensed across government and public agencies. The remainder
of companies working in the private security sector—almost
certainly the smaller companies 
<?notus-xml column=521?>and the one-man businesses the Government are so concerned to
protect—could then be dealt with in a few months’ time by
a second set of provisions.
Indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:07:04"></hs_TimeCode>,
secondary legislation might well be utilised here. I ask the Minister:
would secondary legislation be possible to complete this process? If
not, a small targeted Bill in the next Session could easily be taken
through to license those companies that did not come into this first
tranche of my
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:07:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012033000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000022">I

I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:09:25"></hs_TimeCode> am
aware—and I have to say this—that some industry leaders
are worried about it on the grounds that it adds a layer of complexity
to an already complex set of industry regulations. But all private
security industry leaders want an effective range of sanctions to
underpin regulation, and they also all want the effective exchange of
information, which will not be secured by the routes the
Government currently have in mind. If the Minister could give an
assurance that a second stage of business licensing to cover those
companies not covered by this amendment will follow relatively quickly,
this would achieve the goal of business licensing of the
private security sector more effectively than the
alternatives the Home Office is
proposing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:08:10"></hs_TimeCode>.

reduce protection of the public by preventing the regulation of

Henig:</Member></B> My Lords, I have listened carefully to what the
Minister has said. The first point I want to make is that, clearly, the
Minister and those of us who are arguing for this are not divided on
the end. We share the same goals; we are divided on the means to
achieve those goals. The thing that has worried me particularly is the
speed, or rather the lack of speed, with which the Government are
moving forward on this. We have waited since 2010; we are now into
2014. This was all supposed to have been completed, I remind the
Minister, by the end of 2013. I remember that he gave a pledge that it
would all be completed by the end of 2013. We are now in January 2014
and the Minister is still using phrases such as, “as soon as
possible”, “once completed” and “we aim to
do this”. He has to acknowledge that the speed has been somewhat
less than he would have liked. We know where the problems lie but it is
this lack of speed that motivated me to put the focus on moving with
urgency. What is actually happening is that, because of the slowness
and what appears to be lack of action by the Government, we are losing
the support of the
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012033000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000041">The
Minister will be aware that industry leaders are becoming increasingly
frustrated by the lack of progress. Their concern is that if this is
introduced through secondary legislation the situation could even be
worse for companies than it is at present, because of the difficulty of
enforcement under secondary legislation. I am concerned not to lose the
support of the industry. It is so unusual to have nearly all the
leaders of a big industry such as the private security industry united
in wanting business licensing of companies that I do not want to lose
that momentum. That is one reason I have brought forward a series of
amendments to try to focus attention on this issue, and to explain why
the industry is so concerned about it and why we need business
licensing. However, I have listened to what the Minister has said and
in the light of that, all we can do is wait. If he is not prepared to
bring something back at the next stage, all I can do is hope that the
primary legislation to which he referred will be with us sooner rather
than later. On that note. I beg leave to withdraw my
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14012033000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000172">Amendment

Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendments
94B, 94C and 94D. These are basically probing amendments. I apologise
for not bringing them forward in Committee, but I think that the Bill
was changed in the other place to add these amendments. Some of the
amendments that were brought in in the other place are very good, but I
am concerned about the resulting balance between what PCSOs can do to
cyclists and what they can do to motorists. I am sure the Minister will
agree that there has to be some balance in what they can do and the way
they go about it. I speak as a cyclist. I hope that I am a law-abiding
cyclist. I am also secretary of the All-Party Group on
Cycling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012033000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000043">In
general, I welcome the ability of PCSOs to hand out fixed penalty
notices. It is a good idea but if they can do it to cyclists, they
should be able to do it to motorists as well. My amendments are,
frankly, just examples, because when one digs into the
legislation—the various pieces of primary legislation and the
regulations—it is a bit of a can of worms, as I am sure the
Minister will agree, and it has been like that for many years. I hope
that we can, at least, have a little debate about this tonight and
maybe see what happens after
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012033000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000044">I
was particularly concerned when I discovered that the Metropolitan
Police has been targeting cyclists in a really rather unpleasant way.
There is a memo that one of my cycling colleagues has seen which gave
Metropolitan Police officers a target of putting penalties on
10 cyclists each in London. That is a very bad way of going
about it. Was there a similar target of 10 motorists? I do not know,
but we can see where that goes. Amendment 94A would make offences under
Section 35 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which concerns failure to
comply with a traffic direction, apply to motorists as well as cycle
riders. The Bill says it should apply to cycle riders and I am
suggesting that, if a PCSO is capable of stopping a cyclist, he should
be able to stop the driver of a vehicle.</hs_para>

must all accept that there are fewer policemen around now than there
used to be and that PCSOs add to their presence in the streets and
encourage cyclists and motorists to obey the law. This allows PCSOs to
stop cyclists and, I hope, vehicles. I think it is mainly to do with a
survey, which may be important. I do not think it is the most important
thing we are talking about in the Bill but, clearly, if a cyclist needs
to take part in a survey, he should stop and do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012033000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000046">Amendment
94B is very much more important. This is to do with advanced stop
lines. I fear that this needs a longer explanation. I thought for many
years that the first advanced stop line that you come to is advisory,
if there are two with a box in between, the box being for cyclists. I
discover that it is not advisory; it has the same force of law for
motorists as the second one does. I shall say a little more about that
in a minute. There is also a rather odd piece of legislation about the
box between the first and second advanced stop lines. There is often an
entry for cyclists on the left of the box as they go into it.
Apparently examples have come up in London when a cyclist wants to make
use of the box—which, after all, is there to provide visibility
for cyclists.</hs_para>

been the case for many years that visibility is the most important
thing and lack of visibility has probably contributed to much of the
sharp rise in cycling fatalities in London this year. A lot of good
work has been done to try to make cyclists more visible, but one of the
most important things is the box, whereby drivers can see the cyclist
in the box. However, apparently there is an anomaly if one is at a stop
line and a cyclist wants to turn right. Normally, the cyclist might
have got into the right hand lane of the traffic before he reached the
stop line, would then stop until the lights turned green, and then go
forward and turn right when it was safe to do so. Apparently, the only
legal way of entering this box is up that little lane on the left,
which means that the cyclist has not cross the full line—he
crosses the dotted line to get into the box, then he has to go across
one, two or occasionally three lanes of, one hopes, stopped traffic, to
get into the right-hand side to turn right. I hope that I am not
confusing your Lordships too much. It is a problem when cars do not
stop at the first line. Then the cyclist wants to go further ahead to
be seen, and then he is crossing the second line, maybe, and he gets
stopped by the police and fined—and he will get stopped by the
PCSOs in

do not have a solution for this, and I am not sure that the Minister
will have one. It is very complicated. But if PCSOs are going to stop
and put a penalty on cyclists for making these manoeuvres that are, in
theory, illegal, there must be a similar action by the PCSOs to take
action against road vehicles. I have tried pretty hard to find out how
many examples there are of police stopping and putting penalties on
vehicles that have gone through the stop lines, but it is really very
difficult to find the statistics. I have some only from London, but it

for failing to comply with the advanced stop line offence. When I cycle
every day, probably at half the stop lines that I come to a vehicle has
gone over it. It may be enforced, but it is nothing like enforced
enough. If a PCSO is going to stop a cyclist going over one or other of
these lines, I hope that they will be able to stop and put a penalty on

the cyclists will be treated in the same way—and that a little

next amendment, Amendment 94C—I shall be a little
quicker—is to do with lighting. There are too 
<?notus-xml column=527?>many cyclists going around without lights at night. We all know that,
and it is extremely dangerous. It is good when the police take action,
and it must be good that PCSOs will be able to as well. The problem is
that, when you dig down into the regulation, you find that all cycle
pedals must have lights on them—or reflectors, front and back,
of a sort of orange colour. But you also find that, although they have
been in the construction and use regulations for about 20 years,
roughly half the cycles in use in this country do not have such
reflectors; the manufacturers are not complying with the regulations. I
am not sure whose job it is to make manufacturers comply, but it will
not be much good if half the cyclists in London are to be stopped and
given a penalty for not having a reflector because they cannot buy a
particular pedal that they need, which can take a reflector.

this extra work. This is not a way of teaching them to suck eggs, or
anything like that. If you are in a situation where you are trying to
control and regulate and ensure that cyclists are cycling safely and
within the law, it is just as well that you know how to ride a bicycle.
Similar comments could apply to police in cars who deal with motoring
offences on the move; on the whole, they have the right training, I
believe. Some of them do not have the right training in
bicycles<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:36:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012033000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012033000053">I
was cycling up a cycle lane through Hyde Park a year or two ago, in the
dark, and there was a car coming down the cycle lane. I stopped the car
and asked them what they were doing because they were driving illegally
down the cycle lane. Of course, in the car were two police officers,
and I asked them why they were driving down the cycling lane. They said
that they were on patrol and I said, “Yes, I know that, but
can’t you patrol on bicycles? Is it too cold for
you?”—because it was winter. They said, “No,
it’s not to do with that. We have to have special training
before we can patrol on bicycles, and we both failed the test”.
I am not sure whether that is a good or a bad example, but it shows
that there is a test to be done. Those police officers—and there
are many more of them now—who patrol on bicycles do it very
well. They are much less threatening than when you come across them in
a car on a dark night. So the idea of PCSOs doing some training before
they embark on bicycle regulations would be very

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, for his amendments. I suppose there was a general answer when
he was talking about dotted lines and straight lines. I was told from a
very young age that whenever you crossed the line, it was not the right
thing to do. That is something all should keep in perspective when
looking at these issues.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:40:08"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord
spoke to the subject in his amendments with a great deal of expertise
and insight. I fully acknowledge his work as president of the Road
Danger Reduction Forum and as vice-president of the Cycling Touring
Club<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:40:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Amendment 94D would mandate that all PCSOs must undergo a cycle
training course before a chief constable designates cycle-related
powers. We recognise that, as a result of these changes, additional
training will be required to ensure PCSOs have the right knowledge,
skills and expertise to exercise these powers. We do not agree that
this should be mandated specifically by Whitehall, but we are confident
that the police and the College of Policing are best placed to deliver
this. I will bring this to their
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:41:04"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Lord was speaking with insight and I am quite happy to facilitate
a meeting with the Roads Minister to see how we could talk about these
subjects in terms of their wider application. I think he would agree,
from his personal experience as a cyclist—and an avid cyclist at
that—that across Britain and in our cities as well we are going
through an evolutionary change on cycling. There is a ready acceptance
now that cycling is something that is to be encouraged as part of the
transport mix. When you go to cities such as Cambridge, for example,
you actually see how it operates more effectively than in other parts
of Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:41:35"></hs_TimeCode>. We

now turn to Amendment 94C regarding the updating of regulations. The
Department for Transport has consulted on the simplification of the
current regulations with groups including the police. Revising these
will form part of their ongoing work on the red tape challenge.
Granting PCSOs the power to enforce 
<?notus-xml column=529?>regulations on cycling without lights will have a real impact on
improving the visibility of cyclists and will help prevent road traffic
accidents. The noble Lord acknowledged this himself in speaking to his
amendments. That is why we believe that delaying the introduction of
this power until after the regulations are updated would not achieve
our objective of improving the safety of cyclists and other road users
as quickly as we want to. His point about the pedals on cycles is well
made. I remember years ago passing the cycling proficiency test and
there were certain things which were “dos” and
“don’ts”. He is correct in saying that many cycles
now in Britain do not have reflectors and there is a need for those
regulations to be updated. His point of raising these issues with
manufacturers is also well made and

94A and 94B seek to grant PCSOs the power to issue motorists with a
fixed-penalty notice for failing to comply with traffic directions and
for failing to comply with advance stop sign regulations. We recognise
that PCSOs have a key part to play in tackling issues around road
safety and have consulted with the police and other key stakeholders on
this matter as part of our ongoing work to explore the development of
the role and powers of PCSOs. I am grateful to the noble Lord for
suggesting these further enhancements to PCSO powers and I will
certainly take his suggestions away to consider them as part of the
wider work on reviewing PCSO powers that is already taking place.
However, we want to understand fully the implications for PCSOs, the
police and the public and until we have completed that further work I
think it would be premature to make these changes at this time. I am
aware that there is some concern that our proposals will result in
cyclists being picked on by PCSOs. Let me assure the noble Lord that
that is clearly not our intention. The powers in the Bill are not new,
as a police officer can already exercise them. Just as police officers
use their discretion, we expect that PCSOs will also do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:44:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:44:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on a couple of points made by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser. Of course,
the extension of these new powers is very much in the hands of the
chief constable. PCSOs have 20 standard powers and another 22
discretionary powers. These changes bring a further 19 discretionary
powers. It is really down to the chief constable to make the decision
from an operational perspective as to what powers should be extended to
PCSOs. We believe that is the right thing to do. We know that the
public really value the role PCSOs play in tackling low-level crime and
anti-social behaviour and we believe that this package of measures will
ensure that they can continue to play a key part in providing the best
service to the communities they serve. Given these reasons and, I hope,
the assurances I have given to the noble Lord that we will continue to
consider the points he has raised and the powers available to PCSOs, I
hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his

summarise what appears to be a slightly technical and arid set of
amendments, but which would nevertheless have a very significant

individuals enjoy at

summary in context. First, my particular concern is the impact of the
Government’s proposal on those arrested under what is known as a
Part 1 warrant—more familiarly, the European arrest
warrant—because of the very short timetable of EAW proceedings.
Secondly, I want to make it clear that this is not an attack on the EAW
generally. The EAW has enabled many very nasty
criminals—terrorists and the like—to be speedily brought
back or sent back to face justice. That is as it should be. Thirdly,
and quite understandably, this Government—and, indeed, the
previous Government—focus on these very high-profile cases, but
the vast majority of cases do not involve matters of high
importance.</hs_para>

ordinary members of the public for whom this will be an entirely
strange and unfamiliar process and one which they are not well equipped
to challenge. Some of them will have been arrested for crimes which
they did not commit. 
<?notus-xml column=531?>Therefore, it is on behalf of these people—Edmund Burke’s

Sir Scott Baker to review the operation of this country’s

For example, they expect much less use in future of the EAW for trivial
crimes and that greater efforts will be made to ensure that cases are
trial-ready before the surrendering of individuals takes
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:49:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Those are

hope that the House will forgive me if I remind noble Lords of two
particular aspects. The first, as regards the EAW, is just how
compressed the process of surrender is. An arrest will be followed by a
court hearing at Westminster magistrates’ court within
48 hours. The accused will be represented by a duty
solicitor who may or may not know anything about extradition. Edward
Grange, a specialist extradition solicitor, has
explained:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14012036000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012036000044">“At

after that initial hearing will follow within 21 days, so that in as

it is worth while remembering that, if the person wishes to appeal, he
has in any case to make that appeal within seven days. I ask noble
Lords to imagine the case of an unsophisticated person remanded in
prison. His first legal representative, it turns out, knows nothing
about extradition, so he has to make a change. He has to gather
evidence, probably from at least two jurisdictions, perhaps involving
many people, and put all that together into a case, and he has to do so
within seven days while he is confined to
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:51:53"></hs_TimeCode>. So much

catastrophic impact that extradition can have on an
individual—on his family, on his home, on his employment and
indeed on his whole life. I shall not weary the House today with
quotations from people who have been involved in these cases, but the
stories of how people’s lives have been turned upside down by
mis-arrests and an inability to get the appropriate advice and help are
truly horrifying. The step of a state arresting one of its own citizens
and handing him or her over to another state to try is a very
fundamental one. It needs to have a proper level of safeguards. That is
why I have tabled these amendments today and why I think they are so

shoulder of my noble friend on the Front Bench and glance at his
speaking notes, what do I think I would see there as the
Government’s wish behind the policy of removing the automatic
right of appeal? I think the first thing would be that they were doing
so because Sir Scott Baker recommended its abolition due to what he saw
as a large number of unmeritorious appeals. However, the world has
moved on since Sit Scott Baker undertook his review. First, the
safeguards introduced by the Government, as I referred to earlier,
through their amendments to the 2003 Act will now give weight to
arguments which may previously have been deemed to be without merit due
to the lack of a legislative basis. Therefore, it is likely that these
reforms will reduce the number of unmeritorious appeals reaching the
High Court. Further, the Government have introduced a requirement in
Clause 145 of this Bill for the National Crime Agency to review
extradition requests and sift out cases where it is clear that a judge
would be required to order a person’s discharge on the basis
that extradition would be
disproportionate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:54:03"></hs_TimeCode>.

remember that, while Sir Scott Baker recommended that the automatic
right of appeal should be removed, as a compensating factor
he also recommended that the time in which an appeal could
be launched should increase from seven to
14 days to match the period that exists for a Part 2
warrant. I tabled an amendment to that effect in Committee.
Subsequent to that, and after discussions with my noble friend on the
Front Bench, I reflected and concluded that the longer the appeal
period, the more the well resourced “nasty” case could

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened carefully to the
noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. I think that he has argued a powerful case
this evening and I share his concerns. I am not convinced that the
Government have made the case for removing the automatic right of
appeal. Given the criticisms that the Government themselves have made
of the European arrest warrant, I find it particularly surprising that
they now seek to remove the automatic right to challenge such a
warrant<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:57:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government brought this forward in terms of the Baker review.
However, we are talking about British citizens being extradited to face
what I would hope would be justice in another country. I have looked at
the same information as the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, and the figure of
12% of appeals being successful is likely to change significantly. The
Government have made other, welcome changes to ensure that cases
without merit are more easily dismissed, and we would support those. I
am not convinced that the information that Baker had to work with can
now be viewed as a reliable indicator of the current number of
unsuccessful appeals. As the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, said, the world
has moved on and the Government have made changes, and therefore the
figures will have changed.</hs_para>

the court will still have to make a decision on whether to allow leave
to appeal. I do not know whether the noble Lord can help me on that.
Would it be a written or an oral process? That is not clarified in the
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Whatever the process, it is going to require a degree of judicial and
administrative time, and that seems to me to eat into any cost savings.
However, the impact assessment says that those savings will in any case
be minimal, if there are any at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:58:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the noble Lord made was about the court’s discretion. An
individual would have to be able to show that they had new
evidence or a different legal analysis, or that the evidence that the
judge relied on in making the original decision to extradite them was
wrong or incorrectly interpreted. We have to accept that there can be
mistakes. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, outlined the scenario of
a duty solicitor. He or she would do their best for their
client but they might only just have met the client and may not have
all the information. It is a complex area of law and they may not be up
to speed or have dealt with such cases before, so it is not impossible,
although it is understandable, for
mistakes to be made. It seems to me that in the very short time
available for seeking permission to appeal, they would have to have
almost the same information as they would need for an appeal, and that
is quite an amount of detailed information. I wonder how somebody in
those circumstances could provide all the information required in the
time
allowed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

all our interest to ensure that the appeal process should never be used
just to delay judicial process. However, we have to ensure that there
is a process to provide for genuine errors. I mention specifically the
Gary McKinnon case, which has caused all Governments a great deal of
anguish and consideration. The evidence that ultimately ensured that he
remained 
<?notus-xml column=534?>in the UK related to his mental health. That information would not have
been easy to provide in the time allowed by the proposals being brought
forward by the Government today. He would not have had an automatic
right of appeal. Could he have got that evidence and presented a mental
health report in time for a permissions hearing before the High Court?
I am not convinced that he could. I think that the Government have not
yet made the case in the light of other changes. I would also ask the
noble Lord what impact he thinks the National Crime Agency’s
sift of applications will have. That could have a significant effect on
the number of cases.</hs_para>

I am not 100% clear that I have understood government Amendment 94DH
correctly. My understanding is that the Government are choosing an
option. The Minister wrote to us about this and I am grateful to him
for doing so, but I want to clarify a couple of points. This is about
the ratification of the European Convention on Extradition. The
Government’s amendment allows the Government to hold or detain
someone while the request to ignore the bar on a person being proceeded
against for offences other than those listed in the extradition
request—the rule of speciality—is being considered by the
state that originally extradited the person. Those will be people who
are already facing charges for extradition, and the Government are then
seeking to charge them with offences beyond those for which they have
been extradited and are awaiting permission to do that and want to hold
them while they are waiting. I understand that. However, not all states
are signed up to this; it is an optional measure. What are the reasons
for opting in, and have the Government given any consideration to the
impact on current or past cases? Does the Minister have any indication
of the kind of offences that are being considered here and has any
consideration been given to the length of time that the state would
hold people while authorisation to ignore the role of speciality is
being considered? That length of time could be quite significant in
terms of justice for the person facing extradition and those seeking
justice from them. Clarification in writing on those points would be
helpful.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012036000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012036000027">I

Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> My Lords, before the noble Baroness
sits down, it might help if I were to say that my understanding is that
applications for leave to appeal have to be in writing. The grounds for
seeking leave have to be written out in the application, and usually
these things are disposed of on paper, so it is essential for success
to have the grounds properly stated on paper. One has to bear in
mind—this may be the noble Baroness’s point—that
these things will be put together by somebody who is in custody, within
a very short time limit, who may find it difficult to get access to
legal advice. Without expressing a view one way or the other, I suggest
that the practicalities of this measure need to be very carefully

it is best if I start with the government amendments in this group,
which would insert two new clauses into the Bill. First, Amendment 94DG
implements an optional provision in the Fourth Additional Protocol to
the European Convention on Extradition—the ECE—which the
Government intend to ratify shortly. The ECE governs extradition
between the UK and members of the Council of Europe—other than
EU member states—plus Israel, South Africa and the Republic of
Korea. This provision concerns the issue of speciality, which is the
bar on a person being proceeded against for offences committed prior to
extradition other than those listed in the extradition
request.</hs_para>

Fourth Additional Protocol provides an optional mechanism whereby
states can restrict the personal freedom of a person while a request to
waive the rule of speciality is being considered by the state that
originally extradited the person. This is not something that is
currently catered for in Sections 150 and 151A of the Extradition Act
2003, which deal with the speciality rule in these cases. Accordingly,
Amendment 94DG makes the appropriate changes to the 2003 Act. A person
may only be detained under this new provision where both states have
made the relevant declaration under the ECE and that declaration is
still in force, and certain specified conditions, as set out in the new
clause, are met.</hs_para>

on that point. Those conditions are as follows. First, the Home
Secretary requests the state that extradited the person to waive the
speciality rule. Such requests are predicated on the prosecuting
authorities being satisfied that there is a case to answer and that
prosecution for other offences would be in the public interest.
Secondly, the requested state must be notified by the Secretary of
State that she would wish the person to be detained while they consider
the request to waive specialty. Thirdly, the requested state must
explicitly acknowledge the notification. If the requested state objects
to the detention request then that person may not be detained; or if
detained, must be released. Finally, and assuming these criteria are
met, any application to detain the person will be made by the
prosecuting authorities to the courts in line with general criminal law
procedures. The new provision allows for detention in these
circumstances for a maximum period of 90
days.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012036000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012036000033">We
believe there will be only rare cases which fall into this category.
However, in those rare cases, the ability of the prosecuting
authorities to apply for the person to be remanded in custody could be
crucial to safeguarding the public and effecting a successful
prosecution.</hs_para>

section 142(2A) of the 2003 Act. Section 142 deals with the issue of
European arrest warrants in the UK; that is, in cases where the UK is
requesting the extradition of a person from another member state. In
the case of people who have already been convicted of an offence and
whose extradition is requested in order to be sentenced or to serve a
sentence, one of the conditions for the issue of an EAW by a UK judge
is that the person is “unlawfully 
<?notus-xml column=536?>at large”. In a recent case a judge refused to issue an EAW in
respect of a person who was in prison in another member state on the
basis that the person could not be said to be “unlawfully at
large”. Following that, we have decided to amend the 2003 Act to
make clear that it is no barrier to the issue of an EAW that the person
is in prison in the requested state. Amendment 94DH will
achieve that.</hs_para>

amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts.
Let me preface my comments on the detail of his amendments by
reiterating that we welcome the constructive approach he has taken to
the extradition provisions in the Bill, and I am pleased to say that
there is a great deal of common ground between us. As my noble friend
explained, Amendments 94DA to 94DF would remove the appeal filter
introduced by Clause 148.</hs_para>

Scott Baker’s review of our extradition arrangements was that
the success rate of appeals was extremely low—less than 13% in
2010. In other words, the court system is burdened by unmeritorious
appeals which delay hearings for all appellants. The purpose of the
appeal filter is to address this problem by making appeals subject to
permission from the High Court. I understand the points that my noble
friend makes, but I must stress again, as I did in Committee, that
these provisions will not prevent anyone applying for permission to
appeal. Once an application has been made, the High Court will decide
which cases should proceed to a hearing. Each application will be
considered by a High Court
judge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012036000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012036000037"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:10:46"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
I wish to make two further comments with regard to two of the other
extradition clauses in the Bill. The first relates to Clause 144. That
clause inserts a new Section 12A into the 2003 Act which provides a bar
to extradition in EAW cases—cases where the issuing state has
not taken a decision to charge and a decision to try the person. I want
to make clear that the purpose of and intention behind this clause is
to ensure that the case is sufficiently well advanced in the issuing
country. We want to ensure that ordinary mutual legal assistance
arrangements are used fully and properly. It is not our intention that
a parochial approach to this clause should be taken. As the Court of
Appeal has said, the Extradition Act 2003 should be interpreted in a
cosmopolitan sense and be mindful of the stages of criminal procedure
in other member states which do not use the common law. It is important
that there is a clear intention to bring the case to trial. An EAW
must, after all, be issued only for the purposes of conducting a
criminal prosecution, as Article 1 of the framework decision makes very
clear. We want an EAW to be used only for its proper
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:12:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012036000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0002.htm#14012036000038">Comments
have been made about the timescale for appeals. Clause 148 sets out
that the High Court must not refuse to entertain an application for
leave to appeal by the requested person solely because it has been
submitted outside the normal time period if the person did everything
reasonably possible to ensure that the notice was given as soon as it
could be. That is an important provision. It is also important to note
that the seven and 14-day period relates to the notification of the
intention to seek leave to appeal. I appreciate 
<?notus-xml column=537?>the concern that this is an insufficient period. However, it is also
important to be clear that the onus should be on the person to ensure
that as much as possible of the detail of why they believe they should
not be extradited should be before the court as soon as possible. This
would surely improve their chances of having the case discharged at an
early stage by the district judge.</hs_para>

clarify what the Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims
said in the Commons Committee on 16 July last year in relation to dual
criminality and Clause 152. He spoke about how this provision would
work in practice in relation to an example about the offence of
Holocaust denial. I want to ensure that there is absolute clarity on
this point. Where an EAW was received for Holocaust denial allegedly
committed in the UK, extradition would be barred for that conduct
because it is not an offence here. However, extradition would be
granted for such conduct committed in the issuing state, provided that
the conduct is punishable in the issuing state with imprisonment or
another form of detention for a term of three years, or a greater
punishment, and of course that none of the bars in the Act apply so as
to prevent

noble Baroness asked a number of questions and I hope that I have
answered some of them. Perhaps I may say particularly that the changes
we are making will give people greater protections and improve the
overall operation of the EAW, but that they will not impact on the
number of unmeritorious appeals. It will be a matter for the courts how
they operate the filter and decide whether to grant or refuse
admission. On the impact of the NCA
filter—proportionality—while the filter will leave the
number of low-level cases that the courts will have to consider, we
cannot say how it will impact on the number of cases that the court
will consider. This will be dependent on the number of requests made by
a state. I hope that I have been able to persuade my noble friend that
our approach on extradition appeals is the right one and he should not
press his amendments. As for the government amendments, I commend them

Berridge (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for clarifying that 1,100 people have been granted refugee status, but
I think it would be useful to have further clarification. How many of
those people were already in this country when they applied for asylum,
and how many have very dangerously made their way to our shores and
claimed asylum? It seems that with the latter situation we are enabling
some of the most able who can travel to come to our shores to get
refugee status and not some of the most vulnerable, who have been
processed by the United Nations and who are desperately in need of
refugee status, to gain that
status<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:32:42"></hs_TimeCode>. Can the

probably the most serious crisis that has confronted us for a very long
time. Our allies around Syria—Turkey, Lebanon and other
countries—are battling under the strain and beginning to break
down under it. There is no doubt that the Government’s policy
has been excellent in terms of financial aid and I give full credit to
it, but I agree with the noble Baroness who has just spoken that the
gesture of having some Syrian children and families here would be an
example to the rest of the members of the United Nations. That example
would come all the more from a country that has given moral leadership
in terms of financial help. The Government need to take one more human
step to show that they are willing to have a limited number of Syrian

that our top priority should continue to be to provide humanitarian

defendants should be able to pay the defence costs of Crown Court cases
privately, as set out in the <I>Transforming Legal Aid: Next Steps</I>

that those individuals who really cannot pay their defence costs
privately can be represented in court. This will be similar to the

civil legal aid cases must pass the applicable merits test, as set out

is targeted at the cases that most justify it. The prospects of success

legal aid cases are subject to, but it is an important element. Not all
applications are subject to a prospects of success test. Only
applications for full representation, a specific form of civil legal
service, are directly subject to a prospects of success test. Therefore
applications for legal help—the advice and assistance level of
legal aid—and other types of service are not subject to this
test. Also, there are certain categories of case, for example certain
family and mental health cases, where the test does not apply. It is
important to note that these cases are not affected by this

It also ensures that weak cases are not funded. Currently, certain
cases assessed as having borderline prospects of success can be funded
in limited circumstances. The regulations that your Lordships are
considering today will remove funding for cases assessed as having
borderline prospects of success. I am aware that concerns have been
raised about our policy on borderline cases. Let me deal with one or
two of those. I recognise that there is some unease over the effect
these regulations might have on the development of case law and the
funding of so-called test cases or those with the potential to advance
the common law. Legal aid cases have indeed led to the development of
case law in the past, but that alone is not sufficient justification
for legal aid to be granted in cases that do not have at least a 50%
prospect of success. In addition, I do not think that our proposal will
hinder or prevent the development of case law. The arguments are likely
to be strong for such a development to be warranted.</hs_para>

has also been expressed in response to our consultation about cases

his department, and particularly the Ministers in it, have tended to
indulge in a series of attacks on many of the best and most important
features of our legal system, in the field of civil and criminal law.
The consequence of the removal of legal aid from social welfare law,
the over-the-top attack on criminal fees, the proposals on judicial
review, or the proposed residence test, has been to lessen the
reputation of our legal system in a number of ways. Most
importantly—I think this is felt around the House to a greater
or lesser degree—these measures attack the overriding principle
that all those who live under the rule of law should have at least some
access to quality justice when they need it in the course of their
lives.</hs_para>

concerns about the exclusion of borderline cases from the scope of

noble Lord, Lord Bach, mentioned examples of such legal aid cases,
including one in which I acted for the claimants. That was the case of
Debbie Purdy, which was the subject of the last judgment of the

of the Supreme Court in 2009. This was a case in which judgments were

held that that the DPP had a duty to publish guidelines about the

was accordingly granted under the law at the time. When these
regulations are implemented, as I think they now are, legal aid will
simply be unavailable for such a case.</hs_para>

to fund such cases serves the public interest. The Minister told the

cannot begin to justify the damage that this change will do to the
ability to develop the common
law<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:04:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Minister’s other point was that taxpayers’ money should
not be spent on cases that a private-paying citizen of reasonable means
would not wish to pursue. The defect in that reasoning is that a
private-paying citizen may well wish to pursue a case that has only a
30% or 40% chance of success if it raises an issue of enormous

further<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:04:07"></hs_TimeCode> point in
answer to this defence of this change. It is a point that was made by
Richard Drabble QC in his excellent response to the consultation on
this issue. He pointed out that when the Government respond to judicial
reviews in cases such as that of Debbie Purdy they do not simply ask
themselves whether they have a 50% chance of success and, if not,
decline to be represented in the court proceedings; the Government very
properly take account of the importance and complexity of the case and
often fund a defence even though their legal advisers cannot say that
there is a 50% chance of success. These are not the cases mentioned by
the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, where further investigation may provide an
answer; they are cases where it is inherent in the nature of the case
that they are borderline and you cannot say that there is a 50% chance
of success.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000036">Why
should the legal aid scheme adopt a different and narrower approach to

deciding when and how to resist judicial review claims? The

interest in ensuring that the law is determined and applied only after
proper legal argument on both sides. For these reasons, I very much
regret these amendment regulations and I hope that the Minister, if he

in my support of the regret Motion introduced very clearly by the noble

Lord, Lord Pannick. However, I want to turn to the criminal regulation.
I do not support a criminal regulation that means that somebody who has

counsel on legal aid but his preference would be to instruct more
senior counsel, leading counsel, but that would not be covered by legal
aid. Not surprisingly, the 70 year-old retired butcher asked for advice
as to his prospects if he took either part of the respective advice. He
was advised by the solicitor, perfectly reasonably, that his best
prospects were to have the more experienced counsel from the very
beginning, so leading counsel was

it turned out, in the event, there were a number of complex legal
points and some factual issues. After the matter was dealt with with a
good deal of care by the solicitor and leading counsel, the case went
to the Crown Court where it was dropped at the courtroom door. One of
the reasons why it was dropped was that it transpired that he could not
have committed one of the most important offences alleged against him
because he was out of the country at the time, an issue which involved
very complicated inquiry, including issues of the admissibility of
evidence obtained from abroad. Thus, he avoided a trial and a potential
sentence of upward of 10 years’ imprisonment and he was able to
return to his family and home. He had paid for the advice by borrowing
money from his grown-up children and by mortgaging his
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000041">Before
your Lordships think about six-figure sums for the fees involved, they
were nothing like so high. It was well understood by the solicitor, who
drove a hard bargain, and by counsel, who knew perfectly well that
their fees were subject to assessment if they were too high, that
reasonable fees would have to be charged, and they were. Total costs in
the case amounted to a middling five-figure sum. He applied for his
costs before the Crown Court judge, before whom the case was
dropped—accepting an acquittal, by the way—and the judge
thought it entirely reasonable that he had obtained the advice of
leading counsel and a good solicitor and he was awarded his costs out
of central funds. What is unreasonable or unjust about that? He acted
on legal advice, what he did was perfectly reasonable, a good result
was obtained and the costs of a trial were avoided, which would
probably have been higher than what was paid out of central funds to
the solicitor and leading
counsel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000042">What

there is a threat to equality of arms—a point made very clearly
by Richard Drabble QC. He has already been quoted, so I will not repeat
what he said. The JCHR is clear that exceptional funding cannot be
relied on to ensure access to justice in place of borderline legal aid
funding, as has been argued by the Government, although I think that
they have not been using that argument so much since the JCHR published
its report. Again, ILPA wholeheartedly concurs with the JCHR analysis,
saying that those lawyers who are prepared to do the risk work involved
in applying for exceptional funding are increasingly disheartened by
the soul-destroying work in spending many hours putting together a
lengthy and detailed exceptional funding application and knowing that
it has almost no prospects of

view that the measure that deals with borderline cases—the

I said, I shall not replough old ground, although I should like to
remind the House that in the consultation, which lasted for only two
months, there were 16,000 written submissions, which is quite

Bach, has already said, against these provisions. I simply want to
quote paragraph 234 of the report of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights issued on the 13th of last month. It is the seventh report of
the Session and it deals with the matters that we are talking about
tonight. In referring to the present situation—the status
quo—it
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1401213000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000127">“We

is the point. Only 100 or so cases are involved, and I think that the
sum of legal aid estimated to be at stake is around £1 million.
Therefore, they are already exceptional cases and we must realise that
they reverberate throughout the system. As the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Woolf, has just reminded us, under the common law system of
precedent, one of these cases can affect thousands of cases, which will
not be brought as a result. Therefore, there is that to

the Joint Committee report is absolutely unequivocal about these
borderline cases. 
<?notus-xml column=555?>It is worth reading—and I am sure that most noble Lords here
tonight have read—the fourth chapter and the three conclusions
at paragraphs 43 to 45 of the final recommendations and conclusions. I
urge the Minister—perhaps he will refer to this in summing
up—to give an undertaking to the House that the Government will
not wait the three to five years allowed for under the LASPO Act for a
review of the whole of that vital piece of legislation. However, if
they persist in pushing forward with these measures—which I hope
very much they will not—I hope that they will make a special
case of borderline cases and review early the impact of what they are
doing, not least in terms of access to justice and the cost of
justice.</hs_para>

the charity Justice, in its report on this matter, rightly pointed out,
the cost to the Exchequer of depriving many of these borderline cases

critical to recognise and bear in mind in the course of this short
debate that under the existing funding scheme—the scheme it is
now proposed to abolish—borderline cases are funded only if they
are either of significant wider public importance or of overwhelming
importance to the applicant. In other words, the cases to which it is
now intended to deny future funding will be either those with
implications for the relationship between the state and a substantial
number of individuals, or those that impact on such fundamental
interests as an individual’s life, liberty, health, housing or
something of that character. Surely, these cases are ones that must
therefore justify a broader merits test than the bald test simply of
establishing that there is at least a 50:50 chance of
success.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1401213000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000062">I

on the Motion moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, to take note of
the effect of a whole raft of proposed government cuts in legal aid
funding—which included those we are now discussing—I
urged the Government to take particular note, among the innumerable
responses to consultation, almost all of which were opposed for a
variety of reasons, of the consultation response prepared by ALBA, the
Constitutional and Administrative Law Bar Association, of which I was
once privileged to be president. ALBA’s arguments were and
remain cogent and convincing, not least as to the borderline cases.
Among the material that ALBA presents is a 2012 study by Doughty Street
Chambers—chambers that are prominent and highly respected in the
field of public law and from which the just retired Director of Public
Prosecutions came—showing that in the three years until then,
borderline cases had achieved a substantive benefit for the funded
party in between 47% and 56% of those cases, which was an average of
just over 50%. I repeat, those cases are by definition important cases
that affect either the public at large or the vital interests of an
individual. Therefore, they are not cases from which the Government
should be withdrawing funding. The suggested savings are uncertain; the
price of achieving them is altogether too
high.</hs_para>

shall try not to repeat what others have said but the first point on
which I want to comment is the borderline test itself, particularly the
use to which it has been put. I have a feeling that it has a sort of
arithmetical sense to it. When one talks about a borderline case,
people at conferences will ask: is it above or below 50%? That is fair
enough; that is what the test really means. If it is 50%, it is on the
borderline. However, the problem, as has been explained by so many
others, is that these things do not measure themselves
arithmetically.</hs_para>

brings me to a series of questions about how this will work in
practice. How will fairness be achieved 
<?notus-xml column=557?>up and down the country? I understand that decisions are taken by
independent funding adjudicators who look at the papers. We are not
dealing with a single individual—it is difficult enough for one
person—but one can imagine a series of people in different
offices applying their minds to this test. Is any guidance to be given
on how to approach the question of arriving at the borderline? If there
is to be guidance, will it be made public so that we can comment on it
and make suggestions, particularly if the system is to be reviewed in
the future? There is then the very important point made by the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Woolf: will there be any element of discretion
or shading in a situation where it is difficult to say that it is
exactly at 50%? Can one, for example, have a margin of error in favour
of granting legal aid, as against not doing so? It is that kind of
guidance, if the Minister could explain it, that would help to flesh
out how this will work in
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000068">The
problem with the test, as has been said already, is that it introduces
an unequal playing field. The state on the one hand, with all its
resources, is in a position to apply a different test on whether or not
it wishes to contest the claim, whereas the individual is caught by
this very exacting test. There is the vital point about the development
of case law. I recall a series of cases, which have already been
mentioned, but because I was involved I dare to mention them again.
There was the case of Purdy, but it was preceded by that of Pretty, who
is unfortunately no longer alive. That was the original assisted
suicide case. It was a very difficult case in which to say that she had
a 50% chance of success. In fact, she lost. She went to the Strasbourg
court and lost there again, but the advantage of her case was that it
helped us to begin to develop jurisprudence in this immensely difficult
subject, which all Members of this House will have to discuss again
before too long. It cleared a lot of the ground, which made it easier
to grapple with the Purdy case when it came
along.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000069">Then
there were the succession of cases, to which the noble Lord, Lord Bach,
has referred, in the field of social housing, which were also very
difficult to predict. I bear a personal responsibility for this because
I sat with Lord Bingham and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls,
and, I think, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Walker, all of whom took
one view. Three judges went one way but I turned the case around. Three
others followed me and we were a majority of four to three. Who could
have predicted that? Everyone knows—this is a commonplace
criticism of the Privy Council jurisdiction in the
Caribbean—that you need to know who the judges are and the way
cases vary. How can one predict when it depends so much on
personalities in cases that are so narrowly balanced, as they so often
are in the highest

last point to which I want to draw attention is one of the difficult
areas of our law, which has been repeatedly commented on. What do you
do as judges, particularly in the senior courts, when you are applying
Section 2 of the Human Rights Act, which refers to having regard to
decisions of the Strasbourg court? Some of us have been fairly inclined
to follow Strasbourg; others have not, in particular the noble and
learned 
<?notus-xml column=558?>Lord, Lord Judge, who asked the other day in a lecture why we should do
that. He said we should take an independent view. Again, one will have
to guess what the judges are going to do with that jurisdiction,
whether there is to be any change and who will be sitting on the panel.
One can predict, looking at the Supreme Court today, who will vote one
way or the other. That makes this whole idea of the borderline test
extremely difficult to accept unless there is to be some really
rigorous guidance, which I hope the noble Lord may be able to comment
and guide us on. I would respectfully support the Motion that the noble

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to
join with others of your Lordships in extending very warm
congratulations to the Minister on his first experience at the Dispatch
Box. Of course, he demonstrated the reasons for his appointment very
fully. The noble Lord is an ornament to the legal profession, just as
his brother is an ornament to literature. We look forward on this side
to many useful jousts over the next few months

noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said, has undertaken to do this work without
remuneration. That is a notable sacrifice on his part. Of course it is
consistent with the Government’s policy of acquiring most
lawyers to do legal aid work more or less pro bono. I hope that he does
not expect too many to follow his example with enthusiasm. However,

Lords, these regulations are yet another example of this
Government’s apparently incurable propensity to legislate in
haste and amend at leisure. It was, appropriately, only on 1 April last

it, we are entitled to ask, that the Government overlooked the apparent
necessity to change the arrangements for borderline cases and make them
ineligible for legal aid? How did they fail to spot the tidal wave of
such cases, amounting—according to the estimate they now
give—to all of 100 cases a year? Or the soaring cost to the
taxpayer, which equates to as much as just under 0.5% of the legal aid
budget?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000075">After

Minister, again repeating the words of his honourable friend in the
House of Commons in a debate in the Delegated Legislation Committee,
mentioned what I can only describe as the pretext for the
Government’s belated change of position: the stated importance
of the public having real confidence in the scheme. This was a
reference of course to taxpayers’ hard-earned money being spent
on cases that a private citizen with reasonable means would not wish to
pursue because he would feel that the case is not strong enough and,
therefore, that it cannot be right for the state to spend
taxpayers’ hard-earned money on such cases.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:45:34"></hs_TimeCode> have heard
some rebuttals of that assumption

Carlile, suggested another thought to me about this in referring to
criminal regulations. It struck me that, in the event that a private
citizen used his reasonable means to pursue a civil claim and
succeeded, he would of course obtain his costs, not on legal aid rates
but on the ordinary rates. Therefore, a divergence would take place
between the criminal case and the civil case, which I find difficult to
understand<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:46:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000079">However,
the important point for the purpose of my noble friend’s
amendment is that in neither the Minister’s speech tonight nor
in his honourable friend’s evidence before the Delegated
Legislation Committee was there any significant response to the
Secondary Legislation Committee’s report which recognised, in
its words, that the policy was to reduce the size of the legal aid
bill. However, while expressing its understanding, it stated that
“the premise of excluding weaker cases” raised, as we
have heard, the question of the appropriateness of excluding access to
legal aid where the issue turns on a disputed point of law. Hitherto,
as the committee pointed out, dispute over law or expert evidence was
grounds for including an apparently weaker case in the scope of legal
aid<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:47:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000080">As
my noble friend Andy Slaughter pointed out—as have others of
your Lordships tonight—there have been a number of borderline
cases that have raised matters of great public interest and which would
have been unlikely to qualify for legal aid under the proposed changes
to the system. They range from the case of Smith and Others v The
Ministry of Defence, the very high-profile case to which my noble
friend referred, in which the Supreme Court eventually decided that the
courts could adjudicate on whether the rights of soldiers in combat
can, in certain circumstances, be the subject of a

one of the claimants in that case was represented under a conditional
fee agreement, where the insurer declined to support the application to
proceed to the Supreme Court. The public interest, of course, was not a
matter which engaged the interests of the insurers. However, as the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, pointed out, the public interest is

<?notus-xml column=560?>surely a key element. Public interest should surely also engage the

of the main themes of the debate was the fear that the lack of legal
aid for these borderline cases will result in some form of ossification
of the common law—that it will not develop in the absence of
legal aid for such borderline cases. It is worth remembering that the
common law develops in a number of different ways, sometimes with cases
which one would not expect to result in a change in the law. The
Government believe that prospect of success—the test that is
applied—remains a useful and sound test and that a 50% prospect
of success is a reasonable one and should not result in cases not being
brought and the law not
developing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:55:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000093">Individual
cases were mentioned, including Pinnock, Smith v Ministry of Defence,
Purdy, Pretty and Anufrijeva, to name but a few, all of which were
important cases. Of course, the Government are not in a position to
comment on individual cases, or precisely on the funding arrangements
that may have existed in those cases. There may be other cases which
have not resulted in success or in the development of the law. The
Government  
<?notus-xml column=562?>remain doubtful that the change which these regulations will bring about
will prevent cases being brought in areas where the law will develop
and has developed. One of the ways in which the law has developed is
through the Human Rights Act, and it shows little sign of standing

noble Lord, Lord Bach, asked particularly about the impact on housing
cases. I recognise the serious consequences that can ensue from housing
cases—the potential for someone to lose their home. Indeed,
there are all sorts of cases where there may be serious consequences.
But there always has to be an assessment of the merits of a
case—that has been well established in the granting of legal
aid—and it has been a fundamental part of the scheme since
its 
inception<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:57:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401213000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000095">The
noble Lord also questioned the accuracy of the savings which are put
forward. The Government’s best estimate is £1 million. An
impact assessment estimated that 100 fewer cases would be funded. As
was made clear in the methodology, those were rounded figures. Further
supporting data consisting of a breakdown by category of law have been
included in the updated impact assessment published alongside the
consultation response. While the estimate is based on 2011-12 data, I
can assure the House that it is consistent with more recent data; that
is, the data from 2012 and
2013<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:57:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble

cases which may be included are those where there is a dispute over law
or expert evidence. I mentioned that there may still be legal aid where
it is as yet impossible to assess the prospect of success, but the
Government have been frank that they consider it reasonable in
principle that 50% should be the touchstone. We suggest to the House
that it is a very reasonable and rather modest prospect of success when
one bears in mind the sort of decisions that somebody paying privately
might make in deciding whether to pursue litigation. Indeed, many would
say that 50% was rather a modest prospect of success and very few
privately paying citizens are much enthused or encouraged by the fact
that their case raises an interesting point of law. They may well find
that that is a less enticing prospect than the fact that they risk
losing the

noble Lords made reference to the fact that there might be some form of
inequality of arms because many of the cases were brought against
government, either local government or government in one department or
another. The Government’s position regarding litigation is that
they take into account a broad range of factors when deciding whether
to defend or appeal legal challenges, including the prospects of
success and the potential costs versus benefits of that action.
However, it would be simplistic to say that the Government simply took
advantage, as it were, of their overall position in deciding their
approach to litigation. It is already a principle of the current scheme
that most cases, even those concerning issues of high importance, must
have a reasonable prospect of success in order to warrant public
funding, and there has to be an assessment of merits and a decision
must be
made.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_20_PT_1/67F4DCE954B70C2E906F53E750D74C7920DAC8A8" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 January 2014">Monday,

Baroness, Lady Lister, referred to what the Joint Committee on Human
Rights said about exceptional funding. She effectively asked why this
had not been factored into our impact assessment, relying on what was
said in the Joint Committee. I regret to say that I think
the Joint Committee on Human Rights was guilty of conflating issues
here because exceptional funding is, or may be, permissible. I accept
that that is a potentially different debate. The grant or otherwise of
exceptional funding covers the question of scope, whereas the House is
concerned this evening with the prospects of success—that is,
whether they are borderline, 50% or, indeed, greater
than that. Therefore, a case assessed as having borderline
prospects of success will not receive exceptional funding
because it will not come within the test.</hs_para>

Lister, also asked about asylum-seeking children and I will attempt to

and the House that the Government recognise their responsibilities
under Council directive 2005/85/EC on minimum standards on procedures
in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status, which
requires the Government to provide legal assistance for those refused
asylum. However Article 15(3)(d) of the directive makes it clear that
this obligation extends only to those appeals that are “likely
to succeed”. I hope that answers the point made by the noble
Baroness.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1401213000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000100">My
noble friend Lord Carlile referred to the vivid case of the butcher. I

Government’s position is that notwithstanding the
fact—accepting the accuracy of the noble Lord’s account
of that particular case—it is not right for the taxpayer to have
to bear significantly greater costs for a privately paying defendant or
appellant than for one who is legally aided. Although I am sure that
the expensive lawyer in that case provided good value, in these austere
times the Government take the view that it is not their responsibility
to indemnify a defendant for a relatively expensive lawyer but rather
to pay at legal aid rates. The rationale for this was approved by
Parliament during the passage of the LASPO Bill in relation to
magistrates’ courts and we ask the House to bear that in
mind.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1401213000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-0003.htm#1401213000101">The

the Legal Aid Agency relies on experienced lawyers to advise on these

in-scope case on the basis of a merits assessment, he will be entitled
to appeal against that refusal to an independent funding adjudicator,
who is a barrister or solicitor independent of the director of legal
aid casework and whose decision on prospects of success then becomes
binding on the director. I hope that that reassures the noble and

reprioritised our limited resources against a set of principles. We did
not make wholesale changes to the merits test under LASPO; nor are we

Bach:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank the Minister for his
response to the debate tonight. It had the great advantage of being
clear, straightforward and answering many of the points that had been
made in the debate. It was very refreshing to hear a Minister speaking
in those terms. I thank him very much for that. I also thank all other
noble and noble and learned Lords for their contributions and support
for my Motion on this order. I am very grateful for what they had to
say, but even more so for having stayed as late as they have on what is
commonly called, as I understand it, Blue Monday, which is that day in
the year when, following the Christmas and New Year excess, people are
at their lowest and most depressed. So, although I was pleased by what
the Minister had to say, it has not really moved me out of my Blue
Monday feeling about this particular regulation. When he says that the
Government have a consistent policy on legal aid reform, I say to him:
I think that that is the problem. To be fair to the Minister, the
regulation was brought forward by his 
<?notus-xml column=566?>department well before he took over his new position—which was, I
believe, only a few hours ago. He can hardly be held to be completely
at fault for it.</hs_para>

excluding a certain category of worker from auto-enrolment. It sought
more information on three situations, identified that it had a
substantive response to the use of an exception, and committed to
publish the results, with government proposals and a further

so that the employer could operate without input from the worker. That
those circumstances need to be addressed to avoid detriment to workers
is clear, but at present the encouragement from HMRC is to do so by
opting out. If the system for exemption depends on the worker lodging
the existence of enhanced or fixed protection, perhaps with some

point with the level of the income tax personal threshold, thereby
removing thousands of the low-paid from its benefits. We are also

Bates (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is now two years since the
rollout of automatic enrolment began and we are seeing how it works in
practice. Automatic enrolment is a blunt instrument, since everybody
who meets the relevant tests is automatically enrolled. There is
emerging evidence that we should consider refining and targeting, but
it is impractical to make refinements by amending primary legislation
every single time. A degree of flexibility is an integral part of
future-proofing the policy. This clause provides that flexibility, with
a power to exclude prescribed types of workers from the scope of
automatic
enrolment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000015">I
should respond to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock,
and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. The inclusion of all employers,
whatever their size, is part of the broad consensus that continues to
underpin support for automatic enrolment. That is 
<?notus-xml column=262?>Her Majesty’s Government’s position. I will come back to
the specific points, which have rightly been raised, at some

oddities out of the system and this clause enables us to do just that.
Automatic enrolment is not always appropriate. Indeed, in extreme
cases, pension saving could lead to an individual incurring a financial
penalty. Until now we have relied on opt-out as a solution: an
individual can opt out of automatic enrolment if pension saving is not
right for them. However, a problem remains: inappropriate enrolments,
opt-outs and refunds still cause work for employers and frustration for
the individual. We need to consider how we can remove, or at least
reduce, the administrative burden in cases where automatic enrolment
serves no
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000017">The
Government’s consultation on technical changes to automatic
enrolment last year shows significant support from employers, pension
providers and financial advisers for limited, carefully crafted
exclusions which help individuals where automatic enrolment has no
benefit or makes no sense. We are currently looking at the evidence
from that consultation with a view to publishing proposals when a power
is on the statute book. So far, the evidence suggests some clear
examples. One straightforward example is that people with enhanced or
fixed tax protection status could face a tax surcharge if they make any
further contributions into a pension. As well as this, automatic
enrolment may be illogical for leavers, since it may make no sense to
force an employer to enrol a worker into a company pension scheme if
they are serving out their
notice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000018">Any
exclusion is likely to be sensible and uncontroversial which is why the
Government suggest that a negative resolution in these circumstances is
an appropriate use of Parliament’s time. In terms of the breadth
of this power, we have been clear from the outset that the intention of
this clause is not to exclude entire employment sectors from automatic
enrolment or to carve out a particular size of employer; that is a
specific statement in relation to this.</hs_para>

undersaving is most prevalent among low-to-moderate earners, those who
work for employers who have not provided an accessible pension scheme
or those who do not pay into one. These are the core policy objectives
on which the consensus was built and to which we are still committed.
We are not considering exclusions to the automatic enrolment duty
simply because some employers tell us automatic enrolment is an
inconvenience. This is about exceptional situations where it makes
sense to take a person outside the scope of the Bill, hence the
exemption. Although I can understand the aim of the amendment, it is
trying to stop the Government from doing something that we have no
intention of doing. As noble Lords will know, it would not ultimately
constrain future Governments in any

introduced, such as the timetabling for the introduction of
auto-enrolment 
<?notus-xml column=263?>meaning that smaller businesses, with fewer than 50 workers,

justified. The drafting of this power enables us to react to unforeseen

the issues that we have identified. We are, of course, having a

phrase a piece of legislation and make certain statements on the record
in terms of the progress of that legislation through the House. We give
certain assurances and then put something in to say, “This is to

unforeseen circumstances, I gave examples of areas where it would be
unacceptable to exclude people from the terms. We have rejected these
exemptions and certainly would not want to introduce them. We have
identified casual staff and teachers with second jobs, for instance, as
being examples of people for whom we would not want this provision not

I ask noble Lords, if not quite to trust the Government, at least to

Government’s policy that all categories of employer should be

person may emerge who they do not yet know about who they may wish to
exclude in the future, and therefore they need to keep this open. So
the question I am left with is: are the Government open to the
possibility that somebody may make a compelling case for excluding a
category of employer by size? If they are not, there is no reason for
them not to accept this amendment. If they are, then, frankly, their
assurances are not worth the time that they have been given today. I am

would be difficult to show how it satisfies the test scheme standard.

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments allow for two simpler
alternative tests for a scheme to demonstrate that it is of sufficient
quality. These were developed following last year’s consultation
on technical changes to automatic enrolment, asking for views on
whether there is a simpler way to determine whether a defined benefit
scheme is good enough for automatic enrolment.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012011000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000039">As
well as calling for a general simplification in these rules, responses
to the consultation highlighted that once the contracting-out period
ends in April 2016, all those schemes that are currently contracted
out, and so considered good enough, must satisfy the test scheme
standard. This is considered unnecessarily complex and burdensome,
particularly as, until the end of the contracting-out period, the
schemes will have satisfied the higher standard of the reference scheme
test. The alternative tests provide for a scheme to be used for
automatic enrolment if the cost to the scheme of the future accrual of
benefits for active members would require contributions that are at
least equivalent to one of two prescribed percentages of relevant
earnings. The first will apply at the aggregate level, looking at the
scheme as a whole, and the second will apply at the individual level
and must be satisfied for at least 90% of relevant members. Moreover,
in order to provide assurances about the quality of schemes satisfying
this alternative test, the amendment ensures that the prescribed
amounts will not be lower than 8% of relevant earnings, in line with
the minimum level for total contributions into a qualifying
money-purchase
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000040">We are
mindful of the need to strike the right balance between increasing
simplicity and flexibility and ensuring adequate member benefits across
all qualifying schemes. This balance will be one of the key issues to
explore as we consult stakeholders on the detail of the alternative
tests, and will also be reviewed in 2017 to ensure that the legislation
is working as intended. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000041"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Sherlock" PimsId="5776" UID="14012011000148" xid="2050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000148">Baroness

First, will he confirm whether the Bill, with these amendments, will
qualify the existing accrued rights protections in any way? Secondly,
will he assure us that, given the variations in definitions of
pensionable pay, the new defined benefit scheme qualifying tests will
be of no lesser standard than the certification alternative

Amendment 62H, which is again in my name and that of my noble friend

<?notus-xml column=270?>the statutory basis for the Secretary of State to make regulations to
restrict charges or impose requirements on work-based pension schemes.
The amendment would amend that clause to enable the Secretary of State,
following a public consultation, to set the standard by which pension
schemes must declare charges and transaction costs to their members and
the members’
employers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000044">Amendment
62H would give effect to a DPRRC recommendation and prevent the
Secretary of State from amending legislation “whenever
made” and imposing requirements on certain work-based pension
schemes by secondary legislation, thus bypassing full parliamentary
scrutiny. The DPRRC made this recommendation because it was not
persuaded adequately by the Government’s justification for
granting themselves this power. We agree with the DPRRC. That is the

regulations to be made requiring work-based pension schemes to disclose
periodically certain costs and information relating to charges for
management of investment portfolios. I shall return to these amendments

the evidence available now, it is difficult to exaggerate how obscure
the charging structure on pensions is. Pensions are pretty complicated
to begin with because, in an occupational pension scheme, the
employer—not the employee—is the person buying the
pension. That pension schemes are then invested in asset classes by
fund managers further complicates the challenge of understanding what

reasons we have debated repeatedly in this Bill, the market cannot
address this challenge. I regret that the Government have been slow to
understand the depth of the problem in the pensions market. My right
honourable friend Ed Miliband first raised this issue in July 2012. He
identified pensions as the next big scandal, warned that savers must be
protected from the scandal of hidden pension fees that can see people
stripped of huge percentages of their savings, and called for a new
regime imposing a clear charging structure on pension funds. He warned
that fees need to be capped. He was accused by the Pensions Minister of
being irresponsible. Regretfully, the Minister joined industry voices
who were making accusations of scaremongering. The next day, the RSA
published <I>Seeing Through the British Pension System</I>, which found
that 21 out of 23 providers denied that there were any additional
charges other than the annual management charge and administration
costs. They failed to reveal what is charged for items such as audit,
custodial costs and other costs such as taxes, lending fees and broking
commissions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:18:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T16:15:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of course, corroborated the basis for Ed Miliband’s concerns. In
his conference speech in September 2013, he announced that Labour would
support an OFT inquiry into the pensions industry, put a cap on pension
charges and force pension firms to stop hiding the full impact of the
pension charges they intend to levy on the full value of a pension. The
Pensions Institute at Cass Business School published a report entitled
<I>Caveat Venditor</I>, which examined the default funds that it is
estimated more than 90% of private sector employees will use under
auto-enrolment, and raised serious concerns about the continued use of
older funds with what it described as “toxic

some cases first-year charges in enrolment schemes can be as high as
£600 per member, followed by an ongoing £60 per year
charge. In May 2013, the Government stirred and announced a ban on
consultancy charges on auto-enrolment schemes, and they are to be
congratulated on that. In October 2013, on the day of Report in the
Commons—although it was trailed the previous day—the
Government launched a consultation on setting a cap on the maximum
charge that can be levied on savings and default funds, and moved the

pause to pose some questions to the Minister. Can he confirm that that

the vested interests of fund managers and pension companies? Can he

date, the amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
contain a comprehensive definition of a total expenses regime. They
identify and incorporate the 18 charges identified by <I>Which?</I> and
the OFT reports. My reservation, however, is that such a comprehensive
present-day list may not be future-proofed. To put it simply, we have
no reason to trust the sector not to invent other forms of charging to
get round such a comprehensive list. Anyone who has read the OFT or the
Cass/Pensions Institute reports would be wise to hold such a position.
This industry is dysfunctional and in large part does not act in
savers’ interests. When it has been forced to make changes, it
has done as little as possible. I fear that if we set in law 
<?notus-xml column=273?>a comprehensive list of charges as of today, the industry will not be
long in dreaming up another set of charges to avoid accounting for
them. Our amendment does not seek to specify the charges. We believe
that this more flexible approach, leaving definition, enforcement and
review to the regulator, is a better way. In our view the sector needs
to be kept on its toes with active ongoing scrutiny. However, I have to

Amendments 63 and 67 in my name, which are linked. I am glad that some

their amendments, which are very much on the same point. I hope that
what I did may have been some kind of a stimulus to them, because we

is a difference between the approach that the noble Lord, Lord Browne,
takes and that which I take. However, before I explain the difference,
I wish to articulate what the problem is. This problem is not confined
to the pension area but is well known to those who have studied any
economics at all. It is known in the trade as the principal agent
problem, where a principal cannot achieve his or her economic
objectives without giving an agent responsibility for dealing with it.
The incentive for the agent may be very different from the incentive
with which the principal originally entrusted the agent to carry out
what is needed. Here the principal is essentially the pension fund
beneficiary, via the pension fund itself, and the agent is the
investment manager. How is this of interest? I would hope that my noble
friend the Minister, even if he does not accept either the Labour
amendment or my amendments, will agree that there is a problem here
that has to be addressed. I hope that he will say how the Government
propose to address
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000059">There are
two differences between the approach adopted in the amendment of the
noble Lord, Lord Browne, and that adopted in mine. He seeks primarily
to regulate various charges made for the carrying out of the
investment. He mentioned disclosure, but the issue is mainly the cap on
charges and other forms of regulatory charges. There are problems with
that approach, which I shall not spell out because I do not want to
detain the Committee.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012011000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000060">What I have gone for is
compulsory disclosure. In a competitive market, compulsory disclosure
will go a very long way towards removing the mischief. If there is
proper disclosure, there is no need for a cap or the regulation of
charges in the first instance. We can then see how it works out. Events
may subsequently suggest that there may be some need for regulation but
initially the remedy must be to require disclosure. I have mentioned
seven types of cost that I believe should be disclosed. 
<?notus-xml column=274?>The noble Lord, Lord Browne, said that the sector might very inventively
find some other form of charge that does not fall within these
headings. I think that is highly unlikely. If noble Lords look at the
headings, it is difficult to see how any charge could not fall under
one or other of
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000061">The
important thing is the principle. The funds are inclined to say,
“You don’t need to worry about costs; all that matters is
the investment performance of the fund net of costs”. That is
not acceptable. The costs are massive in this area. Of course, the
investment performance may differ according to what period of time you
look at. One fund may have a very good performance during one period
and a bad performance during another. One has to look at the costs.
Some costs are not revealed at all; some are. Even with the costs that
are revealed, there is such a lack of consistency that it is difficult
to compare them and to see whether or not they are remotely
fair.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012011000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000062">There
are also other defects in the system. One is, I have to say, one of the
many defects of the accountancy profession in this country. According
to the accountancy profession, the Investment Management Association is
responsible for writing the statement of recommended practice on cost
disclosure for fund managers. This is ludicrous. You are asking the
foxes to regulate the hen coop, as it were. If my noble friend the
Minister looks at this, I am sure that he will find that it needs a
remedy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012011000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000063">There
is another relevant point. At the end of the day it is not merely the
pension fund beneficiaries who are being cheated by these excessive
costs—and many of these costs are grossly excessive—but
there is also the problem of pension fund deficits. The more costs are
ramped up unnecessarily by the pension funds, the worse that will make
the problem of deficits. Of course, there is no incentive for
investment managers to expose the costs that they are incurring in
their recommendations to the funds if they are not obliged to do so. It
will only make most of them look rather
expensive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012011000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012011000064">There
have been some studies in this area, both here and in the United
States. Among the findings of these studies is that there is absolutely
no correlation between investment management fees and performance.
There is also no correlation between portfolio churn, which creates a
lot of income for various people, and performance. There is some
evidence, although it is not conclusive, that portfolios are
deliberately churned in order to generate commissions. In the United
States, a study has been done that shows that most foreign exchange
currency pairs are not monitored but that, when they are, the foreign
exchange costs paid by funds are halved. There are problems across the
board, such as the fact that custodian banks pay lower rates on cash
than money market funds or that financial intermediaries can collect
excessive rewards.</hs_para>

these problems in its sights, but it is totally inadequate. I believe
that the FCA is pressing fund managers to manage their research
procurement, another area of costs that I have identified, in a more
defensible and transparent way. However, it is no accident that
typically pension funds meet in Manchester and fund managers meet in
Monte Carlo. I hope that my noble friends, who have done such an 
<?notus-xml column=275?>excellent job on this Bill, will take on board that this is a serious
problem—the principal agent problem, as it affects
pensions—and must be addressed one way or another.</hs_para>

this area is a problem, as we have discovered in this Committee. If we

now predominant will work only if people add contributions of their own

transparency in this area—not only the details set out by the

together all the different costs discovered by the <I>Which?</I>

our society is disengagement with politics in general, partly caused by
the sheer amount of legislation turned out by Parliament. No one really
understands what is going on and so people disengage from it. With all
the jargon in the investment industry, not least in relation to
pensions—terms such as “bid/offer”,
“revenue splits” and so on—the average person in
the street simply would not know what is being referred to. We need an
overall figure that helps people to understand how much of the money
that they are investing is actually invested, and investment returns,
in a way that is transparent and where the consumer is generally
protected. A few years ago, stakeholder pensions were an attempt to

German (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lords,
Lord Browne and Lord Lawson, for raising these issues, because they
allow us to examine the approaches which might be taken in the
regulations which may follow and to ask the Government to describe
which of these approaches, or what combination of these approaches,
they might take. It is quite clear, in my view, that there are two
separate approaches: one based on regulation and the other based on
openness, transparency and disclosure. There is no reason why you
cannot have some of one and some of the other; where the balance is
drawn is a matter for debate and discussion. Ultimately, this matter
goes to the heart of the success of our pensions industry for savers.
The saver must have trust in a system which has a long tail behind it
to understand that his or her money is being invested wisely and will
return on that investment to provide a
pension.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012013000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012013000004">Auto-enrolment
will, in the long run, be a success only if the schemes into which
people are enrolled are well run and invest people’s savings
responsibly. This is particularly important in DC schemes because, in
the end in those schemes, the saver bears the investment risk of that
complex decision process, which is more often than not made entirely
without the saver’s knowledge or input. I was very interested in
the chain described by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, which stretched
from Manchester to Monte Carlo. I daresay that if you started to plan
these chains out around the world, you would probably find that these
decisions were taken in all sorts of places and the connections very
wide. That helps demonstrate the length of the chain in investment
decisions, particularly if you start with the
saver.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012013000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012013000005">Of
course, auto-enrolled savers do not choose their own pension provider.
Poor pension companies might not become immediately evident to the
saver. The best governance of the system would ensure robust oversight
of savers’ interests and, most importantly, open communication
with savers. It is not always obvious that those in the investment
chain place the obligation to protect the best interests of savers at
the heart of their decisions, particularly if they are in Monte Carlo.
Fundamentally, that means improving transparency and promoting the
disclosure of clear and relevant information to savers, as well as ways
in which savers can easily find out information about their own
savings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012013000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012013000006">I

is, given that culture, to

selling products. I think it was the whistleblower Dave Penny, who
worked for Lloyds TSB, who gave a long list of tricks of the trade that
he had tried to warn against. We all know the fines that that company
had to pay for using those tricks in both PPI and bond selling. Mr
Penny

has not gone away just because of the massive fines and compensation
that these companies have paid. Only a couple of months ago, a woman in
her 60s received a cheque from her son for £35,000. She planned
to put that into a stock market investment. That same day that the
money arrived in her current account, she was called by a Lloyds
employee, who told her that the money could be at risk—an
extraordinary claim to make about funds left in the care of a clearing
bank. The Lloyds customer said, “The woman at the other end of
the line said that my money might not be safe in my current account
over the weekend and recommended that I transfer it to a savings
account where it would be less easy to steal. I was naturally very
worried about this and the bank did not really explain why my money
would not be safe in my current account. The whole thing caused me a
great deal of distress and eventually my husband intervened, and called
the bank to say I did not want to transfer my money to a savings
account and went ahead with my original investment
plans”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012013000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012013000009">Of
course, there is a financial incentive to place money in an investment
account in a bank, no matter how low the interest rates compared with a
current account, which is the sole reason why that employee made the
effort to contact that person. I realise that that is not of direct
relevance to these amendments, except to say that compliance will not
work unless you deal with the issue of the culture in these companies.
We will see all these tricks of the trade happening again, particularly
as the Government are going on the pot-follows-member formula. This

be aware, we launched our recent consultation on charging in October
2013, following on from the Office of Fair Trading’s September
2013 market study into defined contribution workplace pensions. That
study raised concerns, which the Government share, about the weakness
in the buyer side of the market—a point made powerfully by the
noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, in recounting those examples—the
complexity of the product and a lack of transparency, which hinders
consumers’ abilities to compare schemes. My noble friend Lord
Lawson, a distinguished economist, mentioned the principal agent 
<?notus-xml column=278?>problem, which has at its heart, in an economic context, asymmetry of
information. Transparency must therefore be part of the play which
somehow levels the playing field between one side and the
other.</hs_para>

consultation sought views on how the total cost of scheme membership,
including transaction costs, might be captured, reported and managed.
My noble friend Lord German rightly said that perhaps it was not an
“either/or” solution, but more of an “and”
solution. That was reflected in the consultation’s remit, which
presented not just one idea but alternative measures to improve the
transparency and disclosure charges, as referred to by my noble friend
Lord Lawson with regard to his proposed new schedule: a cap on charges
on default funds of defined contribution workplace pension schemes, a
point made powerfully by the noble Lord, Lord Browne; a ban on
active-member discounts and commission; and an extension of the ban on
consultancy charges to all schemes used for automatic enrolment. Quite

on whether transaction costs should be included within a charge cap.
Any charges that are restricted—even those under a possible
cap—will have to be defined in regulations. These regulations

the issue of disclosure of pension scheme charges and other costs, the
subject of the amendment and my noble friend Lord Lawson’s

OFT that a lack of transparency can hinder consumers’ ability to
compare schemes. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester
said, while there is also concern about the
correct operation and transparency of scheme, there is a greater
concern for us in our cross-party consensus: lack of knowledge or
understanding may deter people from making the very

is why we have consulted on a proposal to regulate, under existing
powers in Section 113 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, for greater
transparency of pension scheme charges. These powers could allow us to
mandate disclosure to both members and employers, and we asked for
views on these approaches. My noble friend Lord Lawson’s
amendment sets out a significant number of specific charges to be
disclosed. I thank my noble friend for his amendment and contribution,
and will ensure that they are considered as part of the response to the
consultation. His amendment illustrates the complexity of charging
structures and definitions—a point illustrated also by the
number of, and level of detail in, the responses to our consultation.
Given that these charging structures may change over time, we are not
minded to constrain the Government’s freedom of action to
respond to these changes by putting such specific details in primary
legislation, hence the need for Henry VIII powers. I should add that we
have been clear in our consultation that any requirement to disclose
information must result in that disclosure being meaningful, relevant
and accessible—not buried on page 12 in the fine print of a
document or policy, as might have been the case in the past—to
those who are making decisions about pension saving. That includes
employers and scheme trustees as well as individual savers. I realise
that I have been unable to provide specifics on how the
powers in Schedule 17 and Section 113 of the Pension Schemes
Act 1993 will be used in respect of restricting charges or requiring

German asked a specific question to which I will try to respond. He

The code sets out the best practice for institutional investors. The
FCA already requires UK asset managers to report on whether they apply

questions. I am grateful—and noble Lords will be
grateful—for his acceptance that transparency and disclosure are
a necessary part of the reform that we are engaged in; for his
confirmation that he and the Government share the concerns that have
been expressed in this debate; and, in particular, for his assurances,
in so far as they are assurances, that 
<?notus-xml column=281?>the response to the consultation can be expected shortly but that we
will receive from the Pensions Minister Steve Webb on Thursday in the

feel that we now have to wait until Thursday to see whether this
response is adequate and, in terms of what it allows us to expect or
anticipate, whether it puts a timeous set of potential actions in place

thank all noble Lords who have contributed to this debate. First, I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, for his engagement. I can confirm
that there was some stimulus from the fact that he tabled Amendments 63
and 67. Of course, the fact that he did so first in your
Lordships’ House does not detract from the fact that an almost
identical amendment was tabled in the name of the Labour Party in the
House of Commons by my honourable friend Gregg McClymont before
Committee there. I make this point not to in any sense undermine our
common interpretation of this problem or our substantially common
approach, but to point out that but for the slight difference of
wording between the amendment my honourable friend tabled in the
Commons and the one we tabled in your Lordships’ House, our
amendment would probably have been tabled about the same time as the
noble Lord’s amendment. The question of timing does not detract
from the fact that we have been engaged with this issue for some
significant time.</hs_para>

the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester for two things: first,
for his identifying that the approach of the Labour Front Bench and
that of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, are much more compatible than
others who have commented on this appear to believe. These amendments
proceed by way of regulation but the regulation is to define what
subsequently should be disclosed. I point out to those who have
contributed to this debate that we, too, are about disclosure with this
amendment. We have an ambition to cap the charges on the administration
of pension funds but this is not the vehicle for that policy. This is
about disclosure. It is about defining what ought to be disclosed in a
very precise fashion through a process of consultation and regulation,
and then about disclosure for all the same reasons that the noble
Lords, Lord Lawson and Lord German, the right reverend Prelate, my

second reason I am grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Chester is that he not only put his finger on the problem for the
member, or potential member, of a pension scheme but explained more
fully than I did—perhaps I should have done—why value for
money is so important to our reforms. It is about confidence. If there
is no confidence in the market, as the right reverend Prelate pointed
out—and drew the Minister to agree—this whole package of
reforms will fail. This will be half a reform, if there is no
confidence in the private pensions industry. Our whole thrust is to
address the issues that have been successively identified

reform the law and to provide the confidence that will be necessary for

comes down to this: the Minister, as his honourable friend the Pensions
Minister, Steve Webb, did in the other place, rests his case on the
statutory structure which is being created and a process of
consultation with a promise of significant regulation following
thereafter, which will be engaging and confidence building. His case

amendment seeks to capture that governance challenge. To achieve an
increase in pension savings, workers are auto-enrolled into workplace
pensions. There can be no caveat emptor, as the saver does not buy. The
system is designed to restrict the saver to one choice—either
stay in or opt out and lose the employer contribution. Current
regulation of contract-based pensions is at odds with the assumptions
underlying auto-enrolment. Contract-based regulation is built on
informed consent and consumer choice. Auto-enrolment is designed and
built on the principle of inertia, on a population of savers who do not
engage with investment choice. A plethora of reports has revealed the
conflicts of interest in the industry. The OFT report confirms a
dysfunctional pensions market with a weak demand side and concludes
that the market could not be expected to self-remedy and that there is
a need for
intervention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000030">The
introduction of auto-enrolment has been a success and the Government
should be pleased. Opt-out rates have been low. The Government must now
secure a level of quality and governance that delivers optimal results
for savers in terms of building trust so that workers persist with
their savings, thereby setting the ground for increasing contributions
beyond the current statutory minimum and improving savers’
chances of achieving a reasonable income in retirement. Measures to
encourage savers to engage with their pension savings are important but
of themselves are not sufficient. The majority of savers will not
actively engage. It is that very inertia that can be used by some
providers to create or sustain profitable inefficiencies. The legal
framework must protect those who do not
engage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000031">The
challenge of inertia means that there is a need for efficient defaults
over the life cycle of the pension saver. For example, there is a need
to get people saving; to determine a minimum they should save; to
determine their investment choice at different intervals in the life
cycle on, for example, joining a scheme or 
<?notus-xml column=284?>following a quality review as they get nearer to retirement age; and, by
default, to transfer and consolidate their pension pots. Over time, I
suspect that we will be considering default arrangements on
decumulation when a person retires. The need for defaults raises the
bar on governance because someone is using their discretion on behalf
of the
saver.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000032">Contract
pension provision has systemic weaknesses of governance and a
particular feature that constrains efficient default arrangements. For
example, looking forward, an employer conducting a triennial review
that decides that the current scheme is poor value will be unable to
switch workers in a contract-based scheme unless they individually
consent. However, the very nature of auto-enrolment means that this
active consent is unlikely to be granted by many savers. On legacy
schemes and pots, I am sure that any OFT-driven audit will reveal
poorly performing funds and high charges, but the solutions will not be
effective if they require individuals’
consent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000033">We
have a misalignment between what contract-based provision can do and
what it is necessary to deliver in the interests of the saver. How does
one respond to that challenge? Recent press comments are peppered with
references to making it easier to move contract-based scheme members
from old to new schemes. Standard Life’s head of workplace
pensions, speaking at the NAPF conference, said that contract law acted
as a barrier to moving people from poor-quality schemes to good-quality
schemes, and
added:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14012028000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000067">“We

recent Pensions Institute report found potential for massive
improvement in outcomes where poor-quality legacy schemes transferred
en masse into better-quality modern schemes with lower charges. The
Pensions Institute called on the Government to facilitate changes to
contract law to allow such transfers to be made without the individual
consent of scheme members where it is clearly in their best interests.
However, there is the rub. Who decides where it is clearly in their
best interests? How is the primacy of the saver’s interest
protected? Governance requirements must be fit for purpose under
auto-enrolment and remove a constraint in contract provision, but in a
way that ensures that the interests of the saver trump the interests of
others when there is a conflict. Putting the legal responsibility for
the best interests of the saver on the employer will be problematic,
particularly for the long tail of SMEs and
micros.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000035">The
Government’s use of statutory overrides has a role to play,

must rest in major part in raising the governance in the pensions

resolutions to get a more exciting life in future. The Australian

advent of auto-enrolment raises the bar on governance. I welcome the
Government’s decision to impose quality and governance
requirements on pension schemes, but I think that it is necessary to
make it explicit that those requirements should provide for
the identification, avoidance and management of
conflicts of duty and interest. Conflicts of interest go to
the heart of the problems in the private pension system. The
regulations, when addressing governance requirements, must address the

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I speak to Amendments 67ZB
and 67ZC in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Sherlock. It is
always a pleasure to follow my noble friend Lady Drake on issues such
as this. She has once again characteristically set out an informed and
persuasive argument in her contribution to the debate. To a degree, I
accept that it could be said 
<?notus-xml column=286?>to undermine Amendment 67ZC in that it approaches the same issue but in
a distinctly different fashion, accepting the same principle. From my
perspective, however, I am not that concerned how the Minister responds
to the nature of the challenge that my noble friend set out. If he
chooses to accept her amendment—I venture to suggest to him that
he would invariably be wise to do so in such matters—he will
find no great cavil from these Benches that our amendment fell by the
way as a

67ZB is designed to address the issue of scale by way of a new clause.
It would promote good value in scheme sizes and would require trustees
to consider whether the scheme had sufficient scale to deliver good
value. I note that, in the Government’s consultation on quality
standards in workplace defined-contribution schemes, the Government
reveal that they are “interested” in the idea that
trustees should have a duty, and underline their interest in the
Australian approach to imposing duties on
trustees<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:26:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government are beginning to catch up with the Labour Party’s
policy review on these issues, but I also note that they have not yet
progressed sufficiently far in its investigations to recognise that the
Australian Government, the policies of which have already been prayed
in aid by my noble friend, also deploy the regulator in this respect.
It is not clear why the Government think that trustees of very small UK
schemes, which we know from the TPR surveys self-identify as not
incapable of understanding investment processes, will be able to make a
judgment as to whether they have sufficient scale. If these trustees
fail to act, what is supposed to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:27:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000044">In
Australia, those intending to supply a pension scheme have to apply to
the regulator for a licence, and one of the licence conditions requires
a reasoned attestation as to how the trustees of the scheme will meet
best practice in terms of scale at the investment and administration
layers. This process has a ratcheting effect, as the attestation must
be repeated on an annual basis and, as best practice improves, this
forces mergers. Failure to attest would mean a breach of the regulatory
licence, and commentators believe that there will only be a sixth of
the current number of schemes within 20 years. For trustees
to move to scale we would need a ubiquitous requirement for trustees, a
duty on them to assist scale and a mechanism to require action where
they fail to act or mis-assess. That is what we seek to provide the
beginnings of with this

provide for regulations to require any pension scheme to appoint a

our policy review. However, his quality standards are intended for
automatic transfer schemes only. Under our approach, automatic transfer
will be limited to aggregators, as the Minister is well aware. Our
requirement for trustees applies to all qualifying schemes, not just to
automatic

a further point, these conditions will apply to schemes that wish to
operate as automatic transfer schemes, but an automatic transfer system

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, ensuring that schemes deliver good value
for, and are run in the best interests of, their members is a primary
concern for this Government, so we welcome this discussion, which was
set out with great insight and clarity by the noble Baroness, Lady
Drake. We agree that the issues highlighted by these
amendments—scale, fiduciary duties and conflicts of
interest—are important ones to consider. However, we do not
agree that simply encouraging the creation of large, trust-based
schemes is the right approach to ensuring good value for
members.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012028000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000049">We
are interested in testing how far scale can help schemes to deliver
better quality and lower charges for members. Last year we published a
call for evidence on defined contribution quality standards, in which
we sought evidence about how a scheme’s size can influence
outcomes for members. As noble Lords are no doubt aware, the issue of
scale is not straightforward, and most responses to our call for
evidence saw benefits to members in both large and small schemes. We
are currently considering the responses to the call for evidence
alongside the recommendations of the Office of Fair Trading, and will
respond in due course.</hs_para>

about compelling schemes to merge in the way that this amendment
suggests. Determining what is in all members’ best interests
would be extremely challenging for the Pensions Regulator, which simply
would not have the capacity or information needed to scrutinise every
small scheme and consider whether it should close or merge. There could
also be European Court of Human Rights issues in relation to property
rights because to force a scheme merger could lead to some members
losing out.</hs_para>

that all schemes should be trust-based, in our call for evidence we set
out the importance of ensuring that schemes are governed in
members’ interests; of course, we recognise the vital role that
trustees play in achieving this. However, we disagree that simply
imposing a trust-based structure on all schemes is the way forward.
Neither the presence of trustees nor fiduciary duties are a panacea for
poor governance. This is shown in the findings of the OFT, which
identified governance weaknesses in trust-based schemes of different
sizes. The Law Commission’s current consultation on fiduciary
duties notes that legal duties
are,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012028000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000074">“insufficient

amendment suggests that in scheme governance, trustees’
decisions should take precedence over an employer’s decisions in
any circumstances. This does not provide any opportunity to balance
interests, and would apply even if the trustees’ decisions are
unreasonable. Such a broad requirement could lead to significant
financial difficulties for employers, which would not be in
anyone’s interests.</hs_parafo>

the noble Baroness, Lady Drake, highlights the importance of
identifying and avoiding conflicts of interest. The Government agree
that this is an important area; in our call for evidence we suggested
that all schemes should have a governance body that must be able to act
freely in members’ interests. The noble Baroness referred to the
Australian scheme, as did the noble Lord, Lord Browne. She was very
dutiful in reading it over Christmas. I suggest that she would find the
Australian pension code less onerous to read if she was reading it in
Australia, but she was probably shivering here with the rest of
us.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012028000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000054">The
Australian regulator’s new power is interesting but it is not

are interested in this approach and will monitor how it is used and how
effective it is, but it should be remembered that the Australian
pensions landscape is significantly different from our own. It is our
understanding that the APRA does not intend to use the power to target
all small schemes but to focus, for example, on cases where there is a
link between underperformance and an absence of
scale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000056">The
noble Lord, Lord Browne, argued that you need to drive up scale in
order to increase consolidation, which has an effect on charges and
therefore brings a benefit to members. Scale is not necessarily a
determinant of value: bigger schemes are not always better.
Consolidation is already happening. For example, in 2012 around half
the active members of private occupational defined contribution schemes
were in schemes with 10,000 or more members; in 2000 this figure was
one in eight. The number of active members in small and medium-sized
private occupational defined contribution schemes decreased from 0.3
million to 0.1 million between 2000 and 2012—a reflection of the
greater regulatory requirements and burdens that are placed upon scheme
managers, as well as the challenge of finding trustees who will
undertake the
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000057">Finally,
turning to the comment made by the noble Baroness, Lady Drake, about
independent governance committees and whether they would have a
fiduciary duty to members, the OFT has recommended a model of
independent governance committees to address a number of problems that
stem from weaknesses in the buyer side of the market. As part of the
consultation on fiduciary duties, the Law Commission has asked about
the duties that should apply to members of independent governance
committees. Its tentative view is that members should be subject to
legal duties to act in the interests of members. We are working with 
<?notus-xml column=289?>regulators and stakeholders on requirements for independent governance
committees, and will respond in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012028000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012028000058">This

significant research that challenges the assertion made by the
Minister. I will say only this: recent NAPF research shows that a
person in a larger scheme will get a 28% larger pension pot than a
person in a smaller scheme. Indeed, research from Australia supports
the assertion that fund size has a positive impact on the performance
of not-for-profit superannuation funds there. I shall arrange for the

the power to retrospectively change the terms of existing pension
contracts to embrace any new quality or governance requirement? It is a
pretty key point because it goes to the heart of what the Government
can or cannot do unless they take those powers to themselves. A lot of

Lawson of Blaby</B><B>:</B></Member> Thank you, Lord Chairman. You
advised me that I need to move this amendment, which I am happy to do
even though we have already had the debate on it. I will just say one
or two things briefly. First, I thought the debate was very useful and
I am particularly grateful to my noble friend the Minister for
indicating that the Government accept that there is an issue here that
needs to be addressed and that the Minister in the Commons, Steve Webb,
will make an announcement about it later this week. Presumably, he will
set out what he considers to be the remedy for the problem identified.
It would certainly be churlish to persist with my amendment in the
light of that. I will wait to see what Steve Webb and the 
<?notus-xml column=292?>Government have to say and then decide whether that is adequate or it is
necessary to pursue the matter further on
Report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000012">I have
two other quick points. First, the Minister said that the degree of
specification for costs to be disclosed, as I have in my amendment, was
not suitable for primary legislation. He is probably right but I
interpret the meaning of that to be that he thinks it is suitable for
secondary legislation. This is certainly a matter where legislation is
needed and I am perfectly happy to accept his advice that there is a
need for secondary
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000013">The
other point is that the noble Lord, Lord Browne, suggested that between
Mr Webb’s announcement and Report, he and I might discuss the
matter to see what we feel about this. I am very happy to do that. This
is not a party-political point, but if we think that the
Government’s remedy is inadequate—I hope that will not be
the case—it may be that he and I can agree an amendment to

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in a Bill of extreme complexity,
with a large number of amendments that are equally complex, this must
be the simplest amendment on the Order Paper before the Committee.
Therefore, I assume it is one which the Government could easily accept
or, alternatively, make a slightly different  
<?notus-xml column=293?>proposition in respect of. Most of my interventions in Committee have
been on behalf of the interests of beneficiaries of pension schemes,
which I think is right, but this amendment is on behalf of a subset of
employers; namely charities, although it would extend more broadly to
the non-commercial private
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000021">Charities
are providers of occupational pensions—in fact, the top 50
charities have pensions liabilities of more than £5 billion.
Clause 45 provides some degree of protection for all employers engaged
with the Pensions Regulator in restoring the affordability of pension
schemes, long-term deficit reduction plans and related matters. It
requires the Pensions Regulator to take into account the effect on the
employer’s “sustainable growth”. That is obviously
a very important issue for commercial private sector employers, but the
aim of charities, and of certain other organisations that provide
pensions, is not growth. The aim is to work on the object of the
charity and, in some cases—for example, with the alleviation of
poverty or the eradication of disease—the charity’s aim
is to reduce that object and therefore to run down its actual
activities in the long
run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000022">“Sustainable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:52:17"></hs_TimeCode>
growth” is not the appropriate term to give the equivalent
protection to private sector employers and to charities and other
bodies for which growth is not the objective. I am therefore suggesting
that the broader term of “sustainability” should be
substituted for “sustainable growth”. Alternatively, if
the Government are not prepared to go along with that entirely, I
suggest “sustained growth or sustainability”. Otherwise,
charities which face equal and, in some ways, greater financial
pressures than private sector commercial employers, because of the
legal and trustee-type restrictions on how they can use their own
money, will have difficulty running pension schemes in many respects.
They need this protection, but appealing to this clause, which amends
the Pensions Act, would not automatically give them that
protection.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012032000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000023">I

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend Lord Whitty has

sympathetic to the aims of Clause 45 and recognise that there is a
balance to be struck between the requirement on the Pensions Regulator
to ensure that there is enough money in pension funds to meet their
liabilities and the need to ensure that burdens are not placed on
employers, with requirements so tough that they are effectively forced
out of business and thus rendered unable to make any future
contributions to said pension
funds<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
as my noble friend pointed out, there are real concerns among those
responsible for managing the finances of charities and other non-profit

purpose.</hs_para>

charitable objects that effectively circumscribe their purpose and

pointed out, charities do not necessarily aspire to grow as companies
do. They may happen to grow, if demand is there and money is available
to fund their activities. They may aspire to grow, to increase the
number of people that they work with in line with their charitable
objectives. However, they may not. In my time, I have presided over
charities that grew but I have also taken decisions that effectively
reduced charities by refocusing them on core objectives and ensuring
that they were sustainable. While charities generally do grow, they
also need to be sustainable, and that is what my noble friend is
addressing
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000028">This is
not a negligible issue. Registered charities employ around 850,000
people. The voluntary sector, according to the Charity Finance Group,
contributes £11.6 billion to UK gross value added, compared, for
example, to the contribution made by agriculture, which is just
£8.3 billion. As my noble friend pointed out, there is a
significant issue with charity pension funds. The Charity Finance Group
estimates that the top 50 charities are carrying almost £5
billion in liabilities. I am advised that those liabilities, and the
actions that have been required to flow from them, are driving a
significant number of charity mergers. This is having an effect on the
architecture of the sector, not just on the individual charities and
their employees. Those charities are understandably nervous about any
shift in direction or emphasis that is not appropriate to their
circumstances.</hs_para>

experience of the fact that charities have often suffered at the hands

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment relates to the proposed
new objective for the Pensions Regulator. The Pensions Regulator
oversees the scheme funding regime for defined benefit pension schemes.
This regime requires, among other things, the regular evaluation of a
scheme’s funding position and a formal recovery plan to plug any
deficit identified.</hs_para>

evaluation, the Pensions Regulator is guided by a number of objectives
set out in the Pensions Act. It is therefore important, in reference to

<?notus-xml column=295?>the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Sherlock, that when we talk about this new requirement, it is placed in
the context of the six or seven different measures that the Pensions
Regulator will take into account in determining the funding rate that
is necessary for the scheme to make up any deficit. While some
consideration of sponsoring employers is implicit in these objectives,
the new objective will make it explicit that the regulator must
consider them, alongside members and the Pension Protection Fund, in
deciding upon the suitability of deficit recovery plans and other
decisions related to scheme
funding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000033">The
new objective responds to concerns expressed by sponsoring employers
which felt that they needed to be recognised in the regulator’s
statutory objectives, given their importance to defined benefit
schemes. The current wording of the objective refers to sustainable
growth, as the Government believe that the best protection for scheme
members is a strong, healthy employer standing behind its scheme now
and in the future. Whether that is a charitable organisation or a
commercial organisation, its health must be the first objective in
order to keep a sustainable body behind the scheme. Sustainable growth
can benefit both the organisation and pension scheme members via a
potentially stronger employer covenant underpinning the pension
promises
made.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14012032000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000203"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></I>6

can reassure the noble Lord that the proposed objective on sustainable
growth is intended to be interpreted in a broad sense. The regulator
has outlined this approach in its ongoing consultation on its updated
code of practice and funding policy, which will take account of the new
objective, subject to it becoming law. In that consultation, the
regulator recognises that the proposed objective may need to
apply,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012032000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000135">“differently
to different employers. For some, growth is a real prospect while for
others it may be more about maintaining their position or limiting the
effects of a declining business. For employers in the not-for-profit

a purely commercial
environment”,</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="14012032000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000136">as
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock,
mentioned. Of course, trustees—and the regulator, if called upon
to intervene—will still need to assess the impacts and
understand the risks attached to any proposals in respect of the

least for his quote from the consultation of the Pensions Regulator,
which recognises that growth may well not be considered in the same way
by certain non-profit organisations, including charities. However, I
find the Minister’s conclusion from that to be slightly
illogical. If he is correct and pension fund administrators in the
not-for-profit sectors look at this apparent 
<?notus-xml column=296?>protection and do not interpret growth or have it as an aspiration in
the same way that commercially driven organisations do—the

“sustainability” and “sustainable growth”.
It is a fairly simple point but it would make clearer the position of a

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, the four amendments I will speak to fall
into two groups of two. The first two, Amendments 64A and 72A relate to
the application of the PPF compensation cap to individuals who have
entitlement to both an occupational pension and a pension credit
arising from a divorce or civil partnership dissolution settlement. It
has come to light during the drafting of the Bill that the way in which
the PPF currently applies the compensation cap to this group, while in
line with the policy intent, does not comply with legislation. When
compensation is calculated, these two entitlements are kept separate.
It was the intention that the compensation cap would also be applied
separately and this is what the PPF is currently doing. However, the
legislation, as currently worded, requires the two amounts to be added
together and the total capped, leading to a significantly lower
payment. These amendments simply bring the existing legislation into
line with the policy intent and the actual practice of applying the cap
separately. They also allow the change to be applied retrospectively to
cover past calculations and for them to come into effect from Royal
Assent to reduce the period in which the practice and the legislation
are out of
alignment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000039">The
second set of amendments—Amendments 67A and 67B—relates
to the provisions in the Bill that establish a long-service
compensation cap in the PPF. Those provisions in Clause 47 already make
provision for how the long-service cap will apply in the calculation of
PPF compensation for individuals in the PPF when the long-service cap
legislation is commenced. The amendments deal with how the long-service
cap should be applied when a scheme is either undergoing assessment by
the PPF or winding up when the long-service cap is introduced. When the
legislation commences, a scheme could be in the PPF assessment
period—that is, being considered for entry to the PPF, or the
scheme could be in
wind-up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000040">Members
of schemes in the assessment period will see their payments increased
to reflect the long-service cap. However, any valuation of the
scheme’s liabilities as part of the assessment period will
continue to be based on the current cap structure. Any scheme that
winds up outside the PPF, after being in assessment or not, will
allocate its assets against the current cap structure. I hope that is
absolutely clear. I beg to

Bates:</Member></B> The answer is that the current provision applies if
a scheme is wound up outside the PPF. Schemes will increase payments
where appropriate to reflect a long-service cap. However, the
scheme’s liabilities will continue to be measured against the
old cap. This 
<?notus-xml column=298?>is to prevent the actuary having to recalculate the scheme valuation,
leading to delays and extra costs. I hope that that is helpful to the

that this transitional protection should also extend to members of the
smaller public body pension schemes; for example, those administered by
the UK Atomic Energy Authority, the various research councils, or the

2010, Jarvis went bankrupt and 1,200 skilled rail workers across
Britain were thrown on to the dole. I believe that the situation could
have been avoided, and I will come back to that in a minute.
Jarvis’s work was transferred to new companies but the 1,200
workers were not transferred. Jarvis was forced into administration
because Network Rail deferred renewals work to comply with the Office
of Rail Regulation’s decree that Network Rail needed to make 21%
efficiency savings over the next five years. Therefore, Jarvis going
into administration was not the result of the recession and is separate
from the general question of railway funding. It is ironic that Network
Rail has recently been criticised for delays caused by its decision to
scale back renewals work in
2009.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000050">Jarvis
had cash-flow problems but its rail business had an order book of up to
£100 million. However, Network Rail and the previous Government

of Jarvis employees to new contractors. Representations were made by
the unions to the Government, who refused to allow their legal powers
under the Railways Act to treat Jarvis as an essential railway
activity, which would have allowed it to step in and protect the work
of the members of the union. Instead, these 1,200 were thrown on to the
dole. This is despite the fact that the Government, according to
information provided in response to an FOI request, knew quite a long
time in advance that Jarvis was in imminent danger of collapse. Had

provide protection to members of defined-benefit schemes. The status
given to protected persons, on the other hand, was focused on ensuring
that their pension benefits after privatisation were at least as

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 67ZA is
in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Sherlock. It proposes the
addition of a simple clause to the Bill which would require the
provision of an independent annuity brokerage service or the offer of
such a service to all members pending retirement. Later provisions set
out how best practice should be defined and maintained in the brokerage
service offered to the retiring member or to which he or she is
directed; in other words, it calls for an independent brokerage service
to assist people to annuitise at the point of retirement.</hs_para>

hardly a radical proposal. It is best practice. It is what many
employers with DC pension schemes already offer. The ABI code of
practice says that providers should tell people who are decumulating
that they can shop around and transfer their funds to another provider

<?notus-xml column=303?>before so doing. But that is not enough. As Dan Hyde, in an article in

scandal of annuities is well known and widespread. When this amendment
was debated in the House of Commons, Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister,
used the same diversionary tactic as did the Minister, Mark Hoban, who
responded to the later Westminster Hall debate on annuities. It is all
very well to suggest that those reaching retirement age can do many
things other than plan for an annuity, but it is insufficient to say
that people should have many different opportunities and lots of
different advice. The fact is that the variety in the kinds of annuity
that are offered and the variety of deals available is considerable and
an annuity is invariably the default position of most of those
retiring. They need independent support at that

need for that independent support at this point may be obvious but the
reasons for it are worth repeating. The first is the complexity of
choosing the right annuity option. Annuities are complex products and
decumulation is a complex process. Comparison between providers is very
difficult. I saw a recent quote for an annuity pot of only
£30,000. In one short e-mail the following terms were contained:
single life; level escalation; anticipated bonus rates and required
smooth return rates, all without explanation. It offered four
alternatives to a conventional lifetime quotation, annuity was
described as income choice annuity or with-profit annuity, and out of
nine total options the rates varied between £700 and
£1,400, with most about £1,200. With this complexity no
one should exercise a choice without independent support, so no wonder
more than 50% of people—according to the
<I>Telegraph</I>—go with their existing
provider<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:27:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000066">I
understand that the first comparator website has been launched, and I
suppose that is a step in the right direction, but Ros Altmann, the
independent pensions consultant who gave evidence to the Commons
committee, did not think that it was particularly simple. She said that
it was disappointing and not easy to use. Annuities are complex
products with multiple options and it may be that there never can be a
simple comparison website. Does the Minister accept that annuities are
complex and people need independent brokerage support at the point of
decision-making? Does he accept that obtaining that support is beyond
the grasp of most people, particularly those with no knowledge of
investments? If he does accept that, how does he suggest that those who
need that support can be guaranteed to get
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:27:51"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000067">The
variety in the kinds of annuity that are offered and the deals that
people can get is just bewildering. The NAPF and others have said that
annuitising with some pensions scheme providers pays on average 20% 
<?notus-xml column=304?>less than shopping around. Ros Altmann said on “Newsnight”
that if you had an annuity with the worst performers you would have to
live until you were 100 to get back the money that you paid in. In
effect, inertia or, alternatively, being overwhelmed by the complexity
of making a choice, is exploited by pensions providers. Insurers are
making excessive profits from purchasers failing to shop around.
Inertia is a powerful force that results in excess profits for
insurers. They penalise, not reward you, for loyalty. Perhaps it was
that which drove the Pensions Minister, Steve Webb, to make his
announcement on portable annuities last week—a Statement, by the
way, that went down like a lead balloon in the industry. Well, it

current system is a lovely little earner, as they say in my new adopted

made many points. To assist my analysis of it, I have drawn the
following points from the report which states that the tactics used by
insurance companies and brokers are “tantamount to
burglary” of old age pensioners, and that it is nearly
impossible for pensioners to know whether they are getting a good deal.
Pensioners are hit by excessive profits and exploitative pricing.
Insurance companies make 20 times more profits on annuities than on any
other financial product. There are poor returns: on a pot of
£100,000, Clerical Medical offered £4,664 per annum,
while Reliance Mutual offered £6,111. Over their expected

opaque charges. Brokers are incentivised to sell particular products.
In some cases they make 6% or £12,000 on a pot of
£200,000. There are sharp practices with brokers shopping
around, resulting in a referral fee from each. Many have exploitative
pricing: that is, they sold a product for a fit person when the
individual was not fit, or an adviser neglected to tell them of other
products such as income drawdown as the profit margins were
slimmer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000070">Companies

Importantly, it has not said what profit is made—presumably that
information is known. We should also be aware that the pensions
Minister, Steve Webb, commissioned a review of annuities from the FCA.
That is due to report in February. We welcome that. Never has a case
for a review been better made than the FSCP report. People have gone
without who have diligently saved throughout their working lives. They
are being systematically burgled, to use the FSCP word, by a
profit-hungry industry and its associated sales force. The issue has
been comprehensively covered by the <I>Telegraph</I> but in its
articles of 9, 10 and 13 December it also concluded that the complexity
of the products, the sharp practices, excessive charges and profits,
and incentivised sales forces all point to the need for independent

are one area of pension policy where the buyer deals directly with the

it might help divert us away from the next financial mis-selling

the case for the need to provide access to an independent annuity

will escalate from 2020 onwards, when the impact of auto-enrolment
starts to kick in. Annuity policy might yet be the next pension Bill
before us and that would be the place to address unscrupulous practices
and to make sure that the industry is fit for purpose and puts the
interests of savers first. This element of independent support falls
firmly within the remit of this Bill. I urge the Minister to accept the
need for it now and in future. I beg to

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, this Government recognise the importance
of supporting individuals in making decisions about their retirement
income choices. These choices can be bewildering and the implications
of choosing an unsuitable product can be devastating, as the noble Lord
has very clearly set out for us in moving this amendment. That is why
the Government continue to lead on and to support a whole range of
initiatives aimed at driving up standards among providers, providing
guidance to trustees and education to members. As well as the ABI code
of conduct, we welcome the new Pensions Regulator guidance setting out
expectations for what trustees should provide for their members. In
addition, the Money Advice Service is further developing its support
for those approaching retirement to help them engage with how their
personal situation relates to products and services which might be
appropriate to their needs.</hs_para>

understand whether this activity is making a significant difference in
terms of value to the consumer. The Government will therefore be
assessing the ABI evaluation of the code of conduct planned for later
this year, and the Pensions Regulator will be assessing the impact of
the new guidance this summer. We will also be looking at other
indicators to assess the extent of change in the
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000077">Wider
regulatory activity includes the Financial Conduct Authority’s
thematic review of annuities and consideration of a market study. The
review will assess the extent of detriment to consumers of not shopping
around—the numbers presented this afternoon have been quite
startling and stark—and will consider other indicators of risk,
such as insurers’ retention rates and whether profits in the
market are high or unreasonably high. The FCA will report later this
quarter. In addition, Her Majesty’s Treasury and the Department
for Work and Pensions are currently reviewing the broad range of
available research and statistics on decumulation to explore the
impacts and interactions between market and consumer behaviour and

noble Lord’s amendment is that, while rightly highlighting a key
issue, it would increase the risks for consumers and place additional
burdens on employers. I will deal first with the risk for consumers. By
sending all members to an annuity broker, we would effectively be
pushing them away from regulated advice routes, as brokers, unless they
are also FCA-regulated advisers, are not required to ensure that the
product is suitable for the consumer. At this point, it is worth saying
that the range of options available to somebody facing retirement are
bewildering but are also many: there is not just the open market option
but whether they should be retiring at all or whether they should be
using the flexibility that is available, whether they should be drawing
down on a pension pot rather than actually purchasing a new version of
it, and what type of
annuity—</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000079"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" PimsId="996" UID="14012032000238" xid="1545" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000238">Baroness

with it—that people should be able to consider alternatives to
annuity arrangements, such as draw-down and the like. All I am saying
is that to do that, and not to have to cash in, you have to have, under
Treasury rules, a minimum of £20,000 in alternative regular
income. That is on the 
<?notus-xml column=307?>grounds that you need to protect people against falling into a charge on

Bates:</Member></B> Okay, I have the right answer now: £20,000
is needed for flexible draw-down but not for capped draw-down or
trivial commutation of benefits. There are different elements of it. My
point, from which I have probably strayed into a trap—I should
have stuck to the script—was that there is a range of choices,
not simply the annuity rate which people face. That is why it is vital
that all members engage early. That is the reason for the wake-up
programme which is now being organised, to encourage people to engage
with what they should be considering later

the first port of call for all would create a captive market for one
part of the industry, without effectively adding to consumer

noble Lord’s amendment suggests that a brokerage service would
have to provide information on alternative at-retirement services, but
it has to be recognised that brokers are not impartial. They make their
money if the member buys an annuity, but not if they choose to draw
down or defer, or to commute. While it is right that schemes should
play a central role in informing consumers of their options, we would
be wary of making this part of the qualifying criteria for automatic
enrolment. The duty to enrol into a qualifying scheme does, of course,
fall on the employer, and so to require them to take this step would be
an unwelcome, additional
burden.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0001.htm#14012032000085">I make

information they need to make good choices and that the annuities

honourable friend Steve Webb for raising this matter on annuities but,
in many ways, he was doing just what the noble Lord is doing: saying
that this is an area which needs to be discussed and debated. In many
ways, this debate enables us to do that, but so do the reviews which

reply, it seems to me, says that in addition to all the complexities
which the noble Lord, Lord Browne, set out, there is actually a whole
load of other complexities about whether you should be having an
annuity at all. My question is simply as follows. Until now, when we
have often had final-salary schemes around, these decisions have been
largely managed. However, we are increasingly moving into a position
where most people will be on money-purchase schemes, 
<?notus-xml column=308?>and this will become normal; we will have to engage with these issues.
Given the complexities which the Minister has so helpfully set out, is
the Government’s view that the obligation to work this out is on
the consumer—the person taking the pension—with some
information provided somewhere, or is the obligation on the pension
provider to provide information which covers all these options? Where
does the responsibility primarily lie to advise the person at the point
of retirement? I thought it was not quite clear enough as to where that
lies in what the Minister
said<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:43:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I will ask another question associated
directly with that. To what extent does the Minister expect the Money
Advice Service to take on some of this responsibility, given the
slightly bumpy ride it has had so far? Or do the Government—and
here I declare an interest—expect an organisation like the
Pensions Advisory Service to take on some of this responsibility? It
has to be free, independent, impartial and professional. Those are the
only two organisations of which I am aware which might fit that role at
the

to focus on this issue. It is their responsibility. It is vital to

we are wary of putting the responsibility for providing information to
members solely in the hands of annuity brokers. It is better to drive

speaking notes sought to deploy what I would call a diversionary tactic
in addressing the issue that this amendment seeks to address, and that
clearly concerns a number of Members of this Committee. I am grateful
to my noble friend Lady Hollis for her intervention and for the detail
that she extracted from the Minister. I am also grateful for the
intervention of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester, who
encapsulated in a couple of sentences the fact that the Minister had
compounded the complexity and the difficulty of the challenge facing
those approaching retirement in such pension schemes, rather than
giving them any
comfort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000092">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:29:22"></hs_TimeCode>
course, we must all accept what the Minister says about the variety of
choices facing those who reach this point before or at the same time as
they engage with the issue of annuity. However, the fact is that the
level of understanding of the vast majority of those retiring is such
that significant numbers—400,000 
<?notus-xml column=309?>a year—are entering into annuities. They are taking out these
complex insurance policies at the point of retirement and the results
that they are achieving, even within the annuities themselves, suggest
that they are not making the best choices for their own futures. This
amendment seeks, within the confines of this Bill and in the context of
other work that must be done in relation to annuities, to provide at
least a step in the right direction now, demonstrating that Parliament
understands and engages with this issue and wishes to prevent it from
becoming the next mis-selling scandal of the financial services
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000093">With
respect to the Minister, it is no answer to say that, of course, the
answers can be bewildering but that these same people should engage
with a whole other set of bewildering choices in order to avoid the
bewildering nature of the choices in relation to annuities. That is
hardly a way to move forward. This is a relatively simple initiative.
It is not perfect but it seeks, within the body of the clause as
drafted, to address the very issue that was the target of the
Minister’s principal criticism. It seeks to establish a method
of ensuring that best practice is adopted by those brokerage services
and gives the regulator a role in defining what best practice is.
Surely this is acceptable, if only as a place marker while we go on to
deal with the much more difficult issues that have been revealed,
through the reports and the information that I have shared, and that
the Minister knows exist in the annuities market. There is something
fundamentally wrong with the market and it is driven by exactly the
same motives as we have engaged with in other parts of the private
pensions industry and in our debates in this
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000094">I
understand why the Minister gives this disappointing reply to this

to engage with this initiative. However, I am determined that, at some
stage, your Lordships’ House will have an opportunity to

with. I predict with some confidence that this matter will come back on
Report but, given where we are in these proceedings, I will look
forward to the debate on this issue in the Chamber and to discovering
how much those who hear that debate will be reassured when the Minister

that there was a good case for having restrictions before it was clear
how the market would progress, but these restrictions are no longer
justified. The auto-enrolment market is now well under way and NEST has
not taken all the business, which had once been a concern among some.
Indeed, the restrictions have meant that NEST has been able to get less
of that low and medium-earning segment than it otherwise would have

the contribution limit will be lifted from 2017 by legislation, the
restriction on individual transfers in and out of NEST will be left to
coincide with the beginning of pot follows member. Whether the income
cap is such a problem up to 2017, the continuing ban on transfers in
and out will be. The DWP’s own research found that more than 80%
of employers want one provider. However, the ban means that any
employer who is thinking about using NEST but currently has a pension
scheme of any type will be discouraged from using NEST because they
cannot transfer in the pension assets in their current scheme. The
Government are encouraging employers to use NEST but, by refusing to
lift the ban on transfers in and out right away, they are discouraging
those employers who currently have a scheme elsewhere. In this way,
NEST is being disadvantaged against many of its market
competitors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000099">Our
amendment would enable employers who currently have an existing pension
scheme to take their employees with their existing savings into NEST.
While there remains a ban on transfers in and out, those employers
cannot use NEST, or can use it only by leaving any existing pension
pots in a stranded place, with a different scheme. Has the Minister
considered that aspect of the Government’s
decision?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000100">It
appears that what the Government are actually doing is ensuring that
the restrictions on NEST remain until every employer has staged. By the
time the NEST restrictions are lifted, auto-enrolment will be complete.
There are a number of significant problems with the Government’s
position. First, as the pensions industry acknowledges, NEST provides
best-practice standards, which has obliged the insurance companies to
improve their standards. Yet NEST is disadvantaged in competing for
many of the low and medium-earning 
<?notus-xml column=311?>savers for whom it is designed. That may well result in customer
detriment for many of those workers. Secondly, the Government’s
proposals fail the public interest test. If large numbers of low and
medium-earning employees cannot use NEST, it is thereby being prevented
from delivering its public interest obligation. Thirdly, restricting
NEST impacts on its financial position and makes it harder to pay back
the state aid earlier and thereby allow it to reduce its charges even
further. This again undermines NEST’s public interest obligation
and its mission to deliver a low-charge, high-governance pension
proposition. Finally, the rest of the industry is reported in the
pensions press as increasingly not having the capacity or, possibly,
desire to cope with all the employers who are still to stage in. Having
had, it is said, the advantage of the NEST restrictions in place while
larger employers move in, the rest of the industry is perhaps less
interested in the smaller end of the
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000101">I
trust that the Minister will be able to explain why the Government have
so far refused to lift the restrictions. However, whatever has been
said in the past, I urge the Minister to accept this amendment; but if
he cannot do so today, I hope that he will take it away and reconsider
before Report the strong case for these restrictions to be

the National Employment Savings Trust was established to support
automatic enrolment, providing access to a quality, low-cost scheme for
a target market of low-to-moderate earners and smaller employers. We
are now just over one year into automatic enrolment and NEST has around
800,000 members and 2,500 participating employers. Opt-out rates are
low, with only 8% of individuals enrolled into NEST choosing not to
save for their retirement. NEST is already very successfully doing what
it is there for—supporting automatic
enrolment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000104">However,
we are approaching a peak in the staging profile. Between April and
July this year, 27,000 medium-sized employers will start to enrol their
workers, and from April 2015 more than 1 million small employers will
do the same. We anticipate around 65% of these small and medium
employers will use NEST. By the end of staging we expect NEST to have
admitted around 750,000 employers and to be providing a pension saving
vehicle for between 2 million and 4 million
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000105">This
implementation challenge is what we need NEST to focus on. We need to
ensure that the millions of people currently not saving sufficiently
for retirement are provided with an opportunity to do so, and that NEST
plays its part in starting to make pension saving the norm rather than
the exception. For this reason, during the implementation of automatic
enrolment, it is critical that NEST focuses on the key task of getting
employers and workers on board without distraction. That is why we
announced that we will be lifting the annual contribution limit and
transfer restrictions currently placed on NEST by April 2017, when
implementation for all existing employers is complete.</hs_para>

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 68, I will also speak
to the other amendments in this group. Government Amendments 68 and 69
respond to recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee. They provide that regulations made under certain
powers in the Bill would be subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure. I am grateful to the Committee for its consideration of the
powers in the Bill and subsequent
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000126">As I
do not wish to detain noble Lords for too long, I thought it would be
helpful to briefly outline the regulation-making powers affected by the
government amendments. They would provide that the regulations made
under the following clauses would be affirmative: Clause 17, which
provides for regulations to prescribe the rate at which deferral
increments will be calculated for the single-tier pension; Clause
18(3), which provides for regulations to modify the amount of state
pension to be used when calculating the deferral increase due where a
person has been resident overseas during their period of deferral;
Clauses 19 and 31, which provide that regulations may be made to
disqualify a prisoner from being paid a single-tier pension or
bereavement support payment; Clause 20, which provides for regulations
to exclude people who are not ordinarily resident in Great Britain or a
specified territory from entitlement to the annual uprates of the
single-tier pension; and Clause 33, which provides for regulations to
prohibit the offering of incentives with the intention of inducing a
member of a defined benefit pension scheme to agree to a transfer of
their rights to another pension scheme or
arrangement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012032000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000127">Turning
now to the other amendments in this group, Amendment 68ZA would make
regulations under Clause 17(5) affirmative. As I have
already said, Amendment 68 provides for regulations under
Clause 17 to be affirmative so this amendment is not
necessary. Amendment 68B would make regulations under Clause 42
affirmative. Clause 42 provides for regulations to be made to enable
the recovery of Pension Protection Fund levies for past periods. This
is a technical area relating to ensuring compliance with EU law on
state aid, following a decision by the European Commission and a
subsequent ruling of the General Court in respect of the BT pension
scheme. This found that partial exemption from the PPF levies due to
the existence of a Crown guarantee constituted unlawful state aid. The
Government understand that BT has appealed the ruling of the General
Court to the European Court of Justice.</hs_para>

in 2010, following the Commission’s decision, to ensure payment
of the levies going forward. Clause 42 simply provides for regulations
to allow recovery of outstanding levies relating to the period from
2005-06 until 2010, when the regulations took effect. In agreement with
the Commission, an escrow account was set up pending the final legal
outcome and already holds the maximum amount of risk-based pension
protection levy that could be due, plus applicable recovery interest.
The Government are not aware of any other scheme in the same position
as BT, so any regulations would have limited application.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012032000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140120-gc0002.htm#14012032000129">Given the limited scope
of this power and the opportunity to scrutinise the Government’s
intentions during the passage of the Bill, we consider the negative 
<?notus-xml column=317?>procedure appropriate in this instance. Any regulations made under this
power would simply ensure that the prompt payment to the PPF of the
levies for past periods is possible should BT’s final legal
challenge not succeed. This will ensure that the UK is in compliance
with state aid law and so avoid possible fines. I therefore ask noble
Lords not to press their amendments. I beg to

that mental health should be on a par with physical health. And we have
put mental health at the core of our Mandate to the NHS, setting out
