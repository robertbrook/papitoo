dangers of excessive sugar in our diets, will the Minister consider
adding a specific sugar-reduction pledge to the current

salt—and will he help reduce sugar consumption by following the
latest advice of Dr Susan Jebb, chair of the department’s public

final question back with me. We will certainly look at it. However, I
stress that our current emphasis is on overall calorie reduction, of
which sugar can form a part. The scope for a reformulation to reduce
sugar levels varies widely depending on the food and a reduction in
sugar levels does not always mean that the overall calorie content is
reduced—for example, when sugar is replaced by starch or other
ingredients. The Scientific Advisory Committee on
Nutrition—SACN—is currently undertaking a review of
carbo- hydrates and is looking at sugar as part of that. Its report
will inform our future
thinking<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:39:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Palmer" PimsId="91" UID="14011476000787" xid="1378" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000787">Lord

Perhaps I can just refer the noble Earl to the report of the National

scenarios, more than half of the population of this country will be
obese by 2050. Does he not think that the volunteer approach may no

complacency on obesity levels throughout the nation. However, the
current data do not support the claim by the National Obesity
Forum. In 2007, the Foresight team projected that, based on data from
1993-2004, more than half the population could be obese by 2050 if no
action is taken. An analysis based on recent data suggests a flatter
trend than the one projected by the Foresight team. I do not
agree that we should belittle the responsibility deal. It has many
worthwhile achievements to its credit and they are being added to month

producers and retailers have committed to having 80% of bottles and
cans in the UK displaying unit and health information and a pregnancy
warning by the end of last year. That is a worthwhile step forward. As
regards the calorie labelling of alcoholic drinks, that, as the noble
Lord will know, is an EU competence. It is subject to discussion at
this time, but most large retailers include the calorie content of
alcohol products on their websites, and that information is also

my noble friend recognise that this has been an extremely difficult

until today, inflation has been above the Bank of England’s

low interest rates, which have been necessary in the economic
circumstances in which we have found ourselves, that helps very many
consumers, households, mortgage holders and businesses and is on
balance, in our view, beneficial to the economy. The downside, as the
noble Lord mentions, is that savers get a lower rate of interest. I
think it is unrealistic to expect NS&amp;I to promote products with a
higher rate of interest than market rates, because its remit is to get
best value for money for the Government, but I am sure that the noble

believe that there has in fact been a significant increase in the
number of cataract and knee and hip replacement operations since

absolute numbers of operations taking place do not tell us anything
about possible rationing or the absence of it. That question can be
answered only with the benefit of fuller data. The key to consistent
access to these treatments is a common understanding among

working-age social sector tenants who underoccupy their homes are
subject to a reduction in their eligible rent, regardless of the length
of their tenancy, unless they fall within one of the limited
exceptions. The exceptions include certain excluded tenancies, shared
ownership tenancies, mooring charges for houseboats, rent for caravan

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for that reply, but is not what has happened just another example of
the incompetence that surrounds the Government’s welfare
reforms, and their careless approach to people’s lives in
introducing it? The upshot is that there are thousands of people who
are being hit illegally with housing benefit reductions, and thousands
of people who are unnecessarily caused undue stress because of the
effect of this tax. I would like to ask the Minister how the Government
are going to rectify matters for individuals who are denied their full
benefit entitlement to date, whose rent arrears may have affected their
credit rating, who have moved house in response to the tax and given up
their security of tenure, or who have fallen into the clutches of
private sector landlords who are now intent on evicting tenants
claiming housing benefit? Is not this mess a further reason to scrap
this wretched

noble Lord that this is not the first IT project to go on. In 1998,
Labour announced a programme to reform the way that the NHS used IT. It
was originally intended to cost £6.2 billion, but costs later
doubled to almost £13 billion. In 2011, the Government
axed that project and replaced it with a cheaper, locally led system.

Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, our amendment adds a
new ground for the issuing of a closure notice that would allow
premises to be closed in cases of sexual offences against a child. It
is largely a preventive measure but would be an important extra tool in
tackling this problem. No one could have failed to be distressed and
horrified by the reports late last year of groups and gangs of men who
abused young and vulnerable girls. They did so by a cold, calculating
and sinister grooming process, sometimes involving drink and drugs,
which allowed them to sexually and physically abuse these children. So
cleverly warped are these groomers’ tactics that the
children—and vulnerable adults—may not even realise at
the time that they are being abused and
exploited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000096">We
have an opportunity in the Bill to provide more ammunition for those
trying to prevent this shocking and evil crime. I hope noble Lords will
allow me to put on record my gratitude to those who brought this matter
to my attention: Tony Lloyd, the police and crime commissioner for
Greater Manchester; Colin Lambert, leader of Rochdale Council; and
Jeanette Stanley, Rochdale’s safety community manager. They 
<?notus-xml column=114?>have given me some hugely important and useful
evidence. I know they have been in contact with Home Office Ministers
as well. Their experience and knowledge of what works in tackling such
crime and where the gaps are in legislation is invaluable. I know that
the Minister shares my concerns on this issue and I hope that the
Government will share my view of the suggestions that these people
brought forward to try to tackle this
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000097">They
are seeking an immediate closure power where there is a safeguarding
threat. Greater Manchester Police has evidence of properties that are
unregulated and unlicensed being used in a variety of ways to prey on
vulnerable adults and sexually exploit children “behind closed
doors”. Yet the only powers the police have—and will have
in legislation if the amendment is not passed—is to close
premises on anti-social behaviour grounds. Now that the police have
evidence of the shape and extent of this problem, that is no longer
enough. In Rochdale, they have been able to use the current anti-social
behaviour closure order power on a number of occasions to good effect
because they also had sufficient evidence of recent and repetitive
anti-social behaviour incidents. However, the main reason for obtaining
a closure order was because of safeguarding concerns involving children
and young adults. That power allows a short-term disruption to the
abuse while the police can then take longer-term permanent
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000098">Norman
Baker, as Home Office Minister in the other place, has responded to the
suggestion outlined in our amendment that closure powers exist under
the Sexual Offences Act 2003. He is absolutely right—they
do—but they apply only to prostitution and pornography, not to
protecting children and vulnerable adults. The powers do not allow for
the swift action that is needed. However, perhaps the most serious
problem with that approach is that to use a sexual offences order,
evidence of a criminal offence is needed. The grooming method of such
gangs is quite sophisticated in a warped way, and many victims of child
rape and sexual abuse do not complain. They may even believe that their
abuser is their boyfriend and that they have sex with his friends to
please him. While in the clutches of these men, the victims cannot even
recognise that they are being
abused.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000099">This

noble Lords if I outline some of the powers already available to the
police to tackle the sexual exploitation of children. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Smith, has said, in particular, the Sexual Offences Act
2003, already gives the police and the courts the power to close
premises on a temporary basis where there are reasonable grounds for
believing that they are being used for certain sexual offences
involving a child and that closing the premises is necessary to prevent
the commission of those
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000105">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>
that Act, service of a closure notice by the police will prevent anyone
entering or remaining on the premises, unless they regularly reside in
or own the premises, until a magistrates’ court decides whether
to make a closure order. If the court is satisfied that the relevant
conditions are met, it can make a closure order for a period of up to
three months. An application can be made for the closure order to be
extended but the total period for which a closure order has effect may
not exceed six months.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:32:18"></hs_TimeCode> Sexual
Offences Act closure notice and order therefore operate similarly to
the closure power in the Bill, although they are targeted specifically
at sexual crimes against children, which are listed in Sections 47 to
50 of that Act. These crimes all relate to the abuse of children
through prostitution or pornography.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:32:39"></hs_TimeCode> addition to
their duty to investigate criminal offences, the police have a
statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, and

Home

lose the place where they are living, if not habitually at that
point. I am not suggesting that this may be a widespread
situation but, for those affected, it will be very significant and I

against a decision to make or extend a closure order may be made. Of
course, I understand that my noble friend has in mind the situation
where an appellant may wish to challenge the extent of a closure order
in terms of those parts of a building or structure which are covered by
the order. Again, I can assure my noble friend that the provisions in
the Bill as drafted allow for this. Clause 77(6) enables the court
hearing an appeal to make whatever order it thinks appropriate. This
would include varying the terms of a closure order so that it applies
to a more limited part of the building or structure in question.
Therefore, an employee living on-site could use the appeal to argue
that a closure order should not include his or her living area. I hope
that, in the light of the explanation that I have given, my noble
friend is reassured and will be content to withdraw her

discretionary ground for possession for offences connected with a riot.
The existing grounds for possession for anti-social behaviour are
discretionary and require that the anti-social behaviour must have
occurred in the locality of the property. This means that thuggish
behaviour committed against neighbours or in the immediate vicinity of
a tenant’s home may currently be a basis for eviction.</hs_para>

offences likely to have a devastating effect on whole communities such
as looting, or other riot-related criminal activity, committed by
tenants further from their homes would not usually be taken into
account. I do not think that that is right. It is important that people
who wreck other people’s communities through riot-related
offences should face the same consequences that they would if they
carried out such behaviour in their own neighbourhoods.</hs_para>

concerns relating to the possibility of minor offences triggering
possession under this ground, Amendments 80B and 80D would restrict the
application of the new ground to “indictable offences”
instead of any offence committed at the scene of a riot as currently
drafted. This means that convictions for less serious offences such as
common assault and obstructing a police officer in the execution of his
duty will not trigger possession under this ground. However, I
emphasise our commitment to ensuring that we send a strong signal: if

concerns raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights that the ground

the circumstances of the tenant and other family members, including
children, when deciding whether to grant possession. I should add that
available evidence also indicates that landlords resort to eviction
only as a last resort. In addition, these government amendments would
provide additional safeguards in the Bill to ensure that whole families
are not evicted under the new ground for the actions of a child during
a riot. I would reassure the noble Baroness, Lady

O'Loan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 91 as originally drafted
added a new ground for possession under Schedule 2 of the Housing Act
1985 and Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Housing Act 1988 so that, as the
Minister has said, a landlord might apply for possession where someone
living in the property has been convicted of an offence committed at
the scene of a riot which had taken place anywhere in the United
Kingdom. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, of which I am a member,
has consistently stated that this clause should be deleted from the
Bill. In the first instance the committee stated that it was
unnecessary and disproportionate. It was also concerned about the
potentially serious implications of this clause for family members and
considered that it may disproportionately 
<?notus-xml column=122?>affect both women and children. The committee said that it amounted to a
punishment rather than a genuine means of preventing harm to
others.</hs_para>

wish to set out absolutely the aggravated nature of riot offences.
Living in Northern Ireland, I have long experience of the fear and the
horror of riots. People who commit criminal offences must be pursued
under the criminal law. To allow an offence committed anywhere in the
UK, even if the conviction were to be on indictment only, to be grounds
for eviction where there is a tenancy, is certainly to impose a second
punishment on a limited group of people who do not own their own home
and who have committed no offence, since the other members of the
household have committed no
offence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:52:58"></hs_TimeCode>. I
should like to thank the Minister for meeting with me in December to
discuss this issue, and for giving me the opportunity to articulate
again the difficulties with this clause.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011476000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000134">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:53:42"></hs_TimeCode>
note the amendments that the Government have now tabled and the fact
that they make in effect two changes. The clause will apply only where
an adult member of the household—someone living in the
house—has been convicted of an indictable offence. That is to be
welcomed because it limits the effect of the clause. It relieves from
the threat of eviction the families of young people who may have fallen
into bad company, but who have been dealt with for their criminality
under the criminal law. However, that still leaves tenants and their
householders subject to a possible double punishment for a crime
committed either by a tenant or someone else who lives in the rented
property, and no such double punishment can be applied to a private
householder. The family of such a household will be put through the
stress, fear and expense of fighting an eviction application. It will
go on for months, and while they may well win at the end of the day,
there will still have been serious disruption and expense and, above
all, distress to the family. Can the Minister tell me whether there is
a time limit on the use of a conviction as a ground for eviction? If a
person was convicted in 2013, could that conviction be used in 2014? If
he was convicted 2011 as a result of the London riots, could it be used
in 2014?</hs_para>

the curious circumstance in which someone convicted of a riot offence
in Edinburgh, Glasgow or even Belfast could be evicted in England and
Wales but a person convicted in England and Wales could not be evicted
in Scotland or Northern Ireland. The Government have offered no
justification for this measure, nor is there any necessity for it, even
in its amended form. In the Minister’s letter to the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, the explanation for the Government’s
amendments is that,

property earlier in the year, but she was still served with a notice by
Wandsworth Council seeking possession, which stated that she was likely
to have breached her tenancy agreement. The authority vowed to apply
for a possession order evicting her and her daughter if her son was
convicted. This was despite her contribution to the local area over the
past three years: she was described as a credit to her housing estate
by neighbours and spent her spare time volunteering with a youth
charity and working with domestic violence victims. She had committed
no crime herself and would not have faced that threat had she lived in
a mortgaged house. Liberty represented her in challenging Wandsworth
Council’s attempt to punish her and her daughter for her
son’s conviction. Eventually the council was persuaded to back
down, but not before considerable anxiety and suffering had been

Committee stage, but I have read the debate. It was striking that no
noble Lord other than the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:04:29"></hs_TimeCode>, of
course, spoke in support of Clause 91. The noble Baroness, Lady
Berridge, who is also a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights,
called it an unhelpful precedent. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes,
lately<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:04:29"></hs_TimeCode> of the
Joint Committee on Human Rights, and the noble Lord, Lord
Paddick—who have both already been quoted—called it a
step too far. To the Minister’s credit, he has taken note and
come back with government amendments. In my view,
however<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:01:05"></hs_TimeCode>, his
amendments are a step not far enough. They do not meet the concerns of
the Joint Committee on Human Rights which have been voiced in two
reports on the Bill and lie behind Amendment 80G. The noble Lords who
serve on the JCHR said in Committee that Clause 91 smacks of punishment
rather than serving as a means of preventing harm. As the noble
Baroness, Lady O’Loan, said, it would create a double
punishment. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:02:17"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister talks about tough action, but tough action was taken after the
riots, as the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, argued strongly in Committee.
Moreover, in many cases the punishment will be applied to people who
are totally innocent of the behaviour in question. The noble Baroness,
Lady Hamwee, talked about the clause creating new
victims<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

JCHR’s concerns on this point, the Minister tried to reassure
your Lordships that the power would be discretionary and the courts
would have regard to what is reasonable before granting a possession

of tenancy law that a tenant is held responsible for the behaviour of
members of their household. Surely tenancy law concerns behaviour that
affects the accommodation and/or contravenes a condition of the tenancy
and not behaviour that could 
<?notus-xml column=125?>have taken place hundreds of miles away. Indeed, the
Minister himself has dubbed it “riot tourism”. That is
not a phrase that I would use but it underlines the fact that we are
talking about behaviour that has no implications for the neighbours of
those concerned, and nor does it affect the

what about the selective post-sentence treatment of rioters as a

anti-social, and virtually all have a victim class of some sort who
would naturally look, under the terms of the overarching principle of

of this class of offender. Maybe the Minister can explain how that
works<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:11:09"></hs_TimeCode>. This
provision could result in a class of persons without rights to occupy
anything that they could call a home of their own. That needs to be
circumscribed and contained in some way because the circumstances of
the offence will not necessarily be replicated. If there is no risk of
replication, what is the court being instructed to do? The
justification is rebalancing towards the interests of
victims—for them to feel that justice has been done. Would

does not even have any financial control these days. The court would be

and excludes minor offences as well. However, I share other noble
Lords’ concerns about this additional sanction. As I said in
Committee, in the aftermath of the riots a couple of years ago, the
courts clearly showed how seriously they took offences committed during
a riot—far more seriously than if those offences had been
committed at some other time. It does not appear to be necessary to
have a further sanction in order to deter rioters. The noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said that this is a power given
to the courts. I am a great believer in the courts and
in the fact that they will make the right decisions. But I fail
to see why we need this power. I cannot think of circumstances where a

point I made briefly at Second Reading, following up on the point made
by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about Wandsworth Borough Council.
I, too, checked with serving councillors regarding what happened
subsequent to the 2011 riots. It is my information that the council did
not pursue the repossession of its property. Although it had the
powers, the council decided that it was not in its interest or that of
the tenants to pursue the matter. Therefore, I agree with the points
that have been made by the noble Lord, Lord Paddick. One has to
question the motivations of the Government for pursuing this
legislative change when a council which sees itself as a flagship of
the Conservative Party has not pursued the avenues that were open to

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> The noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, and
my noble friend Lady Lister of Burtersett, have already made a strong
case for deleting Clause 91. The Government, of course, have put down
amendments that make some changes to that clause, but do not address
the basic objections, which have also been expressed for a second time
by the Joint Committee on 
<?notus-xml column=129?>Human Rights, about the disproportionate impact of eviction on other
members of the household who have not engaged in such riot-related
behaviour. The Joint Committee on Human Rights was not moved by the
references to judicial discretion, so clearly it did not rate very
highly in its thinking as a safeguard. The Joint Committee also
expressed the view that it was the job of criminal law, not civil law,
to deter riot-related offences, and to administer sanctions when such
offences were committed. As has been said, courts when sentencing,
quite rightly, already take a much more serious view of offences
committed as part of a riot, and under cover of a riot, as was shown by
the sentences given to those convicted following the riots in 2011.
Many people were sent straight to prison when they probably would not
have been given such a sentence if the offence had not been committed
in association with the
riots.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000163">Clause
91 does not just relate to offences in the locality in which the
offender lives, but covers such offences anywhere in the United
Kingdom. It is clearly seen as an additional punishment by the
Government, and it is not related to the experience of victims in the
locality in which the offender lives. The Government are seeking to
make some amendments so that Clause 91 would not apply where
under-18s are convicted of a riot-related offence or in respect of the
most minor offences. However, that still means that, since Clause 91
relates to repossession where a person residing in the dwelling house
has been convicted of a riot-related offence, the penalty of eviction
affects everybody else in the house. People who are guilty of no crime,
such as pensioners with a son or daughter living at home, or
children whose older brother or sister, aged 18 or over, has been
convicted, are the innocent victims of Clause
91.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000164">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:24:44"></hs_TimeCode>
will certainly act as a deterrent to a member of a household reporting
another member of the household to the police for rioting if they know
that the effect of such action, which surely we should encourage not
discourage, would be to find themselves evicted as a result, under the
terms of the clause. Why do the Government take the view that
riot-related offences justify repossession and eviction when they do
not take that view over equally serious or more serious offences? In
addition, why do they think that those who commit riot-related offences
away from their own locality and who own their own home or live in a
house that is owner-occupied should face no further penalty other than
the sentence of the court for the crime that they have committed but
that those who live in rented accommodation should not only receive and
serve the sentence of the court for the riot-related crime that they
have committed but face eviction from the house in which they live in
their own locality, along with other members of the household, who
could include the tenant, who have committed no riot-related
offences—indeed, no offences at all—and will be made
innocent victims of Clause 91? The Government say that the Bill is

the first step in eviction proceedings. That resulted in an outright

Earl, Lord Lytton, asked why it was necessary to introduce a special
ground for riot-related offences but not for other offences. As I have
explained, it is indictable offences concerning a riot that are
covered; in general, within the locality, the specific riot-related
element is absent. We think it is right that eviction should be
an option only where the crime has a direct impact on those
living where the offender lives. However, the particular characteristic
of looting and rioting is that they can wreck whole communities, which
may be distant from where the rioter or perpetrator lives. That makes
these crimes a particular

noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Rosser, pointed out that eviction is
not tenure-neutral—that it discriminates in favour of
owner-occupiers at the expense of those who live in homes under a
tenancy. A tenancy presents a contract between a landlord and an
individual, and includes obligations on both the landlord and the
tenant. One of those obligations is that the tenant must ensure that
they and members of their household do not behave in an anti-social
way. No such contractual understanding applies to owner-occupiers, so
provisions around possession cannot apply in the same
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:31:44"></hs_TimeCode>. As I have

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment was also moved by my
noble friend Baroness Thornton in Committee, so I do not intend to
repeat all the points that were so powerfully made at that time.
Needless to say, we were not happy at the Government’s response,
which was basically that, because the measures proposed in this
amendment would not solve all the problems in relation to young people
in the purchasing of tobacco products, it should not be
adopted<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:54:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendment has the support of the Association of Convenience of Stores,
which represents 33,500 stores, the majority of which sell tobacco
products. The ACS welcomes these proposals as a further measure to help
to restrict youth access to tobacco products.</hs_para>

is illegal to sell tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18, but
it is not an offence for someone to buy tobacco products on behalf of a
minor. There is, thus, a gap in the legislation which this amendment
seeks to close to bring the position more into line with the provisions
of the Licensing Act 2003, which has made it an offence to proxy
purchase alcohol. Proxy purchasing is one means by which young people
gain access to tobacco products. A recent survey has shown that, in
2012, 8% of pupils had asked somebody to buy cigarettes on their behalf
and nine out of 10 were successful at least once. We are not saying
that tobacco proxy sales are the only means by which children receive
their supply of cigarettes—there is a variety of means for
this—but we are saying that it is one of the predominant ways,

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, my name is added to
this amendment, which I feel is very important. We know that when young
people start smoking, their addiction potential and the long-term harms
are very great. There is good evidence that children get cigarettes by
proxy either, particularly in the case of younger children, by stealing
from their own families or by purchasing single cigarettes from other
children at school. However, a cohort in the older, middle-teens
bracket seems to obtain cigarettes more through proxy purchasing. Quite
often, with a very small incentive added to the cost of the cigarettes,
they use a drug abuser or somebody else to do the purchasing for them.
The retailers—the small shops—which sell cigarettes find
themselves in a really difficult position. Rightly, they are not
allowed in law to sell directly to the youngster, yet they are aware
that there is no lever in terms of proxy purchasing, although it is
they who would be prosecuted rather than the person doing the proxy
purchasing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000183">It

tobacco. Persuading young people not to smoke is something to which we
in this House have devoted a lot of attention.

I am not sure that the laws against proxy purchasing of alcohol have
been terribly effective. I would be concerned if bringing in a further

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, when we debated this issue
on 4 December, we agreed that, because smoking is largely an addiction
taken up during childhood or adolescence, reducing the availability of
tobacco to young people is important if we are to succeed in
reducing overall smoking uptake. This new clause seeks to create a new
criminal offence of an adult purchasing, or attempting to purchase,
tobacco products on behalf of a child or young person
under the age of 18. This act is commonly known by the phrase,
“proxy
purchasing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:02:07"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000188">While
smoking prevalence among young people has declined considerably in
recent years, there are still each year around 300,000 young people in
England under the age of 16 who try smoking for the first time. As a
starting point, we must continue to take action to encourage adults to
quit smoking. If smoking is seen by young people as a normal part of
everyday life, they are much more likely to become smokers themselves.
The Government’s <I>Tobacco Control Plan for England</I> is
clear that, to promote health and well-being, we will work to encourage
communities to reshape social norms, so that tobacco becomes less
desirable, less acceptable and less accessible. We aim to stop the
perpetuation of smoking from one generation to the next.</hs_para>

need to think carefully about whether creating a proxy purchase offence
would have an impact on how accessible tobacco is to children and young
people, and whether it would have a meaningful impact on reducing
smoking rates among young people. Obtaining cigarettes from retailers
is just one of many avenues by which young people access tobacco. We
know that children and young people obtain their cigarettes from a wide
range of sources. Some young people take tobacco from their parents,
from other family members or from older friends. In such circumstances,
no proxy purchase has occurred. Introducing a new proxy purchase
offence would not tackle that particular way of getting
tobacco<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:03:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

introducing a proxy purchase offence for tobacco is supported by some
retailer organisations, including the Association of Convenience Stores

I recognise the important role played by retailers in ensuring that
tobacco products are sold in accordance with the existing age-of-sale
legislation.

difficulties that some retailers face, and I understand why some feel
that it should be an offence to buy tobacco on behalf of under-18s. I
also 
<?notus-xml column=139?>understand that the creation of a proxy purchasing
offence has the support of the tobacco industry—as the noble
Lord, Lord Faulkner, said. However, I am sure that noble Lords will
agree that the creation of effective and practicable legislation should
be informed by evidence. In the area of proxy purchasing, the
Government’s current view is that we want to see evidence that a
proxy purchase offence would be effective both in reducing young
people’s access to tobacco and in having a deterrent effect on
those adults who are prepared to buy cigarettes on behalf of children
and young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000192">In
fact, I am concerned that some of the evidence that is currently
available suggests that creating a proxy purchasing offence would have
only limited benefit. For example, a Scottish study published in August
2013 looked at how young Scottish smokers living in disadvantaged
communities obtained their cigarettes. The study concluded that the
introduction of a proxy purchasing offence in Scotland had had little
discernible
impact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000193">Nevertheless,
that is not to say that evidence does not exist, and I encourage those
who support this amendment to provide evidence of the likely public
health benefits of creating a proxy purchasing offence to the
Department of Health for further consideration. Proxy purchasing of
tobacco is an area that the Department of Health is keeping under
review, and any further evidence that is provided will be carefully
considered. I assure noble Lords that I will draw the attention of my
noble friend Lord Howe to the debate we are having on the subject this
afternoon.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011476000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000194">As
the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, said, those in support of a proxy purchase
offence point to Scotland, where the offence was introduced in April
2011. While I understand that a light-touch approach has been taken on
enforcement and that the legislation has been in place only for a few
years, I note that only one fixed penalty notice has been imposed since
the offence was introduced, and that there have been no convictions.
Furthermore, whether the legislation has had any deterrent effect is
also not clear.</hs_para>

similar offence of the proxy purchase of alcohol show that convictions
are few and far between in that area, too, in no small part because of
the burden of proof required. Furthermore, the alcohol offence includes
a defence that the purchaser had no reason to suspect that the
individual they bought the alcohol for was under 18. This amendment
does not address that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011476000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0001.htm#14011476000196">Whether
local authorities want the creation of a proxy purchasing offence is
not at all clear at the moment. After all, they rather than the police
would be responsible for enforcement. The Minister responsible for
public health made it clear during a debate on this issue in the House
of Commons in October that the Government would be happy to hear the
views of local authorities on the potential for effective enforcement,
or to hear of good examples of existing local measures to reduce access
to tobacco by young people. I also call on those in the public health
community to provide this sort of evidence for the creation of a
proxy purchasing offence. I want to be clear that we are not
rejecting the creation of a proxy purchasing offence outright, but we
need to give the matter further consideration.</hs_para>

Avebury (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, if the evidence is supplied, how
will the Government deal with it? If we do not agree the amendment, the
Minister would have to wait until further primary legislation was

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I think that I can answer that best by
saying that if the evidence were provided and the Government were
persuaded that creating this offence was a practical and effective way
of dealing with a policy issue that I am sure all noble Lords in the
Chamber agree with, they would wish to see it introduced through
primary legislation. However, I am not in a position to be definitive
in my answer, and I think that my noble friend will understand the
reasons for that. I can assure noble Lords that we are committed to
reducing the availability of tobacco to children and young people.
However, our actions must be guided by evidence and effectiveness. On
that basis, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, will be prepared
to withdraw his

Rosser:</Member></B> I would be grateful if the Minister would first
clarify what he has just said. One interpretation is that the
Government do not really intend to do anything further themselves but
are urging anyone else who thinks that there is any evidence to put it
in front of them. I am not sure whether that is what the Minister is
saying. Obviously, if anyone else does have evidence on this issue, of
course they should submit it to the Government—but are the
Government themselves seeking to do anything to ascertain or produce
evidence? The Robinson and Amos study of 2010 looked at how young
people’s sourced cigarettes and attempted to circumvent underage
sales. It concluded that there was a problem, and one suggestion was
that regular national smoking surveys should include questions that
would capture more accurately the nature and extent of proxy purchases.
What I am asking the Minister is whether it is now purely up to other
people to put the evidence in front of the Government, or are
the Government, through the Department of Health, actually doing any
work themselves to seek to ascertain evidence of their own?</hs_para>

would know that there was a problem in a particular location because of
evidence that proxy purchasing was taking place. Again, is the noble
Lord’s response that it is basically up to everyone else to
provide the Government with evidence, or is he saying, “If you
have any evidence, provide it to us, but we are
also”—whether it be through the Department of Health or
anyone else—“seeking that evidence

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> Perhaps I may respond to that point.
The Government are determined to try to stamp out smoking as a habit,
particularly among young people, so they are being proactive. However,
what I am saying on this particular issue and this particular amendment
is that the advocates of proxy purchasing as an offence—the
noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, drew attention to the wide number of people
who are, and I said it myself in my speech—will be helped in
their advocacy if they can provide the Government with the information
they need to make sure that if at a future date they choose to
implement such a policy through legislation, they will have the

about the evidence. It may be my fault, but I am not entirely clear
what evidence the Minister is looking for. It is quite difficult, until
such a measure is in force, to know whether it will be effective. Of
course the Scottish experience is there as an example, and it may be
that the noble Lord is relying on that, but the fact is that until the
measure is actually put on to the statute book, you cannot be
absolutely certain one way or the other that it will be effective. On
the other hand, there is certainly evidence, which has been referred
to, that people with knowledge of the way these things work are asking
for the measure. Is that not evidence to justify putting the measure on
to the statute book, taking the view that it may do some good and would
certainly do no harm?</hs_para>

CPNs will be issued only after an attack has taken place and a written

informal advice notices—which in practice are similar to

them and bring them back if he thinks there is merit in them and they

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a useful
debate. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, for bringing it back for
us to consider, having had this debate in Committee. In a number of
instances we are going over ground we have discussed before, but it is
important that we try to set the Government’s position in some
context. As noble Lords will know, I was a Minister in
Defra—and, indeed, had quite a lot to do with some of the early
talks about how to deal with dogs and the dangers that out-of-control
dogs present not only to postmen and people visiting houses but to
people going about their daily

some organisations, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, support dog
control notices, it is similarly true that some do not—and it is
by no means the case that the scales are weighted on one side of the

welfare organisations have all agreed to suspend their campaigns for
dog control notices and to work with us to ensure that the same aims
may be achieved through the community protection

much welcome this constructive approach from the sector. It is a
genuine partnership, working with the Government to ensure that
measures may be as effective as possible. That really answers the noble
Baroness’s point as to how the facilities offered by the

implemented. It will be implemented with the co-operation of the dog
charities, and I expect this dialogue to continue after implementation;

make it clear that the community protection notice can do all that the

do more, because it avoids the prescriptive nature of issue-specific
notices and allows practitioners to respond to all manifestations of
behaviour that negatively affect the community. Focusing on the impact
of the behaviour ensures that dog owners are not unjustly penalised and
that communities are protected from existing, as well as new, forms of
irresponsible dog
ownership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000016">The
community protection notice provides a mechanism so that officers faced

the most effective way to stop and prevent future recurrences of that

requiring the owner to attend training classes. The officer, in
consultation with welfare experts where necessary, may use the notice

provide an example to noble Lords of how the CPN could work in
practice. Many noble Lords will have heard about terrifying and
unacceptable incidents in which postal workers have been attacked or
regularly have to face the unpredictable and, at times, out-of-control
behaviour of dogs at certain properties. Clause 98, in amending the
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, corrects the current legal lacuna and will
ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service can take forward prosecutions
where postal workers and others are injured, or indeed fear injury, by
a dog while on private property.</hs_para>

that the threshold is not met; perhaps the dog is out of control but
not dangerously so, as defined by the 1991 Act, but is nevertheless
barking excessively at the postal worker or jumping up at the

delivering experience to know exactly what we mean. Under the new
powers we are introducing, the postal worker may alert the authorities
and report the behaviour. I should take a moment to congratulate Royal

investigate and, if it is satisfied that the test for the community
protection notice has been met, serve a written warning that such
behaviour is evidently detrimentally affecting the quality of life in
the locality—in this case, that of a postal worker, although
other people may be affected. An officer from the authority may wish to
visit the address and discuss the issue with the owner, or may simply
post the order as a warning to the owner. The warning would state that
the officer considers the threshold to have been met and would detail
the offending behaviour. It would make clear that the officer will
serve a community protection notice should the behaviour not change or
stop, and that, over time, this may result in prosecution and a
criminal record.</hs_para>

level of intervention will be sufficient, and the engagement from an
officer will encourage the owner to consider the opportunities for
better education and training. However, if the warning is not heeded, a
community protection notice could be served, which may make a number of
requirements of the owner: for example, that they attend dog training
classes with their dog and/or attach a letterbox guard or similar item,
as I have already illustrated. The owner will be provided with the
opportunity to become more responsible and the postal worker will be
better protected. Should the owner attend training classes, the
dog’s welfare may also be improved. All this can be achieved
with a community protection notice, fully negating the need for an
additional power in the form of a dog control
notice.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_14_PT_1/6E466C5C624E8BB1354C2EE2AD60ECEDA09F98A5" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 January 2014">Tuesday,

86B and 86C in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Trees, which relate to
dog attacks on protected animals—in other words, animals kept
largely as pets. I am conscious that a number of organisations in the
charitable sector would support an amendment of this kind to provide a
specific offence in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 for a dog attack of
this nature. However, the Dangerous Dogs Act is a public safety
measure; it is not about providing protection for animals more widely.
These amendments would see police forces, and in some cases local
authorities, potentially having to investigate reports of dogs chasing
other dogs, cats and, for that matter, any of the many other animals
kept as pets, to ascertain whether an 
<?notus-xml column=150?>offence has been committed under the Act and whether
a prosecution should be forthcoming. I do not believe that this is the
best way of tackling the problem of dog attacks on other
animals.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011499000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000024">I
recognise the concern of pet owners with regard to dog attacks. I have
seen for myself the horrific reports where animals have been injured or
killed as a result of dog attacks. Such incidents are abhorrent and can
be indicators of wider problems with the dog, such as a lack of
socialisation with other animals. However, I suggest to noble Lords
that the Dangerous Dogs Act is not the appropriate vehicle for taking
cases forward with regard to attacks on protected animals. Rather, I
would maintain that the solution lies in existing legislation that is
better suited to addressing this type of incident, and in the
anti-social behaviour provisions in the Bill.</hs_para>

our pets almost as members of the family, in law pet animals are
defined as property. As such, where a cat or dog has been injured or, I
dare say, killed as a result of a dog attack, then it would be possible
to bring forward a prosecution against the dog owner under Section 1 of
the Criminal Damage Act 1971. This covers the intentional or reckless
damage or destruction of another person’s property and carries a
maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment on indictment and a
maximum of six months’ imprisonment or a £5,000 fine, or
both, when tried summarily.</hs_para>

circumstances in which Section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act
applies to dog attacks on other animals. I am aware of a recent case in
Manchester where an Akita attacked and injured a miniature Yorkshire
terrier so severely that it had to be put down. The owner of the Akita
was prosecuted under both Section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act and
Section 1 of the Criminal Damage Act. The owner was ordered
to pay compensation and court costs and complete unpaid work. Thus the
existing legislation has been seen to apply in the case of a dog-on-dog
attack.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011499000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000027">One
of the reasons why this sort of case can succeed is that the Dangerous
Dogs Act 1991 applies where there is reasonable apprehension of injury
to a person. It is not necessary for injury to be caused to a person
for an offence to be committed. It is likely that, where a dog attacks
another animal, the nature of the aggression shown by the dog
means that people in the vicinity would have a reasonable fear of
injury to themselves. In such a situation, the police and the Crown
Prosecution Service are well placed to determine whether a prosecution
meets the public interest and evidence test. In all cases, where a dog
attacks another animal, criminal proceedings may also be brought under
the Animal Welfare Act 2006 for causing unnecessary suffering to the
animal that has been attacked. This carries a maximum penalty of six
months’ imprisonment, a £20,000 fine or both.</hs_para>

case not meet the threshold of any of the other offences to which I
have referred, but the incident poses concern—as an attack on a
pet is likely to do—both members of the public and the
authorities may make a civil complaint to a magistrate under Section 2
of the Dogs Act 1871, where the dog has been out of control. Based on
the balance of probabilities, a court may order the destruction of the
dog or impose conditions to mitigate the risk posed by 
<?notus-xml column=151?>it, such as keeping the dog on a lead or muzzled at
certain times. There are many cases where the courts have taken action

all know that public authorities, such as the police, often have to
take the safe decision in line with legal advice, because they cannot
afford the cost of legal challenge. Many of us will be aware of cases,
particularly in local authorities, where councils wish to take one
decision, but are advised that if they do that it could be challenged,
and they cannot afford a challenge. So sometimes decisions are taken,
not because those taking the decision believe it is the right thing to
do, but because they are frightened of the cost of defending it. Too
often, the police find that when they refuse a licence, that decision
can be overturned by the courts. Last year the deputy chief constable
of Hampshire Police attempted to prevent a man keeping shotguns after a
series—not just one—of allegations of serious sexual
crimes, including against a 17 year-old girl. That was just one of a
string of licensing refusals that Hampshire Police made that were
overturned, each one costing thousands of pounds.</hs_para>

support for the police when they have reasonable concerns for public
safety if they were to issue a licence. We recognise that more
effective checks would cost money; there would be an additional cost.
That is why this is so important, especially when we are seeing such
large cuts in police budgets. At present, the Government are
subsidising firearms licences at the cost of around £18 million
a year—and you have to ask why. If the Minister cannot accept

me. He is always prepared for, and open to, discussions. I hope that he
can accept the amendment. If he cannot accept it today in its entirety,
can he look specifically at the issues relating to domestic violence?
Surely those victims deserve our support and protection, and when the
checks undertaken by a chief police officer in an application for a
firearms licence uncover substantiated evidence of violent conduct,
domestic violence or drug or alcohol abuse, the presumption should be
that the licence application will be refused, unless exceptional
evidence can be brought forward by the applicant of their suitability

ingrained in the minds of anybody who comes from my part of the world,
in Scotland. It was the very same thing with a certain Mr Hamilton, who
had been found guilty of sexually assaulting children and then went on
to carry out the Dunblane massacre of primary school children. The net
effect of that was the passing of the Act banning handguns, which does
not address the issue of whether the police will bring charges when
they see the seriousness of a situation, or understand that there is a
risk in issuing a licence to someone who might appeal and cost them a
lot of money. Of course, the banning of handguns has been
counterproductive because nowadays, if you go around anywhere in the
UK, the only people who have handguns are criminals, who know very well

about what is already happening. The amendment refers to the necessity
of performing background checks, but I believe they already are being
performed. I speak with some experience of dealing with firearms
officers in different parts of the country, which I hasten to admit is
by no means necessarily a representative sample. None the less, these
checks are being dealt with with a good deal of thoroughness. They have

admit that in the Atherton case, as in the Dunblane case and the

regard to the substantiated evidence of violence, there is already a
duty on a police officer not to grant a licence to anyone who is a
danger to public safety or the police, or to those of intemperate

British Association for Shooting and Conservation, which very kindly

the question of full cost recovery, which the noble Baroness has raised
before, the difficulty with any cost is that it is potentially a blank
cheque of some sort. It takes no cognisance of the police efficiency
with which the matter is dealt, nor of wider public safety issues that
may lie outside and beyond the specific application. The costs incurred
could be very high if the system is not effective. The question then
arises—I do not have an answer to this—of how much
society should pay for the protection that licences afford, as opposed
to costs being recovered from the individual. There are many different
walks of life where similar situations apply, such as
whether the cost of a driving licence or the grant of a passport covers
the full cost of the scrutiny. There are certain things that are done
in the name of society and for its protection when it is not considered
appropriate to recover the full costs. I made the point in previous
dealings on a similar amendment at an earlier stage, and I think that
it is probably fair to say, that the present level of the firearms
licence fee looks quite low. However, that is a different matter; it is
a matter for making an order as to what the fees are, which is rather

the police decide whether to prosecute on the basis of their chances of
winning or losing some court case. That is extremely worrying. It means
that the law as put into practice depends on someone’s estimate
of whether the police should deal with somebody who might sue them, and
who has a big enough legal budget to be able to do that. This seems to
call into question the whole legal basis of the way we operate. I very

Harris of Haringey (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we are in danger of
having a slightly false debate on this subject. Let us start from the
simple fact that firearms and shotguns are, very easily, potentially
lethal weapons. What is more, they are lethal weapons that can operate
at some distance. They are therefore dangerous items. It has been
decided by Parliament, quite properly, that there should be a licensing
regime—that checks should be applied to individuals who hold
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:17:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about comparing the population of those who are licensed firearms
holders with those who are not; it is about a very specific
sub-category. This is not an amendment that will stop, or is intended
to stop, armed robbers. It is not about people who start off with
malign intent. It is about the nature of the checks, and how they
should be used, in very restricted circumstances. It is about people
who would 
<?notus-xml column=158?>set out to acquire a firearm not because they want to rob a bank, but
probably for sporting purposes; that is, I assume, the reason why the

operates, that is not sufficient. By passing this amendment, we would
give those chief police officers not just a discretion, as we would be
saying, “The presumption is that you do not put a lethal firearm
in the hands of somebody who has committed domestic violence or has a
history of alcohol abuse or drug abuse”. Surely, that provision
is sensible, is a safeguard and is something on which we can all

noble Baroness, Lady Smith, as I had the pleasure of engaging in
debates with her for two and a half years, but I agree with my noble
friend Lord Deben that we are in danger of overkill here and I disagree
with the comments of the noble Lord opposite. It is clear that we have
to generate public confidence and this amendment makes a very good stab
at trying to establish it, which is absolutely
fundamental.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000066">However,
the process through which people have to go in applying for a firearms
licence is incredibly rigorous. The checking process is rigorous, as is
the storage process, but there will always be people outside that

problem with the amendment is that it leaves out a whole range of
people who should be included in the category we are discussing. That
is why I have drawn the conclusion that legislating for the 
<?notus-xml column=159?>sake of legislating to tighten regulation that is
already tightly drawn is not the answer. Like noble Lords on the
opposition Benches and those who support the amendment, I understand
that public confidence has to be of the utmost. We have to let the

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to my
noble friend Lord Marland for that speech. This has been a useful
debate, in which noble Lords have cast around a bit and have perhaps
extended the debate beyond the terms of the amendment proposed by the
noble Baroness, Lady Smith. It may help if I explain how the current
regime operates, because we have to consider the amendment in the light
of what is already being done to deal with these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:23:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000068">As
the noble Baroness has explained, the first part of the new clause she
proposes seeks to create a presumption that, if an applicant for a
firearm certificate or shotgun certificate meets one of the stated
criteria in her amendment, the police should not grant such a
certificate. The stated criteria include violent conduct, evidence of
domestic violence and drug or alcohol
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:25:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000069">I
share the noble Baroness’s concern about firearms being
possessed or accessed by unsuitable persons. However, under the
provisions of the Firearms Act 1968, the police already have
the ability to take these factors into account when assessing the risk
to public safety. The Firearms Act 1968 specifies that, before a
licence can be issued, the police must be satisfied that the applicant
can possess a firearm or a shotgun without danger to “public
safety or the peace”. That is the basic test, so the law is
sound in this respect and there is no need to change
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000070">I
understand that there are concerns in particular about domestic
violence and abuse. The police do take domestic violence and abuse very
seriously. If they are called to a domestic violence and abuse incident
and they suspect that a person is in immediate danger, they are able to
seize any firearms immediately under powers in the Firearms Act 1968,
the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 or the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984. The police would also complete the domestic abuse,
stalking and “honour”-based violence risk identification
checklist, which asks them to consider the abuser’s occupation
and interests and whether this could give them unique access to
weapons. It also ensures that the police ask victims whether weapons
have been used to hurt them
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000071">Moreover,
in response to concerns, last July we published new guidance on this
issue which provides greater detail on how the police should handle
such cases. The guidance makes it clear that, although each case must
be considered on its merits, evidence of domestic violence will
generally indicate that the application should be
refused.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000072">Furthermore,
revised firearms guidance, published fully in October, specifies that
the police must take seriously intelligence falling short of a
conviction and information when assessing a person’s suitability
to possess firearms. It also states that forces must have procedures in
place to monitor any activity of certificate holders or their
associates which has come to the notice of the
police, and that following a domestic 
<?notus-xml column=160?>violence incident an immediate review of the
suitability of a certificate holder should take place. These recent
changes—they are recent changes—underline how vital it is
to ensure that those in possession of firearms do not pose a risk, and
they serve to make the firearms licensing system
stronger.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000073">The
proposed new clause also seeks to introduce a requirement that the
police must follow any guidance issued by the Home Secretary when
assessing public safety. I understand the argument being made here.
However, I do not consider that this would be the right approach. The
law provides the police with discretion in recognition of their
responsibility for public safety in local areas, so it is right that
chief officers have discretion to assess applications for firearm and
shotgun certificates, taking into account the merits of each case and
the published
guide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011499000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000074">I say
in response to the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, and,
indeed, those of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, who was
concerned that the procedures might be
deficient<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:28:41"></hs_TimeCode>, that
the test the police must apply in deciding whether to grant a
certificate is whether the applicant can be permitted to possess a
firearm without causing danger to public safety or the peace. An
applicant has a statutory right of appeal to the Crown Court against
the police’s decision to refuse a certificate. Therefore, the
police will want to be satisfied that they have a rational, cogent and
well evidenced justification for a decision to refuse a certificate to
enable them to justify their decision in the event of an appeal. While
the police may consider the possibility of a successful appeal in
deciding whether to refuse a certificate, this factor is not part of
the statutory criteria for the decision to grant or refuse a licence
and therefore will not be part of the process, which will be based on
the test of not endangering public safety or the
peace<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:29:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:29:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011499000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#14011499000117">6.30

mentioned this particular factor. I can assure noble Lords that
consultation with the police is integral to the fee-setting process. We

public. They return to the precise location and to the circumstances of
the ordeal they faced. That results in increased anxiety and the

could end up with as little as a £50 fine. What is the point in
pursuing a case if that is the result? Even then, when the CPS does
decide to prosecute, it is very rare, in the reported cases that we
have, for the aggravating factor that I described earlier of assault on

amendment would increase prosecutions and help to ensure that
sentencing reflects the seriousness of the crime. It would do so by
making the assault of a public-facing worker a separate offence, which
would consequently elevate the seriousness of the crime in the

make the range of penalties for offenders higher, thus encouraging a

existing range of offences relating to criminally violent behaviour, my
amendment would further complicate the law and make prosecutions more
complex. I must say, in making this argument, the Government totally
ignore the existing complexity of the laws governing common assault, an
offence which has three categories of harm and culpability and—I
do not have 11 fingers—11 factors reducing seriousness. In

is wrong. For a start, public-facing employees are placed in danger.
That is the whole point. They are legally obliged to be there. We
expect shopkeepers to challenge under-age purchasers of cigarettes and
alcohol—an instruction which, when implemented, results in 30%
of all violent and abusive incidents faced by retailers. We make the
law saying that under-age people should not be given alcohol and
tobacco. Shopkeepers have to implement it, and many of them get
assaulted when they are doing so. You can imagine the 15 year-old thugs
going into those shops. They may be under age as far as the law is
concerned, but they can certainly be very violent towards the

words, contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said,
public-facing workers, like the police, often have to put themselves in
potentially violent situations. As with the police, it is their duty to
uphold laws and regulations. This responsibility not only imposes a
greater financial burden on small businesses such as bars and

course, an assault, in both the law of Scotland and the law of England,
is a crime, and in a sense you could say that it was not necessary to

the value of the measure, which got a lot of publicity, was its
deterrent effect. After all, the last thing that one wants is to have
the assault committed. The Government in Scotland were trying to reduce
the very unfortunate crescendo of assaults on emergency
workers—firemen, ambulance people and so on—and to some
extent the measure appears to have had that effect. Therefore, the
deterrent effect is as valuable as any sentencing. As I said, in an
ideal world, if something was a crime, the individual tempted to do the
act described as criminal would refrain from doing it. It is because of
the deterrent effect that I think there is a good deal of force behind

evidence. If he is saying that there is some restriction on the way

very eloquently made the case in support of this amendment. It is
really about supporting victims of assault by a member of the public in
the course of their employment and in the course of earning their
livelihood. I suppose that the question is whether one feels that the
matter should be dealt with by regarding that kind of assault as one of
a great many aggravating factors in an assault case, or whether it
should be regarded as a separate offence. The noble and learned Lord,

some of the figures that have emerged. Those from the HSE’s
Crime Survey for England and Wales show that there were nearly 650,000
reported incidents of violence at work and that workplace violence

equivalent to some 120,000 assaults—and 34% were threatened with
violence. In addition, 17% of those attacked did not report the
offence—and we can all speculate as to why that might have been
the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:10:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

work—in their employment, in the course of earning their
livelihood— are in a different situation from most other people.
The reality is that an assault on somebody at work can be quite
traumatic. It can lead to a situation where somebody is reluctant or
fearful to go back to their place of work and be in exactly the same
situation that they were in when they were attacked, facing a constant
stream of strangers, any one of whom could become violent. One can also
find cases of people assaulted by a member of the public in the course
of their employment where the assault leads to them actually losing
their job and their livelihood, because they are so traumatised that
they are no longer able to return to the same job at the same location
and to carry on with that
employment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:11:37"></hs_TimeCode>.

reflect the effect that that kind of assault can have on their

has already been said, many people in the course of their employment
are actually put in the way of danger by their work. They are the kind
of people who have already been mentioned: public transport
staff, fire workers, security staff, emergency service workers and shop
workers. They often have to deal with people who are aggressive, drunk
or attempting to break the law. Those workers are the kind of people
who can be working late at night, sometimes on their own and in areas
of anti-social behaviour which most people voluntarily avoid
for their own
safety<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>. Workers

course of their employment dealing with the public have an obligation
to seek to enforce the law. Those, for example, who serve alcohol are
required to obtain proof of age from the purchaser. They are required
to refuse to serve someone who is drunk and they are required to refuse
a proxy sale of alcohol—although not of tobacco, as we were
discussing earlier. Those kinds of actions are all major triggers for
assaults on staff, and reference has already been made to the situation
in that regard. In the USDAW survey, some 30% of assaults arose from
challenging age-restricted sales, and some 15% related to people who
appeared to be committing
theft<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:13:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

out by people in the course of their employment who are required to
seek to enforce the law, place workers at risk. If they are not
undertaken—particularly in relation to refusing to serve people
with alcohol when they are under age, or refusing a proxy sale of
alcohol—staff can be liable for prosecution or for action to be
taken against them for failing to carry out their duty to seek to
enforce the requirements of the law where it
applies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000029">There
are, therefore, differences in the position of people who are
assaulted in the course of their employment. They cannot run away; they
cannot move somewhere else; they have to go back to their employment
after an assault and be in the same situation in exactly the same
circumstances as they were, facing members of the public and probably
fearing that the same kind of thing might happen again. In some cases,
it can cost them their jobs because the experience has been so
traumatic that they feel they cannot carry on. Many are put in danger
by the nature of their work or the kind of job they have to do; many
are required to enforce the law as part of their

the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers about attacks on

too common. We have heard further such evidence in the debate today. We
all agree that assaults on people who come into contact with the public
as part of their work are totally and utterly unacceptable. They are a
matter which both Parliament and the Government take very seriously and
on which we are all agreed. No one should be expected to face violence

when he talked about the staff of small shops. There has been
consistency across the board in our cities: quite often, shops are run
by particular members of the community, often 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. By definition, that opens them up to greater levels of
assault and crime, which do take place; when we look across the
country, it is of course the case. Staff of small shops are
particularly vulnerable in this respect because they may need to stay
open longer hours to make the profit needed to keep their business
going, often as a family business with minimal staff. In Committee, my

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> A Freudian slip there perhaps. Maybe I
was honest in my first assessment. Nevertheless, I listened very
carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, when he talked about victims.
In my own life serving the public in local government, quite often I
came across a victim of crime—we are not talking about someone
who serves the public, but any victim of crime. The noble Lord painted
a scenario about that person having to return to their place of work.
If someone has been assaulted in their own house, on the way to work,
catching a train, at a bus stop or a station, there is equally a sense
of great trepidation when the person has to return.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:20:22"></hs_TimeCode> is important
when we look at these issues that we put them into context. Ask any
victim of crime, particularly serious crime, and the trepidation and
fear that they feel in overcoming those challenges are
intense.</hs_para>

course I acknowledge what the noble Lord is saying. When we face public
life where does it stretch? The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of
Craighead, contributed with his experience of the judiciary. Often, the
judiciary are in the front line when they have to sentence people.
There is an issue to be tackled there. Here, we sit in the Lords and
many have served in representative office. Politicians put themselves
in the front line when they face the public and indeed there have been
instances where they have been assaulted in their own
offices<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000043">We
argue that the degree of seriousness depends on the particular
facts of the case. Why should it be worse, for example, or more
traumatic for someone to be assaulted at work rather than on the bus
going to work, or for that matter when locking the front door when
leaving for work, or as a result of an intrusion into the home? The
simple truth is that every case is unique and may have aggravating and
mitigating circumstances that should be taken into account. That is
where the judiciary comes in. We rely on the judiciary, guided by
sentencing guidelines, to do just
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000044">Specific
issues and questions were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, and
others on issues vis-à-vis the police. First, assaults against
people whose work brings them into contact with the public
should receive the same sentence as an assault on a constable.
That is already the case. With regard to the offence of an assault on a
constable, we accept, as my noble 
<?notus-xml column=174?>friend Lord Taylor said previously, that the police
do occupy an important role in society and a slightly different one by
virtue of the role that they have to perform. But that does not mean
that an assault on someone else, while being a distinct offence,
carries a different maximum penalty. Both offences, be it
on the police constable or anyone else, carry a maximum penalty
of six months’ imprisonment or a fine not exceeding
level 5 on the standard scale currently set at
£5,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000045">The
noble Lord, Lord Davies of Coity, also raised the issue of young women.
Again, I would say, as the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, said about the
Asian community, that there are particular circumstances that have to
be looked at. We maintain that the current law provides protection. He
mentioned the case of Kim and I listened very carefully. It is a great
concern that there are harrowing experiences of victims of assault and
noble Lords have shared those with the House today and in Committee. As
I have already said, there are lasting consequences from these attacks.
It is down to the individual and how they deal with it. It is the role
of government, community and society to provide the support and
protection they need. It concerns me greatly that individuals are not
reporting serious crimes because they believe that nothing will be
done. But we believe that having a new offence will make not a
difference to that issue.</hs_para>

Foulkes, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead,
pointed to the experience in Scotland. I take the point on board about
the higher number of people being charged. It may well be that offences
are currently being prosecuted under the legislation protecting
emergency workers as an alternative to common assault. But I will
certainly take their comments back, make inquiries with the Scottish
Government and write to them in that regard if I
may.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000047">In
closing, I assure the House that the Government are committed to
improving things for victims of crime. Since 2011, the Ministry of
Justice has provided—and continues to provide—more than
£50 million in funding per year to diverse victims’
organisations, including a £38 million per year grant-in-aid
agreement with Victim Support. My noble friend is not in her place, but
I remind noble Lords of the appointment of my noble friend, Lady
Newlove, as Victims’ Commissioner. As noble Lords know, she has
personal experience that she brings to bear to protect and help others
and ensure that we can tackle these issues with people who have tragic
experience in this regard. I pay tribute to her

new victims’ code recently came into force. It explains what
victims should expect from the criminal justice system, who to request
help from and how and where it should be provided. The code also holds
those in the criminal justice system to account, makes victims their
priority and gives victims a clearer means of redress if they are not
given the support they deserve. We all believe that victims need to
know that the criminal justice system will work as hard as possible to
deliver justice for them and help them recover and move on with their
lives. As I said, ask any victim of crime; that is exactly what they
want to do. Indeed,  
<?notus-xml column=175?>often we hear that they do not want to be known as victims of crime:
they want to know that they are survivors of crime because
they have moved forward with their lives.</hs_para>

the Minister mentioned. The police are treated separately when dealing
with criminals. In education we use the phrase “in loco
parentis”, but in this case teachers are acting “in loco
custodia”; that is, in place of the police in that they are
acting on behalf of the police, and so they should be treated in the
same way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:28:57"></hs_TimeCode>. I
would also say to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that the question of
who is the worker is absolutely clear. The only point in relation to
the single source is that the single source is needed to describe a
worker. I do not think that we need corrobation in terms of who is a
worker in these
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:29:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

encouraged by the support that I have received from the Labour Front
Bench. My noble friend Lord Rosser, who has tremendous experience in 
<?notus-xml column=176?>the transport field, knows and understands the kind of problems that
transport workers face. My noble friend Lord Davies of Coity has huge
experience as General Secretary of the Union of Shop, Distributive and
Allied Workers, and he knows exactly what people face. I welcome
particularly the support of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of
Craighead, who pointed out that the introduction in Scotland of a
special offence in relation to workers in the emergency services has
increased the prosecution rate and resulted in a decrease in such
offences. Those are powerful arguments from people who have worked in
the field and from a former judge in Scotland. I hope that if I
have not convinced the Minister, I might have convinced other
Members of this House and Members
opposite<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:30:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

important thing of all is that while of course the general public face
dangers—that is incontrovertible—they do not have to
return day in and day out to the scene of the crime. These workers do.
They have to go back to where the offence took place. That is why they
are a special case and it is why we as a House should give them special
treatment. It is also why I am moving this amendment today.</hs_para>

Soley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, two themes underpin this very short
debate, and I shall try to keep my remarks very brief, to assist
others. First, and very obviously, the Middle East poses a major threat
to world peace. There are appalling conflicts there at the moment and
the humanitarian disasters are great. The second theme relates to the
activities of the European Union, which have been growing in
significance and are extremely important. One of the things that I want
to suggest today is that we must use the influence of the European
Union to get involved in some of the other disputes that trouble us in
that region. The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, as the High
Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, has played a
particularly important role, and this House owes her a debt of
gratitude as she has certainly put us on the map in that
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000058">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:45:08"></hs_TimeCode>
theory, the European Union does not have a foreign policy or a defence
policy. What<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:49:42"></hs_TimeCode> has
been happening, particularly in the Iranian talks, is that you have the
five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus
Germany and Iran, but with the European Union playing a very
significant role in those negotiations, precisely because it has
enormous economic power. With economic power in a unified market, as
some of us have been saying for some time, you inevitably get drawn
into foreign affairs and security policy because you cannot run a
single economic market without having a profound influence on the
world. It is, by far, the most powerful economic bloc in the
world and is therefore going to have a wider influence. That is
important. With such economic power, I would argue, states are born.
They may be very diverse and loosely knit ones, and it is hard to call
the European Union a state, but it certainly has some aspects of a
state<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:46:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000059">The
European Union’s role in the agreement emphasises that economic
power, because it was as a result of those talks, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, chairing them, that she was also able to deliver
relief on some of the sanctions imposed on Iran, such as some of the
nuclear ones, some of the financial ones affecting the insurance of the
oil industry and so on. You could see economic power translating into
political power by saying to Iran: “If you co-operate, we will
move, as will the other states representing the United Nations Security
Council, and Germany as an individual state with great interest in the
area”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000060">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>
facts are true also for the Palestine-Israel dispute. I could spend
some time—I will not because of the shortage of
time—listing what the European Union has already done for both
parties in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Both parties have benefited
from European Union involvement, which has been progressively growing.
People will have noted that, if 
<?notus-xml column=180?>there is a final status agreement, the European
Union has already promised a very significant economic and political
package to try to underpin that agreement. Again, this is enormously
important. It offers an attractive option for both parties to find a
settlement and underpins the efforts by the United States to create
that agreement. We ought to recognise that this is
powerful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:47:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000061">Events
outside the Middle East, which I would like to talk about at some other
stage, also indicate this growing influence. When French troops went
into the Central African Republic, fairly soon afterwards—indeed
only the other week—the European Union asked its members to
provide additional troops in that area. The reach of the European Union
is becoming wider: it is not just the Middle East, although that, to my
mind, is by far the most important area and the one where we can do the
most at the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000062">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>
is my contention that we have gone so far in using the European Union
as a tool of our foreign and security policy that we ought to think
through additional ways in which we can use our influence within the
European Union. We are a very influential player in it and by evolving
a greater coherence on foreign and security policy we can have great
influence. I stress that this does not mean that we have to rush to
create a European army or a European Foreign Secretary, and I am sure
the Minister will not be rushing to the Dispatch Box to say that that
is what we want to do. However, there is a delicate but incredibly
important balance where we can actually increase our influence in that
way and develop it in a way that really benefits the whole region and
enables us to act as though we had a foreign policy, but without
actually creating the problems that would exist within the European
Union if we tried to set that up formally. It is the informal but very
co-operative approach that the European Union takes with its members
that enables that to
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:49:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this into context as I was in the House of Commons when there were
terrible problems in the former Yugoslavia. There was a growing desire
to intervene in that situation as ethnic cleansing reached horrendous
proportions. Eventually we did intervene, led by Prime Minister Tony
Blair. It was done by NATO but, significantly, nearly all the military
assets were those of the United States. The vast majority of the air
power assets—more than 85%—came from the US Air Force and
US Navy. That brought home to Europe the fact that if it could not deal
with ethnic cleansing in its own continent, what other threats could it
not face down around the edges of its continent? That was a very
important lesson and one that is continually being learnt.</hs_para>

am a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which
recently produced a very useful paper pointing out that it was
incredibly frustrating for people in the defence industry and the
defence world generally to see that the European Union did not have
such a policy because it was increasingly marginalising the European
Union forces as the world power balance shifts and new powers
emerge—Brazil in aircraft production, and China, India and
Russia will all come back into play in due course. Those factors are
incredibly important and ought to be looked at in due
course<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:51:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

want to focus on the Middle East and where it goes forward from here.
The role of the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, in the Iranian talks is
very important. I note that she is now being invited by Iran to visit
the country. That invitation was issued the day before yesterday, I
think. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether she has accepted that
invitation. I think that there is a strong case for doing so not least
because the discussions should widen as my Motion indicates, towards
talking about resolving the dispute in Syria as well as the dispute
with Iran over the nuclear weapons issue. There is a very real chance
of the European Union playing a crucial role here. If the Iranians
recognise, as I know they do, that the European Union is a different
entity from the United States and from the individual great powers
which it has dealt with so far, and if the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton,
does visit, the EU might find it a very useful way of seeing what role
it can play.</hs_para>

is difficult for the United States and others to accept that Iran
should be present at the table when the discussions take place on
Syria. I have doubted for some time whether those discussions will take
place, as the Minister will know from other questions
that I have asked her in the past. If we can get that conference going
then there is a case that Iran should be there, subject to certain
limitations. Perhaps the European Union can be helpful in that regard.
Even if it does not work out that Iran is present then the European
Union can act as a conduit between that conference and the Iranians. If
the Iranians do not co-operate on a settlement within Syria, the
problem will continue to trouble us, and the horrendous sights of what
is happening in Syria that we see on our televisions will
continue

said that I would keep my remarks as brief as possible but I have one

Carrington of Fulham (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Soley, on this extremely timely debate, and on his
work in bringing Arabs and Jews to a better understanding via his
Arab-Jewish Forum. This debate comes at a time of mourning for the life
of General Sharon. His life in some ways is an exemplar of the problems
that have bedevilled attempts to find a solution to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He moved from freedom
fighter—terrorist to some—to being a successful general,
to being accused of war crimes and to becoming a hard-line
Prime Minister who removed the settlements from Gaza. His was a life
that many, including me, would like to interpret as a progression from
a belief that the conflict could be solved through violence to a
realisation that the only solution is through compromise, negotiation
and
magnanimity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000069">Finding
that compromise and magnanimity is the problem. As some of your
Lordships may know, I have spent much of my working life outside
politics doing business in the Middle East, often with devout Muslims.
I am also a strong supporter of Israel and its right to exist, and to
do more than exist: to prosper as a beacon of enterprise and democracy
in an otherwise very challenged part of the world.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=182?><hs_para UID="140114106000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000070">In
this dispute, sadly, facts and truth often do not matter and perception
is everything. Among many devout Muslims who believe in the teachings
of the Prophet, which are peaceable and loving, the perception is that
American and—perhaps to a lesser extent—EU support for
Israel is absolute, and as too often in the region “my
enemy’s friend is my enemy”, it is hard for either to act
as an honest broker in any
negotiations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000071">It
would be wrong to say, as some Arab commentators claim, that the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the root of all the problems in the
Middle East. However, the conflict is certainly not divorced from the
Sunni-Shia war and the persecution of Christians in some Arab
countries. Without a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian problem, it is
impossible to see how the other conflicts in the region can start to be
resolved. I would like to think that the European Union role, or the
American role, in the negotiations could be seen to be benign and
impartial—but, sadly, that is
impossible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000072">The
Middle East desperately needs a fair solution to this problem in the
short window in which a two-state solution is still possible, but there
can be no honest brokers and possibly not even guarantors. The two
sides have to come to a realisation that neither one has any
alternative to a fair two-state solution. Once that is agreed, we will
have the best chance that the men of violence will lose support and
that peace will become a reality. The role of the EU has to be to
support and put pressure on the Americans, and to make it clear to both
the Israelis and the Palestinians that only a two-state solution is
possible and that no other solution will be acceptable if money,
technology and arms are still to flow to the
region.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140114106000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000131"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:57:25"></hs_TimeCode></I>7.57

UK Government and the EU frequently endorse a key Palestinian demand

agreement. They have 
<?notus-xml column=183?>not acknowledged one of Israel’s key
concerns: namely, that an agreement must be along the lines of two
states for two peoples, as my noble friend Lord Carrington outlined. It
is important to set realistic expectations for both sides regarding the
end game, and in particular to reassure the Israelis that a peace
agreement will secure, not threaten, Israel as the only state in the

does Israel see? The glorification of terrorism and violence in the
Palestinian Authority and Hamas media, along with a denial of the
Jewish connection to the land and any right to statehood. That sends
out a very negative message to Israel about Palestinian intentions
regarding a negotiated two-state solution, which we all want.
Israel’s public support for talks is high, but faith in the
Palestinian partner is, sadly—whether correctly or
incorrectly—very low. This is a considerable source of concern,
particularly when there seem to be continued Palestinian attacks on
Israelis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000079">Given
the role of the EU as a financial supporter of the PA, to which the

it not do more to pressurise the Palestinian Authority to address that

O'Loan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Soley,
for securing this debate. We meet at a time of terrible difficulties in
the Middle East. The Geneva II Middle East peace conference is due to

talk about displaced people. The United Nations says that there are
about 6 million people now displaced inside Syria, with more than
2.3 million registered refugees living across the region in
countries such as Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq, all of which are
struggling to cope with the number of refugees. About 20% of the
refugees live in camps; the rest are in other communities, often living
in profoundly difficult
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T20:01:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000082">Last
autumn, I visited a refugee camp for Syrian refugees, Camp Zatary in
Jordan. It has a population of between 125,000 and 145,000. It is
difficult to know how many there are because people come and go with
such fluidity. Some people think that those camps are used by the
Syrian fighters for R&amp;R. As refugee camps go, Camp Zatary is a
model location. It has a paved street, three hospitals and many
shops—you can buy a washing machine or a television—and
electricity is available, but it is still a refugee camp, and only
Syrians can go
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T20:02:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there are many refugees from Syria who are not Syrian. I think in
particular of the Palestinians, about whose plight is there has been so
much international comment, effort and so on, but which still remains
unresolved. It is important, as the parties move to attempt
to change the situation in Syria and other parts of the Middle East,
that we do not forget the plight of those who have been living for
decades in various Middle Eastern countries as displaced people without
refugee status and with no proper access to
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T20:02:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I was in Jordan, I visited a Gaza camp at Jaresh, a long drive from
Amman, perched on the side of a barren mountain in the desert. It has
been there since the people fled from Gaza in 1967. They are not
recognised as refugees; they are displaced people. The only body that
helps them is UNRWA, established in 1967 to care for them. It has very
limited resources. In 40-plus years, it has not been able to achieve as
much as the UNHCR has achieved at Zatary. The people cannot go back to
Gaza: they have no identity, no right to work in the public service or,
really, in the private sector, no homeland, no ability to travel and no
experience of the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000085">There
are more than 5,000 children in the school in that camp, educated to a
limited degree. They cannot go to university because, apart from a very
small number of them, they have to pay international fees. The teachers
try to teach them. When we met the children, they told us what they
want. We met the girls, and I should like to tell noble Lords what
these beautiful, bright, articulate young women, living out their lives
on a bleak mountainside, told us. They said that they want to be
recognised as human beings with rights, not as people with no identity
who are helpless. They want the right to own property. They want to be
able to work. They want an education but they said, “If we
can’t get an education, we’ll study”. Above all,
they want to be happy. They said that everything is about grieving.
Even when there might be some happiness, there is still sadness for all
that is lost. They want to make a

European Union and those who support it could make a difference to
those young lives. They could encourage funding to allow those bright
young people to take their place in the world. They could conduct an
audit of conditions in those forgotten camps. Above all, the United
Nations could be facilitated and encouraged by the European Union and
its international partners to recognise the responsibilities it has to
those forgotten people. UNRWA is not enough. Something needs to be done

would render a contiguous Palestinian state well nigh impossible. I am
delighted that John Kerry, the American Secretary of State, has made
such good progress in the past few months, although sad that he left
the Middle East recently without an official framework agreement

lacerated psyche of both nations needs considerable tact and respect on
Europe’s part. Pinpricks from Brussels, such as trade boycotts
and academic and other cultural ostracism, inflame only one party. When
Israel released a third batch of 26 imprisoned Palestinians, it
included a man who killed a woman in the ninth month of pregnancy,
three further children and an Israeli soldier trying to prevent this
crime; he was hailed by President Abbas as a national hero and a model
for Palestinian youth. No doubt, Palestinians could point to deeply
offensive incidents allegedly committed by Israelis and, of course,
there is the tremendous problem of the settlements.</hs_para>

consider the fact that the total area of settlements in Palestinian
land is less than 2%. From talking to various people, I believe that,
in a final settlement, a great deal could be done by land swaps and
ingenious ways of dealing with this terribly vexed
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114106000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#140114106000101">In

echo the words of my noble friend Lord Carrington and pass condolences
to 
<?notus-xml column=187?>both the State of Israel and the family of the late
Ariel Sharon. There is a lot we can learn from his life which, while
controversial, nevertheless included taking some enormous steps to
promote peace in the region, such as agreeing the road map and the
withdrawal from Gaza, despite facing enormous pressures internally and
externally. I hope that his passionate and determined pursuit of peace
towards the end of his life will encourage others to follow his
example.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#1401152000003">This
debate refers to a wider Middle East peace settlement and there is
often a tendency in such debates to focus just on the Israel-Palestine
conflict, which is not necessarily the main cause of regional
instability. However, in my opinion, economic prosperity for all the
parties in that region is one of the keys for peace. This debate is
focusing on the efforts made by the EU, and quite rightly, as since
1994 the EU has provided more than €5.6 billion in assistance to
the Palestinian people. The United Kingdom has been a very large
contributor to this sum. Between 2008 and 2012 it was the third largest
contributor of direct financial support after Holland and Sweden, with
the United Kingdom’s contribution being about 10% of member
states’ specific
contributions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#1401152000004">Some
of this direct funding has gone to support the rehabilitation of the
private sector in Gaza, which must be very welcome. However, the recent
European Court of Auditors’ Special Report No. 14, which was
published in 2013, draws attention to some very worrying observations,
such that a “considerable number”, in its words, of civil
servants in Gaza were being paid without going to work or providing any
public service. Furthermore, it is now clear that a significant
proportion of the Palestinian Authority’s budget, in part
financed by the EU Pegase programme, is used to pay a salary to
Palestinian prisoners in Israel, many of whom have been convicted of
terrorist activities. This now runs at a rate of nearly £3
million per month and, perversely, the longer the sentence, the greater
the salary. While Israel has commendably started to release prisoners,
as the noble Lord, Lord Weidenfeld, said, the president of the
Palestinian Authority has publicly called such convicted terrorists
“heroes”. This does not bode well for changing the mood
in the region towards peace. The EU would do well to heed the warnings
by listening to the concerns in its own auditors’ report and
further reflect on whether it should allow its—and our
financial—support for Palestine to be used, in effect, for
prisoner salaries.</hs_para>

more to promote peace in this area. Specifically, the funds would be
much better used in following the example of the Portland Trust, based
here in the UK, and using our resources further to promote Palestinian
economic growth, which did in fact achieve an impressive 4.25%
in 2013. It is by promoting the prosperity of the region that the EU
will enhance the peace

Anderson of Swansea (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I warmly congratulate
my noble friend Lord Soley and will raise only a few headlines. First,
on the context, there is turmoil throughout the Middle East and north
Africa region, much of it interconnected. No one can now plausibly
blame Israel for that turmoil, with Israel 
<?notus-xml column=188?>itself being an oasis of stability. Nevertheless the
current Israeli Government, with their settlement policy, are surely
placing obstacles in the path of a two-state solution, just as the
Palestinians raise their own obstacles to peace, as the noble Lord,
Lord Palmer,
emphasised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#1401152000007">Secondly,
the EU’s interests and those of its member states are directly
involved throughout the region, not just because of refugees and
terrorism. We have a clear interest in seeking to stabilise the region
on democratic
lines.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#1401152000008">Thirdly,
I recall the US jibe against Europe: “We do the cooking; you,
the Europeans, do the washing-up”. There is surely an element of
truth in this. It is Secretary Kerry who has taken the lead, both on
the Middle East peace process and over Syria. Yet it is fair to say
that the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, is playing a key role on
behalf of the European Union in the rapprochement with Iran, and not
just because of the EU sanctions. Is the main strategic political role
always to be led by the US and does the EU mainly have a secondary role
in institution-building and humanitarian aid? Even if this is
inevitable there is surely a key, if subordinate, political role for
the EU, not only over Iran but over the quartet and the Syria problem.
We should also not decry the washing-up or soft power role. For
example, the EU and its member states have spent more than €1
billion in funding Syrian refugees. The EU has also offered attractive
carrots to the Palestinians.</hs_para>

Middle East is a test case for the new European External Action Service
after its apparent success in Kosovo. By using all its available
instruments, the EU has a serious role. There has been real progress on
the immediate humanitarian side. In the longer term, there is much EU
experience in the building of viable civil society institutions, the
rule of law and human rights. This is particularly seen now in Tunisia,
the cradle of the Arab
awakening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0002.htm#1401152000010">Back
to Palestine: the EU is the largest provider of development aid to the
Palestinian territories yet there is surely insufficient conditionality
for all the money which is given. Last December, the European Court of
Auditors concluded that EU assistance to Palestine has been reasonably
effective but it highlighted many areas of concern. I have two final
questions. Will the Government press for these to be addressed and,
generally, will they seek to make the EU’s political weight in
the region more commensurate with our financial
contribution?<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T20:20:51"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Nicholson of Winterbourne (LD):</Member></B> I add my voice to the
praise and thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Soley, for giving us the
opportunity today to debate his Question for Short Debate on what role
the European Union is playing in the wider Middle East peace
settlement. I suggest to the noble Lord that the European Union herself
is in fact a centre of peace and stability in a turbulent Middle East
and north Africa neighbourhood, and that the European Union can look
back with pride on a tremendous historic sweep of achievements. She is
today the largest donor to Palestine but, at the same time, has been an
absolute determinant in ensuring the best possible two- state solution
terms.</hs_para>

European Union runs a constant and well managed European observation
set of missions to some of the more difficult countries in the region:
Yemen, Lebanon and Egypt, for example. From the European
Parliament’s Iraq permanent standing committee, one member of
our earlier grouping is now the United Nations representative to Iraq.
A second member of the committee is the EAS representative. In Iran,
high activity has been taking place recently but in fact that has been
going on for very nearly 15 years now. In Egypt, the
European Union has a massive influence. It is perhaps the only constant
influence in trying to diminish the horrific female genital mutilation.
That rose up to 90% according to the EU ambassadors, including
that of the UK, and the US ambassador under the
unlamented President Morsi.</hs_para>

the global Mediterranean policy of 1972, with bilateral agreements in

Settlement goods are being banned from some supermarket chains. Soda

counterbalance to the seemingly singular narrative that has been

turn to the amendment and the issue that we discussed in Committee.
This is a hidden problem. In cases of the forced marriage of a
vulnerable adult, the violence, threats or coercion to which the Bill
specifically refers are often not necessary to force a person to marry,
due to the lack of capacity of the victim. Deception is not necessarily
a factor and, consequently, the amendment seeks to make it an offence
if a person forces another person to marry when that person lacks the
capacity to consent to the marriage.</hs_para>

forced marriages of people with learning disabilities happen. Marriage
can sometimes be seen as a means of providing a carer and continuing
support. Parents may be the primary carers and, as they get older and
less able to provide support; they may view marriage as a means of
ensuring continuing care for their son or daughter with learning
disabilities. Marriage can be seen as a means of improving the chances
of getting a visa to the UK. A person with learning disabilities may be
seen as easy to deceive or coerce into such a marriage and then act as
the visa sponsor. Families may believe that the marriage will cure the
learning disability or allow a person with learning disabilities to
lead a normal
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T20:55:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the figures for people with learning disabilities involved in forced
marriages. The Forced Marriage Unit estimates that 115 of the cases it
has received involve people with disabilities, but it is not clear
whether they have learning disabilities or lack of capacity. I have
seen an estimate of 50 in 2012. However, the Ann Craft Trust believes
that this is the tip of an iceberg and that hundreds of adults who lack
capacity are being forced into marriage. Mencap believes the same; its
chief executive

with a learning disability can be particularly vulnerable to forced

problem is the lack of facilities, experience or support for people

terrible lack of options for people with learning disabilities who are
escaping abuse and forced marriage. She says that the problem is
compounded by social care cuts and that statutory authorities are
placing the victims in supported living service or care homes, which
are not services geared to provide the specialist support needed to

victims with a learning disability. Where necessary, the Forced
Marriage Unit works closely with adult social services to ensure that a

all, they may have only one chance to speak to the potential victim and
therefore only one chance to save a life. This means that all
professionals working in the statutory agencies must be aware of their
responsibilities when they come across suspected forced marriage
situations. I fully acknowledge that this is even more important for
people with learning disabilities. There is an even greater onus on the
practitioner to recognise the warning signs. We hope and intend that
the guidance will ensure that all practitioners working with people
with learning difficulties are aware of their responsibilities and will
not let one chance to save a victim be lost. In this regard, after the

The quarterly meetings of the forced marriage NGO partnership board are

Thornton:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for allowing me to press
him on this point. Actually, the point is that there will be no
coercion. There does not need to 
<?notus-xml column=210?>be any coercion as the person lacks capacity. Therefore, they cannot
consent, or withhold their consent, because they do not know that they
can do either of those things. The parents concerned may think that
they are doing exactly the right thing for that son or daughter,
whether a young person or not. In other words, the Bill as drafted does
not cover that point. No coercion is being used, and no coercion is
needed, as the person lacks capacity. I do not think the definition of
coercion that the Minister has mentioned at previous points in the Bill
covers
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:21:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000105"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="1401152000331" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000331">Lord

respect the noble Baroness’s position. She is correct in saying
that, often, the people who may be forced into a marriage would be
unaware of the situation. The point she raised about parents is also
well made. However, as the legislation stands, they would not have
given their “full” consent, which means that they had the
capacity to give that consent. I see that the noble Lord wishes to

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> The point here is not the consent but
whether coercion has taken place. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, put
it very clearly: for an offence to be committed, both paragraphs (a)
and (b) have to apply. It is not a question of whether consent has been
given or not under paragraph (b) but a question of whether or not there
has been coercion. This will not necessarily be coercion. It may simply
be suggestion, which I do not think counts as coercion. The context is
that you have to do both (a) and (b), so there has to be either the use
of “violence” and “threats”—which
does not necessarily have to
happen—</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1401152000286" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000286">“or

this will not necessarily be coercion. I will carry on explaining the

is the question of coercion, which leads to somebody entering into a
marriage, and the question of consent. I think we all agree that people
with limited capacity will not be able to give consent. However, that,
in itself, does not create an offence, because they may not have been
coerced. A highly suggestible person with learning difficulties may
simply have been told, “This is going to be nice, you are going
to enjoy this and this is going to be fun. So-and-so is going to look
after you and take you to the cinema”. I do not know what the
form of suggestion might be, or how it might be put, but that is the
context in which it would happen. It is not the same as
coercion—that is the difficulty. As far as I can tell—the
noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, put it very clearly—you need both
coercion and the failure to consent before you have committed an
offence. That is why my noble friend Lady Thornton’s amendment
is so

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord and the noble
Baroness for their interventions and will return to that point before I
conclude my comments. The point is well made and understood, but I will
continue while I await clarification. My understanding on this issue is
that any person taking part in a marriage would have to give their
consent. The view is 
<?notus-xml column=211?>that, if no consent is given, it would not be deemed
to be a valid contract. However, as I said, I will clarify that point

turn to Amendments 87A and 87B tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady
Tonge. I shall explain that these amendments relate to the process by
which a young person aged 16 or 17 may consent to the marriage.
Following the Committee stage, I have had the opportunity to meet the
noble Baroness and I welcome the opportunity again to discuss this
important issue today. These amendments would make it an offence for
the parent or guardian to consent to a marriage of a person or persons
before the age of 18 unless the written consent of both parties to the
marriage has been obtained. The offence would also extend to marriages
contracted outside the UK.</hs_para>

noble Baroness is concerned that under the current law parents may give
consent to force marriage on a 16 or 17 year-old who may not wish to
marry. However, I do not believe this amendment is necessary because
the law already provides adequate safeguards for children who are aged
16 to 17 and are entering into marriages.</hs_para>

Wales, as contained in Section 2 of the Marriage Act 1949, provides
that if a marriage, be it civil or religious, is solemnized and either
or both of the parties is under the age of 16 that marriage will be
void. If the child is aged 16 or 17, Section 3 of the Marriage Act 1949
requires the consent of the child’s parents or guardians, unless
the child is a widow or a
widower.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000112">I
appreciate that Amendment 87A seeks to add additional safeguards to the
current law rather than preventing the marriage of 16 and 17 year-olds
outright. However, I consider that the additional need for the written
consent of parties is unnecessary. If any person is forced into a
marriage without their consent, the provisions in this Bill which will
make it a criminal offence to seek to force someone to marry will apply
regardless of the age of the party concerned. In addition, any forced
marriage would be voidable under Section 12(c) of the Matrimonial
Causes Act 1973 on grounds of lack of valid
consent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000113">If
someone is being forced into marriage, it is foreseeable that they
could be forced to provide written consent. Therefore, I do not believe
that this provision would achieve the noble Baroness’s desired
effect of preventing forced marriages. However, I understand totally
the noble Baroness’s concerns and I share her desire to ensure
that we do everything we can to protect 16 and 17 year-olds—as
well as others—from forced marriage. In regard to the points
made by the noble Baroness, I will keep the provisions in the Bill
under review and, as we have previously discussed, consider the issue
of how the legislation is currently drafted to see whether there is
something more that we can return to at Third
Reading.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000114">Turning
to the application of such a provision to marriages contracted outside
the United Kingdom, there is no legislation in England and Wales on
this issue and matters of recognition of such marriages in England and
Wales are for the courts to determine. However, I consider that the
courts already have the necessary powers to provide adequate safeguards
for children entering into marriages outside the UK. Generally 
<?notus-xml column=212?>speaking, the validity of a marriage contracted
outside the UK will be governed by the law of the country in which it
was contracted. However, if there were questions as to the capacity or
age of one or both parties to such a marriage, the courts in England
and Wales could refuse to recognise the marriage for the purposes of
England and Wales law.</hs_para>

that the need for the written consent of parties is unnecessary in

I may turn to the issue just raised on Section 109. The Forced Marriage

there is an element of coercion, we do not wish to criminalise the

offences of forced marriage in Scotland that mirror the offences in
Clause 109 for England and Wales. The Scottish Parliament is currently
considering the necessary legislative consent Motion. The amendment
relates to the penalty on conviction on indictment for the new offence.
Initially, the Scottish Government opted for this to be imprisonment
for a period not exceeding two years, as that was in line with similar
penalties in Scotland. The Scottish Government have given further
consideration to the issue and concluded that if we are providing
consistency across the UK by criminalisation, we should seek to extend
the consistency by applying the same maximum penalties on indictment.
The maximum sentence of seven years has been set to cover the most
serious behaviour imaginable under the offence. We have looked closely
at other existing offences, international comparators and related
maxima in proposing the new maximum sentence. I beg to

combatant in armed conflict against a foreign state without the licence
of Her Majesty. My purpose in doing so is to defend the realm, which is

from six years of financial crisis, the determination of the expanding

Islamist jihad is now as dramatic as anything that has been seen since
those decades of expansion that followed the death of the Prophet
Muhammad in 632 AD. This now includes persecution of Christians in many
Muslim countries, particularly Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Egypt and now

means that any British passport holder who takes part in armed conflict

who induces any other British citizen to do so, will be subject to
penalty unless he has informed the Foreign Secretary before doing so.
There could be three penalties according to my amendment: a fine or
imprisonment; the forfeiture of a British passport; or the deprivation
of citizenship. It would send a clear message to those considering
taking part in armed jihad. It would necessitate HM Passport Office
being aware of the details of other passports that British passport
holders have. This is something that I have urged for a long time, as

that there are already substantial powers to deal with terrorism.
Indeed the Supreme Court, in R v Gul in 2013, emphasised that while
there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism in
international law, in British law terrorism is very widely defined. My
amendment is therefore neither needed nor intended to deal with
terrorism per se; it is intended to control actions which, according to
the heads of our intelligence services, could lead to people becoming
terrorists. It is therefore a preventative measure, and one with
sufficient sanction to deter those who might be led into terrorism by
military adventure

it is because the jihadist threat is a new threat that I believe this

this is quite different. In any case, the opportunity as well as the
need, in effect, to get consent from HMG before becoming an overseas
combatant, would ensure that no one need fear victimisation for their
political or religious convictions. I believe I would have the support

<?notus-xml column=217?>for tabling this amendment, not least because it
provides your Lordships with an opportunity to consider the Foreign
Enlistment Act 1870—not something that we do every day, or
night. The Act prohibits British nationals from fighting in the armed
forces of another state, against friendly states. The new clause would
go further by creating a new offence of participation in armed conflict
against any foreign state at peace with Her Majesty. My noble
friend’s amendment raises an important and topical issue: that
of people from the United Kingdom seeking to engage in combat abroad in
so-called “theatres of jihad”, such as the civil war in
Syria, to which my noble friend
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000140">Although
the issue of British nationals fighting abroad is not a new one, or one
specific only to Syria, it is something that the Government take very
seriously. Syria is now the number one destination for jihadists
anywhere in the world, and there are currently thousands of foreign
fighters in Syria, including a large number of Europeans. We judge that
more than 200 UK-linked individuals have travelled to Syria to join the
fighting. Of course, not all individuals who travel to Syria are
extremists. Many simply want to support humanitarian efforts. However,
those who do travel there are putting themselves and innocent Syrians
in danger, and we know that a number of Europeans have already been
killed in the conflict. Moreover, we know that some individuals travel
to Syria—or other places such as Yemen or
Somalia—to engage in fighting with terrorist groups.</hs_para>

working with the police and security services to disrupt travel by
individuals of concern. Your Lordships will understand why I am unable
to provide specific details of all of the actions that are being taken
to this end—but rest assured, we support the use of the full
range of available measures. In particular, where there is evidence
that individuals are planning, promoting, funding, facilitating or
participating in terrorist activities overseas—including
terrorist fighting—the police and Crown Prosecution Service will
look to prosecute them, before they go or on their return. A very wide
range of offences already exists on the statute books to capture such
activity, not least in the Terrorism Acts 2000 and 2006, which provide
extraterritorial jurisdiction in relation to certain activities.
Although my noble friend’s amendment seeks to add a further
offence to the disruptive arsenal, I fear that this amendment, as
drafted, entails a number of drawbacks that would undermine its
effectiveness.</hs_para>

with,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1401152000270" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000270">“armed

distinctions of war and peace made sense in 1870; Tolstoy’s
masterpiece had been published just the year before. But the bases for
modern conflicts are no longer so binary. The UK has not been in a
declared condition of war since the defeat of the Axis forces in 1945.
Today we are at peace with all states, at least in the classical sense
of international
law.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1401152000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000144">Second<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:50:06"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
the defence of notification to the proposed new offence has the
potential to severely undermine the disruptive utility. Whether it was
my noble friend’s 
<?notus-xml column=218?>intention I do not know, but the amendment as
drafted gives the Secretary of State no additional power to prohibit a
person who gives notice of their intention to fight overseas from
going. A number of existing powers might be used to prevent such a
person from travelling—and, of course, the Bill augments these
by providing powers to seize passports cancelled on public interest
grounds. But the amendment adds nothing to these powers. Indeed, the
proposed offence bites only when a fighter who previously failed to
notify returns to the UK. Anyone who does notify the Secretary of State
would be completely free from the sanctions which this amendment seeks
to put in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000145">Third<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:50:59"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
any offence that hinges on such a notification regime is likely to
raise significant difficulties in enforcement. A committed jihadist is
unlikely to inform the authorities of his travel plans for fear of
disruption, either before or after the fact. Evidence that a person has
engaged in fighting abroad would be extremely difficult to obtain, so
the evidential difficulties in securing a prosecution may be no less
than for the other relevant offences
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000146">Fourth<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:51:23"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
although self-defence has a well understood meaning in relation to
ordinary offences against the person, how it would apply in the context
of overseas conflicts is unclear. Many jurisdictions have laws to deal
with the use of defensive force in situations of immediate danger, and
we expect British nationals to comply with local laws wherever they
are. But the idea of participating in armed conflict as an act of
self-defence is a difficult matter. We must take care not to legitimise
the wrong-headed extremist narrative that paints so-called jihadists as
fighting a war of self-defence on behalf of Muslims
internationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000147">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:52:27"></hs_TimeCode>,
the amendment proposes sentences for the new offence that could include
forfeiture of a passport and deprivation of British citizenship. As
noble Lords will recall from our discussion in Committee of what is now
Clause 138, passports are issued under the royal prerogative. The Home
Secretary already has the power to refuse or withdraw passports
where she believes that a person’s activities—past,
present or proposed—are so undesirable that the grant or
continued enjoyment of passport facilities is contrary to the public
interest. The British Nationality Act gives the Home Secretary powers
to deprive persons of their British citizenship when she is satisfied
that deprivation is conducive to the public good, provided that the
person is not left stateless as a result. As such, these sentencing

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> In moving Amendment 90 I
shall also speak to Amendment 91. These two amendments are intended to
be entirely helpful to the Government. I am surprised that that
suggestion provoked hilarity from the Government Front Bench, because
that is genuinely the case. If the Minister has in front of him a brief
from his officials suggesting that he should oppose these amendments, I
hope that by the time he has finished listening to what I have to say
he will realise that that advice is perhaps an example of civil
servants approaching amendments to a Bill as if not a tiny hair of its
precious head should be interfered with, because obviously it is an
object of complete perfection. I hope that by the end of my speech the
noble Lord will realise that I am trying to improve the Bill and make
it fit more coherently with other legislation on policing and
anti-social
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:56:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000152">Amendment
90 requires that each of the responsible bodies in a local community
safety partnership should set out its approach to using the anti-social
behaviour powers in the Bill. As part of the production of a community
safety plan, the various relevant organisations —the local
authority, the local police commander, and possibly the health bodies
and so on—should set out how they will use the powers given to
them by the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that police and crime commissioners should include in their policing
and crime plans objectives for the use of the anti-social behaviour
powers in the Bill. Before the Minister assumes that I must have had
some sort of Damascene conversion to the concept of police and crime
commissioners, let me tell him that this is nothing of the sort. I am
simply trying to make this legislation that the Government are trying
to get through consistent with other legislation that Parliament has
already passed. I am not saying that previous legislation is perfect or
does not need changing; I am simply trying to make this legislation
consistent with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:57:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000154">The
aim of the amendments is to integrate what is in the Bill with other
legislative requirements. They would ensure that plans were made for
how the various 
<?notus-xml column=220?>powers—the new injunction powers, the
dispersal order powers and so on, which we have spent many happy hours
debating—would be used in any local area. The requirement that
the intentions of the various responsible authorities be set out in the
local community safety plans and the force-wide policing and crime
plans will ensure that there is public consultation on the approach to
be taken. It will also require buy-in from all the local partners to
the approach being
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T21:58:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Above
all, we are trying to ensure that some sort of coherent strategy for
the use of Parts 1 to 5 of the Bill is articulated. At the moment, that
is not an obligation for those who will enforce it.</hs_para>

my view, local community safety plans are the building blocks of local
collaboration. The 1998 Act that created them, and the subsequent
amendments of the law that have strengthened and added elements to
them, are the mechanism by which, at local level, the police service,
the local authorities and other relevant parties come together to
decide on the best way of dealing with what, in the original
formulation and language used, was called crime and disorder. In this
context, that would include anti-social behaviour. What is the best way
of addressing that? My amendment would involve the local authority
sitting down with the police and identifying the circumstances in which
they can both make a difference, so it is about the sort of
collaboration that the Minister, in responding to a number of
provisions, has talked about as being the sine qua non of what the
Government are trying to achieve with the Bill. Therefore, the
amendment follows the principles set out by Ministers but provides a
framework in which they will be discussed at local level by the
relevant parties. The amendment would also provide coherence and enable
the relevant intentions to be set out clearly. It sets out a mechanism
for this to take place and a mechanism for partnership around what the
Government want to see achieved at local level with regard to
anti-social behaviour. It also sets out a mechanism whereby those
approaches can be
agreed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000156">The
amendment would deliver transparency at local level with regard to how
the measures in Parts 1 to 5 are to be used—without the
amendment, I am afraid that the Bill simply does not have
that—and introduce a much clearer system of local accountability
as the local objectives in regard to the use of Parts 1 to 5 would be
set out. It would also provide a mechanism to achieve consistency of
approach in the way that the powers in Parts 1 to 5 are used within a
force area and even within a local authority area. Above all, it would
institutionalise effective
collaboration<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:01:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I
cannot see what there is in these amendments for the Government Front
Bench not to like. As I say, they are genuinely put forward in a spirit
of trying to be helpful and make this piece of legislation consistent
and compatible with other legislation that requires collaboration and
working together to protect local communities against anti-social
behaviour. I beg to

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I entirely agree with what lies behind
these amendments but have one concern about them, with which the noble
Lord may be able to help me. We heard in an earlier debate on the Bill
that 
<?notus-xml column=221?>a number of police and crime commissioners are
already dealing with anti-social behaviour as one of their objectives.
I assume that, as they are doing that, they are able to do so.
Therefore, I wonder whether it is necessary to refer specifically to
this Act, as it will be, in the second of the noble Lord’s
amendments in this
group<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000158">Given
that we already have a requirement under new subsection (1A) of the
relevant Act for each of the responsible authorities to have regard to
the police and crime objectives, I am not sure whether the proposed new
subsection (1B) is necessary. We often hear that things are not
necessary but it is helpful to be clear about them. However, my real
concern is whether, by referring specifically to the Anti-social
Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act, there might be a suggestion that it
should have priority over other legislation which could be listed among
the objectives. The relevant police reform Act, the obligations of the
police and crime commissioners and the police and crime plans use wide
and general terms. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act,
as it will become, will not be the only legislation to which all
responsible authorities need to have regard, so I am concerned about
knock-on effects outside what we are considering at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:03:56"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:04:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000159"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="1401152000348" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000348">Lord

Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> I understand the noble
Lord’s eagerness to accept this, and it may have something to do
with the hour, but, just occasionally, I have a few words to say on the
proposals put forward by my noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey. I
must admit that when I first looked at these amendments I had a slight
concern about the role of the community safety partnerships and their
responsibilities. My own CSP has seen a massive cut in its budget and
its capacity to deal with some of the issues before it. But when
resources are short, planning is most essential. It would be
extremely useful to have the kind of co-ordination function that is
laid out in the
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:04:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401152000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-0003.htm#1401152000161">I
am sorry that the Minister laughed when my noble friend said how
helpful he was trying to be. He has been accused of many things during
the course of proceedings on the Bill. He was accused of being
mischievous when he was trying to be helpful. He put on record that he
is trying to be helpful now and there was hilarity from the Benches
opposite, which I genuinely think is most unfair. This is the kind of
amendment that sets in place how the objectives of the Bill can be
achieved by those responsible for implementing
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:05:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this Bill. It is important that all the partners understand their role
and the expectations. I give one example. The noble Lord will recall
that I proposed amendments in Committee on dispersal orders. One of the
issues is that there is no longer a responsibility on the police to
consult the local authority when issuing dispersal orders. The new
orders that the Government are proposing are wider and can last longer
than the ones in place at the moment. There is also no obligation to
consult the local authority, but the guidance says—I cannot
remember the exact phraseology—that there is the opportunity to
discuss or that that is expected or is likely.
Before<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T22:09:29"></hs_TimeCode> 
<?notus-xml column=222?>any dispersal orders were issued, would it not be
helpful if discussions took place within the community safety
partnership about what the expectations would be when it came to the
point of issuing one? It is fitting to have that kind of co-ordination,
to know what the expectations and responsibilities are, to ensure that
the legislation being put forward by the Government has an impact, that
it does not disappear into the ether somewhere but can be worked on. I
would expect that this is the very least that the Government would
expect—to have this way of taking the new legislation into the

will talk about the issue in general and then talk about how it happens
specifically. This is about how police and local councils will use the

Amendment 90 first and then I will come on to Amendment 91. I have
listened to the noble Lord’s comments on the amendment. Although
I appreciate the helpful intent behind the amendment, I do not believe
that it is necessary. As the noble Lord will be aware, Sections 5 to 7
of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 already require local authorities
and the police to co-operate with each other and other local agencies
in formulating and implementing strategies to reduce crime and
disorder. The noble Baroness, Lady Smith, is absolutely right. The
Government expect local authorities and the police to co-operate
together. The formulation and implementation of those strategies would
manifestly include a consideration of anti-social behaviour. I am sure

I will repeat the point that I made in Committee. The election of
police and crime commissioners put the public back at the heart of our
drive to cut crime, thereby giving them a greater say in how their

out for the record the Government’s commitment that the use of
the powers under the terms of the Bill should be very much part of
local planning in terms of the preparation and delivery of community
safety plans and in terms of police and crime commissioners setting out
their objectives. The reality is that most police and crime
commissioners have said, “Yes, this is one of our
priorities”. They have not—partly, of course, because the
legislation has not been passed—specified exactly how they
intend to approach these issues. But of course, at the moment, there is

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:30:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, in the
absence of the noble Viscount, Lord Astor, I speak to this amendment,
which is not brief but is logical. I hope I can persuade others it is
logical that when we extend the area of tax we expect to online
betting, with it the levy should benefit accordingly from the benefits
that the bookmakers get from their increase in betting online. Noble
Lords will realise that the levy fall has had a grave effect on the
finances of racing. Among the causes of the fall has been the move to
online betting by people who back horses and the fact that no levy
comes from that source. There are all kinds of other reasons why the
levy contribution has fallen. As regards the popularity of betting on
horses, since the 1960s when the law effectively changed to introduce
betting shops and so on, the fall has been gradual but the amount of
betting has not in any way declined. It has just been spread over a
wider area of gambling opportunities and is not likely to change
favourably for racing in the foreseeable
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:32:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consider the logic of what I am saying. If the bookmakers find this
unappetising and unacceptable, I suggest they realise that racing is
threatened. The sport has existed in the form we know basically from
the early 18th century. It has a worldwide reputation and its brand is
unequalled. We really cannot afford that to change because bookmakers
do not feel that they should contribute towards the sport from which
they profit. I do not want to get any more e-mails from bookmakers,
which I expect noble Lords also have been getting, saying how lovely
betting shops are with their daffodils and how they are places where
you can take children. Of course they are not like that.</hs_para>

we all know, in those shops there are four gaming machines. They are
called fixed-odds betting terminals, which is a euphemism and nobody
understands what it means. They are casino machines. You can play
poker, blackjack and so on. In most betting shops, they are a main
contributor, if not the major contributor, to the bottom line of the
bookmakers’
accounts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:34:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

rude about bookmakers. I did that once in the House. It was covered by
what I can only call a pornographic newspaper, the <I>Daily Sport</I>.
I had the privilege of removing the ladies in compromising positions on
the front of the <I>Daily Sport</I> to find that my face was very large
on the front of the paper under a heavy headline saying, “Falk
Off!”. I have to tell you that that newspaper is displayed in a
prominent place in my
house<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:35:06"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
if noble Lords will allow me, I will say to the bookmakers through this
Committee that if they do not play ball on this we will take away the
machines—simple as that. The previous Government did not seem
keen even on looking at the machines although, in opposition, most of
the complaints about betting machines come from the Labour
Party—I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara,
will take note of this—and I agree with them. It is no good the
bookmakers saying that there is no danger to people who go into betting
shops in terms of social damage from increasing their gambling habit.
It is a fact that it does that, but the bookmakers deny
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:36:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

quite some time before we get those machines removed. I see no evidence
of movement on that; other noble Lords may be able to disabuse me of
that. If the bookmakers do not play ball now, such is the threat to
racing that we have to find ways of putting pressure on. Maybe they
have suddenly had a change of heart. If they agree that they should pay
a levy online, we will have to find other ways, but if they do not
agree we should consider asking the Government to tell them that the
machines will be removed—simple as
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:36:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Others may

amendment is about. I hope that the Government can make an encouraging
response, because the other day we all had the benefit of listening to
the new head of the horseracing authority. I was impressed by his
general approach. His is a fresh look at racing, because he comes from
outside it. He made this important point about this wonderful sport
that we have exported to the rest of the world: what other activity is
there, half of which is extremely profitable, in this case the breeding
industry and the bloodstock agency in particular, and the other half of
which—the 
<?notus-xml column=55?>racecourses and the people who work in the racing industry—is
having a very bad time? It is about time that the Government took
steps—many of us are keen to work with them and talk to them,
together with the horseracing authority—on how they can get a
balanced view of that and get racing back into the position where it

Lipsey (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, nobody is going to tell the noble
Viscount, Lord Falkland, to “Falk off” this afternoon

unconscious on the sidewalk and rushes up to offer it mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation. In that way, he offers the Committee a chance to discuss
the levy and its future; I, among others, am grateful for that.
However, I cannot support his amendment, and I am afraid that I am

shall start at the technical end. It is not clear that the amendment
would not constitute state aid in European terms, and state aid that
would not be allowed. The recent French judgment on state aid has been
much misunderstood. The Commission did not rule that the activities of
the pari-mutuel in France were not state aid. It did rule, however,
that it was legitimate state aid. What we have yet to determine is
whether a similar ruling would apply were we to extend the levy in
Britain, in the way that this suggests, to overseas betting. That
judgment needs to be studied carefully and the views of the Commission
need to be sought. It would be premature—indeed, I would say
provocative—to seek to advance at this stage. On those minimal
technical terms alone, I would not support the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:40:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000011">A
broader question is going to constitute the majority of my remarks. The
Government have for some time been looking, and still are, at the
future of the levy. There are all sorts of notions about the levy, from
the kind of notion put forward by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland,
that we should extend its scope to the whole question of a sporting
levy in general for sporting betting rights, to, at the other
extent—and I am about to expand on this—the abolition of
the levy. All these options are rightly open at the moment and still
being reviewed. The Government have lurched to and fro for rather a
long time on this, and changes in Ministers have meant changes of
attitude. This is certainly not something that we should rush into. The
levy has been about for 50 years, and for most of that time it has
served its purpose. We ought not to go into a decision about its
long-term future without careful reflection and analysis of the
alternatives.</hs_para>

said that, I make it clear that I am in favour of the abolition of the
levy. I have been for 25 years. I first wrote a leader on this subject
in the <I>Times</I> in 1991 or 1992, and I have consistently never
changed my mind about it. The only thing is that in those days, and
indeed when I came into this House, I was in a minority of one. There
really was not anyone else, in this House or another place, who
favoured the abolition of the levy. That is not so today. Some of the
most knowledgeable people about racing in the House of Commons take the
view that the levy should go. I think of Mr Robertson, the chairman of
the horseracing, betting and levy group, and Philip Davies. These are 
<?notus-xml column=56?>all opponents of the levy. They may or may not be right—indeed, I
may or may not be right—but they have a view that ought to be
carefully weighed.</hs_para>

am an opponent of the levy for two sets of reasons, and they consist of
being an economist and a socialist. The two do go together—in
some people’s minds, anyway. First of all, I shall expand on the
economic case. Throughout the world, including in a lot of countries
that were once communist, there is now a strong understanding of how
very bad subsidies are for industries. When I look at racing, I do not
see an industry that has been brought low because it has not had enough
subsidy; I see an industry many of whose flaws stem from the subsidy
that has meant that every time, instead of sorting out the fundamental
problems of the industry, people have asked someone else to pay for
them through the levy. For years we have had a situation where the
bookmakers and racing were at loggerheads, because racing was seeking
more money out of the bookmakers and the bookmakers were seeking not to
give it to them, when they should have been working together to grow
the size of the cake by looking to their mutual interests and advancing
those.</hs_para>

multiyear settlement this year was a tremendous step forward, and the
great improvement in the climate of relations between bookmaking and
racing is also an extraordinarily encouraging development. I hope,
however, that it could go still further: I hope that within a year or
two the levy will simply seem to be an unnecessary mechanism. I am
certain that no one would cheer louder in that case than Her
Majesty’s Government. An absurd situation has arisen in recent
years where at midnight one night negotiations break down and a
Minister of the Crown is asked to decide how much money one industry
should give to another in subsidy. That beggars the imagination. If
anything other than racing were involved, it would be recognised that
it beggars the
imagination<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011479000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000095">3.45

went, many of the other restrictive practices that bedevil racing would
go. One example is the ban on artificial insemination of horses. In
greyhound racing, which I used to have the pleasure of running,
artificial insemination is taken for granted. In harness
racing—I am president of the British Harness Racing
Club—artificial insemination is universal, because it keeps the
price of horses down and makes the racing industry viable at much lower
prices. However, that restrictive practice, which suits a certain
number of high-level breeders extremely well, persists in horseracing.
I do not say that it would be easy to get rid of it, but it is the kind

the idea that the lack of a levy—and in particular the lack of
levy support for prize money—is bringing racing to its knees is
a total nonsense. I went to the opening meeting at Cocklebarrow, the
new Heythrop point-to-point course near Northleach, on Sunday, to watch
my two horses get pulled up. There is virtually no levy support for
point-to-point racing, and none at all for prize money. If you were
racing that day, the top prize was £500, which is very unusual,
as it is usually £200. There were 234 entries for the 
<?notus-xml column=57?>seven races; they had to be divided. We started at 11 am and
never stopped racing all day. That was not because people were in it
for the money but because they were in it for the glorious sport of
watching those horses racing.</hs_para>

horseracing in general, the standard of point-to-point racing has gone

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:47:19"></hs_TimeCode> standard of

levy; greyhound racing has a certain amount of levy support, but it is
a voluntary levy and therefore more akin to a commercial transaction
than anything else. Therefore the idea that racing would come to an end

can speak as an economist in this House with perhaps more confidence
than as a socialist, because I know that most Members of this House are
not socialists. I have one other great problem with the levy. I simply
cannot understand—it is beyond the life of me to do
so—why poor people who like a bet on a horse should have to
subsidise the hobby of rich people, like myself, who like to keep a
horse. That is the most extraordinary reverse redistribution from the
poorer to the richer, and it is wholly

would I like to see in its place? Obviously, in order to retain its
profitable interest in horseracing the bookmaking industry needs a
largish number of horseraces to be run each year. The suppliers of that
racing are, essentially, racecourses, which in turn subcontract the
provision of horses to owners and trainers to run in those races.
Essentially, therefore, what we need is simply a commercial agreement,
whereby both parties seek to maximise their revenue and the bookmakers
offer the racecourses the amount of money that is required to get the
sort of number of races that they think will be profitable for them.
The racecourses then take into account that income, together with the
income they take at the gate in deciding what to put on; negotiation
takes place and a sum is found. That might be a greater or a lesser sum
than at the moment; it is very unpredictable where a free market would
end up on that. However, it is perfectly clear that this is a
free-market arrangement done on decent market principles, and that it
would not be a compulsory levy on punters to subsidise the pastime of
the
better-off.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000020">I

there to be 100% support—I should be delighted if the Minister

would immediately ensure that it happened—but I do expect a
proper analysis to take place. That should not be dominated by the
interests involved—not by the bookmaking industry, not by the
racing industry and not by owners or trainers—but should take
place in a cool, calm economic framework designed to reach a cool, calm
economic outcome that is in the interests of everyone. That would be a

a product which is used by bookmakers and all we ask is that they
contribute for that product. Racing has to be co-ordinated centrally,
or else we would all race on one day and there would be no racing on a

I think that it was the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, who summed it up
best by saying, “Well, since this amendment probably cannot be
included in the Bill, could at least powers be taken in this
Bill?”. The significance of that is that any reform of the levy

heard that the Government still had anxieties—the noble Lord,
Lord Lipsey, referred to this—about state aid, which may well be
the case. I think that there was also a feeling that this was not
entirely the appropriate Bill for this kind of amendment. Although the
Treasury is very keen to reclaim leaked taxation, I think that the
Government understood that we are also very keen to retrieve some of
our leaked revenue. I therefore ask the Minister, since this is a
probably a probing amendment, whether there would be a possibility of
the Government bringing forward their own amendment if this one was not

Collins of Highbury (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name
to this amendment, which is a reflection of cross-party support for the
levy and the principles that underpin it, even if there is not exactly
unity on it within one party. Its purpose is to capture the revenue
that racing should be paid, as Parliament has already determined, from
all betting operators who take online and telephone bets on British
racing, wherever they 
<?notus-xml column=59?>are located—in effect, to secure levy payments from exactly those
operators whom this Bill brings within the remit of the UK tax regime,
as we have heard, and who will have to have a Gambling Commission
licence in order to be allowed to continue to operate in the British
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000027">I do
not want to repeat all the reasons why there has been a fall in the
value of the levy; we have heard them already in the debate. But this
change in arrangements could be worth up to £20 million a year
to British horseracing and, in my humble opinion, would lead to a
healthier sport, more investment, growth and jobs.</hs_para>

ideological arguments today and I am impressed by them, but too often
people focus on the prize money, which of course is substantial.
However, there is other work that the levy provides and the board
distributes, such as training, education and employment initiatives,
which are key to the sport retaining its integrity and developing. Nor
do people see the broader picture of how the racing industry has a
direct link to building sustainable rural economies. In the past, as a
socialist, I have been very keen to support training levies and to
ensure that the small firm is able to benefit from the overall
expansion of training and education.</hs_para>

create a level playing field among all betting operators. Why should
onshore betting operators and those in betting shops pay the full levy
while others based overseas, which do not have a voluntary agreement
with British racing, do not pay a penny? This unfairly distorts
competition. It is not the free market that we are talking about. I
understand the frustration for racing of seeing the Government now
acting to require overseas betting operators to comply with Gambling
Commission regulation, to pay the social responsibility levy and
subsequently to pay tax. The only area not to be harmonised
is for them to pay the levy, which Parliament has already decreed they
should. Perhaps the Minister can explain why the Government have not
seen fit to act further and faster for racing.</hs_para>

any provision in relation to racing or the horserace betting levy,
meaning that the sport will not receive a return from remote betting
activity even once it is licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. We
have heard the very persuasive argument from my noble friend that any
reform to the levy to capture revenues under a point-of-consumption
licensing regime would constitute state aid. He and I know that the
British racing industry strongly disagrees with this interpretation

the industry.</hs_para>

made reference to what I believe is a comprehensive ruling on this by
the European Commission. A French parafiscal levy on online horserace

my noble friend, I am sure that the Minister may want to look at a more
modern and commercial framework for the levy in the long term.
Certainly, we have had many serious reviews of it, but very little 
<?notus-xml column=60?>progress. I know that the racing industry itself would support
that—not just the owners, but the workers in the industry, who
for a long time I have worked to support. Therefore, will the Minister
reassure noble Lords and the racing industry that we are not going to
wait several more years during which the racing industry will continue
to lose out on this vital source of income—as I said at the

there is a strong argument for further consultation—I hear the

people employed in an industry. There is no doubt that the rise in
betting operators licensed offshore over the years has contributed to a
fall in revenue from the levy of about half between 2003 and

horserace betting operators was a state aid compatible with the state
aid rules. That confirms the Government’s position that the UK
levy also is a state aid. Any substantive alteration to an existing
state aid requires approval by the European Commission. The French
decision does not mean that the UK would not have to seek separate
approval for a substantive change to the existing system. Indeed, the
French had to make changes to the proposal they originally notified to
the Commission in order to gain its approval. As I have said before,

move on to levy reform. I am particularly mindful of what the noble
Lord, Lord Collins of Highbury, said about many of the other activities
of the levy board. Training is one that I know something about. The
recent figures published by the Horserace Betting Levy Board indicate
that levy yields, including voluntary contributions from bookmakers,
will rise in the next two years from £74.4 million in 2012-13 to
an estimated £75.6 million in 2013-14 and an estimated
£80.2 million in 2014-15. That is clearly good news—I
think that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, described it as
encouraging—but it does not mean that the Government are kicking
levy reform into the long grass. The Government have said that they
would like to see the levy replaced by a more commercial arrangement
between racing and betting, but a workable replacement that is fair,
sustainable, enforceable and legally sound has yet to emerge.

agreeable way, and I understand exactly what he is saying. Of course
the amendment is probing. The Bill is primarily about taxation but
gives us a good opportunity to discuss a number of matters that I
imagine will have roughly the same kind of reaction from the Minister
when he comes to them. So we are grateful for this assurance that the

Lord, Lord Lipsey, made an interesting speech—interesting in
that he declared that he was not a socialist, which I am rather
disappointed about, as I like to count him among my socialist friends
in the House. In a way that rather accords with that, he has a sort of
reactionary view of prize money. I remember years ago when we had a
debate in your Lordships’ House—he may remember it; I am
sure that he was there—and the Duke of Devonshire and I sat on
the same Bench. He is a close relative of my noble friend Lord
Cavendish of Furness, from a notable Whig family. He said, when we were
discussing prize money, “I don’t know what all this prize
money means to a lot of rich people who own racehorses. I own
racehorses and am also a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, but I
don’t expect people to pay for my sails”. That was his
view. His son, who was in the Gallery, and who later played a prominent
part in various changes in racing, went puce—I turned round to
watch him.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011479000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000053">I
say to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:19:46"></hs_TimeCode> the noble
Lord, Lord Lipsey, as I would have said privately to the Duke, that of
course racing was originally the sport of a number of very rich men,
many of whom had made money in the plantations in Jamaica and
elsewhere, who had bought land and wanted to breed horses and compete
with their horses. They did not care terribly about prize
money—they had matches with one another, but it was not a
factor. However, when horseracing got taken up in the 19th century as a
sport which engaged with ordinary people who wanted to bet on horses
and with ordinary people 
<?notus-xml column=64?>who made some money and wanted to own horses, of course they did not
have those resources. Nowadays a large part of ownership consists of
groups of people who go together. In fact, the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey,
and I were in a syndicate and owned a horse together—an
unfortunate horse who did not live to fulfil his full potential.
However, I am quite sure that the noble Lord will agree with me that
unless prize money had been available, three of us in your
Lordships’ House would not have gone into that
agreement.</hs_para>

frankly, owning a racehorse is an expensive business. However, as the
noble Lord, Lord Collins, said, there is a lot more to it than that.
Nowadays you need prize money to pay for all the things that surround
racing. For instance, stable staff have to be looked after and paid a
decent wage, trainers have to be able to survive, and so on, and they
can do that only through prize money. Therefore times have changed. I
do not know why the noble Lord should be so deeply immersed in the idea
that prize money is wrong—although as a non-socialist, I can
understand. Are we to deprive all those people of owning horses? They
do not get very much back for owning their horses; they seem to get
pleasure from losing all that money. I suppose that trainers get some
benefit—certainly the people who transport horses around do.
Will he deprive everybody in the modern world of having a chance to
take part in racing, when the only way they can do it is through an
improvement in prize
money<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:18:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lipsey" PimsId="1516" UID="14011479000112" xid="1316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000112">Lord
Lipsey:</Member></B> I am sorry to interrupt the noble Viscount,
especially as his point about the yacht-owning, horse-owning aristocrat
made my point so much more eloquently than I did myself. Perhaps he has
not entirely followed the full detail of my argument. I spoke as a
socialist, not as a non-socialist—I am so sorry to disappoint
him. I would have bought my share in Robber Baron had there been no
prize money, just as willingly as I did when there was prize money.
Anyway, we did not get anywhere near that prize money very often. I
suggest not for one second that there should not be prize money, but
that it should come about as a result of the commercial business of
racing, supported by the bookmakers for commercial purposes, not by a
compulsory tax on poor betting-shop
customers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000056"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:19:44"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Falkland" PimsId="3181" UID="14011479000113" xid="1668" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000113">Viscount

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, under existing regulations,
onshore casino operators can and do hold remote licences, which permit
them to advertise their online products in their casinos. However,
those licences do not allow operators to indicate that the product is
available from any internet-linked computer within their casino or
advertise their online site on or around a computer with internet
access supplied by the operator. In other words, it is currently
illegal for a casino to offer a customer access to its own legitimate
online business if the customer is inside its bricks-and-mortar
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000059">Therefore,
there is the anomalous situation that a customer is currently able to
bring their own internet access device—iPad or
smartphone—into a casino and play online, perhaps even on the
casino’s own online site, but the operator is not able to offer
that facility. It is totally illogical that the most rigorously
controlled premises, intended by statute to be at the top of the
regulatory pyramid, are not permitted the most up-to-date technological
products.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000060">The
industry asserts that the opportunity to undertake research and player
protection would be lost if the product were not to be available in
terrestrial casinos, which are required by law to have the most
rigorous control measures. It points out that all casino gaming staff
are licensed by the Gambling Commission; that all staff, including all
food and beverage and administration personnel, are trained annually in
responsible gambling practices; and that effective policies are in
place to protect the young and the
vulnerable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000061">A
UK terrestrial casino provides the only environment where online play
could be monitored, observed and researched. During pre-legislative

the proceedings in the Commons and the responses of the Minister, Helen
Grant, it appears that the Government have it in mind to allow this but
only by means of secondary legislation. This route seeks to categorise
an internet access device as a gaming machine, perhaps a category A
machine, if it is offered for use in a casino. That would mean that
someone playing in the bar on their own iPad was not playing a gaming
machine but someone playing a device offered by the casino
was.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011479000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000063">If an
internet access device is categorised as a gaming machine in these
circumstances, it would become subject to machine technical standards

<?notus-xml column=66?>These detailed regulations would overlay conditions as to how the device
could be played in the casino that might be entirely different from
those applied elsewhere. The outcome could be that a player accessing
his or her online account from different devices with different IP
addresses—one provided by the operator on the gaming floor in
the casino, and their own device—might face different conditions
of play. Customers would be able to use their own devices without
restriction. This would be confusing for the consumer and unnecessarily
bureaucratic, and does not meet either the industry’s
aspirations or any measure of common
sense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000064">The
Minister in the Commons told both the CMS Committee and the House that
she was confident that secondary legislation would give the industry
what it wanted. But as can be seen, that is far from the case. By
contrast, Amendment 2 clarifies that a remote gambling terminal
provided in a casino is not a gaming machine, and provides for the
Secretary of State to be able to make regulations setting the maximum
number of such terminals which may be made available in a casino. This
would allow the UK onshore casino sector to provide its customers with
the same online gambling experience as the online sector. The devices
would not be one-armed bandits; there would be no means of putting
money into them; and a player would simply log on to an existing
account or create a new one. That is a simple and transparent solution.
The products that the casinos seek to offer through this amendment are
not slot machines; the look or feel of British casinos would not
fundamentally change.</hs_para>

18 years of age and ensuring that players were not
“vulnerable” within the meaning of Section 1 of the 2005
Act. Players would benefit from the industry’s commitment to
player protection, outlined in the playing safe statement of
principles. The area concerned would be supervised by trained and
licensed casino staff and be subject to casino surveillance measures.
Social responsibility information would be available in accordance with
guidelines. The terminals would be under the supervision of trained and

Gambling Act 2005, which, as our founding document, has formed part of
a lot of the discussion that we have had today, was very good and well
respected for being what it is, but unfortunately technology has moved
on and one therefore needs to think again about some of the regulatory
arrangements.</hs_para>

seemed to me that my good friend the noble Lord who moved the amendment
was trying to lay a somewhat philosophical conundrum before us about
whether or not, if you were in a place such as a casino but playing
online on your own iPad, you would be in some way susceptible to the
same sort of regulatory environment as you would be had you been
playing on a machine, probably with the same internal workings and
connections, supplied by a third party—presumably a casino. When
the Minister comes to reply, I wonder whether he can be clear about
where he thinks that we have got to in this process. I can think of
many bad things we could do in reviewing the Bill, but the one thing we
should try to do in this area is not to anticipate where technology
might be taking us on this matter. We are at a point where things may

Clement-Jones for his amendment. The argument has been made that if
remote gambling can be played on portable devices in bedrooms and on
trains, why can it not in the well regulated environment of casinos?
Such devices can already be played in casinos and can indeed be, and
already are, offered by casinos to customers, but within the
limits of machine stakes and prize regulations. The debate
is therefore about the ability of casinos to promote and encourage the
use of their own devices outside of those
controls.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000075">Where<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:32:50"></hs_TimeCode>
casinos are promoting and encouraging gambling services to be
undertaken on their own premises, the Government remain of the opinion
that it is right to consider potential flexibility within the structure
of existing machine stakes and prize regulations. The amendment would
remove those controls, leaving those devices outside the existing stake
and prize framework. That would be a potentially considerable
relaxation of machine gaming policy if it were not addressed most
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011479000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011479000076">Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:33:22"></hs_TimeCode>

which will more than double the maximum stake for category B1 gaming
machines, which are only available in casinos, from £2 to
£5, and the maximum prize from £4,000 to £10,000
on a single machine. Casinos will also be able to offer a linked
progressive jackpot of up to £20,000. These changes were
predicated on commitments the casino industry has made in relation to
player protections. The Government would like to assess the
effectiveness of these player protection measures, and consider the
issues of gaming machines and remote gambling provisions in casinos
more generally, before considering any further changes. I can confirm
that any legislative changes could be via secondary
legislation.</hs_para>

current discussions. The big issue is that they will not conclude until
the end of March, and I suspect that this Bill will be well gone from
this House by the end of March. Therefore, I urge the Minister to take
reserve powers in this Bill to do what he expects to agree to, probably
by the end of March—that would be a very satisfactory

reality of problem gambling is that it is a terrible blight on our
society. The 2010 UK problem prevalence figure demonstrates a problem
gambling figure of 0.9%, which may not sound very much on one level but
equates to 461,000 people. However, to really understand the challenge,
we need to remember that the actual figure is much larger if one
includes the families who are associated with this problem. Indeed, in
2012, the Gordon Moody Association, which treats the most serious
addicts, estimated that each
addict,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14011494000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011494000053">“will

course, we have to understand that gambling online has a significantly
higher problem prevalence figure than gambling generally. Far from
being 0.9%, the problem prevalence figure for online slot machines was
actually over 9%, rising to over 17% on a monthly basis.</hs_parafo>

that a perceived drop in problem prevalence figures associated with the
<I>Health Survey for England</I> is currently being used by some to
mitigate the sense of urgency for implementing stronger social
responsibility mechanisms. Lest anyone here should be attracted by such
arguments, I will make three brief points. First, the <I>Health Survey
for England</I> itself acknowledges that health surveys tend to report
lower gambling problem prevalence figures than dedicated problem
gambling research. Indeed, I understand that there was a relatively low
response to the gambling section of the
survey.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011494000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011494000004">Secondly,
notwithstanding the perceived lower overall gambling prevalence figure,
that number does not tell us much at all in relation to this Bill. The
Bill is about online gambling rather than gambling in general. What the
<I>Health Survey</I><I> for</I><I> England</I> results do tell us is
that problem gambling is particularly associated with young men aged
between 16 and 24, an age group noble Lords will no doubt associate
with mobile phone apps and the use of the internet. The health survey
says:</hs_para>

16-24, 11.7% were classified as low risk gamblers and a further 3.2% as
moderate risk gamblers … When combined with problem gambling
rates, 16.6% of men aged 16-24 experienced some type of difficulty with
their gambling behaviour in the last

the point should be made that you cannot compare the UK problem
prevalence figures with the results of <I>Health Survey</I><I>
for</I><I> England</I> questions on gambling, not least because they do
not include the results from the equivalent <I>Scottish Health
Survey</I> or figures for Wales and my very own Northern Ireland.
Moreover, even if there was a drop in problem gambling of a few per
cent from 461,000, it would still leave hundreds of thousands in need

making this point, I think particularly of the two cases that the noble
Lord, Lord Morrow, mentioned at Second Reading: Lisa Carville, the
accountant from Northern Ireland who stole £50,000 to feed her
online gambling habit between March 2010 and September 2012; and
Michael Garner, the financial adviser who stole almost £1
million from friends, a charity and investors to feed his online
gambling habit between December 2011 and May
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011494000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011494000007">Having
made these important introductory remarks about the sad reality of
problem gambling, I now turn to self-exclusion. The principle of
self-exclusion is not one that I have dreamt up. It is standard that is
widely recognised, not least by the Gambling Commission codes for the
purpose of helping problem gamblers and those who feel they are at risk
of becoming problem gamblers. Put very simply, on a strong day someone
who recognises that they have a problem, or are in danger of developing
a problem, can visit each of the betting shops in their
town—perhaps up to four or five—and self-exclude for a
fixed period of time, such as six months. During that period the
betting shops in question are not permitted to serve them.</hs_para>

the problem gambler will effectively cut themselves off from the
opportunity of terrestrial gambling in their home town for six months,
during which time they can get help and try to put their lives back
together. The problem with this protection from the perspective of
today’s debate is that although online problem gamblers can
self-exclude from an online provider, self-exclusion does not provide
them with comparable assistance because it cannot cut them off from
online gambling opportunities. They can self-exclude from four gambling
websites, but there will still be hundreds if not thousands of online
gambling providers that they can access without even having to leave
the comfort of their own home. The reality of this failure is
particularly problematic as online problem gambling has a higher
problem prevalence figure than gambling generally. It is extremely
ironic that in this context, where it is needed most badly,
self-exclusion is most ineffective.</hs_para>

rather than trying to self-exclude from the hundreds if not thousands
of online gambling websites that are out there, online problem gamblers

<?notus-xml column=72?>should simply have to register their self-exclusion with the Gambling
Commission. Any holder of a UK Gambling Commission licence should then

in another place, the Minister did not appear to have any real
arguments against implementation apart from the fact that it was
complicated and she wanted to give the industry more
time—although more time for what was not entirely clear. At
Second Reading in your Lordships’ House the Minister also
mentioned that implementing such a solution would be complicated. In my
experience, most worthwhile endeavours require hard work. I am not
suggesting that setting up such a system would be a walk in the park,

argues that the technology is available and points to its feasibility,
particularly in the UK due to the current existing licence conditions
and code of conduct upheld by the UK Gambling Commission. In
demonstrating that a one-stop-shop facility is technologically entirely
possible, Gainsbury highlights a programme called VeriPlay.com,
developed by Bet Buddy, which allows the secure exchange of anonymous
data. It enables operators to check whether a player is on a
centralised list of players who have self-excluded. Gainsbury also
argues that collaborative efforts would help to strengthen
self-exclusion. Moreover, research presented to the Canadian-based
Responsible Gambling Council in 2011 by the British-based GamCare and
the University of Salford, along with Bet Buddy, endorses the
proposal.</hs_parafo>

have been informed that both the industry and officials see no reason
in principle why we should not embark upon such a project, nor why it

treatment meted out to online problem gamblers compared with that
afforded to terrestrial gamblers is justified, because it is not
possible to provide online problem gamblers with as robust a form of
self-exclusion as that enjoyed by online terrestrial gamblers. That
would constitute a legitimate defence if it was true but, as we have
seen, it is not. In a context where we have the capacity to deliver
online problem gamblers an equally credible form of self-exclusion to
that afforded to terrestrial problem gamblers but choose not to, we
practice discrimination. In this context, the basic question that we

Bill did not exist. The presence of the Bill, however, greatly
compounds the already powerful imperative for action such that, to my
mind, rejecting Amendment 3 is frankly unthinkable. First, and most
importantly, the Bill would widen the scope for online gambling
advertising. At present, only online 
<?notus-xml column=73?>gambling providers located in the European Economic Area and whitelisted
jurisdictions can advertise in the United Kingdom. Under the terms of
the Bill, the scope of gambling advertising will extend to any
provider in any jurisdiction, so long as they have a UK
Gambling Commission licence. The Bill would widen the scope for making
people in the UK, including all the problem gamblers, more aware of
online gambling opportunities—a form of gambling which, as we
have seen, has a higher prevalence of
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:00:46"></hs_TimeCode>. To me

doing such a thing without, at the same time, equipping online problem

telling the Committee this because I think that the statistics are
nonsense. The statistics are given to us by the Government, and they
were given to us by the previous Government. I spoke to the Minister in
charge and told him—which he agreed with; I was quite persuasive
on that occasion—“What you are giving us is a figure
which represents the number of people who are in treatment for a

think that self-exclusion, whether it is online or terrestrial, is
generally the answer. Self-exclusion is rather like dieting. You can
tell your wife not to buy any more ginger biscuits for six months and
to stop you when you go to take double portions of a rather fattening
dinner, but when she stops doing that you just go back. That is a
characteristic of dieting. It is characteristic of heavy 
<?notus-xml column=74?>social drinking. You can stop it during Lent or make up your mind to
stop drinking for a while but inevitably you go back. That is
self-exclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:04:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011494000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011494000018">A
self-exclusion agreement with an online company, a casino or anywhere
else is the same. When the pre-legislative scrutiny committee went to
France, it discussed this. France has tried self-exclusion in casinos
and there is the same problem. A gambler, drinker or eater with a
serious addiction can have a sincere wish one day to change their life
but, unless they get proper treatment and get to grips with the
problem, they will just go back to it. As I have said, a huge number of
young men go to betting shops, for example. I have rather condemned the
fixed-odds betting terminals to which these young men get addicted, as
well as to all other kinds of betting. Often, they are young married
men with small children. We got evidence of that on the pre-legislative
scrutiny committee when we spoke to GamCare. Some young men have
exactly the same characteristics in their addiction to gambling as
people have with drugs or
drink<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:06:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:06:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011494000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#14011494000019">In
a way, it happened to me, although it was not serious. I would say to
my wife that I was going somewhere I was not going and I was going to a
casino. That is what happens. You deceive yourself and other people.
Self-exclusion may well play a useful part for some of the gambling
population. However, the Government have to accept that the statistic
they brandish and boast about as regards having one of the lowest
levels of incidence of gambling in Europe—I think that that is
the way in which it is phrased—is not true because they do not
know about the vast bottom of the iceberg and the vulnerability of
people. Fundamentally, before you get to the business of self-exclusion
and other things, you have to recognise that some people have problems.
They need to find a way of stopping their denial of their problems. It
is not easy and I do not expect the Minister to give us much
encouragement on this issue.</hs_para>

shoplifting to feed their habit. I am very sympathetic to the concern
of the noble Lord, Lord Browne, about gambling and he is quite right to
be concerned about it, as should we all. However, we have to be able to
detect it sooner. Families should be able to detect it from behaviour,
as do the online companies. At Second Reading, I said that I am quite
encouraged by online companies. They take great efforts to detect the
behaviour of people, as now do, I think, casinos. They step in and say,

deep problem. If you want to stop it or to reduce it, you cannot mess
about with it. You must be prepared to spend money and resources on it,
as we do with any other addiction, and take strong measures. There is
nothing much that you can do about the real addicts except to get them
into GamCare or Gamblers Anonymous. I know someone in treatment at the
moment. I think I said at Second Reading that he told me that all the

self-exclusion once to the Gambling Commission and all Gambling

criticism and, where necessary, a pinch of salt. Our main source is of
course the Gambling Commission’s <I>British Gambling Prevalence
Survey</I>. I expect that this broadly measures the number of people
who participate in gambling. It is not a good source for finding out
about problem gambling for this reason. There are only 7,000 in the
sample and, of those, only a small number are problem gamblers. You are

that kind—this was essentially a telephone poll of the
population—are not very good sources for information on
something like gambling. As an analogy, we know that telephone surveys
of drinking show that people say that they drink half as much as they
actually do; it is quite easy to compare the two because we know how
much people actually drink by taking the total consumption of liquor in
the country and dividing it by the number of people. People halve the
amount; some of us probably do it when we see our doctors each year. In

distress and upset this causes to wider family members. That is why the

make a commitment to the identification and treatment of problem
gamblers, and set out how operators will contribute to this. The
Gambling Commission’s licence conditions and codes of practice
already include the requirement for each remote licensee to have, and
to put into effect, procedures for self-exclusion, which must include a
register of those excluded with appropriate records, and the removal of
access from those self-excluded persons found to have gambled or to
have attempted to gamble on the facilities. This recognises that
self-exclusion is an important tool for those individuals who have

registering players; the range of self-exclusion options offered by
different operators, which may vary in the length of time and range of

assess the most effective way of achieving a system for
self-exclusion.</hs_para>

Stevenson, rightly wanted to know the Government’s view. Work is
under way on reviewing the effectiveness of self-exclusion as a tool
for managing problem gambling. The Gambling Commission asked its expert
advisory body, the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board, to look at the
effectiveness of self-exclusion as a tool and how it could be improved.
Self-exclusion also forms part of the Responsible Gambling
Trust’s work programme, and they are due to report their
findings in March. Further steps will be developed once these findings
have been considered and the remote operators are brought within the
regulatory oversight of the Gambling Commission. The Remote Gambling
Association also convened an industry meeting in November 2013, and
this will be contributing to the process. What is more—and this
is crucial to the amendment—under the Gambling Act 2005 a
centralised self-exclusion system can be achieved in licensing
conditions and does not require further primary legislation. For that
reason, although I entirely understand the force of arguments about
problem gambling and our mutual desire to assist as much as possible, I
ask the noble Lord to withdraw his

it is the state, through legislation, that proposes that the scope for
British people, and therein all problem gamblers—I will not cite
any statistics at this stage—should be widened, that they should
be made more aware of types of gambling with a higher prevalence of
problems than gambling as a whole. It is therefore only right that the
state should, as a minimum, provide problem gamblers, through the same
legislation, with equal and opposite protection in the form of a
credible model of self-exclusion. To simply leave this to the industry
is not acceptable. I should say that I would welcome self-exclusion
from restaurants—it might help to improve my figure. I beg leave

Heyhoe Flint (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a probing amendment.
I fully support the general principles of the Bill. Not only will it
create a level playing field—if that is not a well worn
cliché in these surroundings—for all betting operators,
regardless of whether they are located in the UK or offshore, but it
will have a positive impact from a consumer protection perspective.
Crucially, it provides a huge boost to the integrity of sport.
Operators will be required to comply with the Gambling
Commission’s licence condition 15.1 on information sharing,
meaning that any suspicious betting patterns will have to be reported
to both the Gambling Commission and sports governing bodies. Given the
growing threat of match fixing and betting-related corruption, this is
a very welcome development. The Bill has been endorsed by all major
sports bodies in the UK, including the Sport and Recreation Alliance,
formerly the Central Council of Physical Recreation, and the England
and Wales Cricket Board, where I have to declare an interest, being on
its
board<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:25:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000003">Spread
betting is, for example, betting in what year England will next win a
test match in Australia between 2014 and 2018, although that might be
negated by the fact that the women actually won their test match
yesterday in Perth, and long may that continue. To be slightly more
serious, though, unfortunately the Bill fails to address the anomaly of
spread betting. While traditional betting operators are regulated by
the Gambling Commission, at present spread-betting operators are
regulated by the Financial Conduct Agency. However, the FCA regulations
do not contain an equivalent to Gambling Commission licence condition
15.1 on the sharing of suspicious information. The two companies that
currently offer spread betting on sport in the UK have voluntary
information-sharing agreements in place with the FCA, but
spread-betting companies in totality are under no binding legal
obligation to report suspicious activity. Herein lies the problem,
because there is no statutory obligation for spread-betting companies
to report suspicious activity. Sports bodies cannot be entirely
confident that they are receiving all the available intelligence about
suspected corrupt activity.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000004">Indeed, the weakness
of non-statutory agreements was highlighted by Jenny Williams from the
Gambling Commission during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage of the
Bill. Using the example of fixed-odds betting operators, she said that
the Gambling Commission received one or two reports of suspicion a
month from its online gambling licensees, who handled less than 20% of
the market, but that from the 80% licensed overseas, which had
voluntary agreements in place, 
<?notus-xml column=80?>the commission had received a total of about 10 since 2007. Jenny
Williams suggested that it was “implausible” that so few
suspicious transactions had been reported. That is one of the reasons
why the Bill is before this House; it clearly makes little sense to
introduce statutory arrangements for sports betting but not to do so
for spread betting on
sports<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000005">The
Government have assured us that the FCA is looking into the issue and,
in turn, the FCA has confirmed that it will be issuing new guidance for
spread betting. While this is a positive development, sports bodies are
not satisfied that the new arrangements will be directly comparable to,
or as effective as, the requirements set out for fixed-odds operators
under licence condition 15.1. Specifically, sport has ongoing concerns
over the quality of information that might eventually reach governing
bodies, and the speed with which it will be made available.
Furthermore, sports bodies are yet to receive confirmation on whether
the new FCA guidance will even be made publicly available for them to
see. Perhaps the Minister could offer some hope as to whether that
confirmation is imminent or
likely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000006">I
gather that the reason for the non-confirmation is that the FCA says
that its own statutes do not allow it to instruct spread-betting
companies to share information directly with sports governing bodies.
They also preclude it from publishing formal—on the
record—guidance. Those are major problems, which is why I have
tabled this amendment, for I feel that now we have the opportunity
before us, we must seek to correct the primary legislation and use
every weapon—or even cricket bat—at our disposal. As a
member of the ECB I know how vital it is that sports bodies receive
timely information when there is a betting concern, and that they do
not pick up that information from revelations in the national media. If
received in real time, this allows governing bodies such as us, the
ECB, to warn the umpires officiating and the players involved, which
acts as a great deterrent. I hope that all Members of the House will
support me in looking to give these powers to sports governing bodies
through the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:15:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140114109000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000227">5.30

points of concern that I have just highlighted were raised by the Sport
and Recreation Alliance and the England and Wales Cricket Board in a
meeting which I attended last week with my noble friend Lord Gardiner
and his officials. I sincerely thank them all for the time they spared
for us. He assured me that the department will look into these
lingering concerns and that it will
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:34:30"></hs_TimeCode> to work
with the FCA to ensure that the new guidance is as robust and effective
as possible. However, I urge my noble friend—and I know that the
DCMS Secretary of State takes this issue very seriously—that if
he really wants to address the highlighted problems, it would be of
enormous value to the integrity of sport to accept the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000008">The
easiest way to guarantee a level regulatory playing field between
traditional betting companies and spread-betting companies would be to
transfer responsibility for sports spread betting from the FCA to the
GC, which is what the amendment does. It is carefully
drafted—that sounds rather immodest, but it 
<?notus-xml column=81?>is—so that only sports spread betting is transferred and not the
wider spread-betting industry, which would create many administrative
difficulties. I therefore encourage my colleagues who believe in
integrity in sport, and indeed integrity in life, to support this
amendment for the reasons that I have set out. I beg to

Moynihan (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble
friend’s amendment. The amendment is important, because it goes
right to the heart of integrity in sport, and the fight against
irregular and illegal betting is critical if we are to maintain the
integrity of sport, on which all international sport and indeed all
sport depends. I declare an interest as a member of the working group
of the International Olympic Committee, which has sought to define a
common approach in the fight against irregular and illegal betting. The
work we have done was touched upon in a number of speeches made in
Grand Committee this afternoon, and fell into three distinct
areas.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000010">First<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is the importance of
education<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:33:07"></hs_TimeCode>, which
is critical. In the context of sport that means the education of the
athletes and the entourage around them, ensuring that they understand
the impact of betting and in some cases what they can and cannot bet
on. Secondly, it is vital to maintain the integrity of sport. We need
to monitor and have first-rate intelligence and analysis. The global
monitoring system that was introduced for the first time in London 2012
went a long way in the right direction, but we need to build on the
work that was done in London. The third area is legislation and
regulation. This legislation before us is important in that context. It
is important because, as my noble friend has pointed out, there is a
loophole here, which applies to sports and spread betting and which
needs to be closed through her amendment either now or subsequently, in
later consideration of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:34:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000011">In
the run-up to the Olympic Games in London 2012 it was interesting that
the president of the International Olympic Committee, at that time
Jacques Rogge, opined that the greatest threat to the Games in London
was illegal gaming. I take issue with that view, as I think the threat
of doping in sport is currently a greater threat. Nevertheless, he was
right that we need to be serious in our approach to suspicious betting
patterns. If that does not happen then we challenge the integrity of
sport, and that challenge will grow exponentially.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000012">It is
not just a matter of a small bet. I shall give the Committee an
example. If you are a young athlete in Africa and someone comes along
and says, “I’ll give you $10,000 if you come second or
third in the race”, and you know that in that heat you will
still manage to qualify for the final, then that $10,000 is a vast
amount of money. That sum can then be multiplied in bets that can be
made in the irregular markets and indeed in the legal markets, and they
require very close monitoring. It is that type of example that can
undermine sport and lead to widespread international movements of
illegal gaming, the kind of gaming that can corrupt young people and,
as in the amendment that we have just discussed, goes to the very heart
of the integrity of, in this case, my noble friend’s subject:
sport.</hs_para>

with the Gambling Commission’s licence condition 15.1 on
information sharing is a really important step forward and I hope it is
welcomed by all sides of the House, but it should be all-embracing
within the industry and we should not leave a loophole here when it
comes to sports spread betting. In this context, I strongly urge the
Government to continue to work with all members of the sports movement
to update their internal rules, to use legislation such as the Bill
before us to remove any loopholes that exist and, in the case of
government legislation, to ensure that we combat irregular and illegal
sports betting.</hs_para>

regulations, we need sanctions and we need to combat all forms of
cheating linked to sports betting, including spread betting. We
co-operated well for the first time in London and I think that all
those involved in that work, particularly within the IOC, can be proud
of the fact that there was greater co-operation than we have ever seen
at a sporting event. It was not just the UK experts who were brought
together; it was the industry, working with the United Nations Office
on Drugs and Crime, the UNODC, and of course Interpol was critically
important. This cannot be seen in the domestic or European context; it
has to be seen in a completely international one.</hs_para>

like to pick up on is around the sharing of information, which is
vital. Every time we see a story in the press about match fixing or
dishonourable behaviour, it affects the wider public perception of
sport and raises further doubts and gossip. Ultimately, it affects how
parents think about that sport and how they encourage their children to
be involved in it, and how people engage in that sport. It 
<?notus-xml column=83?>does a great disservice to the wonderful parts of sport that we all
know. I think that national governing bodies and international bodies
would welcome all the support and help that they can receive, not just
to tackle ongoing cases but to put measures in place for the future.
Governing bodies cannot always be two steps behind, as they are now.
With drug-testing in sport, much more information is shared and we are
able to look at it intelligently, to track patterns and see how we
tackle it. This is such an important issue that I hope that the noble

important of the amendments that we are discussing today, and it has
been good, but short, debate. At the heart of it is the concept of what
sport is and how we regard it. It is clear that it has to be fair
competition; it has to be between participants who are playing under
the same and agreed rules; and it is vital that all participants are
competing to win and not following some agenda and that the officials
are honest and are seen to be so. Therefore, there are a number of very
important moving parts in any event like this. Sport is important also,
as has been said, because it seems to be part of our culture,
particularly in Britain. It is important for how we stand in the world
and how we operate that our sports should be run effectively and are
above reproach and

that is to be the case, it falls to the governing bodies—the
international bodies, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord
Moynihan—to police what is happening and to make sure that
conduct is appropriate. This Bill is remote from that, because those
governing bodies have an unavoidable duty and should be held to task
for it. However, the growth in the number of betting services has meant
that there is a surrogate way of checking out what is happening on the
ground. Where strange events in betting are happening, which are often
seen, and when there are strange outcomes that can perhaps be looked at

need to make sure—and this is the point of the
amendments—that the structures of regulation match the
aspirations that we have for our sport and for those who operate within
it. It may well be true that match fixing is not the most important
threat facing sport—it was suggested that it is drugs—but
the points made by Jacques Rogge and the International Olympic
Committee are important in this context. In response to that, the DCMS
set up its own review, the Rick Parry review of sports betting
integrity, which suggested that a specific risk was posed to sports
integrity as a result of the current licensing regime. If that is the
case—and the Minister must speak his feelings about
it—surely the present situation does not match up to the
aspirations that we have for our sport. To split responsibilities for
spread betting from those of the Gambling Commission is clearly going
to lead to trouble. It is interesting that the three amendments in this
group give a range of options, a pick-and-mix, as to how to do it. One
could leave things as they are, with two bodies responsible, but it
would then be 
<?notus-xml column=84?>necessary for the Government to ensure that arrangements for
reporting—as picked up by the noble Baroness—were exactly
the same, so that both the Gambling Commission and the FCA could ensure
that irregular patterns were reported to the authorities as quickly as
possible. That would be one
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:43:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000022">The
second approach would be to make the Gambling Commission fully
responsible for all aspects of gambling activity, which would have a
clarity that is lacking in the present arrangements. In that way,
licence condition 15.1, which is generally accepted to be very good,
could be applied to all areas. In that situation—and this is the
third option—you could keep the general responsibilities for
spread betting within the FCA, but licence condition 15.1 in relation
to gambling operations would have effect within
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:44:01"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
therefore three options for the Minister to consider. It is important
that we get some clarity on this. If we cannot get some movement, we
will need to come back to the matter on Report and at later
stages<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:44:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:44:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

respond also on the question of whether we have sufficient legal power
to deal with match fixing? There is some concern that the UK does not
have a specific law to deal with the offence of cheating or match
fixing in sport. The current arrangements, set out in the Gambling Act
2005, were deficient in relation to the recent case of the Pakistani
bowlers; I defer to the noble Baroness, who is nodding vigorously, so
it seems I am correct on this. It seems perverse to have had this piece
of legislation in place and yet to have discovered that the way in
which they were eventually prosecuted was through the Fraud Act, not
the Gambling Act. This was clearly an offence in terms of match fixing.
If we do not have sufficiency in legislation, could we not take this
opportunity to bring ourselves up to date?</hs_para>

clear that all gambling operators, whether they provide spread betting
or fixed-odds betting services, should be subject to obligations to
report suspicious market activity of the sort which is set out in
licence condition 15.1. The Government confirmed in the other place
that the FCA would issue guidance to the sports spread-betting firms
operating 
<?notus-xml column=85?>in the United Kingdom regarding how they report suspicious betting
transactions under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. So far
as is possible, it will be aligned to those requirements on the
fixed-odds betting operators licensed by the Gambling Commission under
licence condition 15.1. This is an important development that will
strengthen the existing arrangements, and allow for greater consistency
in the way that suspicious activity is reported. I am pleased to be
able to confirm that work on this has been progressing. Officials from
the FCA met the representatives of sports governing bodies and the
Gambling Commission on 5 December 2013. The FCA is now in the process
of drafting the guidance, and I understand that it hopes to be in a
position to issue a draft to operators in early February. The
department will continue to explore the provision of draft guidance
with the
FCA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000028">Concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:47:34"></hs_TimeCode>
have been raised about whether compliance with the FCA guidance will be
just voluntary. Compliance will indeed not be voluntary. Real
consequences can flow from a failure to follow the guidance. Failure to
comply could result in the FCA determining an operator has breached FCA
rules, which would put the operator at risk of enforcement action by
the FCA. In parallel to the FCA guidance, the Gambling Commission has
just completed consulting on changing licence condition 15.1 to make it
clearer that the Gambling Commission expects operators to report all
information about suspicious betting patterns in its knowledge to the
Gambling Commission and sports governing bodies, whether or not those
occurred on their Gambling Commission-licensed bets. This would include
information about suspicious betting patterns in its spread-betting
operations. Those changes will be made as part of other changes being
made to the licence code and conditions in anticipation of the new
licensing
requirements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000029">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>
is an important part of the picture, because the vast majority of
sports spread betting is covered by the two operators that are also
licensed by the Gambling Commission for fixed-odds betting. The
commission has found the operators co-operative in responding to
inquires about spread betting on specific events, and willing to
volunteer such information. However, if contrary to the
commission’s experience of working with them, its licensees
breach the licence condition, it would be open to the commission to
consider an appropriate sanction, which can include financial penalty,
imposition of licence condition or, in extremis, licence revocation.
The commission therefore already has the powers suggested in Amendment
11.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000030">Amendment
12 raises the question of whether sports spread betting should be
transferred from the FCA to the Gambling Commission. As I have said,
the integrity of sport is absolutely paramount. The public has to be
confident that what they are seeing in front of them is true and fair.
However, the Government do not believe that at this stage there is a
case for fundamental change to the existing arrangements or that
non-legislative options for strengthening sports integrity have been
exhausted.</hs_para>

that the FCA regulates and supervises spread-betting firms more
generally, only two of the spread-betting operators relate to sport out
of 26. There are 
<?notus-xml column=86?>advantages to ensuring that responsibility for the regulation of sports
spread betting remains with the FCA, in that it allows for a consistent
approach to the regulation of all spread betting—both sports and
financial spread betting. The Government believe that that is the right
approach and that regulation of spread betting in all its forms should
remain with the FCA. Enshrining licence conditions in primary

understanding is that in response to proposals from the Council of

betting-related match fixing, already was covered adequately by
existing legislation. The “cheating at gambling” offence
under the Gambling Act 2005 is deliberately wide to extend its
applicability and we would not want to lose that flexibility.</hs_para>

taking action against illegal advertising will not prevent unregulated
providers accessing the UK market but will just prevent them from
advertising. Moreover, while the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport says that advertising is enough of an incentive for companies
outside the current whitelisted and EEA jurisdictions to apply for a UK
licence, that is an untested assumption. The current experience is that
providers located beyond whitelisted and EEA jurisdictions happily
access the UK market even though they cannot advertise. Our current law
has not prevented them from accessing our market. Is that not the
principal consumer safety argument for the Bill before us
today?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000042">As if
this was not enough, in a conversation I had with the industry last
week I heard that remote gambling customers are incredibly
price-sensitive and, in a very rapidly changing market, increasingly
find online comparisons of the odds available from providers much more
useful than advertising. Those customers do not rely on traditional
advertising to find the best 
<?notus-xml column=88?>odds but rather use price comparison websites and odds-checkers. This
development makes the Bill’s dependence on advertising even more
problematic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000043">Secondly,
while better player education is obviously fine, it is no substitute
for the state preventing unregulated online gambling providers getting
to UK consumers. We do not find the state relying on better education
in other areas to compensate for the lack of enforcement. Finally, we
come to the only mechanism of the three that really pertains to
preventing unlicensed operators accessing the UK market:
enforcement—namely, prosecution. However, by the
Government’s own admission, this is a deeply problematic
mechanism when having regard for a multiplicity of small providers
spread across the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000044">In its

the event of detecting an unlicensed operator believed to be actively
targeting British consumers, a straightforward test purchase exercise
would assist the Commission in determining whether an offence was being

right the department is. The truth is that large numbers of relatively
small online providers located beyond the UK make prosecution a
woefully inadequate mechanism for addressing the problem of unlicensed
operators accessing the UK market. The operators in question know that
the UK Government cannot possibly devote the necessary resources to
chasing them through the courts of foreign jurisdictions. They know
that the chances of them ever getting convicted are absolutely tiny,
and many will be quite happy to take any
risk.</hs_parafo><hs_time UID="140114109000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000229">6pm</hs_time><hs_para UID="140114109000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000046">None
of these provisions delivers credible enforcement in the sense of
protecting UK consumers from unlicensed providers accessing the UK
marketplace. In this context, the suggestion that the Bill is all about
consumer protection gets into real difficulty. It is just not credible
to argue that the Bill is about better regulation if it simply allows a
whole new group of providers to advertise online gambling opportunities
for the first time, without at the same time preventing companies
without a UK Gambling Commission licence accessing the UK market. In
this context, the principal change secured by the Bill is that more
people can advertise in the UK. Unregulated providers will be able to
continue to access the market as before. As such, rather than looking
like a Bill that has at its heart a desire to provide better consumer
protection, the Bill looks more like the online gambling licensing
liberalisation Bill, in the context of which the suggestion that its
primary concern is taxation revenue looks much too

this would be true if it were not for the fact that credible
enforcement mechanisms exist, in the form of financial transaction and
ISP blocking. Let me begin with ISP blocking, the subject of my
Amendment 7. If this provision were in place, it would be possible to
block websites providing access to price comparison sites and
odds-checkers that involve odds from unlicensed online gambling
providers. It would, of course, also be possible to block the sites of

to see ISP blocking as one important mechanism in the available toolbox
provided by the Bill. On the basis of my research, however, if I were
restricted to one mechanism, I would choose financial transaction
blocking, the subject of my Amendments 5 and 6, which will be the focus
of the remainder of what I am going to say. Amendment 5 would introduce
financial transaction blocking, investing relevant powers in the
Treasury, while Amendment 6 would introduce financial transaction
blocking, investing relevant powers in the Gambling

been clear that they have not ruled out financial transaction blocking
but say that the evidence is mixed, on which basis they suggest that
they do not want to make provision for financial transaction blocking
in the Bill. However, I still do not find this persuasive, for four
reasons. First, I know that financial transaction blocking is not 100%
successful. Few public policy solutions are, but that does not mean
that they should be rejected. As I said at Second Reading, even if
something is just 50% successful, if we want to seize every opportunity
to protect British consumers when we can, we should surely seize hold
of this opportunity on the basis that it is 50% better than
nothing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:03:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000050">Secondly,
the truth is that financial transaction blocking has been deemed to be
sufficiently useful to be employed as a tool to protect consumers from
unregulated online gambling providers in Belgium, Estonia, France,
Hungary, Israel, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway and the United
States. Thirdly, financial transaction blocking is actually likely to
be more successful in the UK than in many other jurisdictions, both
because as a relatively open market, blocking will not need to be
employed to the same extent as in a relatively closed market, and
because open markets are highly competitive so there will not be the
same incentive for punters to try to evade the financial transaction
blocking that exists in closed markets. The online gambling industry
has been at particular pains to stress the success of financial
transaction blocking in the United States. Fourthly, if the Government
are concerned about solutions with mixed results, why are they
entertaining the possibility of solutions that are likely to
demonstrate far more mixed results; namely, prosecution, the efficacy
of which is seriously called into question by their own
consultation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000051">The
fact that financial transaction blocking may not work all the time is
not a real reason not to introduce it in this Bill. If the Government
did so, and accepted Amendments 5 and 6, they would surely restore
integrity to their proposed legislation, making what I regard as their
half-Bill into a whole Bill, and making it clear that this Bill is
indeed about consumer protection, and not just liberalising,
advertising or promoting tax
receipts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000052">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:05:26"></hs_TimeCode>

do not take steps to stop it. If there is such an appetite in parts of

use the same tool to protect UK customers from accessing unregulated

second point is about the nature of ISP blocking within the context of
gambling in the United Kingdom. ISP blocking of unlicensed gambling
websites will be much more successful than ISP blocking to prevent
copyright infringement. Only last October the trade body, BPI, brought
a successful case at the High Court, which issued injunctions to ISPs
in the UK to block 21 websites that infringe copyright. In 2012 it
successfully ensured that ISPs had to block The Pirate Bay, a website
also associated with copyright infringement. The Motion Picture
Association of America also brought cases against seven websites
successfully in the last months of 2013. They are now being blocked by
ISPs. In both cases, the websites that are being blocked by ISPs are
diverse websites that allow or facilitate copyright infringement. They
offer either peer-to-peer file-sharing 
<?notus-xml column=91?>for music, films or TV, connecting people through the so-called
torrents, or direct access to streamed content such as the BBC iPlayer
or the ITV and Channel 4 equivalents.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000059">The law that is used
to effect the ISP blocks is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
1988, amended by the Digital Economy Act 2010. As I understand it, this
is also the basis of the wording of the new clause before us now. In an
article published on the BBC News website, a spokesperson for the BPI
said that it felt that the blocks currently in force had,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="140114109000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000223">“significantly
reduced the use of those sites in the
UK”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="140114109000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000060">The
veracity of that claim has of course been challenged but it is safe to
say that, for the casual user who is able to access free or nearly free
legal content, the block acts as a significant deterrent and points
users towards legal content. In the context of gambling websites,
however, the evidence suggests that blocking would be even more
effective. The remote gambling sector, unlike the copyright piracy
sector, requires money to be spent. That increases the incentive for
the person who will be spending that money to do so in a responsible
way, or at least in a way that will ensure that the money does not go
missing if they win a sum and then the irresponsible website does not
pay
up<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:12:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000061">While
I take the point that gamblers seek out the best odds that they can
find, I also think that there is a desire for them to seek out odds on
websites that they know are properly regulated and thus accountable in
any dispute over payout and financial security, or indeed disputes
about proper player protection. So while it may be possible to get
around ISP blocking if one has the requisite know-how, it is unlikely
that punters will seek to do this in the same way as illegal
file-sharers. Moreover, if ISP blocking were to be combined with a
warning page provided by the Gambling Commission that informed users
that the website in question was not regulated and operated illegally
in the UK, the likelihood of a person then trying to circumvent the ISP
block should drop significantly.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000062">The Minister in the
other place made the point that ISP blocking for remote gambling
websites has seen mixed results in other jurisdictions but it is hard
to compare the UK to other jurisdictions because of how open and free
the market is in the UK. This means that while there will be websites
that operate in the UK without a licence, there will be fewer websites
that operate without a licence here than, for example, in Italy. While
blocking illegal websites accessing the UK will be very important,
therefore, there would be significantly less blocking to do here than
in closed markets that use blocking as an enforcement
mechanism<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:13:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
that the threat of ISP blocking to a potential revenue stream is real,
it would act as an incentive not only for players to gamble on
regulated websites but for unlicensed websites to seek a gambling
licence and come under regulation. After all, the market here is
completely
open.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000063">We need
to think creatively. We already ask ISPs to block certain content. Let
us apply the same mechanisms to remote gambling, where almost certainly
the use of such blocks, for the reasons that I have set out, will be
more successful than they are in relation to other 
<?notus-xml column=92?>forms of online content and in other jurisdictions. I very much hope
that the Government will back Amendments 5, 6 and 7 and thereby restore
integrity to the
Bill.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_14_PT_1/C709579DA3BDB7BC50CCC296E88B6AC36EC5676E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 January 2014">Tuesday,

all noble Lords who have participated in this debate: to the noble
Lord, Lord Morrow, and perhaps particularly to the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, who made some very interesting points and produced some
additional evidence. However, of course I am particularly grateful to
the Minister, who very kindly met some of us earlier last week to
discuss these issues. He will of course realise that I am still very
disappointed by what he had to say. Referring to my rather hard talk
about half a Bill rather than a whole Bill, I sadly feel that if only
he could have moved quite a long way in the direction we were
proposing, it would have been very much a relevant and full Bill.
However, I am reassured to some extent by his assurances that genuine
enforcement mechanisms will be considered very carefully when rather
more evidence has been gathered together on that issue. However, as we
know, it is far too much carrot, and we are lacking on the stick side
of the argument.</hs_para>

also understand that taking action on FOBTs is Lib Dem conference

effectively give new powers to local licensing committees to prevent
betting shops providing these machines or to reduce their number,
taking into account the views of the local community. It would also
allow for regulations to make provision for increasing the minimum time
between plays; requiring the machines to display a warning of overuse;
building in enforced breaks between plays; and requiring at least two
members of staff to be present when such machines were in

protections are essential to protect local communities from the
clustering of high street betting shops in areas of high social and
economic deprivation. Regrettably, betting shops are becoming
increasingly reliant on the income from these machines rather than from
traditional forms of betting, and it seems that this income is being
drawn from poor and often desperate individuals who can least afford to
gamble in this way. Meanwhile, local councils from around the country
report that they feel powerless to prevent the expansion of these
shops, even when they are opposed by the local community. Indeed, a
Local Government Association survey in 2012 found that 68% of people
wanted the planning laws changed to address this issue.</hs_para>

source of some of the worst examples of gambling addiction. It is
possible to lose up to £100 every 20 seconds, which is
£18,000 an hour. 
<?notus-xml column=97?>The speed of play is faster than a roulette table and it can happen
without any staff contact or intervention. All this is happening on
high streets in a fairly unregulated way. I do not think that anyone
foresaw that betting shops would be dominated by these machines when
the Gambling Act was passed in 2005. Our responsibility is to provide
greater consumer protection from the magnet of compulsive gambling that
these machines represent. This is not about imposing a blanket ban but
about enabling local communities to have a greater say in what should
happen on their high streets and, if necessary, to limit or reduce the
preponderance of these machines.</hs_para>

are other steps that would help. Extending the time between each play
would allow the user more time for reflection between games, breaking
the spell of compulsive behaviour and allowing staff members to
intervene if they had become concerned about the amount of time that a
player had been spending on the machine. It would also set more
sensible limits on how much time could be spent and lost in a given
timeframe. A requirement for the machines to interact with the player,
to give warnings about addiction and about the cumulative sums being
spent, might also break the addictive cycle. Requiring more than one
member of staff to be available is an essential feature of staff
safety, as there have been a number of violent incidents involving
punters who have lost large sums of money on these machines. It would
also enable a staff member more effectively to supervise the use of
these machines, and there is an added need for better staff training in
this respect.</hs_para>

issue about the level of stakes and prizes. I rehearsed these arguments
with the noble Lord, Lord Bates, in November when we were considering
the latest gaming regulations. At that time, the noble Lord, Lord
Moynihan, who contributed to the debate, made the important point that
local sports clubs quite often rely on the income from these machines.
However, here we are talking very specifically about the regulation of
betting shops on local high streets—which, if you like, are
walk-in betting shops—rather than about the provision in local
sports clubs. I continue to feel that the Government should have used
the triennial review to act on the high stakes offered by these
machines.</hs_para>

agree with my noble friend Lord Lipsey that the evidence base is rather

it had known that they would, as they do now, account for around half
of betting shop turnover. The deal is now shrouded in history but
basically they were supposed to be a little top-up revenue for the

have pressed on them the desirability of making a concession

itself, and I very much hope that even at this late stage it will come
forward, more positively recognising the scale of the problem that it
faces, recognising the political consensus that now stretches from
David Cameron to Ed Miliband that something has to be done about it,

amendment is designed—I hope—to be probing. It is a long
way from clear yet that a local authority-based scheme for licensing is
the only way of tackling this problem. I have a considerable concern
about what happens when you have one local authority that allows, let
us say, eight FOBTs per betting shop while the authority next door
allows none. That will lead to a huge proliferation, beyond
anything that we have seen so far, in the “Come here

the Liberal Democrats.</hs_para>

looking at. Local authorities’ planning powers, which are not
covered by this amendment, also need looking at in order to find a
robust policy. A measure of localism has a great deal to be said for

of all, I hope to see the consensus that exists now in the political
class and among politicians spread more widely to the bookmakers, to
the betting industry and among the public. I hope to see even more
concentration on methods to exclude those who abuse this form of
gambling. I also hope to see a frank recognition of the reality and not
just a single-minded focus on short-run profits, because if the

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I am glad we are having this
short debate today. It is quite interesting that this has become a
topic of current debate. I followed closely the debate that took place
last week in the Commons on the subject.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000103">I notice, and indeed I
regret, that the noble Baroness herself does not express any regret for
the legislation that was passed in 2005. After all, it was the Labour
Government who introduced these FOBTs, and now we have had the
proliferation of what appear to be highly damaging and addictive
gambling machines in our high streets. Prefacing remarks along those
lines would have been quite useful, because they were clearly
introduced by that legislation.</hs_para>

concerns about these machines. Indeed, it is all very well for the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, to say what he said, but we have been warning
of the dangers of these machines ever since the passing of the 2005 Act
because we thought that it would lead to the proliferation of these
high-stakes machines. I will come on to the level of stakes in a minute
because that is one of the key issues surrounding them.</hs_para>

though there is, in a sense, a cross-party view about the impact and
danger of FOBTs, there is a level of disagreement because some of us
feel that the evidence is already there that they are addictive, and
that something should be done in the very short term. I am not going to
adumbrate all the research that is out there but it includes GamCare,
the Salvation Army, the National Problem Gambling Clinic, the Campaign
for Fairer Gambling, Professor Gerda Reith at the University of Glasgow
and even the <I>European Journal of Public Health</I>—a series
of different reports can be prayed in aid to show that these machines
really are a source of problem gambling, and that the problem is rising
over
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000106">Clearly,
the evidence is disputed by the Association of British Bookmakers; I am
sure that we have all had its briefing, which heavily disputes some of
the points that are being made about FOBTs. The association questions
the validity of the evidence put forward by the <I>British Gambling
Prevalence Survey</I>, for instance, and so on. The Government did not
have much of a choice other than to say, “Right, let’s
remit this to the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board and see what
comes out of that”. I very much hope that that will be
conclusive on the matter and lead to further action, although probably
not through this Bill because I do not believe that any of this needs
primary legislation. I do not believe that it is the planning system
that is essentially at fault here. We heard during the Commons debate
last week that Southwark Council is employing perfectly proper legal
means to restrict the further spread of FOBTs and betting shops in its
borough, and that sort of remedy is open to other councils to
adopt.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140114109000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000107">I do
not think that it is about that side of things; a lot of this problem
boils down to stakes and prizes—something that can be remedied
very straightforwardly by political will through secondary legislation,
through regulations and through altering the stakes. At the moment you
can put in £100, which is a huge amount of money for these
machines in the high street. Some of the campaigns are saying that this
should be reduced to £2—I think that that is somewhat
drastic—but I certainly hope that when the Responsible Gambling
Strategy Board reports it will make a recommendation about the
appropriate level of stake that should be the limit for these machines.
That will go a long way towards making sure that they are no longer as
addictive as they currently are, and will also mean that bookmakers
have to think very carefully about the profitability of their premises
and we do not have the kind of proliferation that we appear to be
having as a result of the ability to install these FOBTs. I appreciate
the subject having been raised and I share the noble Baroness’s
concerns but, ultimately, I hope that quite soon we can adopt a remedy
by secondary legislation that could be relatively
straightforward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:57:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Gardiner of Kimble" PimsId="5760" UID="140114109000258" xid="2035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000258">Lord
Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness
for her amendment, which gives us a timely opportunity to set out what
the Government are doing. The Government acknowledge the harm that
gaming machines cause for some people and have set out clearly what we
are doing to address this. As part of our review of gaming machines
last year, the 
<?notus-xml column=101?>Government looked very closely at the available evidence about category
B2 gaming machines—FOBTs. The review found that there are real
concerns about these machines and that some players have experienced
considerable harm from using them. However, it is currently not clear
that a reduction in stake or prize would be effective in reducing
gambling-related harm.</hs_para>

Government therefore concluded that the future of these machines was
unresolved. We are undertaking urgent work to establish how these
machines can be made safer, especially to those individuals who may be
at the greatest risk of harm. Enhanced player protection measures will
be introduced from 1 March, and research is under way by the
Responsible Gambling Trust to identify where there is robust evidence
that consumers may be experiencing harm. The Prime Minister confirmed
last week that the Government will report on this issue in the spring.
The Government will take whatever action is necessary to make these
machines safer, and have very clearly set out our evidence-based
approach to determining their
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:59:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000110">Amendment
8 raises a number of important points about the controls on gaming
machines. I assure the Committee that the existing legislation already
provides licensing controls on the provision of gaming machines as well
as technical requirements about their operation. The amendment calls
for new powers under which the Secretary of State may make regulations
about the speed of play on a gaming machine, the messages that must be
displayed and breaks in
play.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000111">Technical
matters in relation to gaming machine operations are rightly a matter
for the Gambling Commission and are controlled by the
commission’s technical standards.
These<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:04:44"></hs_TimeCode> standards
specify the minimum speed of play, which is twenty seconds for a FOBT,
and also make clear what information must be displayed on the machine
itself, or on screen, to enable players to keep track of their
gambling<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:24:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140114109000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000234">7

right that technical matters about the operations of gaming machines
are dealt with by the Gambling Commission. However, the Government
already have reserve powers to require the imposition of licence
conditions, and indeed have direct regulation- making powers that could
cover messaging. In the meantime, the player protection measures being
introduced from 1 March include enhanced responsible messaging and
pauses in play, and the Government have demanded that the industry
demonstrates the effectiveness of these as soon as possible. The
Government do not rule out reducing the speed of play but it is not
clear that such a change would have an impact on problem gamblers. It
could simply make machines less attractive to occasional players who
are in control of their
gambling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000113">Amendment
8 also calls for powers which would allow a licensing authority to
review and revoke a betting premises licence. The amendment also
proposes that a minimum staffing level of two people be required where
category B gaming machines are available. Licensing authorities already
have powers to control gambling in their areas, including the provision
of gaming machines and the number of staff in betting shops. Local
authorities can reject an application for a gambling premises 
<?notus-xml column=102?>licence, or grant one with additional conditions, should that be
necessary. These powers allow licensing authorities to tackle problems
in local communities. In making these conditions the licensing
authority must—quite rightly—demonstrate why the
conditions are necessary to uphold the licensing objectives of the
Gambling Act 2005. It is important that the obligation on licensing
authorities to build an evidence-based case is not undermined by
legislation which removes requirements on them to justify their
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0001.htm#140114109000114">There
are very good examples of licensing authorities imposing conditions

want to emphasise that the Government take concerns about category B
gaming machines very seriously and are prepared to introduce
precautionary measures to make them safer, if necessary. Work is in
hand. It is a very good thing that there is, I hope, not too much of a
divide among parliamentarians on this matter, because it is very
important for local communities that this work is in hand. I hope that,

said, too, that this was a probing amendment. I do not think that we
got the wording exactly right; there is obviously more work to be done.
I heard what the Minister said about existing licensing regulations but
I therefore do not understand why local authorities up and down the
country are saying that they are finding it impossible to get a grip
and to control the number of betting shops and fixed-odds betting

concern remains that the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board will
produce an inconclusive report; there is a tendency for that to happen.
It has been set quite a challenge in being asked to show the
relationship between the use of fixed-odds betting terminals and
compulsive gambling, and I am not sure that it is going to be able to
produce a coherent piece of work between now and the summer that proves
that one way or the other. The last thing we want is for further work

rules that are in operation so far, which I think is what the Minister

will be really brief. It is widely believed among the public and people
in public health and gambling regulation that online gambling
represents the greatest challenge to be faced in the next few years in
the prevention of problem gambling. As we heard earlier, problem
gambling is often how you get started, how you become
addicted—it is not necessarily the money; it is the addictive
nature of the gaming system.</hs_para>

Jones of Whitchurch</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, this amendment
concerns the issue of dormant accounts and the use of the money that
resides within them. There are currently millions of pounds tied up in
accounts that represent unclaimed winnings or, for example, bets placed
on horses that do not run but are never reclaimed. However, the actual
sums involved are difficult to express accurately because it has never
been in the interests of the industry to disclose them. The amendment
would introduce a greater level of transparency about the sums involved
by requiring disclosure as a condition of the licence. This could be a
prelude to an agreed plan to use the money more constructively. When
this was discussed in the Commons, it was reported that Don Foster had
produced a report in 2011 identifying the levels of funds involved and
that on the back of that an attempt was made to reach a voluntary
agreement with the industry but, perhaps unsurprisingly, this was
unsuccessful.</hs_para>

considerable scope for this money to be put to good use—for
example, into research on treatment for problem gambling, or perhaps to
invest in the development of grass-roots sports—so these
investments could in turn prove to be to the benefit of the industry in
the longer term. This strategy would be consistent with the policies of
this Government and the previous Government for the use of dormant
accounts in other sectors. For example, dormant bank accounts and
unclaimed lottery winnings are used to support good

Obviously, there would need to be further dialogue with the sector

to use the funds for good use, which is why our amendment would require
the Secretary of State to consult on the arrangements. This is very

the lack of research, particularly into problem gambling. I want to
make a couple of quick points in support of our amendment. We have said
that there is not enough research, which I think we all have
acknowledged. It also seems that the industry is spending relatively
small sums of money on research. At the moment, the amount of money
paid by the sector is disturbingly small. It is estimated that the
industry as a whole is worth some £6 billion a year, yet the
amount available to the Responsible Gambling Trust through the
voluntary levy is just over £5 million a year, with only 10% of
that being spent on

in the Commons, my colleague the Shadow Minister, Clive Efford, pointed
out that when he looked on the Responsible Gambling Trust’s

That is all very worthy but you would think that there was enough money

said, at present the voluntary industry funding scheme provides around
£5 million a year, 80% of which goes to bodies like GamCare, the
Gordon Moody Association and the Soho clinic to provide advice and
treatment. This funding has supported the introduction of a free-to-use
national telephone helpline and the development of GambleAware, a
general gambling information website. Useful work has been done in this
area by the Responsible Gambling Trust and its predecessor body with
local clinics or advice centres, to see how those developing problems
can be identified and helped. In addition, the Soho clinic has piloted
ways in which the NHS can help those with severe problems. The

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, the Bill proposes widening the
scope for advertising online gambling in the United Kingdom.
Henceforth, not just operators based in the European Economic Area or
whitelisted jurisdictions will be able to advertise. Any provider
anywhere in the world will be able to advertise in the UK, so long as
they get a UK Gambling Commission licence. As such, the Bill will make
problem gamblers more aware of opportunities to gamble and of
opportunities to gamble associated with a higher problem gambling
prevalence
figure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000146">It
would be quite wrong for us to sanction such a Bill without at the same
time comparing our own codes and technical standards with those of
other whitelisted and EEA jurisdictions to identify where ours fall
short and to make good the difference. We should not countenance
exposing British consumers to yet more gambling advertising without
first making sure that the protections we offer problem gamblers are
second to none. This is the purpose of the proposed new clause, which I
introduce today for two principal
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000147">First,
the proposed new clause would prevent the Bill having the effect of
eroding protections that some UK consumers have come to enjoy since
2005. To understand the possibility of an erosion of protections
flowing from the Bill one must first recognise that it is part and
parcel of a Treasury initiative to correct a perverse tax incentive
created through the Gambling Act 2005, which resulted in all but one
online gambling provider leaving the UK for a whitelisted or EEA
jurisdiction, from which they could continue to access and advertise in
the UK market without paying UK tax. The Treasury very understandably
wants to correct this by requiring all companies accessing the UK
market to pay tax. The Bill provides them with a basis for doing so by
stipulating that all holders of UK Gambling Commission licences must
pay UK taxes.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=109?><hs_para UID="140114109000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000148">In this context, there
is a real possibility that companies that were previously based in the
UK and relocated for tax purposes to EEA or whitelisted jurisdictions
will now return to the UK. In any event, they will definitely be
subject, as far as their UK consumers are concerned, to a UK regulatory
framework. This will result in erosion of protections for those UK
consumers who have depended on the regulatory frameworks of whitelisted
and EEA jurisdictions where those frameworks are better than those
offered by the UK, unless of course the UK protections are brought into
line with the best whitelisted and EEA
protections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000149">Secondly,
the proposed new clause is important because the UK, especially since
the 2005 Act, has rightly aspired to have the very best regulatory
framework in the world, one which other countries would desire to
emulate. In this context, there is every reason to review our codes and
technical standards internationally to check that our regulatory
framework, especially as it relates to the vulnerable and the care of
problem gamblers, is as good as the very best framework of any
whitelisted or EEA
jurisdiction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000150">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:26:01"></hs_TimeCode>
the other place, the fact that regulatory frameworks with respect to
problem gambling are weaker than those of the best whitelisted and EEA
jurisdiction was called into question, but such questioning simply does
not stand up to scrutiny. Let us consider the
evidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000151">I
want to begin by considering a whitelisted jurisdiction, Alderney.
People who gamble on websites licensed in Alderney can request that any
number of limits be put on their accounts. Crucially, this is currently
not the case in the UK, where the technical standards specify that
software operated by a licensee should allow players to set some
limits, but the technical codes do not specify, as the law does in
Alderney, that a player may choose how, when and in what way those
limits should be set. The UK technical standards documents set out
examples of financial pre-commitment such as deposit limits, spend
limits or loss limits, but it does not require all these examples to be
part of the financial pre-commitment of the
software.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000152">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:27:22"></hs_TimeCode>
Gambling Commission told the Committee in the other place that the UK
technical standards require giving players the opportunity to
pre-commit to the amount of time spent gambling. They may have meant
the amount of money spent in a given period, but that is not the same
as pre-committing to an amount of time spent gambling. The amount of
time that a person gambles can also be part of the problem. We need to
arm problem gamblers or at-risk gamblers with real
solutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000153">There
is a very real risk that British consumers buying access to online
gambling from Alderney will experience an erosion of consumer
protection when Alderney providers are subject to the weaker UK
regulatory framework. Surely it is not acceptable that this Bill should
contain such a potentially retrograde step. We need to plug this
loophole through the new clause proposed in Amendment
19.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000154">Next, I
want to consider an EEA jurisdiction, Sweden. In so doing, I want to
make it clear that, since no online providers accessing the UK market
are located  
<?notus-xml column=110?>in Sweden, there can be no question of British consumers experiencing an
erosion of the protections that they have come to enjoy, as in relation
to operators based in
Alderney.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000155">The
point I am making here is that those jurisdictions provide us with
regulatory frameworks which exhibit better care for problem gamblers
than our own. Considering them thus provides us with an opportunity to
raise our game such that we can sustain the claim that we provide a
regulatory framework that is among the best in the world, which is
incumbent upon us at a time when we are introducing legislation that
proposes making problem gamblers more aware of gambling opportunities
with a higher problem-prevalence figure than gambling on
average.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140114109000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000156">In
Sweden, players are given the option of using technology called play
scan. Play scan is a programme that uses behavioural analytics which,
when implemented, will prompt a player about behavioural change
indicating that a problem might be developing. The prompts give them
information about how to limit their gambling or where to find help,
but this is not the only social responsibility measure in place in
Sweden. If the gambler wants to play online poker, they need to apply
for a membership card, which has a specific number associated with it
and is linked to the player’s bank account. The gambler
authorises the transfer of funds from a linked account to a card and
any winnings are paid automatically into the gambler’s account.
To play, customers are required to set time and money limits. The
setting of limits is the main function of the card but it also offers
play management features, including a summary of player history for the
previous 12 months; allows for time-out periods; and offers risk
assessment features on an opt-in basis.</hs_para>

argue that the UK’s code and technical standards are worse than
all whitelisted or EEA jurisdictions—far from it. My point is
simply that the Bill should not have the result of effectively eroding
protections on which some British consumers have come to depend, nor
should it miss the opportunity of enhancing our protections so that
they are as good as the best whitelisted or EEA jurisdictions. I submit
that this is vital if we are with integrity to propose widening the
scope to advertising, a form of gambling with a significantly higher
problem prevalence than average. I beg to

Browne of Belmont:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to speak in
support of the proposed new clause in the name of the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe. The new clause is important because since 2005 a significant
number of online gambling providers have moved outside the UK to
European Economic Area and so-called whitelisted jurisdictions, from
which they can continue to access the UK market and advertise but,
crucially, avoid paying tax. The Bill, in tandem  
<?notus-xml column=111?>with the Treasury initiative, will plug that loophole, resulting in
British consumers having to depend once more on British
regulation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000159">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>
that context, the proposed new clause is vital for two reasons. First,
we need to be sure that no British consumer will experience an erosion
of the protections that they have come to rely on as a result of coming
under UK regulation, at least so far as UK consumers are concerned.
Secondly, we should always be working to ensure that the protections
that we afford consumers, especially in relation to problem gambling,
are the very best.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000160">As the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, has explained, Alderney is particularly important because it
is a jurisdiction to which a number of UK operators have relocated. The
better protections provided for problem gamblers in Alderney, in terms
of the setting of limits, are certainly something that we should look
at and maybe amend our codes and technical standards to
emulate.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140114109000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000161">I
would like to look at two EEA jurisdictions, Finland and Denmark, which
in some important respects provide better regulation and consumer
protection than we do here in the UK. Finland’s regulator has
implemented a mandatory daily loss limit and a monthly loss limit, as
well as setting a maximum amount of euros that can be in a gambling
account of €5,000. The maximum daily loss is set at €500.
Innovatively, they have also produced an actual boundary, something
that is so often lacking in online gambling. Transfers from bank
accounts to a gambling account cannot be made between midnight and 6
am. This creates a natural boundary that is similar to betting shop
opening and closing times. Implementing such a provision would create a
level playing field across the industry in general, and would help to
protect people from unhelpful and impulsive all-night gambling
sessions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000162">The responsibility
codes go further in Finland. On marketing, there can be no registration
bonuses, deposit bonuses or activation bonuses, and no rewards can be
given based on gaming volume. Indeed, payment using credit cards is
forbidden. It is possible in every game to activate a short 12-hour
gaming ban that covers all games. This short self-imposed gambling ban
can be activated by pressing a panic button that is located in the
bottom half of the screen. Given that problem gambling is often
associated with impulse, the provision of a button like that would help
many people tremendously.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000163">The Danish model of
regulation, meanwhile, requires gambling companies to obtain
information about the customer’s intended gambling volume at the
same time as the customer provides identification information by
opening an account. Players are allowed to set daily, weekly and
monthly limits, and all three options must be given to the player. If a
player chooses to self-exclude permanently, they must be given the
option to be added to what in Denmark is referred to as the register of
self-excluded players. This is a central list, much like the proposed
one-stop shop for self-exclusion. If a player chooses to be added to
that list they will not be able to gamble on any website that has a
Danish licence, since every company, before allowing a player 
<?notus-xml column=112?>to gamble or open an account, must check the list to see if that person
has entered their name to the register. To this end, as I have already
explained, Amendment 3 is vital.</hs_para>

the proposed new clause. I hope that the Government will warmly endorse
it, and I particularly look forward to hearing what the Minister has to

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness
for her amendment. The Government are confident that the British
regulatory system is a model of international best practice and that
the Gambling Commission’s requirements are robust and of the
highest standard. It is the commission’s job to ensure that the
British regulatory system is the best that it can be, and to that
extent always has its licensing conditions and technical standards
under review. As the noble Baroness will be aware, the commission has
just concluded its consultation into its licensing conditions and codes
of practice, and we await its response. It is fair to say that the
commission is internationally respected and continues to disseminate
best practice, extensively engaging with overseas regulators. I am most
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, for illustrating
what is happening in Finland and

preparation for the new licensing regime, the commission has had a
series of meetings with regulators in Gibraltar, the Isle of Man and
the States of Alderney to establish ways to minimise duplication. It
will be using the recently developed multijurisdictional business form
for those applying for remote operating licences, which enables
operators to provide and update information, once in a form, that can
be provided to multiple jurisdictions without duplication.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140114109000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140114-gc0002.htm#140114109000167">The commission
continues to explore the scope for expanded collaboration. It also has
memorandums of understanding in place with several regulators,
including Alderney, for the sharing of information between regulators.
This will enable the commission to use any licensing, compliance and
enforcement information to determine the suitability of an operator to
hold, and continue to hold, a British licence. Neither the Government
nor the Gambling Commission is complacent about these matters, and
should either feel that such a review would be appropriate, sufficient
power already exists under the 2005 Act to enable that to take place.

principles of public law. Specific training for all departmental staff,
including those in Jobcentre Plus, involved in civil penalties was
introduced in September 2012. Consideration around what may constitute
negligence and what may count as a reasonable excuse is subject to
guidance and was explored in preparing that material through training
with decision makers. This training was incorporated into a wider
training requirement when the Department brought in the Overpayment,
Decision, Calculation and Appeal (ODCA) process and is designed to
ensure that the civil penalty is considered at the same time as an
overpayment decision and is a fundamental part of the

a claimant error overpayment occurs, a decision maker will consider the
full circumstances of the case, including any further information

individually by the decision maker and the reasons that have led to the

the introduction of the civil penalty in October 2012 the application
of the penalty was closely monitored to ensure the penalty was
operating as intended. A review of the process and guidance was
undertaken, with evidence gathered from live cases and stakeholder
feedback helping to inform a refreshed version of the guidance,
published in October 2013. Supporting products were also updated where
necessary including improving customer notifications. During the first
year of operation around a half of all claimant error cases considered
