picking up many of the costs associated with these welfare reforms,
which in turn will be at the expense of other important local services.

makes properties that are underoccupied available for people who are
overcrowded. According to the English housing survey, the figure for
overcrowding is 
<?notus-xml column=1072?>about a quarter of a million. Under the 2011 census, the figure was
higher, going up to a third of a

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, overcrowding is
essentially a London problem, but the local authorities most affected
are not London authorities; they are in places such as the north. I am
sure that the Minister respects the facts on that and will share his
information with the House. Does he agree that the problem that local
authorities and housing associations face is that there is an absolute
shortage of small accommodation to which people can move? Does he
therefore agree that it would only be fair, right and decent if people
were sanctioned by the bedroom tax only if they refused an acceptable
alternative offer of smaller
accommodation?<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:41:17"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, less than half the overcrowding takes
place in London. More than 30% of properties are actually one-bedroom
and 108,000 have come up. We are adapting to the transition by using
the discretionary housing payment system. The recent data on
discretionary housing payments show that that is exactly how local
authorities are using that
money<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:41:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Sherlock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister mentioned
discretionary housing payments. The LGA survey says that 81% of
authorities said that the number of applications for DHPs had increased
greatly between April and November 2013 and that the social sector size
criteria topped the list of reasons for this. The LGA has made the
point that there are some areas where there is simply not enough
accommodation, and therefore the amounts of money the Government have
made available are not enough. The tenants are suffering and the local
authorities are picking up the tab. Will the Government commit to
reviewing this policy and giving local authorities and tenants the help
they
need<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:42:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="14012860000771" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000771">Lord
Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, we have a high level of discretionary
housing payments, running at £180 million. More importantly,
£20 million of that is to be bid for. I have currently had 67
bids and we are paying out. I am not sure whether local authorities
will actually be using up all the discretionary housing payment at
their disposal. As noble Lords know, a review is going on.  I
will be able to publicise the interim findings in the spring and the
final version will appear next

housing payment is for. It is for local authorities to take decisions,
based on their local knowledge, so that they get the funds to the right
people. The emerging signs are that we will not spend 
<?notus-xml column=1073?>all the discretionary housing payments this year. I am, however, making

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the important thing about output is that
it is rapidly approaching the previous peak. With every passing set of
statistics, we find that output is growing more quickly than we
thought. It is interesting to note that the figure today of 1.9% growth
in output for the past year is significantly higher than the figure
that the ONS thought even in December, when it suggested 1.4%. The
message from today's figures is that growth is accelerating quicker
than most forecasters thought, and all forward indicators suggest that
that trend will
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:58:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000043"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="14012860000804" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000804">Lord

the time that the 50p tax was introduced, that the reintroduction of a
50p tax would be a return to the bad old days of old Labour and the

Lord Myners, has said with the utmost seriousness; everybody across the
House has done so as well and I will undoubtedly continue to do so. The
most significant and impressive part of the growth in the economy and
in employment has been that the preponderance of that growth is private
sector led and the private sector invests only if it feels that the

Government—is conducive to new employment and growth in

Myners is sadly not in his place, but if he were, he would not have had
the slightest difficulty in identifying for the Minister just why we
should be somewhat worried about the development of the recovery. After
all, the Minister and his colleagues in the House of Commons constantly
emphasise that this recovery needs to be balanced. There are already
indications that this recovery is partly housing driven, which is of
course a reflection of the only area in which the Government have been
directly active. Moreover, the recovery favours the south-east in

level of unemployment in London, for example, is significantly higher
than that in Scotland or Wales. Economic growth is occurring across the
whole of the country. As for where it is happening, I will give two
examples: aerospace orders last year included new orders of some
£39 billion and car production was at a six-year high. This is

1 would extend the scope of the register to those who lobby special
advisers, in addition to those who lobby Ministers and Permanent
Secretaries. Our colleagues in the other place recognised the objective
of the amendment and, indeed, expressed some sympathy with the motives
of those who had supported it. They concluded, however, that the case
had not been made to extend the scope in this way at present, but
recognised that discussions regarding the inclusion of those who
communicate with special advisers will continue. They therefore
proposed what I believe is a pragmatic and constructive response to the
noble Lord’s amendment. The amendments in lieu proposed by the
other place would introduce a power for the Minister to amend the
definition of consultant lobbying provided for by Clause 2 to,
subsequently, and if necessary, include communications with special
advisers. Such a power would enable Ministers to extend the scope as
suggested if and when they are persuaded in this Government or the next
of the case for doing
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000064">As I have
observed, the other place was not persuaded that the case for such an
extension had yet been made. That is because it recognises that the
register is intended to complement the existing government transparency
regime. Both systems—transparency and the register—are
intended to enhance the transparency of the key decision-makers, the
Ministers and Permanent Secretaries, and those who communicate with
them. The other place confirmed this view that the Government’s
focus on key decision-makers is appropriate and proportionate. We
accept that lobbyists make communications to Government other than
directly to Ministers and Permanent Secretaries. Ultimately, however,
it is for Ministers and Permanent Secretaries to be responsible for the
decisions taken within their
departments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000065">While
special advisers may provide advice, they are not decision-makers. It

Reading. His amendment now moves away from seeking to apply the
constituency limit to just a narrowed range of activities. The House
has already agreed that it is appropriate to make third parties account
for their expenditure against an expanded range of activities. The
House has also agreed that constituency limits are necessary. As I have
raised before, narrowing the range of activities that would apply to
the constituency limits in turn limits the very effectiveness of these
constituency limits. The reason this Bill widens the range of

What Amendment 26B further seeks, however, is to introduce a second
test to determine whether expenditure is incurred in a constituency or
not. This second test asks whether it can also "reasonably be inferred"
that electors or households have been specifically targeted in a

Bill's provision on constituency limits has, after all, been drafted in
line with current PPERA rules and Electoral Commission guidance.
Although bringing constituency limits is new, noble Lords will
recognise that under PPERA expenditure must currently be attributed
between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That is why
there are separate spending 
<?notus-xml column=1086?>limits for each part.
Expenditure<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:22:15"></hs_TimeCode> must
be attributed between each part of the constituent parts of the United
Kingdom on the basis of where its “significant effect” is
felt. The Electoral Commission has clear guidance on how to allocate
expenditure in this way and the same process will apply to constituency
limits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000086">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:22:29"></hs_TimeCode>
a third party holds a rally in one constituency with a view to
influencing the electoral success of a party or candidates in another

likely to be felt. The expenditure will be attributed to that

a third party advertised in a Welsh newspaper that is also distributed

Shropshire, then the entire spending would be allocated to Wales

almost equal to the current £10,000 PPERA registration threshold

do not see that there is any  merit in claims that the

neighbouring constituency. That is because in the words of the clause
there would be “no significant effect” in it. I give as
another example one of the big agricultural shows that take place every
year around the country. A number of campaigning groups during the
regulated period take the opportunity to hold meetings and give out
leaflets on controversial issues in farming methods, such as cruelty to
animals, pesticides, badgers and hunting. They are high profile and
huge numbers of people from the region or indeed the country who attend
the show are given these leaflets. On the amendment that is before us
today, that activity would not be caught by constituency regulation,
although it would be still be controlled by national expenditure
regulation. That is because, according to sub-paragraph (3)(b), it has
to be shown that the material is substantially orientated towards
electors in a particular constituency or number of constituencies. It
is clear from that example that the campaigners did not have a
particular constituency or constituencies in mind. Their expenditure

have reached now on constituency limits. Your Lordships’ House
may recall that I proposed a very simple amendment on this issue in

telephone calls to electors in those constituencies, should count under
the specific constituency limit. That was very

much activity, particularly the potential for handing out leaflets in a

diligent in attempting to deal with that problem, but I think that in
the process we have been sent round in a circle. Sending information to
a household is an easy test, because it is easy to know where a
household is and therefore in which constituency its occupants are
likely to vote. However, handing out information in a public place is
different, as has been indicated, because people move around and could
be from all sorts of different

Electoral Commission. I am still not convinced by that and I am
particularly not convinced about it in relation to election materials

very substantial round-table discussions, and I hope I may be able to
play a small part in them because I think this is an extremely
important issue.</hs_para>

of the Government to impose strict constituency limits. That is
accepted in the amendment. It responds to the concerns of Ministers
both here and in the other place that not all activity had been

point made by the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, that it took just 24 hours
to reject the advice of this House and of the voluntary sector. I
understand that, anticipating another victory today, they are going to
do the same tomorrow. They do not seem to take your Lordships’
House too seriously. It also means, of course, that we have not had the
opportunity to hear from the Electoral Commission about the new

remain deeply concerned about the Government position on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000118">Just
yesterday the Government had another blitz on red tape, boasting how
they were removing unnecessary shackles from a number of bodies. Last
week, the Government published their Deregulation Bill, which will get
its Second Reading in the other place on Monday. Therefore, on the one
hand all this red tape is being lifted off organisations, and yet on
the other we have here something that will tie up charities, churches,
women’s groups, young people’s movements and green

problem with constituency limits is not their aim but their
workability. The third sector does not organise by

borders. It focuses on things like HS2, Heathrow or badger setts.
Therefore, it is a bit of accounting and bureaucratic red tape to ask
those organisations to do their accounts in a completely different,
geographical way—not according to where their staff work or
their pay grades, but based on whether they might have happened to
spend a bit of time campaigning on something which then became a
political issue, either because a party did or did not like it. If the
Government cannot understand that, it is only because they have not run

will repeat one more thing that I said earlier. The Electoral

said, would restrict the requirements simply to campaigning that is
clearly directed at particular electors—is surely a better way
forward than the Government’s way. The noble and learned Lord
gave the example of an ad, but that is not the point. Ads are easy;
they are like printing things—you know where they will be.
Getting a bit of one campaigner’s time, or getting someone who
may have helped organise a photo shoot, is what is being asked for, and

their very nature individuals or organisations who may undertake a main
function, be it raising awareness of environmental issues,
workers’ rights, animal rights or electoral reform, or who are
set up for the purpose of campaigning in election. It is because third
parties do not fight elections themselves, but seek to participate in
them, often alongside another main function, that the regulatory regime
for third parties relates to the activities they undertake. Where a

is regulated. The Electoral Commission guidance says that the full
costs of any activity should be included, including expenditure on
staff costs. This is to ensure that activities that seek to influence

important issues which go to the heart of the Government's belief that
as a matter of principle staff costs should be included within the
calculation of controlled expenditure. However, we do agree with the
noble and right reverend Lord that third parties should not have to
account for every small or insignificant amount of staff time. The
amendment that noble Lords passed on Report has as its heading,
“Exclusions of background staff costs”. I understand and
recognise that particular concern. Indeed, the conversation that I had
with the noble and right reverend Lord made it very clear where his
concerns were. There should not be an accounting for every small or
insignificant amount of staff
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000133">Campaigners,
as well as noble Lords in debates in this House, have raised concerns
over how a third party would be able to calculate these costs. The
Electoral Commission, in its guidance, outlines that third parties
should provide an honest assessment. It is important to stress this
because I think this is where some of the concern comes from. That does
not mean that staff have to keep timesheets, for example, of
five-minute breakdowns of how their time was spent, nor has the regime
around staff costs operated on this basis for the past two general
elections. Under PPERA, staff costs associated with election materials
have had to be accounted for. Neither the legislation, nor the guidance
from the Electoral Commission, has even suggested that that kind of
detailed breakdown of how time is spent is required of third
parties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000134">An
honest assessment must be made and this should not be burdensome for
third parties. I will use the example that the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries, used on Report. If a third party employee spends 10
per cent of his or her time over a four-week period on election
activity, and has an annual salary of £30,000, that is divided
by the weeks in the year, which provides a figure of £577 a
week. If we multiply that by four, we get a figure of £2,308, 10
per cent of which is approximately

is nothing in PPERA, nor in this Bill, that suggests that every small
or insignificant amount of staff time must be accounted for such as the
few hours a member of staff otherwise not involved in the campaign
spent proofreading a document, or directing attendees to an event. It
must involve expenditure—whether because a person was employed
for a specific task, or because the extent to which a person was
diverted from their normal duties was sufficient to constitute some
additional
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000136">That
leads me to my second point. The amendment of the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, appears to accept the principle of
including staff costs; his amendment excludes the calculation of staff
costs from certain activities—public rallies, organised media
events and transport. However, third parties would still have to
account for staff time where it formed part of the controlled
expenditure for items such as election materials or
canvassing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000137">I
ask noble Lords to consider and reflect that if it is deemed reasonable
and possible to calculate and include the cost of an in-house designer

election leaflet, why is it not reasonable and possible to calculate 
<?notus-xml column=1100?>a communications officer spending 10% of their time over a four-week
period organising press conferences or a public event? The answer is
that it is not unreasonable, and it is not an overly burdensome
requirement, to ask third parties to make such an honest
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000138">The
final point I would like to highlight to noble Lords regards the
statutory review period provided for by the Bill. The review will carry
out a comprehensive assessment of the operation of the Bill as it
operates during the 2015 general election. It will then make
recommendations on how the regulatory regime for third parties may be
improved. Surely we want the review to have available to it all the
necessary information as to how the third party regulatory regime
operates. While it is true to say that both the Electoral Commission
and the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee in the
House of Commons argue that staff costs should be excluded for the 2015
general election, they both support the principle of staff costs being
included. In light of this, the Government would argue that we should
include staff costs for all controlled expenditure activity and let the
review look at the evidence of how this regime operates during the 2015
general election. We will then have the fullest evidence base on which
we can make sensible judgments for the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:15:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:16:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14012860000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000268">4.15

debates on this Bill, no evidence has been provided that third-party
campaigners cannot undertake this task; indeed, the evidence of the
last two general elections clearly suggests that it has not been a
problem to calculate these costs in respect of these two elections. If
we are talking about having to do a five-minute timesheet, that is
clearly not a burden that we want to impose on campaigning
organisations. However, I think that the idea that the Electoral
Commission has worked out for assessment—it has had to do this
over the past two general elections—is the right one. I think I
have mentioned before in general terms that the Government looked at
bringing forward a de minimis exemption or exclusion of staffing costs.

Lord has indicated, this is about the exclusion of background staff
costs from regulated expenditure. First, let me emphasise that
campaigning groups fully support the idea of a wider range of
activities being brought within the scope of regulation than were
originally in PPERA. They fully support this in the interests of
greater transparency. This range of activities is set out in proposed
Schedule 8A of PPERA, which refers to material being made available to
the public, such as leaflets, canvassing and market research, press
conferences and media events, transport costs, rallies and public

that aspect and recommended that no staff costs should count towards

Bill. I remind the House that all that campaigning potentially comes
within the scope of the Bill, even if it is not particularly directed
towards any particular party or candidate, because of the subsections
to Clause 26 which provide that you do not have to mention the name of
the party and it does not have to be your first intention, but you can
still be reasonably interpreted as being biased towards one
party or another. Any campaigning by those big organisations becomes
problematical under the

that they are expected under the Bill to take staff costs into account.
That is what the Bill states. If they are expected under the Bill to
take staff costs into account, presumably they are expected in some way
to provide a note of what those costs are. They have to go about that
in one way or another, and that involves a lot of scrutinising of the

minor difference between what the noble and right reverend Lord has

not agree with that and I do not now, since some of those

election material—are significant. I think we are all at one on
that now, and they could be very significant in particular
circumstances. Those costs are already regulated under the
Labour Government’s Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000, and rightly so. Non-party organisations have had to
account for those in both the 2005 and the 2010 general

press conferences and rallies and in relation to transport, as the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, has said. I do not know if
my noble and learned friend can give adequate reassurance now on those
points. I heard what he said just now, but I hope he may be able to go
into some greater detail about the guidance that will be given to
campaigners. Perhaps he can say that despite what the Bill says,
somehow the incidental costs of someone travelling to a rally or
booking the room for a press conference will not be included. However,
I do not see where the de minimis provision 
<?notus-xml column=1104?>is in the Bill. How will the Electoral Commission guidance deal with

there is not a clear indication of how that might happen. As he will

and with greater success of course—I had a few at council level
that were more successful—in the heat of a campaign it is going
to be very difficult for any organisation to adjudicate on these

that this is a fact of life. It is one of the reasons that I referred

Of all the matters raised in relation to the Bill, this is the one
which many of the charities and campaigning organisations which gave
evidence before the Harries commission raised as the most important for
them. It was the one about which, above all, they felt most strongly

that all that he is suggesting is an honest assessment. But what is the

However, I have a particular question for him because many charities
are sustained by the work of elderly volunteers. I think all of us who
go to charity shops are conscious that much of the work being done is
done by them. Not only is the work done by them; their lives are
substantially enriched by their involvement and commitment to a

kind or a part-time worker has expenses which they can then ask the
charity to meet—for example, for meals, transport and so

answer and because the issue here is not just one of bureaucracy. There

remind the noble Lords that, as regards the level of regulation and

financial forces on both sides are evenly balanced and there is

have. That is the position in principle. Therefore, it cannot be said

we are really arguing only about the next general election. Originally,
as all noble Lords will remember, the point was that under the Bill,
the regulated period was going to start in May of this year. At that
point, the Electoral Commission said, “This is too soon. If we
are going to have to deal with all this extra detail, the charities
will have difficulty in doing so—and so will the Electoral
Commission”. That is the springboard from which the commission
made its position plain; that there would perhaps be practical
difficulties in doing it for this general
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012860000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012860000170">Since<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:39:19"></hs_TimeCode>
then, of course, the Government have changed their position. We are now
talking about a much reduced regulatory period of seven and a half
months. We are talking about the whole of the summer—the spring
and the summer and the early autumn—when it is possible for the
charities to look at this, if they are regulated, and to come to some
conclusion. That dramatically changes the position. Although the
Electoral Commission, as the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries, fairly pointed out, still has some reservations about the next
general election, it says in its latest advice that the amendment of
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, has only some
advantages over the Government’s. That is fairly constrained
language. It is a question of either/or, and it is not a very strong
recommendation in favour of one or the other; it is saying that there
are some advantages to the Harries amendment over the
Government’s present position. It is not a big sell, in other

addition, as the Minister said, what we are looking for here in 2015

excessive detail, because excessive detail cannot be provided and
probably cannot be checked, as the noble Lord, Lord
Tyler<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>, pointed
out, on the timescale we are talking about in the middle of the general
election. Lots of things are in practice unenforceable—even now,

timescale of a general election. We are looking at an honest
assessment. Thereafter, the review, which has to take

Martin of Springburn (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, let
me say briefly that I have the highest regard for the charities in the
United Kingdom, but I also have a deep concern about how general
elections and constituency elections are fought. My worry is about the
single-issue organisations that can be created. Some charities go 
<?notus-xml column=1108?>back 100 or 150 years, but a single-issue
organisation could be created this evening with the aim of undermining
a candidate in a constituency.</hs_para>

time, there might be a legitimate argument about saving a hospital.
However, I can point to the fact that, in one of the English
constituencies, a government Minister was defeated by a candidate who
was fighting on a “Save the hospital” campaign. I have no
argument against that candidate, who did the legitimate thing by
standing, getting enough assenters for a nomination form and nailing
his colours to the mast in saying, “I am the candidate fighting
against the hospital
closure”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000003">That
is one thing, but if you get a single-issue organisation that starts up
a year before a general election —bear in mind that
we know the date of that election—then that is something unique.
Such organisations can say, “Right, we’ll get a campaign
started within a constituency”, and they can spend more money
than any individual
candidate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:43:39"></hs_TimeCode>. A
noble Lord says that that is not true, but they can. They could spend
perhaps £16,000. When I stood for re-election as Mr Speaker, my

more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000004">Okay, we
live in a democracy, but if a single-issue organisation is on the go,
we are entitled to ask that it give an account of how it spends its
money and where it gets its money from—that is also important.
If the organisation is campaigning on, say, a hospital issue, it is
allowed to canvass, to go on the doorsteps and to arrange press
conferences, rallies and all the rest of it. When Parliament is
dissolved, it might say, “We have a good case for putting up a
candidate”. If in those circumstances it goes from being a
single-issue organisation to putting up a candidate, it could have
spent far more than any single
candidate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000005">We
are talking about what is, often, power without responsibility. I cling
to the argument about hospitals. If a Conservative candidate says,
“I want to save the hospital”, the question that will be
posed to that candidate is, “Well, what other hospital in the
area will you close down?”, because the budget will not support
every hospital in the area. A single-issue organisation has the power
but not the responsibility. Okay, I agree that we live in a democracy,
but it is not rocket science to record how many phone calls were made
or how many canvassers were put out, particularly in these days of
electronic

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, the problem with
including staff costs is the issue of workability. As we have heard
from the NCVO, ACEVO and the people who run these charities, what is in
the Bill at the moment is simply not workable. As I said earlier, the
Bill asks these voluntary organisations to divvy up their staff costs,
including national insurance and pension contributions, not only by
which part of 
<?notus-xml column=1109?>the country they live in but by what chunk of their
work has gone on campaigning on an issue that subsequently attains high
political saliency. This is not even about keeping records, given that
the organisation may have to go back and look at

talking about is not just the designing of an election leaflet but the
office staff who help to steward a meeting or arrange visiting
speakers. It is not for nothing that organisations such as the British
Legion support this amendment, as does the BMA. The BMA says that there
is a clear and compelling case to ease the bureaucratic burden to help
non-party campaigners comply with the legislation. They want to be able
to live within the law, which should not be written in a way that makes
it impossible for them to keep to it. They do not want to be tangled up
with bureaucratic demands that they might fall foul of. Surely we want
to help them by not putting unnecessary burdens on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000009">Earlier,
the noble and learned Lord again used the word
“intended”. We had an exchange on that before, but not
everyone was here so let me repeat the argument. As the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, said, we are talking here not just about
campaigns that are “intended” to promote a candidate.
Clause 26 goes much further than that, because it could include things
that turn out to help, or indeed harm, a party. Given the exchange
between the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and my noble friend Lord Rooker, it
could be that a charity has campaigned for fluoridation, which then
becomes an issue with one party in favour and another against. The
charity, which has been campaigning for fluoridation, would then
suddenly find that this is a political issue, so it will need to
account for its staff costs. We are not talking about people moving
into a constituency; we are talking about charities that campaign on
such issues, which could then be caught up in this
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000010">What
is the purpose of insisting on the inclusion of such costs? This is not
about taking big money out of politics. It risks placing motivated,
altruistic organisations in a position where they can either campaign
freely for what they believe in, provided that they deal with all this
red tape, or go quiet. The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, may not like the
word “gagging”, but if people choose not to criticise a
policy because they are worried about the red tape, that sounds like a
gag to me. I think this House would be well advised to send this
amendment back down the corridor and say that it is unnecessary,
unworkable and does nothing about

that we were much more amenable to accepting his amendment. 
<?notus-xml column=1110?>Unfortunately, his amendment does not do what it says on the tin,
because it would allow substantial staff costs to be excluded, not just
background ones. For example, it could be that a campaigning
organisation decides to employ someone for the regulated period to run
rallies or press conferences. That would be their specific job, and if
it fell within the definition of controlled expenditure under the
amendment as it stands, it would not be caught. I do not think that is
simply background staff costs.</hs_para>

difference between us. As we have indicated, we are not looking to have
five-minute breakdowns of how time is spent. That is not what is
intended. Let us go back to the origins of this. The noble Baroness,
Lady Mallalieu, said it is the issue that perhaps came up more than any
other in all the discussions—possibly coalitions was a close
second or perhaps just slightly ahead. From meetings which I attended
with my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who attended a lot more
than I did, I am certainly aware that the issue of staff costs came
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000014">It is
worth reminding ourselves that, when we were conducting these
discussions, the difficulties that many of these organisations
expressed were about the extension of staff costs into areas such as
press, media and transport costs, given that the threshold originally
proposed was £5,000 in England and £2,000 in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. There was genuine concern, not least
among charities, that inadvertently some of the work they were doing
could take them over the threshold. The Government recognised that. For
those issues of canvassing and election material and so on, staff costs
will now need to be accounted for, but that will be against a
background of a £20,000 threshold in England and a
£10,000 threshold in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Indeed, as my noble friend Lord Horam pertinently pointed out, we are
also now looking at a regulated period of just over seven and a half
months, rather than just under 12 months as was originally
proposed in the Bill.</hs_para>

charities and other organisations. About the biggest thing we have done
is to raise these thresholds. If you are spending £20,000 to
campaign on an issue that falls within the definition of controlled
expenditure, I honestly do not believe that it is something that you
inadvertently slide into. It must require quite serious thought to do
that. That is the reassurance I would give to the noble Lord, Lord
Walton, who expressed the views of the
charities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000016">We
had a debate on charities, and I am not going to go over all that
ground again, but I think it was clear from that debate that it is
thought that on only a very narrow band of activity could charities be
subject to both Electoral Commission regulation and Charity Commission
regulation. Indeed, most charities would not want to take up a
position. Historically, they have not taken on positions where they
would have been seen to be partial to a particular party or candidate.
It is important that we put that in context.</hs_para>

want to put in context is that, in fact, there is nothing in this Bill
that relates specifically to staff costs. What we have done is to use
the architecture of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000, brought forward by the party opposite when 
<?notus-xml column=1111?>it was in government, and that architecture applies
to the additional range of activities. One cannot say that the whole
idea of staff costs is new; it is not. When the party opposite was in
government, it brought in a regime in which third parties had to
account for their costs and expenditure, including staff costs in
regard to election materials. The noble Baroness is shaking her head,
but there is nothing more in terms of the definition of staff costs in
this Bill than that. I accept that this extends to media events, press
events, rallies and transport. However, as my noble friend Lord Horam
said, the Electoral Commission would like to see all of these included
for political
parties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000018">It is
a matter of judgment as to whether this should be done for the 2015
election. I argued earlier that, given there will be a review, it might
be better to have a review based on some experience. However, the
experience that we have had with the approach adopted by the Electoral
Commission in two elections is that it appears not to have caused
problems. It is the case that some 30 organisations were recognised
third parties at the 2010 general election and those that incurred
expenditure included their staff costs in their spending returns. We
were not aware of any difficulties in calculating these costs. Hope not
Hate, which was referred to in the debate, was one of these registered
organisations. It is worth while to get some context: of these 30
organisations, only two were charities. As I have said already, we have
also raised the threshold quite
significantly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0001.htm#14012881000019">My

share a common objective in not wishing to have the additional burden

that is our common objective, I think that the difference between us is
that the amendment which I, on behalf of the Commons, am seeking to
reject is one that does not just deal with background staff but would
drive a coach and horses through the whole idea of including staff
costs. For example, in the case of a third party being able to employ
someone to run a whole series of rallies over the regulatory period of
seven and a half months, that would fall within the definition of
controlled expenditure. That goes far further than what would simply be

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to
Amendment 53ZAAA. The two amendments cover different aspects of sex and
relationship education in schools. The first calls for guidance on sex
and relationship education to be updated. The second calls for it to be
taught on an age-appropriate basis in all state-funded schools. The
rules of relationships and sexual contact are moving faster than we
ever could have imagined when we were growing up. Universal access to
the internet, social media, smartphones and music videos are
sexualising children with profound and often damaging consequences. As
adults, we only now are getting an insight into the secret world of
children’s sexual behaviour, which often is now modelled on
images that they see on the screen and in chatrooms. Some of it is
innocent but much of it is

is now powerful and authoritative evidence of the extent to which young
people are being sexualised from a very early age. For example, a
Cardiff University study of pre-teen children aged between 10 and 12
showed that, even at primary school, children were gaining status from
having a boyfriend or a girlfriend and using the language of fancying
them, dating them and being dumped by them. The young girls in the
study often illustrated that they were putting up with verbal abuse and
harassment, which, sadly, they interpreted as a sign of flirtation or
affection, and under pressure to participate in activities that made
them feel uncomfortable or vulnerable to being passed around and being

a recent study from the Children’s Commissioner found that boys

negative attitudes towards women, such as viewing them as sex objects,
and encouraging earlier and riskier sexual activity. This was

pornography to learn how to behave in a relationship, with three times

It is not just academics and policymakers. There is widespread public
concern about this issue. The <I>Daily Telegraph</I> has been leading a
campaign for better sex education, and for sex and relationship
education to be brought into the 21st century; and a new generation of
young women involved in groups such as the One Billion Rising campaign
to end violence against women globally, and the End Violence Against

letter to the <I>Times</I> yesterday this call was echoed by a diverse
group which included Mumsnet, Womens Aid, Everyday Sexism, Rape Crisis,

polling. For example, a Mumsnet survey last year showed that 92% of
respondents thought that sex and relationship education should be
compulsory in secondary schools, and 69% thought it should be so in
primary schools. A similar study of parents for the National

it seems that the Department for Education has been the very last group
to wake up to the fact that something needs to be done. When we debated
these issues in Committee, the Minister’s attitude was at best
complacent, arguing that there was no need for further education or
guidance. Indeed, he listed all the policies and guidance that were
already in existence, to which my response is that they have been
remarkably unsuccessful so far, given the scale of sexism, harassment
and bullying over the same period. However, since then there does
appear to have been a bit of a rethink, and the Minister has made some
concessions on the issue of updating the guidance, which is the subject

Unfortunately, not all do it well, some do it very badly and some do
not do it at all. I do not feel that we are ready yet to have it as an
established part of a national curriculum. All schools are required 
<?notus-xml column=1124?>in their returns on their curriculum to say what they do about
SRE—and, indeed, PSHE; I agree with my noble friend Lady

passionately that all children should have access to good quality PSHE,

point of what children understand makes for their well-being. Over and
over again, children said that one of their top priorities was their
friendships. They were trying to find their way through a complex,
labyrinthine world in which friendships, intimacy and relationships had
to be understood in this technological age, which has been so vividly

at compulsory sex and relationship education. It included young people,
educationalists, experts from organisations such as Brook and the
British Pregnancy Advisory Service, and representatives from the major
faith groups. There were representatives from the Anglican Church, the
Catholic Education Service—I had very good conversations with
Vincent Nichols and I warmly congratulate him on being made a
cardinal—the non-conformist faiths, the Muslim faith and the

already been round this track not once, but twice. I urge noble Lords

into sexual education that is not embarrassing. In other words, if, as
I have experienced, children come home from school and discuss
“Romeo and Juliet”, or discuss a Mozart opera, you find
yourself talking about precisely these points. That is not to say that

support the amendments and thank my noble friend Lady Jones for placing
them before the House. I want to make reference to the noble Baroness,
Lady Kidron, who, rather under a cloak of humility, did not mention a
film which she recently made about the internet. It starts with a very
disturbing episode about young men—15 year-old
boys—watching pornography and the extent to which it was almost
an addiction for them and how, increasingly, they wanted to see more
explicit imagery. They then recognised in conversation that it had
affected the way that they felt about girls and what they expected of
girls sexually, and how it had contaminated relationships in the

about the Ofsted report from back in 2013, which has already been
referred to. It pointed out to us that sex and relationship education
required improvement in more than a third of our schools. In primary
schools, that was because far too much emphasis was being placed on
being nice to your friends— we want that—but very little
was being said about the fact that more and more girls reach
menstruation in primary schools. Puberty is coming earlier for our
children and they were not being prepared for many of those physical
and emotional changes in those later years of primary school. When they
reached secondary school, they were then ill prepared for what they
often faced in the company of boys—boys who were watching the
kind of pornography that I have spoken
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012881000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#14012881000092">In
secondary schools, the complaint made by Ofsted was that the mechanics
of reproduction were being presented in a rather biological way to
young people and that there was too little talk about relationships,
sexuality, the influence of pornography or a real and proper
understanding of healthy sexual relationships. As people who are coming
to the further end of our lives, we all know that fulfilling emotional
relationships and sexual relationships come out of mutual respect.

are not treating girls with

perform sexually and the extent to which the first introduction of
girls to sex is in providing oral sex to boys. The girls might be only
12 or 13, and the boys only 14 and 15. This is the world in which we
are living and I do not want us to cloak it in discussions about how
this should be left to parents or particular religious groupings,
because these boys and girls do not come from any particular grouping
in our society. This is happening across all social divides, in all
classes and in all religious groupings. Those pressures have to be a
subject of concern to us. They lead to unhealthy relationships and,
ultimately, often to violent and degrading relationships for
women.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012881000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#14012881000094">That

in our society, where we really are facing a crisis. Women are facing a

they were in adolescence. I could not be present when my boys were at
school where they would inevitably be shown imagery, as all boys were,

something which the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said about leaving it

then surely it is like any other subject. It is age-appropriate,
structured and has good resources. I remember a parent once saying to

Northbourne (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I can identify with many of
the anxieties that have been expressed today. I want to make just one
point about the heading in the amendment: “Sex and relationship
education”. Not all relationships are about sex and, in the
first place, the extent to which sex and relationship education should
address non-sexual relationships is not entirely clear. However, it is
certainly an important issue. Whether you turn on to see “Call
the Midwife” or David Attenborough and his penguins, or whatever
you look at, the ongoing and nurturing relationships between, I hope,
both parents and the child are crucially important and a great
happiness. As I listen to your Lordships, it sounds as if we are all
trying to tell them what not to do. There is a case for trying to take
a more positive approach, if that is
possible.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_28_PT_1/CDA6A637950DD2AAEF748F4D2C4CC5E2B1370B52" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 January 2014">Tuesday,

Knight of Collingtree (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, there is just a
small question that worries me very much. I was unable to listen to as
much of this debate as I wanted, but what concerns me is that there
seems to be no understanding that there is a time in a child’s
life when it is not a very good idea to talk about sex. I was appalled
on finding out, when I was dealing with other matters in the other
place, that children as young as four were being told in sex education
how to perform the sex act—in fact, how to perform all kinds of
sex acts. That shocked me very much, because I believe that it is very
important indeed to guard a child’s innocence. While I have no
objection to older children being taught about this, the only reference
to that that I could find in the amendment is the requirement
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012889000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#14012889000060">“SRE

inappropriate and very badly taught. I would be very concerned about
how we would guarantee the quality of that kind of teaching. We all
hear that in some schools—although not all—things like
career advice are given as an aside and, because they are not

are not terribly well taught. This issue is incredibly important and,

would, however, like to ask a couple of things of the Minister while I
am thinking through where I stand. First, I am concerned that the
review will not be comprehensive. The world is so different now. To the
noble Lord, Lord Knight, I say it is a very different world to even
when the noble Lord was putting his group together. It is certainly a
very different world from when I was listening to children talking on
the lines at ChildLine. Even then, very young children were extremely
confused about sexuality. There is no doubt that we need to get sex
education for all children firmly into the educational
process.</hs_para>

say to the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, that the age of innocence, with
respect, has long since past. If you have watched the penguins with
David Attenborough or the midwife programme, you have it all there
before you. Much as we would like our children to be innocent, what the
parents that I talk to worry about is not the innocence of their
children but how their children will protect themselves and retain
their own capacity to be responsible in a world that bombards them
continually with these images. No child who lives in the modern world,
unless they are totally in a bubble, is going to escape that. We have
got to ensure somehow that they are
prepared.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012889000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#14012889000011">In
saying that, however, I want to hear what the Minister has to say about
PSHE. I thought my noble friend made an extremely important point about
relationship education not being all about sex, and I hope
the noble Lord will hear that and, indeed, others who have spoken.
Certainly, as the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said, what came out time
and time again when talking to children at ChildLine was that the issue
was not just sex but the whole relationships issue—their
friendships, how they negotiated groups and how they managed to move
from one friendship to another without trauma. That was what mattered
to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012889000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#14012889000012">Unless<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T18:17:36"></hs_TimeCode>

am uneasy, however, about voting for an amendment that simply puts sex
education on the statute book without thinking through the complexity
around how we achieve it. So my last question for the Minister is this:
if he has an expert group and if he looks at how this might be
introduced, would there be a timetable with an end date, so we do not
go around the circle yet again without coming to an end that achieves
something for our young people, who desperately need it in this modern

has always done well is sex and relationship education policy; indeed,
many other authorities use its framework. I particularly want to
reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Knight, that explicit sex, in the
terms that I think worry many people, is not taught at key stage 1.
Actually, the key stage SRE policy is vital because it provides child
protection. I am looking at the Cambridgeshire syllabus at the moment,
and it says that children must understand that they have rights over
their own bodies, understand what makes them feel comfortable and
uncomfortable 
<?notus-xml column=1133?>and learn how to speak about it. That is exactly

You can pass such an amendment but we must also get quality training
for our teachers in PSHE and sex and relationship education, and
leadership in schools that does not look at this as a little tick-box
exercise and say, “Well, we’ve done that, we’ve
carried out our duties and if Ofsted come along we can show them a bit
of paperwork here”. I have seen that happen far too often. It is
also about inspectors, when they go into schools, properly ensuring
that PSHE is being taught. We as a society have to understand and

do to support young people in schools.</hs_para>

no. Why are we not giving as much importance 
<?notus-xml column=1134?>to ensuring that all our schools, whether they be academies, maintained

introduced academies and I understand why they did so; they wanted, if
you like, to give a sort of uniqueness to them by saying, “Okay,
you can have more control over your curriculum”. However, that
has suddenly now led to a huge growth in academies—some 53% of
our secondary schools are academies—so half our schools will not
be bound by any amendment that is carried. We—again, as a
society—should say that a narrow national curriculum should say,
as it does on the label, that it is national and it is a curriculum for
all. I hope that we will give some thought to ensuring that this

There is no point in setting this up unless we listen to what these

signpost schools to further sources of advice on specific safeguarding

secondary schools, by legislating for all compulsory SRE in primary
schools and all academies. It would mean compulsory SRE for children as
young as six. Many primary schools already choose to teach SRE
according to children’s age and development, consulting their
parents and using age-appropriate resources. In particular, good
primary schools are committed to helping children develop an
understanding of positive and appropriate relationships. The new

believe that this is the best approach, with the right balance between
legal requirement and professional judgment, taking account of the
evidence about child development and maintaining the support of

teachers and governors any control over their school’s approach
to SRE. It would also impose on academies a new requirement, when in

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who
have contributed to this debate. I also thank the Minister for his
response. I agree that we have had a very thoughtful and well informed
debate. First, I reiterate what I said at the outset: we welcome the
fact that SRE guidance is now going to be amended. We
acknowledge that step forward. We are increasingly coming round to the
point of view that that in itself is simply not enough.
My noble friend Lord Knight made the point that under
the previous Labour Government, relying on voluntary steps got us so
far but did not make the transformation that we wanted. That is why we
were working round to the idea that PSHE should become compulsory
because we had had voluntary advice and guidance for a very
long time and not a lot had changed. We all welcome the involvement of
the PSHE Association in updating the guidance. Today, it has issued a
statement saying that guidance is not enough. It says that it supports
both the amendments that have been tabled today.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140128102000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000002">The noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, rather reluctantly acknowledged that our amendments are
a step in the right direction. I welcome that. It was, of course, open
to her side to table an amendment on PSHE if she felt so passionately
about it, but nevertheless I hope she will acknowledge that our
amendment is a step forward. I agree with my noble friend Lady Kennedy
that we should rise above using this as a political football. We have
much in common across the Chamber on this and are concerned about what
is happening with the exploitation of young people. We need to address
that and should not just try to score points on
it.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140128102000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000208">6.45

amendment talks about the education being age-appropriate. I reiterate
that. Parents can be reassured because the amendment talks about the
compulsory education being based on the revised guidance
that the Secretary of State is overseeing. I am sure that he
will make sure that that guidance is appropriate. It will also be
overseen by individual schools’ governing bodies, 
<?notus-xml column=1140?>so people can be reassured about some of the concerns expressed about
the danger of what will be taught in schools. I hope I made it clear in
my opening statement that I do not think the focus should be on the
mechanics of sex but on relationships. We have all identified that.
That is particularly true at primary school level where young people
need to understand the basis of friendships, the basis of exploitation,
the power games that take place and so on. Those all start at primary
school level, as was illustrated by a number of noble Lords. Various
studies have found that more than 80% of parents are requesting
compulsory sex and relationship education, so there is widespread
support for the
position.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000004">This
is not about telling teachers how to teach. We of course respect their
professionalism. However, teachers are telling us that they need more
guidance and training on this issue. What they want is a structured
programme which has status and priority within the school. These views
have been echoed by the PSHE Association today. A number of noble Lords
mentioned that a recent Ofsted report focused on the fact that current
teaching of sex and relationship education is simply not good enough
so, without wishing to say that the Minister is being complacent about
this, I think we need to do more. It is not just about issuing more
guidance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140128102000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000005">I
agree absolutely with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Leicester that children’s voices are missing from this debate,
but ultimately, if we do not act to make sex and relationship education
compulsory, it will be children who suffer. Those are all issues that
we have identified this afternoon. Examples of abuse, harassment and
suffering have given rise to this debate.</hs_para>

confident that we know what our children and our grandchildren are
accessing on the internet and on social media sites. We are ignorant
about all of this, so we need to intervene and to intervene at an
earlier age. We can be confident that all young people have been taught
the rules of behaviour to counteract online exploitation only if we do
it through a structured, compulsory SRE programme. I do not say that
that is the total answer, but it would certainly be a real step
forward, and we are offering that today. I hope noble Lords will take
it up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000007">I
accept that the guidance is a step forward, and therefore I will
withdraw Amendment 53, but I give notice that when Amendment 53ZAAA is
called, which I understand will be after the next debate, I will at
that point test the opinion of the House because I do not believe that
the Minister has answered sufficiently. I beg leave to
withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

Massey of Darwen:</Member></B> My Lords, in introducing this amendment,
I first thank the Minister and his officials for the way in which they
have wrestled with the issue of PSHE in schools and what further needs
to be done to ensure that all children and young people
benefit from school policies which support their emotional, physical,
spiritual and academic development. I mean all pupils in all schools.
The Minister has shown strong leadership in this and has clearly
expressed his belief that good schools inevitably have at their core an
effective programme of personal, social and health education, with an
emphasis on relationships and development. I, like many of your
Lordships, wish that this were compulsory—statutory—but
we are where we are and I think that we have made progress.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140128102000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000009">In meetings with
colleagues, it has been agreed that PSHE is not limited to the taught,
formal curriculum, although the formal curriculum contributes to PSHE.
Lessons about drugs, alcohol, sexual relationships, diet, being safe,
first aid and so on are important. Their importance has been
demonstrated recently in the concern of the Chief Medical Officer about
children’s health, in evidence of the influence of the internet
on children, as we have heard already, and in the danger of new drugs,
including legal highs. Children need skills to resist unsavoury
pressure and that is part of PSHE. I remember an interview with the
mother of a young woman, a medical student, who died after being given
a dose of a dangerous substance by a friend. The mother said,
“If only they had had education about this”.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140128102000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000010">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T18:44:58"></hs_TimeCode>
do not think that we hear enough about the influence of education in
tackling such issues. Schools cannot do it all, but they can
contribute. I have seen effective lessons in schools delivered by
experts on a particular topic with the teacher present; lessons on, for
example, sexual health from the school nurse, or drugs from a drugs
charity or first aid from St John Ambulance. Many charities and
services now have educational arms with people trained to talk to young
people. Teachers are not on their own. The PSHE Association and other
charities have developed schemes of work that schools can adapt to
their own needs.</hs_para>

aspects of the amendment, it calls for instruction in schools to be
transparent, obvious and spelt out to staff, pupils, school governors 
<?notus-xml column=1142?>and parents. As I and others asked in Committee, if a school policy on,
for example, children with long-term health needs or on bullying, is
not clear and apparent, how can people in the school know what to do?
If the intended ethos of the school and the principles of citizenship
are not expressed, then they may be left to chance. If what children
are to be taught about drugs, sex and relationships is not clear, how
do parents, in particular, know what their child is learning? How do
teachers know what is being done in the school, and at what
stage?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000012">There
are two types of children who will benefit from coherent policies and
programmes in PSHE. I am simplifying here, but in the first category
there are children who, frankly, for one reason or another, are
disadvantaged. They may have suffered many kinds of abuse, witnessed
domestic violence, never been talked to, never had books or been read
to. In short, they have been neglected. These children come into school
resentful of authority, unable to socialise, sometimes violent towards
teachers and other children and unable to learn. They will also prevent
others from learning. Being unable to learn, they will fall further and
further behind, becoming more and more disruptive and more disaffected,
unless something is put in place in their school to intervene in this
downward spiral. We all know that this is what happens. Yet I have
seen, as have other noble Lords, where the head teacher says something
like, “This school used to be a nightmare. Staff were abused,
children were out of control and not learning anything. That was four
years ago. Now look at my school. What did we do? We put in a
systematic programme of personal social development, with clear
policies and actions on behaviour, how we treat others, how we increase
self-respect, how we have rights and responsibilities”. Guess
what? The academic results in those schools improve dramatically. Any
Government wanting to improve inequality in education must listen to
those schools and learn from them. There is plenty of
evidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000013">The
other children for whom PSHE is particularly important are those like
the daughter of the mother whom I spoke of earlier: children who are
supported at home, are sociable and keen learners, but who say that
they do not have enough information or skills to negotiate around the
temptations of drugs, alcohol and the internet or to cope with
relationships, including sexual ones. Young people are asking for these
skills. Parents are asking schools to teach
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000014">All
this is why I am delighted to see some action from the Minister. I wish
that there were more pronouncements from Government about the benefits
of PSHE. I wish that they would accept it as a subject that should be
taught. However, we are where we are and there has been progress. An
expert group has been set up to look at the delivery of PSHE—I
hope that it will include young people. There will be a set of case
studies to illustrate good practice. I will say no more, as no doubt
the Minister will expand on the good work that his department has done
since we were in Committee. Therefore I do not intend to call a vote on
this today. I have heard the debate. I have heard people say that SRE
is part of PSHE. I shall think about this debate and consult colleagues
and decide what I shall do at Third

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name to this amendment
but as the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, has explained it so

believe that schools have the duty to their children to promote their
academic, spiritual, cultural, mental and physical development. Schools
will do it in different ways. Amendment 53ZA, crafted by the noble
Baroness, accepts that. I have also come across examples where schools
teach PSHE in specific lessons about particular topics, but in addition
have a whole school ethos that promotes children having respect for
each other, having resilience and self-confidence and all those soft
skills that so many employers are crying out for as well, of course, as
giving them that often life-saving information about sexual matters,
drugs, tobacco and so

about the role of school governors enough as we have gone through this

legislation that to include them in the duty of the school to say what
they are doing about the total development of children is very much to

today, with an increasing number of broken and dysfunctional families,
the role of schools in personal and social education becomes
increasingly important. As your Lordships will remember, 3 million
children are growing up in lone-parent families in this country today.
My amendment is about giving young people, as they grow up in school, a
better opportunity to acquire and to develop the soft skills, those
social, emotional and communication skills which they will need in
life, and to develop what Demos, in its important 2009 report, called
“character capabilities”. All these are essential skills
which they will need as they grow up and move into adult life. The
so-called soft skills, including resilience, self-confidence, empathy,
emotional intelligence, concern for others, communication and
relationship skills, are all important. Soft skills are important in
every walk of life, and without them it is difficult to succeed in
adult
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000024">In an
important article in the <I>Sunday Times</I> on 5 January,
Camilla Cavendish made a strong case for the importance of
“grit” in the labour market today. She

asks, that too many do not have the grit to stick to a project and see
it through? Grit may not sound like a very soft skill, but it is
certainly one 
<?notus-xml column=1145?>that all people will need in life. Other soft skills are also important
for employment, and particularly in the family. I will quote from the
same article, on the subject of teenagers:</hs_parafo>

emphasise, once again, the importance of parenting, which is rather my
subject. It is incredibly important for a child to have in their life a
strong, loving and supportive relationship with at least one and
preferably two parents and, whenever possible, the opportunity to
belong to a supportive family. I return to David Attenborough, the
penguins and all the other animals you see, and the wonderful
relationships they have. In a curious way the reward is partly sexual
excitement, but an even greater reward is seeing the child grow up. I
speak as a grandfather of 11, so I know a bit about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000026">Developing
the soft skills is also very important if we want more social mobility
in our society. The ability to communicate and to empathise is crucial
for promoting social mobility. We all know that the best schools
understand the importance of preparing tomorrow’s parents and
workers with what they need. The best schools already give their pupils
the opportunity to acquire these important skills as they grow up
through the school, not just in the classroom but through a whole range
of other extra-curricular opportunities, through literature, talks,
challenges, working in groups and guided discussion, always exploring
their objectives and what kind of adults they hope to be, learning the
skills they will need to
succeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000027">All
schools are different, which is why the noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
and I, both decided that it was much better, rather than trying to
spell out in detail what schools should do, to say to them, “You
get on with it and think about it; decide what your programme will be
and take advice where you want to. Having made up your mind, you must
publish a clear statement of your objectives and of how you hope to
achieve them so that the public, parents, Ofsted and anyone else who
needs to know can see what you are trying to do”. This will
enable the schools that are doing well to acquire credit, and the
schools that are doing less well will see where they are falling short
and will probably be led to do
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000028">My
Amendment 53ZAA is designed to make it absolutely clear that schools
are expected to give guidance to pupils and to explore with them the
challenges they are likely to encounter as they move into adult life.
It also requires schools to consider how they can help pupils to
develop personal, social and communication skills. It emphasises that
the best way to achieve these objectives may often be through guided
discussion in school and through extra-curricular activities such as,
for example, the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award scheme, team games,

to speak to young people under the PSHE banner, I am amazed at how many
are affected by being told that they are worthy and at how their
confidence is boosted. Some are never told that they are loved
unconditionally and that they can achieve. They have no parental
guidance. PSHE helps them to cope with the materialistic, commercially
led world they are living in. It helps them to learn how to deal with
morality, honesty and integrity, and to understand that they can grow
up in our society and be someone in whom people can put their trust.
That is very important in today’s society, and children need
guidance in that direction. Every child in the country, no matter what
their background, needs to be exposed to good PSHE. We owe it to our
future generation, so I support the amendment

Lords who have contributed their knowledge and insights on this
important matter. I am particularly grateful to the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, for her constructive and well argued contribution and for

debates and discussions on PSHE, SRE and related matters,
two things have become clear to me. The first is that in the
field of PSHE and SRE —character resilience, producing rounded
and grounded young people, raising aspirations, pastoral care and so
on—we share a common view that all these matters are absolutely
essential to what a good school does. As I have already mentioned, we
should embrace this as an example of how, despite the politics that
often surround education, we have an absolutely common purpose when it
comes to our expectations of schools. Certainly, I have a very high
expectation of schools on these matters, and they should engage with
all the relevant organisations and charities and so on to
meet this.</hs_para>

for the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, I intend to
ensure that there is such a culture change. This is absolutely
essential in the offer of academy groups that are taking over schools
that have been failing for years. They appreciate that there is no way
that they can engage these children in education unless they are in the
right frame of mind. We also know that, sadly, in recent decades our
society has collapsed so much that schools have to do much more,
standing in the position of parents in supporting children’s
education. To me, PSHE is absolutely central. It is something that all
good schools should do, and we are seeing it happen increasingly as we
improve the state of education.</hs_para>

perhaps I have been a little bit slow to grasp—I particularly
thank the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, for bringing this home to
me—is that not all schools share the belief that PHSE and SRE
are so central and important. We need to give them all the help we can
to link them to organisations which are specialists in the various
areas and are able to update their advice, guidance, training and so on
in a dynamic way, keeping abreast of the
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000037">Noble
Lords have heard me say many times that this Government do not wish to
be too prescriptive about precisely what they set out for teachers.

Amendment 53ZA on PSHE, I agree with the importance of the underlying
aim of this amendment—that all schools should be accountable to
parents. As I explained in Grand Committee, in 2012 we amended the
school information regulations to specify the minimum information that
a maintained school is required to publish, with academy funding
agreements having similar requirements. This covers the curriculum for
each subject in each school year, including PSHE, and it includes
details of how parents may obtain more information. In addition,
Ofsted’s inspection framework requires inspectors to consider
pupils’ spiritual, moral, social and cultural development when
forming
judgments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000039">The
evidence shows that social skills such as resilience and teamwork are
likely to support children’s achievement and successful
participation in education and employment. 
<?notus-xml column=1148?>Ofsted’s report on PSHE in 2013 found that all but two of the
outstanding schools covered in the report were also outstanding for
PSHE education, with the other two outstanding schools having good
PSHE. DfE research in 2012 found that children with higher levels of
emotional, behavioural and social well-being on average have higher
levels of academic achievement. That is supported by international
evidence on the links between success at school and social skills,
including resilience, emotional intelligence, teamwork and so on. I
know from personal experience that good schools understand this and
therefore give PSHE an important place in the school curriculum.
However, partly as a result of discussions with the noble Baroness, I
am not convinced that every school shares the same
understanding. Therefore, I have taken action as a matter of priority,
as I explained in my letter to noble Lords, to remind schools that they
are expected to teach PSHE, and we should offer ideas and inspiration
by highlighting examples of good practice.</hs_para>

importance of PSHE in the introduction to the new national curriculum,
and we are also using other methods and channels to encourage and
inspire schools. For example, we included a reminder in the termly
e-mail to all schools, issued on 15 January. This e-mail is usually
reserved for messages to schools about new requirements and critical
information. By using the e-mail to remind schools about PSHE, we are
emphasising that we consider it a real priority. In the
governors’ handbook, published this month, we have encouraged
governors to hold teachers to account by asking constructive questions
about the school’s approach to pupils’ well-being. In
addition, we are making full use of digital channels, including the
department’s pages on the <I>Times Educational Supplement</I>
website—by far the most popular website among teachers—to
steer teachers towards high-quality resources that deal effectively
with PSHE topics.</hs_para>

responding to Amendment 53, I have already highlighted examples of
up-to-date resources on sex and relationships that we are promoting
through relevant channels, and I explained in the earlier debate on SRE
that we are establishing the PSHE expert subject group to support
better teaching and improve PSHE delivery. This is the approach that we
are taking to subjects in the national curriculum, and I hope that
noble Lords will agree that it demonstrates the Government’s
commitment to PSHE and
SRE.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000042">Finally,
I am pleased to announce that we will be funding the PSHE Association
for a further financial year, and it has agreed to produce a set of
case studies to illustrate excellent PSHE teaching. I know that the
noble Baroness, Lady Massey, has visited Goose Green primary school in
East Dulwich—a very good example of a whole-school approach to
PSHE and its teaching. Case studies such as this will inspire teachers
and provide further impetus to improvements across the school
landscape.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140128102000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000043">I
am personally very pleased to see how my department has responded to
the challenge of raising the profile of PSHE and how it is urging all
schools to follow the lead of the best schools. I know that PSHE is a
subject that good teachers need no persuading about. However, I accept
that we should continue to remind schools of 
<?notus-xml column=1149?>its importance, both as a subject and as part of a whole school ethos
which has a significant impact on a child’s readiness to learn
and adult life. In short, I am fully behind the spirit of this
amendment, as the noble Baroness knows, but I do not consider further
legislation necessary, in the light of the existing requirements and
the additional steps we are
taking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000044">Turning
to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, I
agree with his underlying concern that parenting skills should be
considered a relevant topic for PSHE lessons in which young people
learn about healthy and stable relationships. The statutory guidance is
clear about the value and ethos of family life, grounded in loving and
nurturing relationships. The guidance also contains an expectation that
young people develop positive values and a moral framework to shape
their decisions, judgments and behaviour. Teachers are therefore
expected to explore with their pupils what this means in practice, what
it means for their future lives and what it means for the choices they
might make. In this context, we should trust teachers to decide whether
and how parenting skills could feature in lesson plans. Teachers may
refer to suggested content on parenting, available from the PSHE
Association. Although I am grateful to the noble Lord for proposing the
amendment, I do not consider it necessary to introduce a new
legislative requirement in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000045">To
conclude, I should like once more to extend my thanks to noble Lords
for these amendments and to other noble Lords for contributing to the
debates. I have described some important steps we are taking, but we
need to continue to look for more opportunities. We will work closely
with the PSHE Association in particular and explore other ways in which
we can promote PSHE and improve its teaching. We are beginning to
explore how teaching schools, which are taking a lead in this area, can
support schools, and I welcome Sir Michael Wilshaw’s recent
announcement that Ofsted will be strengthening its approach to teacher
training. Sir Michael explained that inspectors will be “much
tougher” on training providers and on schools that do not
adequately support newly qualified
teachers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000046">I
hope I have reassured noble Lords that I am committed to improving PSHE
and am acting on that commitment. I am extremely grateful to noble

the noble Baroness, Lady Massey. We have achieved a great deal as a
result of working together on these matters. I heard what she said
about reflecting on the debate today and considering whether to bring
anything back at Third Reading. I have to say, I am afraid, that I have
already reflected at length on the amendment and I cannot undertake to
reflect further between now and Third Reading. If she wishes to test

very positive response and for all his hard work and that of his

debates with very little dissent on the importance of

told us about what the Government are doing. Unfortunately, I still
have one serious anxiety. Although regulations require schools to have
a proper and well considered PSHE syllabus, on the sample that I was
able to take the vast majority of schools ignore that obligation. It is
a regulation and therefore, presumably, it is the duty of the local
authority to enforce it. I brought forward my amendment to get this
issue on the statute book so that schools would have to do all these
things that we are talking about. I am sure that the noble Lord may be

Howe of Idlicote (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the new clause to be
inserted under Amendment 53ZAAB proposes, first, that we adopt a
statutory foundation for internet service providers and mobile phone
operator adult content default filters overseen by Ofcom. Secondly, it
proposes that these are backed up with robust, statutory age
verification, which must be conducted before these filters are
disabled. In doing so, I wish to express my sincere thanks for the
support that I have received from across the House, which can be seen
through the fact that the amendment has been co-signed by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, who
had to disappear because of the lateness of the hour to give an award
to a Member of your Lordships’ House, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Benjamin, of Beckenham. I am very grateful for their support. I
also am particularly grateful for all the support I received from
outside organisations, such as the Children’s Charities’
Coalition on Internet Safety, which represents all the major
children’s charities, including Barnardo’s, NSPCC, the
Children’s Society, et cetera, and sees the pressing need for my
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T19:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000056">In
embarking on this debate, I should like to put on the record my thanks
to the Prime Minister for the progress he has made in enhancing child
safety online on a self-regulatory basis through the code of practice
being implemented by the big four internet service providers. However,
I also want to argue that, while welcome as a first step,
self-regulation will not be anything other than a short-term solution
and that regulation should now be placed on a robust statutory
footing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T19:42:06"></hs_TimeCode>. In a
previous debate, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern,
set out the very important principle that if child protection is
sufficiently important to merit statutory protection offline, the same
must be true online.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140128102000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000057">One of the most basic
principles underpinning any civilised society is that those who are
vulnerable—a category that certainly includes
children—should be 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>subject to particularly developed protections through the law. As a
consequence of this, the United Kingdom very properly approaches the
subject of child protection on a statutory foundation in the offline
world. This can be seen, for example, with respect to accessing sex
shops, and buying adult material, or purchasing 18-rated DVDs. While
the law makes clear that if something is illegal offline, it is illegal
online, I am convinced that the protections we put in place to prevent
children accessing legal but adult content should be as robust in legal
terms online as they are offline. If this were not the case, the Prime
Minister would not have worked with ISPs to introduce default filters,
albeit on a self- regulatory
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000058">I will
remind noble Lords of the sort of material we are discussing today by
referring to the so-called “tube” sites, which offer
hardcore video at the click of a play button, with no warnings, splash
pages, or any means of restricting children’s access. If we look
at some Experian Hitwise statistics for UK visits to just six
“tube” sites, the figures are staggering: PornHub gets 66
million monthly UK hits; xHamster, 63 million; XNXX, 29 million;
RedTube, 28 million; Xvideos, 28 million; and YouPorn, 26
million. That is a total of 240 million hits from the UK in a single
month to adult sites, without any form of onsite child
protection.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140128102000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000213">7.45

restrict children’s physical access to cinemas so that they
cannot see an 18 certificate film. We do not allow a retailer to sell a
child an 18-certificate DVD, and the content on television is all
regulated to protect children. If it is necessary to provide all of
these protections for children accessing content offline, the same
level of protection really must be delivered online. It is not as if
children are less vulnerable online; indeed, as noble Lords will
realise, in many ways they are more
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000060">Given the
force of this argument of principle, it is not a surprise that when one
examines the practice of self-regulation, significant problems quickly
become apparent. First, although the big four ISPs have a
self-regulatory code that provides for default filters, this still
leaves between 5% and 10% of the market—well over 1 million
households, and therefore hundreds of thousands of
children—unprotected. Indeed, at least one ISP, Andrews and
Arnold, has publically stated that it will not introduce default
filters. Its home page proudly proclaims, “Unfiltered internet
for all”—including, presumably, for all children. Clearly
it has no intention of introducing default filters, and will do so only
if required by law. If we had a statutory approach to default filters,
as set out in my amendment, all ISPs, including all those that service
the remaining 5% to 10% not covered by the big four code, would
have to introduce default
filters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000061">Secondly,
the level of protection pertaining to the market that is now subject to
the code, is in any event limited because of the industry’s
refusal to provide proper age verification. The provision of default
filters can only really provide proper child protection if it is
combined with robust age verification of anyone electing to disable
default filters, so that they have to demonstrate that they are 18
years old or over. This provision, 
<?notus-xml column=1158?>which is crucially set out in my amendment, is particularly important,
because although adults are the ISP account holders and pay the bills,
often their more technically literate children do the set-up, which
involves making the decision about whether to keep or disable adult
content
filters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000062">Indeed,
instead of age-verifying those seeking to disable default filters
before they are allowed to proceed, the approach the industry has
adopted—called the closed loop—simply involves sending an
e-mail to the account holder, an adult, after the setting has been
changed to inform them of this fact. This is completely unacceptable.
What happens if it takes the account holder a week to read the e-mail?
During that time, their children could be downloading all kinds of
inappropriate adult material. What if the account holder never opens
the
e-mail?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000063">This
is concerning, because polling conducted over the weekend for the
charity CARE, by ComRes, demonstrated that a total of 34% of British
adults— 16.3 million people—say that they would
not read an e-mail from their ISP immediately; 11% said that they would
probably leave the e-mail unread for up to a week; and 9% would be
likely to leave it for more than a week. A staggering 14% said that
they were simply unlikely to read an e-mail from their ISP. That figure
rises to<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> 18%
when we look at the parents of children between five and 10 years old.
These statistics demonstrate that, far from proposing an acceptable
means of avoiding the need for proper age verification, the
self-regulatory closed loop is no basis on which to demonstrate
Britain’s commitment to child safety online.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140128102000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000064">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
self-regulatory experience of mobile phones, which of course stretches
back further than the much more recent ISP codes, is equally
concerning. In 2010, it became apparent that mobile phones using
BlackBerry were not providing adult default filters, in contravention
of the code. BlackBerry was exposed in December 2010 and then agreed to
change, but it is of huge concern that many children were denied
default filters over the five-year period because of
BlackBerry’s failure to have regard to the
code<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000065">Then
just last month, Tesco Mobile was similarly exposed for flouting the
code. This is particularly embarrassing for the Government, because the
Prime Minister had declared in July that all mobile phones were already
subject to default filters, when the reality was that you could
download anything and everything through Tesco Mobile phones. Moreover,
the Government had invited Tesco to sit on the UK Council for Child
Internet
Safety<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000066">Of
course I welcome the fact that BlackBerry has now put its house in
order and I understand that Tesco has done so, too. The truth, however,
is that this is par for the course if you do not consider child
protection sufficiently important to warrant the necessary mobile phone
legislation, which is again proposed by my amendment. If there had just
been the BlackBerry case, one might be tempted to dismiss it as a
one-off—but as Tesco has so eloquently demonstrated, it was not
a one-off, and one wonders whether any other providers are similarly
flouting the
code<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, or indeed
whether at some future date, when the media spotlight is less fixed on
the subject, some providers may become less rigorous

this self-regulation is certainly a step forward, it fails to cover
100% of the market, does not provide proper age verification
and has not been consistently applied in relation to mobile phones. The
end result of these failings, which crucially are all corrected by my

Benjamin:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment tabled by the
noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and I congratulate her on doing so because
there are grave concerns about the damage being caused to children's
mental, physical and moral well-being. Some children as young as six
have been affected because of the inappropriate online adult material
that they have been exposed to. Websites such as those containing
sexual, self-harming or bullying content are taking their toll, as
reported by children’s charities, educationalists, newspapers,
politicians, religious leaders and child psychologists.</hs_para>

people are calling this concern a moral panic, but I call it a moral
emergency. I hope that the Minister agrees that unless we do something
soon we will have a lost generation of adults who have little
understanding of what a healthy, joyful, loving and sexual relationship
is, not to mention thousands of girls who will be psychologically
damaged by their first sexual encounters with boys who have become
addicted to porn since they were very young. These boys themselves are
also damaged because psychologically and mentally they find that girls
are not matching up to the warped sexual fantasy of the ones whom they
see online. Then there are those children who self-harm or commit
suicide. Sadly, there are such reports almost daily due to the sites

them from all inappropriate online content through PSHE. I also
congratulate the Government on taking such a robust stance on working
with the online industry to find solutions to this plague that is
spreading among the nation’s children, many of which are having
some effect. However, the amendment, to which I put my name, goes
further as it compels ISPs and mobile phone companies to comply with
the regulations rather than relying on self-regulation, because some
have been found to be avoiding their responsibilities. Who else in the

Earl of Listowel (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise briefly to offer
my strongest support to my noble friend’s amendment as
vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children and Young
People in Care and Leaving Care. Many of these children have very
unfortunate early experiences of a sexual nature, and as they grow up
through life, they are more likely to become involved in addictions of
various kinds such as alcohol, drugs and cigarettes. They are more
likely to start on these things than other children. If one looks at
their mental health, according to the Office for National Statistics,
10% of children in the general population have mental disorders;
roughly 40% in foster care have mental disorders and 69% in residential
care have such disorders. My concern is that these young people will
particularly tend to look for comfort from this sort of stuff on the
internet—to see it, perhaps, as a form of self-medication and
become addicted to it. I therefore strongly support my noble friend and

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to add a
brief word of my own in support of the amendment. It is a feature of
the amendment, as noble Lords will have noticed, that it places
important duties on Ofcom. In fact, the position that Ofcom occupies in
the structure has been designed to give a 
<?notus-xml column=1161?>robust nature to the system that is being set up:
Ofcom will play a vital part in setting standards, issuing codes and so
on. It is worth noting that the proposal fits very well with the
structure of the Communications Act 2003, which places
duties on Ofcom itself. It also provides that Ofcom shall have such
other functions as may be conferred on it by any other enactment, which

Lucas (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, while I share the concerns of the
noble Baroness—particularly as I have an 11 year-old
daughter—I do not think that her amendment achieves anything. It
asks ISPs to do something that is impossible. How can they provide
subscribers with an internet access service that excludes adult
content? People can use proxy servers; they can link across to their
parents’ computers if they have set their parents’
computers up right; they can use sites that are newly created every day
and whose URLs are spread by e-mail; they can indulge in these things
through chat programmes, where there is nothing about the site that
tells you what it is being used for. There are so many ways in which
the nasty side of the internet can
spread<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:03:03"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
utterly impossible for ISPs to block; there is no technology that would
enable them to perform the functions set out here. How does a little
ISP know which sites in this swiftly moving internet are offering the
content which offends this amendment that were not doing so yesterday
and may not do so
tomorrow<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:03:31"></hs_TimeCode>? They
get passed around by kids and are designed to be fast moving. I cannot
see how there is anything in this approach of requiring individual ISPs
to do things that has any hope of success or of producing a law that is
feasible and possible for individual companies to do.</hs_para>

we were to approach this, perhaps, on a national level by asking our
friends in Cheltenham—who, presumably, already read most of this
stuff—to put a stopper on the stuff that would offend, perhaps
we would have some hope of keeping up with the pace of the avoidance
mechanisms that are out there. Unless we do it in a co-ordinated way
like that, we really have no hope of achieving exclusion. I therefore
beg the noble Baroness to think again and to look rather at enabling
parents to exercise proper jurisdiction over what their children are
doing. It is really quite hard to find good programmes that you can put
on your children’s machines that will tell you what they have
been doing and enable you to share with them what they have been seeing
and experiencing on the internet and to educate and guide them. By and
large, those 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>programmes are not available on ISPs’ websites. Individual
parental responsibility has a much better hope of looking after our
children than pretending that we can block something when we

Sutherland of Houndwood (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the previous
speaker has made very plain that the ingenuity of young people is very
considerable. I admire greatly his technical knowledge and
understanding of the issues before us now. However, I draw attention to
a very important point made by the noble Baroness: that it seems
appropriate in the non-internet sphere to have regulations to do what
we can; yet the ingenuity of young people is huge there as well. Big
brothers buy cigarettes or alcohol for small brothers. There are ways
of pretending that you are 16 when you are only 14 and a half; huge
ingenuity can be shown. If regulation is important, as we accept in the
law in the non-internet sphere, then surely there is a case for
considering it in the sphere of the internet.

have heard in this and previous debates about the growing awareness of,
and concern about, the impact on young people of unfettered
access to pornographic and other adult material. The noble Baroness
outlined the measures in the amendment which, among other things, would

access to adult content, an age-verification process and further
regulation by Ofcom. Those are very important
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000084">I
accept that there are legitimate arguments about what filtering and
age-verification can achieve, but I disagree profoundly with the noble
Lord, Lord Lucas, that the amendment contains measures that would be
either futile or impossible to achieve. He will know that they are
already being achieved to a degree by some ISPs in some circumstances.
The problem is that that level of good practice is not being achieved
consistently or universally, but very
imperfectly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0002.htm#140128102000085">I
suspect, given our debates so far, that most people across the House
would support the measures in the amendment. The Government and,
perhaps, one or two others, may argue that the voluntary approach is
either more effective or preferable or both. I understand the argument
in favour of self-regulation—at least in trying that first.
Under the Labour Government, I chaired the internet safety sub-group
for a while. It is appropriate to try self-regulation first, but I am
clear that although it is good that the Government have built on that
approach and recognised the importance of the issue, it is time to put
these measures on a statutory footing.</hs_para>

reasons why. One is to maximise compliance. It is absolutely clear that
the voluntary code has already failed in some instances. Many Members
will be aware of the cases of Tesco and BlackBerry, which are very big
providers. The key factor in both those examples was that the providers
themselves and the whole industry knew what was going on, but
nobody said anything about it, and Ofcom was none the wiser because it
has no powers. We are entitled to conclude from those failures that we
cannot trust the industry to regulate itself
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000087">Secondly,
we need independent regulation. It cannot be right that, under the
current voluntary arrangements, each company itself decides how it will
classify what is adult content—so different companies can make
different decisions about the same content—and which system of
age-verification it will adopt. That means not only that there is
significant variation in the age-verification process between companies
but that the system adopted is
weak.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000088">For
example, the big ISPs have refused to apply the age-verification
process at the point when someone is trying to access the adult
content; they will apply it only at the point when someone wants to
open an account. They say that they will send an e-mail to the account
holder when someone is trying to gain access but, of course, parents
are not looking at those e-mails every second of the day. I wonder why
the industry is allowed to adopt much weaker measures in relation to
children than, say, the gambling
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000089">The
third reason is enforcement. Without statutory regulation, there is no
effective enforcement. As a number of people have said today, these are
child protection measures and ought to be backed by powers of
enforcement vested in a public body such as Ofcom to protect consumers,
and in particular children, in the same way—here I agree with
the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland—as offline child protection
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000090">Later
in the Bill, the Government have announced welcome additional measures
to protect children from smoking by banning the proxy purchasing of
cigarettes and the selling of e-cigarettes to children. The Government
are not saying that people can decide for themselves whether a
prospective purchaser of those products is a child; the onus will be on
retailers to find out whether those children are under age and, if they
provide to children, they will be prosecuted. I think that we need the
same approach to these online products. I hope that noble Lords will
support the amendment, which is very much
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000091"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="140128102000877" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000877">Baroness

noble friend Lord Lucas has pointed out some of the technological
changes which already pose challenges to the way the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, has drawn up her proposals. This field is moving fast, and
new social media emerge all the time. It is for that reason that we
believe that the best way forward is to challenge the industry, which
knows this field best, to engage and to take responsibility. I
emphasise strongly that we do not rule out legislation, but right now
we believe that the approach that we are taking is likely to be the
most effective. An industry-led, self-regulatory approach will have
most impact, allow greatest flexibility for innovation and is likely to
be faster than any regulatory measures. Legislation can rarely adapt
and change quickly enough to respond to the constantly evolving online
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:14:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

need to bear in mind the global nature of this industry. That is why it
is vital that the industry engages. Self-regulation allows a broad
range of interested parties to participate and, due to the global
nature of the internet, is the best way for organisations to
secure agreement. We remain committed to this. It is already working
well, with good progress being made to develop internet safety
measures, as noble Lords have referred

Family Online Safety Institute, the UK is a global net exporter of

measures to keep children safe online, to which we are all committed,
the Government continue to work closely with the industry through the
UK Council for Child Internet Safety. This brings together
representatives from industry, manufacturers, charities, academia,
social media, parents’ groups and Government. It is through the
council and its partnership-working model that voluntary and
self-regulatory measures have been developed to ensure children are
safer online. It is essential to engage industry so that the solutions
developed are fleet, flexible and fully responsive to the rapid rate of
technological change. Technological solutions are one aspect of a wider
remedy which includes education and awareness for parents and children,
and building children’s resilience, as we heard in our earlier
debates.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140128102000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000100">The
noble Baroness, Lady Howe, calls for default filtering of adult
content, requiring users to opt in with internet service providers and
mobile operators to receive this content. We understand the intention
behind this provision. I assure the noble Baroness that this is being
secured. The vast majority of mobile customers are already covered by
default-on filters, as she noted. The Government are working with the
mobile sector to ensure that all customers are protected in this way.
Between them, the four largest operators cover in the region of 85% of
the UK’s 82 million or so mobile connections. Three of the four
operators already provide filters. The fourth, which we understand has
about 9 million mobile connections, has committed to change to
default-on in
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000101">In
December, my noble friend Lord Gardiner spoke about the four largest
internet service providers, which together cover just under 90% of the
home broadband market, and the commitment they had given in relation to
the implementation of family-friendly network-level parental control
filters. This commitment means that all new customers will be prompted
to make a choice about the application of filters. Importantly, filters
will be pre-selected so that, in those homes where parents do not
engage, they would be applied. I am pleased to update noble Lords that
three of the four ISPs have now met these commitments and Virgin Media
will be doing so shortly. Additionally, through this year, they will
have contacted all of their existing customers to invite them to set
the filters
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000102">Importantly,
these filters will be easy to use and will give parents the choice
about the content coming into their home. For example, parents in a
household with younger children may wish to place greater restrictions
on content than parents in households with teenagers. This is important
because we believe, in line with the advice from experts, that engaging
parents is also critical in ensuring that children are kept safe. Tanya
Byron said in her 2008 report <I>Safer Children in a Digital World</I>
that:</hs_para>

are engaged and aware of the risks that their children face when
online, and are confident in dealing with them, we have asked the four
major ISPs to use their marketing expertise to reach customers to raise
awareness. The ISPs have committed to running a three-year, large-scale
awareness campaign, with a budget of £20 million for the first
year, to inform parents about internet safety. This campaign will be
launched in the coming months. Of course, we are also taking action on
educating children and young people on the risks that they face online.
As was mentioned in the earlier debates, as part of our reforms to the
national curriculum, e-safety will be taught from September this year
as part of the computing curriculum to all four key stages—that
is, pupils from the age of five to
16.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000104">We have
just had in-depth debates on PSHE and SRE, and I shall not repeat all
the arguments that were made. However, there were actions there on
internet safety and many other areas, and I thank noble Lords for their
tributes on the actions being taken. We also welcome the new
supplementary guidance which is being developed by the PSHE
Association, the Sex Education Forum and Brook. This guidance will
address changes in technology and legislation since 2000, in particular
by seeking to equip teachers to help protect children and young people
from inappropriate online content and from online bullying, harassment
and exploitation. In addition, the Sex Education Forum has produced
guidance on the best way for teachers to tackle the dangers associated
with online pornography.</hs_para>

Lady Howe, also calls for an enhanced role for Ofcom to regulate the
standards of filtering. She and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope,
are right to emphasise the importance of Ofcom. The noble and learned
Lord made a clear case for Ofcom’s ability to address this area.
In his speech on internet safety last July, my right honourable friend
the Prime Minister asked Ofcom to report on parental awareness and
their take-up and confidence in the tools available to them to keep
their children safe. I am pleased to say that the first of these
reports was published on 15 January and will be used as a baseline
against which to measure the impact of the internet safety measures
being rolled out this year, so we will see what progress is being made.
One of the most illuminating findings was about those parents who did
not have parental controls installed. One in eight said that it was
because they were not aware that they existed or did not know how to
install them. Clearly, we need to see an improvement on that in the
next
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000106">I
hope that noble Lords will agree that the Government, in working with
the industry, are seeking very hard to make the internet a
safer place for children and young people and that encouraging progress
has been made in this arena. Again, I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, for her comments on that. Indeed, since the Second Reading
of her Bill, three of the four major ISPs are now offering filtering
tools to new customers and the final one will do
so imminently, Ofcom has produced the first of its reports and
will be producing the next in the spring and work continues to
ensure that all mobile networks  
<?notus-xml column=1167?>are offering filters. In addition, the major ISPs are making great
progress on their parental awareness
campaign.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000107">We
are far from complacent and will continue to push forward to make
further progress. I know that this is an area about which we are all

are government measures in this Bill that allow for the establishment

responsible for the registration, support and inspection of individual

extensive debate in Grand Committee, especially about the proposal that
Ofsted would no longer inspect all individual childminders registered
with an agency but instead inspect the agency’s procedures and a
sample of individual
childminders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000113">Since
Grand Committee the Minister has sent me a helpful letter outlining the
experience in Canada as well as some background on two of the agency
pilots. I shall not rehearse the arguments that we made in Grand
Committee and I have taken on board the comments that the Minister made
in his letter. However, I still feel that moving away from universal
inspection for every childminder at some point needs stronger
safeguards than there are in the Bill. That is the purpose of our two
amendments. They do not seek to frustrate the Government’s
purpose in any way. They are about
safeguards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000114">Amendment
53ZAB would give the chief inspector the power to inspect any
individual childminder at any time—that is, any childminder
registered with an agency in addition to the inspection of the agency,
or the sample for which the Bill provides. This is a permissive
amendment, not a prescriptive one. It simply means that if the
inspector has any concerns about a childminder or agency, the inspector
can go in and inspect that childminder at any time. Amendment 53ZAC
would also ensure that over a period of time to be prescribed in
regulation every childminder would at some point be inspected by
Ofsted.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140128102000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000145">The
reasons we need these extra safeguards for parents are twofold. First,
we cannot and should not rely on Ofsted’s inspections of the
agencies and their procedures to assure us and, more importantly,
parents that every agency is conducting thorough and valid inspections
of its childminders. Ofsted’s inspections of agencies will be
desktop and paper-based. They will be about process and will be the
kind of inspection that saw Ofsted rate Haringey’s
children’s social care services good when baby Peter Connelly
was killed. It is crucial that the validity of the agency’s
judgments is tested by direct inspections of childminders by Ofsted,
not just by inspection of a sample of childminders. Secondly, every
childminder needs to know that even if they are registered with an
agency, Ofsted can and will inspect them at some point over time. These
two together are the minimum safeguards necessary to ensure, first,
that agencies are more likely to inspect properly the childminders who
are registered with them and, secondly, that childminders maintain good
standards. Otherwise it is not impossible that a childminder registered
with a not-very-thorough agency who happens to escape inspection
through the Ofsted sampling process may allow standards to fall to poor
or dangerous levels with potentially serious consequences for children.
These<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:42:09"></hs_TimeCode> are
important amendments. They are predominantly permissive. They do not
frustrate the Government but they do build in some extra safeguards for
parents.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140128102000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000115">I
also support Amendment 53A and the related government amendments which
incorporate the inspection of agencies’ quality assurance
mechanisms by Ofsted and require it to report on them. That seems to be
something that Ofsted should be doing anyway, and if it needs to be
spelt out in legislation, I certainly do not oppose that. I beg to

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Hughes, for supporting my Amendment 53A. I
have considerable sympathy with her views about the need for
childminders to be inspected. However, I think that if Ofsted has
concerns, inspectors can inspect any childminder. My amendment focuses
on quality. It seeks to introduce a requirement for Ofsted to inspect a
childminding agency in respect of the quality of the care offered by
the childminders registered with that agency. I noticed that in
Schedule 4 there is no mention of this among all the references to the
standard of services offered by childminders and the quality of
leadership and management. It occurred to me that the most important
matter is the quality of the child’s experience and that of its
parents. However, that was not clear in Schedule 4 as originally
drafted—hence my amendment.</hs_para>

Minister for agreeing with me on the principle that the issue of
quality should be made explicit in the legislation, and for laying a
series of government amendments to secure that. As he knows, I have my
reservations about childminder agencies. I am prepared to give them a
chance to prove themselves, but I will base my eventual judgment not on
the services provided to the childminders but on whether they are
successful in attracting more high-quality childminders into the sector
and whether they provide childcare in the places, at the times and of
the quality that parents want at a price they can afford.</hs_para>

with the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in her wish to ensure quality
in childminding. That is something that we all endorse and I feel a
considerable amount of concern that childminders vary very much in the
quality of what they offer and in the integrity of their offering to
young children. However, I cannot see how Ofsted could conceivably
provide this level of inspection. It would be a huge task. The
inspectors who work for Ofsted already number in the thousands rather
than the hundreds, and this would escalate matters beyond the
possibility of quality in Ofsted itself.</hs_para>

long-standing concern. If it is so important that we

Government and the taxpayer should fund it properly. I apologise that I
did not take the opportunity to raise this with the Childcare Minister,

purpose of the Ofsted inspection of a childminder agency is to hold it
to account for the quality of care its childminders provide, in order
to deliver the best outcomes for children. Last week, Ofsted published
its consultation on childminder agency inspections. This set out its
proposals to ensure that Ofsted regulation of agencies will support
quality improvement and will be centred on the needs of young children
and their parents.</hs_para>

childminder agency model is that it is the agency rather than Ofsted
that is responsible for the monitoring and quality assurance of the
childminders who are registered with it. As part of the inspection of
an agency, the Bill already gives Ofsted the power to inspect the
individual childminders who are registered with an agency. Ofsted plans
to use this to undertake sample inspections of childminders registered
with agencies, which is comparable to the arrangements that already
exist for Ofsted inspection of voluntary adoption agencies and
independent fostering agencies.</hs_para>

agencies to improve childminder quality. Requiring direct Ofsted
inspection of agency-registered childminders could weaken the incentive
for agencies to be responsible for improving the quality of
childminders registered with them. We intend that agencies will help
remove some of the burdens that childminders currently face. We do not
want to complicate the quality assurance regime for agency childminders
by making them subject to two separate inspections by both the agency
and
Ofsted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000126">However,
Ofsted will retain its existing powers of entry to any registered
childcare premises to determine whether providers are complying with
requirements imposed by the Childcare Act 2006. Therefore, if there are
concerns about an agency-registered childminder, Ofsted will have the
power to go in and investigate, as my noble friend Lady
Walmsley said. Indeed, we envisage that childminders registered with
agencies will have much more contact, including more frequent home
visits, than childminders currently have with Ofsted. Under the current
Ofsted arrangements, a childcare provider might have to wait up to four
years between
inspections<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000127">I
am sympathetic to the concerns of my noble friend Lady Walmsley about
the scope of Ofsted inspection of agencies, and how such inspections
relate to the quality of care and education offered to children. Ofsted
intends that inspection reports of agencies will consider how a
childminder agency can assure itself of the quality of its registered
childminders. While this was always our policy intent, I can see, for
the avoidance of doubt and to make it absolutely explicit, that it 
<?notus-xml column=1173?>would be helpful to reflect this in the Bill. I have
therefore brought forward an amendment to place a
requirement for this in the Bill. The amendment will require Ofsted to
report on the effectiveness of a childminder agency’s
arrangements for assuring itself of the quality of its registered
childminders, and of the quality of experience offered to children. I
hope that this gives my noble friend the reassurance she sought, and I
urge the noble Baroness to withdraw her

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
that reply and thank other noble Lords who contributed to the debate. I
will briefly make two points. First, inspection of voluntary adoption
agencies is directly comparable to the inspection of childminder
agencies in the sense that with the former, the situation of the child
in an adoptive situation is much more open and is scrutinised by a wide
range of people. When a child is placed for adoption, the suitability
of adoptive parents who have been selected and prepared by the agency
is ultimately overseen by the court and will have been seen by many
other professionals concerned with the child’s welfare. When
young children are in a childminding situation—and we are
talking about very young children—nobody, apart from the
childminder, sees what goes on there day to day. It is a very closed
situation.</hs_para>

is why I disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, because this is
one of the most important situations, which should be subjected to the
highest level of inspection that we can possibly muster. Things can
happen in that situation, and the quality of what is provided can be
poor. That is more likely to be an issue in areas where childminders
are in short supply and where children are disadvantaged in a range of
other ways. Therefore, it is of great concern that we may be going in a
direction in which there is less scrutiny of the situations of very
young children in a childminding situation than of almost any other
area of children’s social care and children’s
services.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:53:06"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="140128102000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000130">However,
I note the Minister’s responses. I am also concerned that what
may be driving this, as the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, said, is that
Ofsted feels that it cannot manage this. The level of resource is
driving the policy; we are not being clear about what we should be
trying to achieve for young children by way of inspection and ensuring
quality. That remains of great concern to me for the reasons I have
outlined, but I accept that the Government will not move from their
position at the moment, and therefore I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="140128102000907" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000907">Amendment

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment relates to
Clause 76, which seeks to remove the duty on local authorities to
assess the sufficiency of childcare in their area—a requirement
established under Section 11 of the Childcare Act 2006. In
short, my amendment would introduce a review of the impact of repealing
Section 11 on the sufficiency of childcare in England, to take place

considerable concern about Clause 76 was expressed by noble Lords
across the Room. It was felt that removing the requirement for local
authorities to assess the sufficiency of childcare in their area was a
risky proposal. It has the potential to damage the capacity of local
authorities to meet their duty to provide sufficient childcare for
working parents, which, of course, is our end goal. We discussed at
length the value of producing the sufficiency reports, and I do not
wish to rehearse those arguments here. I shall simply say that, in a
nutshell, the main argument was that producing these reports ensures
that local authorities gather comprehensive data on the levels of
childcare provision in their area, and that is vital for identifying
gaps in the market and responding accordingly. It was also argued that
local authorities are able to build a detailed picture of the
availability of childcare for different age groups, taking account of
changing demographics—in particular, for children with
disabilities and special educational needs. Finally, it was argued that
childcare sufficiency reports are an important mechanism for
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:56:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been helpful discussions with Ministers and officials, and I am
grateful for those. The Government have continued to argue in favour of
repeal. We have been told that the current sufficiency reports are
unduly time-consuming and resource-consuming, and that their removal
will allow greater flexibility for local authorities in how they assess
their childcare markets. In essence, we have been told that simplifying
the reporting procedure would allow local 
<?notus-xml column=1175?>authorities to get on with the real job of providing childcare. Of
course, that sounds persuasive and no one, least of all me, wants to
argue in favour of added and unnecessary bureaucracy. However, I feel
that there is good reason to be sceptical
here<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:56:43"></hs_TimeCode>. The
concern remains that, freed from their assessment duties, local
authorities will give a lower priority to securing sufficient childcare
and, indeed, allocate fewer resources to it exactly when we cannot
afford for that to happen.</hs_para>

Lordships’ House does not need to be reminded by me that our
childcare market is far from perfect. There are gaps in provision
across the board—a point made abundantly clear when this House
debated childcare on 9 January. Then, we heard, for example, about the
Family and Childcare Trust’s <I>Childcare Cost</I><I>s</I><I>
Survey 2013</I>, which revealed that just 20% of local authorities
believe that there is sufficient childcare in their area for children
under two. Equally worrying is that only 9% of local authorities
reported having sufficient childcare for parents working atypical
hours, and that only 14% thought that they had enough for disabled
children in their
locality<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:57:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerns, my amendment proposes a review within four years, and this
seems to me a good way forward. I feel that the advantage of a
review should be clear. First, it would allow the Government
to establish concretely the impact of repealing Section 11,
most pertinently how the ability of local authorities to understand
long-term trends in childcare and secure sufficient childcare for
working parents has been affected. The definition of
“sufficient” is broad here: it refers not just to the
quantity of childcare places but to the adequacy and availability of
provision for older children, children with special needs or
disabilities and those whose parents who do not work conventional
hours.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140128102000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128102000136">Moreover<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>,
in my book, “sufficiency” also includes quality, so any
review should also seek to determine whether and how the quality of
childcare provision has been affected. I am sure the Minister will
agree that it will be important to have a detailed understanding of the
childcare market at a time when the Government, very much to their
credit, are increasing the number of free hours of entitlement for two
year-olds<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>.
Finally, should any failings be uncovered by the review, we will be
well placed to take timely action, whether this involves strengthening
the statutory guidance or returning to
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T20:59:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

it is my hope that neither the quantity of childcare nor its quality
will be affected if Section 11 is repealed. The measure we are
proposing here is simply a safeguard—an opportunity to ensure
that our legislative actions do not have unintended consequences.
Finally, it would provide the desired reassurance that the

area. This would, effectively, neutralise the general duty under
Section 6 of that Act to ensure that there is sufficient childcare for
working parents.</hs_para>

rehearsed the reasons why this is very short-sighted and I regret that
the Minister has not listened to those arguments. In his letter to me
about this, the noble Lord simply reiterated his position without
taking into account any of the points we made. I will not rehearse them
all but I will set out the main arguments. First, the
Government’s consultation, on which this proposal was based, was
inadequate: its findings were inconclusive and, at best, one-sided.
Contrary to the Government’s claim, the consultation did not
show support for removing the Section 11 duty, but rather for the need
for revised guidance and a real effort by the Government to help all
local authorities implement the duty as well as the best already are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000003">As I
said in Grand Committee, I agree that some action is necessary. There
are shortages of childcare in many areas and in relation to specific
needs such as parents working unsocial hours or those with disabled
children. Although some local authorities are doing very well, many are
not. They are all using different definitions and methodologies, they
have different action plans or poor action plans, and so on. However
this could, and should, be addressed, not by repealing the duty itself
but by revising the guidance, developing a consistent measure of
childcare demand and a framework for action plans which the five-year
review in 2009 showed was
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000004">The
Government may say they have revised the guidance but they have not
done so in a way that addresses those issues. They have reduced 70
pages of guidance, which I agree is far too long and bureaucratic, to
fewer than two pages of sketchy and vague requirements. This sends a
clear message to local authorities that this important duty does not
matter to the Government any more. Repealing Clause 76 would drive a
coach and horses through the sufficiency duty itself, as the position
in Scotland demonstrates. There is no duty there, just statutory
guidance similar to that which the Government are now proposing for
England. In Scotland, one-third of the authorities do not collect
adequate data. Scotland has only half of the proportion of private and
voluntary providers because they do not work to stimulate the market
and promote new childcare providers in the way the best English
authorities have
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000005">A much
better alternative would be to replace the three-year assessment with
an annual one; improve the guidance by simplifying it and include some
frameworks for consistent supply and demand measures. Local authorities
should be required to produce action plans and their performance
against those plans should be monitored. This is not rocket science: it
is the way performance is driven
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000006">Finally,
on Clause 76, will the Minister explain why the Government are
neutralising the sufficiency duty in childcare at the same time as they
are bringing in a new sufficiency duty in the Care Bill in respect of
adult social care? I asked this question in Grand Committee but did not
get an answer. It would be 
<?notus-xml column=1177?>good to have one now. I hope the Government will listen, even at this
late hour. In the event that they do not, I hope they will accept the
amendment in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler. At least with
a review and monitoring we would be able to assess the impact of the
changes and look at them again if they end up having the consequences
which I
fear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:04:20"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="140128109000187" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000187">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to noble Lords for
their contributions on this important issue. There is consensus across
the House about the importance of making sure that parents have access
to good quality, affordable childcare, as we heard during the debate
introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, earlier this month.
Changes in demographics and in parents’ behaviour mean that this
continues to be an important issue. It is important we see the
reform of the statutory assessment duty that we are discussing here in
this wider context. I hope that noble Lords will allow me to set that
out<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:04:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000008">The
most important thing for ensuring sufficient childcare is to create the
right conditions for growth in supply to happen in every part of the
childcare market. To that end, the Government are making it easier for
schools to increase their age range to take two year-olds and to offer
childcare out of school hours. We are relaxing planning rules so that
nurseries can expand more easily. The aim is that childminder agencies
will make it simpler for people to become childminders, provide
training and support, and help parents to access home-based
care<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:05:32"></hs_TimeCode>. Local
authorities also will have a very important part to play. They are
under statutory duties to ensure that eligible children can access the
funded early education entitlement and to ensure that sufficient
childcare is available in their
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:05:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000009">My
noble friend Lady Tyler is right that we need an effective means of
holding authorities to account for their performance against these
statutory duties. In its current form, however, we believe that the
sufficiency assessment duty that we are debating is not the most
effective way to do this. We remain convinced that it is better for
local authorities to be held to account locally for the delivery of
their sufficiency duty, and we want parents and council members to have
regular information in a helpful format about the sufficiency of
childcare in their
area<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:06:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sufficiency assessment process does not currently meet these
objectives. It seems that the two noble Baronesses who have spoken
agree with that. It is too long and technical to be useful to parents
and, as it is produced only every three years, it will usually be out
of date. Instead, we propose to repeal the duty on local authorities to
publish a sufficiency assessment every three years. In its place our
statutory guidance already sets out that local authorities should
prepare and publish an annual report on the sufficiency of childcare,
giving parents more frequent information which is more focused on what
they need to know. I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, said
about an annual
assessment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:07:11"></hs_TimeCode>. This
change has been welcomed, including by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes,
in terms of it being annual, and these proposals were supported by the
majority of respondents to the 
<?notus-xml column=1178?>public consultation. More than 60% of respondents agreed with the repeal
of Section 11, with only 10% saying they were not in support of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:07:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000011">In
order to support parents and the public to hold authorities to account,
which in many ways is the crux of what both noble Baronesses are
saying, I can commit that the Government will explore how we can
present data in the clearest and most effective way. We will, for
example, continue to monitor parents’ perception of the
availability of childcare regionally through the biennial parent
surveys<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000012">Turning
to the specific issues raised by my noble friend Lady Tyler about
assessing the impact of this repeal, we agree entirely with the spirit
of her proposal. The Government keep a watching brief on the impact of
everything that they do and we are sure that childcare will continue to
be high up the political list of priorities. We would support any
post-legislative scrutiny of this undertaken by
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:08:29"></hs_TimeCode>.

what the amendment seeks to do. The fact that the Government refuse to

many occasions and feels, correctly, that it should not be ducked. I
cannot understand why it would. I know that there is a fear from some
quarters that this could be the thin end of the wedge and that we would
then be telling adults and parents in their own homes that they should
not be allowed to hit children, which I actually agree with, but this
is not about that: it is about children in education settings. It

talk about this issue, there did not seem to be a lack of willingness,
but their answer was, “I cannot see how we are going to get it

knowledge and skills we cannot find some way of ensuring that this
dreadful practice is prohibited in this country. If other
countries—perhaps more enlightened ones—are able to ban
corporal punishment in part-time education establishments, why the heck
cannot we in this country, which has a proud record of protection of
children from abuses? I hope that the Government in their reply might
come some way to agreeing that we will look again at this and if we can
find a way of moving forward, we certainly
will.</hs_para>

Walmsley and Lord Storey for raising this very important issue. We have
a great deal of sympathy for what they are saying. The Government are
absolutely committed to the protection of children. I understand their
concerns: nothing is more important than making sure that our young
people are protected and safe from harm. Clearly, children will not
easily learn in such circumstances. Assault of children is against the
law in whatever setting it takes place. The real issue that we all want
to address is how to prevent the unacceptable, and already unlawful,
treatment of children. We believe the best way to do this is to support
people in their communities to address these issues and uphold the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has a responsibility to make sure that children are safe from violence,
abuse and neglect. Our job is to enable parents and communities to
exercise that responsibility. We must address the culture that allows
unlawful treatment of children to be viewed as acceptable or—and
which may more often be the issue—that makes people reluctant to
report, question or challenge it.</hs_para>

have a strategy that aims to address this issue in all types of
supplementary settings. As my noble friend Lady Walmsley has
noted—though not with favour—we are working with a range
of interests to develop a voluntary code of practice for supplementary
schools. We believe that signing up to the code will mean that
providers will establish robust policies in areas such as safeguarding

from harm. I hope that she will feel that it is a move in the right

meet. It will enable and empower parents to make informed choices about
the provision of supplementary teaching for their children. Through
targeted communications, we will inform parents about the code and
encourage them to refer to it when selecting suitable provision for
their child. Providers who sign up to the code will also naturally want

consultation document and feed their ideas into it. I assure noble
Lords that <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:22:40"></hs_TimeCode>we
will review the effectiveness of the voluntary code over time. It will

is an issue to be addressed. There are different ways this could be
approached, but we feel that the proposed new clause is not the best
way to achieve the change we want. It seeks to amend other provisions,
which themselves have not been commenced. If we were to commence the
relevant provisions, including the regulatory regime for part-time
institutions, that would require the Department for Education to
register a large number of part-time education institutions, with all
the complexity involved. More importantly, commencing these provisions
would be unlikely to capture a wider range of settings, including those
where there may be real cause for concern. Most supplementary schools
are unlikely to qualify as independent educational institutions, so
they would be unaffected by this
change<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:23:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000036">The
real issue is not the technical difficulty that implementing this

regard to data sharing, it was chilling to attend a meeting of experts

allows children’s centres to send a card to the new family
congratulating them on the birth of their new child and inviting them
to visit the centre. It is therefore very important
information<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:31:31"></hs_TimeCode>.
Some local authorities were proud to say that they asked each mother
individually whether her information could be shared, when in fact this

both these concerns, about effective information sharing and birth

Listening to the experts last week, it became clear that we shall see
such problems resolved only if local authorities, clinical

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for his
amendment. Children’s centres provide an important service for
children and families and have a vital role to play in supporting
outcomes for children and their parents, particularly the most
vulnerable, who may be in the greatest need of help. I certainly recall
registering with pleasure my own children. I also found that my own
birth was registered by my father on the same day that he bought a
bucket. I am not sure whether this was for my nappies or, much more
likely, for his dairy calves but I think it was the latter. That would
have been the much more important reason for his visit out, as he
tended to avoid towns.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140128109000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000055">As I highlighted to
noble Lords during Grand Committee, local authorities can already make
children’s centres one of the places where parents can register
the birth of their child. We know that some local authorities, such as
Manchester City Council, are already doing so and we welcome that. We
are also aware of other areas using new and creative ways to register
births. For example, in Salford, in addition to local registry
offices, birth registration takes place in a dedicated office at a
local library building. In the Liverpool and Nottingham City Council
areas, registration can take place at the local hospital by
appointment. As your Lordships can see, birth registration is taking
place at a host of innovative places with the aim of making it
straightforward for parents, in the way that the noble Earl indicated.
The services are designed to work effectively for the local
community.</hs_para>

authorities need flexibility in determining where to locate
registration facilities to meet the needs of the community which they
serve. We do not agree that we should compel all authorities to
establish a pilot scheme but we do agree that more could be
done to gather evidence to demonstrate 
<?notus-xml column=1186?>whether the environment in which parents register their child could help
to increase positive outcomes for children and families. It
would be helpful to know whether integrating birth registration within
children’s centres helps local authorities to reach greater
numbers of vulnerable children. The department will look for
ways to gather examples and use our existing communications channels to
disseminate the findings.</hs_para>

information-sharing, we very much agree with the noble Earl about the
importance of professionals working together to identify families who
are in need of support, and to offer them that support. We are already
doing this through the department’s statutory guidance for
children’s centres, which is clear that health services and
local authorities should share information. Current legislation and
guidance makes it clear that information can already be shared where
there are local agreements and processes in place to meet the legal
requirements about confidentiality, consent and security of
information. As I have mentioned before, the Department of Health will
liaise with NHS England and other partners to promote the sharing of
live birth data and explore the practical issues involved in providing
regular, timely updates of bulk data on live births to local
authorities.</hs_para>

Nash provided an update on information-sharing in his letter to Peers
on 11 December. We can resend that to the noble Earl if he would like
to see it. We agree with much of Jean Gross’s analysis: that
some of the biggest barriers to information-sharing are linked to
professional practice and culture. There is a need to break down these
barriers; again, in Committee I went into a number of those
areas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140128109000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000059">My
honourable friend Liz Truss met Councillor David Simmonds at the Local
Government Association on 23 January to discuss local government
concerns with the registration of births at children’s centres.
She will be writing to lead members for children in all local
authorities regarding early years education, the important role that
children’s centres have in delivering services to families and
the value of better integration and information-sharing.</hs_para>

about birth registration pilots. We will be happy to write to him in
the summer to report back on what the Government have done to raise
awareness of birth registration within children’s centres and
share some further case studies on that. He also asked about the Select
Committee report, which my honourable friend Liz Truss is currently
carefully considering. She will be responding soon but I can confirm
that the department is keen to ensure that local areas share
information as effectively as possible.</hs_para>

about a meeting. We would of course be happy to facilitate such a

can be made against the important issues that he raises. I hope that on
the basis of that and the work that is going on, he will be content to
withdraw his amendment.</hs_para>

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I return to this amendment about a
form of child abuse, about which we had a very useful discussion in
Committee and, following that, a very helpful exchange of
correspondence with my noble friend Lady Northover, the
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000064">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:40:04"></hs_TimeCode>
purpose of this amendment is to fill two gaps in the law protecting
children: first, to make clear that alleging that a child is possessed
or has supernatural evil powers constitutes emotional abuse of the
child; and, secondly, to ensure that people not directly responsible
for a child are liable for child cruelty
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000065">In
Committee, and in her follow-up letter, my noble friend Lady Northover
confirmed that making an allegation of this nature is child abuse. This
confirmation is welcome and important and will be supported by those
working in child protection. Children accused of possession or
supernatural evil are almost always already vulnerable in some
respect—outsiders, orphaned, ill, disabled, trafficked et
cetera—and as a result of an allegation, they may well go on to
suffer serious physical or social abuse. Yet it is the allegation
itself that can inflict the most devastating emotional trauma on the
child. AFRUCA has a number of case studies which, because of the late
hour, I will not go
into.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000066">However,
this is not understood by those making such allegations. A pastor or
relative or member of the congregation who declares a child is
possessed or is a witch may genuinely believe this to be the case and
see it as their duty to take appropriate action. So we have a situation
where an abusive practice, like FGM or forced marriage, is being
perpetrated in ignorance of the fact that it is abuse. But here the gap
in the law is more extreme. Offences already existed that criminalised
FGM and forced marriage; for example, the offences of assault, rape and
false imprisonment. Yet, government wisely saw that a more specific law
was needed. In this case there are no laws criminalising accusations of
demonic possession or evil powers in a child, so again a more specific
law is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:42:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend
suggested<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:42:16"></hs_TimeCode> in the
last debate and in her letter that there were laws that could be used
to prosecute those making allegations. She agrees that the main law on
offences of child cruelty under Section 1 of the Children and Young
Persons Act 1933 does not cover people who are not parents or acting in
loco parentis, such as pastors or relatives. She proposed, however,
that the Public Order Act, Protection from Harassment Act or the
Serious Crime Act might be used against these people
instead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000068">Unfortunately<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:42:48"></hs_TimeCode>,
this is wishful thinking. In practice no prosecutor would agree to a
wholly speculative prosecution under these provisions against
someone—for example, a pastor—who has alleged that a
child is possessed or is supernaturally evil. For a start, if the
pastor was told that he had perpetrated child abuse he could quite
reasonably reply, “Says who?”. Government guidance on
this issue addresses abuse arising as a result of an allegation of
spirit possession, not the allegation
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000069">More<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:43:19"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, under all the provisions cited by my noble friend Lady
Northover, the child would be required to give evidence that he or she
feared violence or was alarmed or distressed as a result of the
allegation. This is precisely the scenario this amendment seeks to
avoid. The whole point is to protect children from the trauma of
knowing that they are believed to be possessed by a devil or are
supernaturally evil. If this amendment was adopted it would be possible
to charge the accuser without involving the child at any point. I think
that is highly
desirable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000070">As
importantly, the purpose of this amendment is
prevention—preventing both the allegations and any subsequent
abuse. None of the laws cited can have that effect because they do not
specify the offence.</hs_para>

others such as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth of Breckland, have made
reference to projects and working parties on child safety and spirit
possession in which most of the participants were of the view that
changes in the law were unnecessary. However, these views were based on
a misapprehension of the law. No one picked up on the fact that neither
the Children Act in civil law nor Section 1 in criminal law covers
third parties, so the participants were told that a law was not
necessary because, “This is already emotional abuse under child
abuse laws”. That is wrong. In any event, the focus was on the
abuse that followed from the allegation, not the allegation
itself.</hs_para>

there was an objection that the law could not criminalise witch
branding because of the harmless meaning of “witch”,
which this amendment very carefully avoids. Lastly, some of the
participants believed in malevolent supernatural forces and were
naturally anxious that their beliefs might be made unlawful,
which, again, this amendment avoids—we have been very
careful to avoid that.</hs_para>

issue has been ducked until now, not least perhaps because belief in
demonic possession is held in major mainstream religions as well as
small African churches. The amendment is not about challenging those
beliefs; it is saying that the child must not be harmed as a result of
those beliefs. So, for example, there could be a private service for
the 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>delivery of a child believed to be possessed, so long as neither the
child nor anyone connected to them knew about it.</hs_para>

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I deeply respect the
tenacity with which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has followed
through this issue. I found some of her arguments rather convoluted and
difficult to follow today, but that could just be that the hour is late
and by now my brain is rather addled. However, I still contend that the
current child protection framework, which identifies physical, sexual
and emotional abuse and neglect, provides an effective framework for
assessing situations where children have been accused of witchcraft and
spirit possession.</hs_para>

these situations as a consequence of parental behaviour towards the
child and through the response by church leaders in performing acts of
deliverance that inflict harm on the child. As I have said before, and
I declare an interest as someone who chaired a working party for Trust
for London, I have met these children and engaged with some of the
pastors, so I understand the issue. However, we also know, and the
noble Baroness herself pointed this out, that belief in spirit
possession and witchcraft is widespread among many African communities,
and current knowledge indicates that the incidence of abuse linked to
these beliefs is low. These beliefs occupy a broad spectrum and range,
from the harmless to the seriously harmful. When it is the latter, the
child protection framework should be applied through recognition,
assessment and
intervention<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T21:48:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000077">Where
the noble Baroness and I might well share a platform is in tackling the
real issue here: the lack of training across this area, which is
extremely complex. We have to remember that Christians believe some
pretty strange things; in my community in the north of England,
“He’s got the devil in him” was something that was
said quite often. That is quite different from a child being accused of
being a witch, ostracised from the family, made to behave in a
particular way, taken before a congregation and pointed out and
scapegoated. Those are quite clearly issues of abuse but they are not
always understood by those working in the field.</hs_para>

that worked with the then Trust for London, we explored these issues
and the range of abusive behaviour, and that was paralleled by a
government group that was set up to look at the issue at the same time.
I do not know if the noble Baroness knows what has happened to that
group, or whether it has simply disappeared and is no longer
continuing.</hs_para>

involved that promoting child safeguarding and well-being is far more
effective for engaging communities and churches than a narrow focus on
witchcraft and spirit possession. My experience, working with a number
of these community groups, has led to improvements in wider child
protection, including through changed practice and disclosures. I hope
that the noble Baroness will continue to press the 
<?notus-xml column=1190?>cause of awareness and training, but I cannot stand with her in having

on some, if not all, of them and I am grateful to her for the
opportunity to explain the position. We share her commitment to
safeguarding children from this and all other forms of abuse. A belief
system can never justify the abuse of a child. We need to ensure that
children are not subjected to abuse, or left vulnerable to potential
abuse, because someone alleges that the child is
possessed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000083">The
Government believe that the current law is sufficient for this purpose:
it provides adequate protection to children from the type of abuse that
this amendment is trying to prevent. I will come to that in more detail
in a moment. I set out much of the legislative framework during our
debate in Committee. I shall not repeat those details again, but I
reiterate that while the existing legislation does not specifically
mention communication of a belief that a child is possessed by spirits,
the current offence of child cruelty already captures conduct likely to
cause a child unnecessary suffering or injury to health. Where the
conduct could not be covered by the offence of child cruelty, it could
be caught by other criminal offences, depending on the circumstances of
the case.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140128109000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000084">I
hope that my noble friend Lady Walmsley will be pleased that since
Committee, to get further clarity on the guidance, officials discussed
the issues around witch branding with the Crown Prosecution Service,
which makes any decision on whether a prosecution should be pursued.
The CPS was able to provide a copy of guidance for prosecutors that the
service produced some time ago. That guidance, a copy of which I have
sent to my noble friend, illustrates the 
<?notus-xml column=1191?>legislation and offences that could be considered in
different circumstances. We believe that it covered all situations
where a child might face potential harm, including those where the
perpetrators of potential harm are third parties, such as rogue
pastors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000085">Our
approach needs to ensure that the scope of the current legislation is
better understood to enable it to work as it should. To do this we must
raise awareness among the relevant communities and faith groups. We
must provide support and guidance to practitioners to help them
understand what behaviours could constitute a criminal offence.
Department officials are working with the National Working Group on
Abuse Linked to Faith or Belief, and will be discussing with them
further how best to disseminate information on this issue to the
relevant communities and groups. We understand that some members of the
working group are also considering revising the 2007 guidance on this
issue and we are grateful to the group members for this. They are the
experts, and they have the links to the relevant communities. We are
happy to support the development of the new
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000086">When
bringing the CPS guidance to the attention of group members, officials
took the opportunity to address any potential misunderstanding about
which people are covered by some of the legislation. Some members of
the working group felt that there had been confusion about whether the
1933 Act could apply to anyone other than parents or those in a
parental role, as my noble friend Lady Walmsley said. Officials have
now made it clear that while third parties, such as rogue pastors,
could not be prosecuted under the 1933 Act, they are covered by other
legislation, as set out in the CPS
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000087">Any
person whose words or behaviour cause severe alarm and distress to a
child could be prosecuted for an offence under Sections 4 or 4A of the
Public Order Act 1986. There are other elements. Those responsible can
extend beyond those with parental responsibility. For example, they can
include babysitters or teachers while they have care of the
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000088">My
noble friend Lady Walmsley will be extremely familiar with
<I>Blackstone’</I><I>s Statutes on Criminal Law</I> because it
probably accompanies her noble husband everywhere. It covers this in
B2.136 on page 283 on child cruelty. It states that other persons such
as babysitters or teachers may also have a responsibility while a child
or young person is their care. It is covered. I hope that my noble
friend is reassured by that. I am sure that she will agree that, as
pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, it is culture that
needs to change. We need to tackle that, and schools can play an
important role in protecting children from a range of risks. We are
working with other government departments and representatives of head
and teacher unions to develop processes to raise awareness among staff
and pupils of safeguarding risks such as these. Of course, there is a
range of other areas in which we are working to try to tackle this. I
hope that my noble friend is sufficiently reassured and will withdraw

Care Bill currently being debated in another place is making major
changes to adult social care law. We have already put those changes
through this House. It brings forward important and welcome new rights
for adults caring for other adults. This Bill already strengthens the
rights of young carers. These new rights will make it easier for other
carers to have the impact of caring on them in their care assessment
and to receive support services. I commend the Government most heartily
and sincerely for the progress that we have made on this issue.
However, as I said when it was discussed in Committee, these changes
leave parent carers of disabled children as the only group of carers 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>who will be left with the lesser rights to
assessment and support provided in old legislation that will be largely
superseded by the new Bills.</hs_para>

amendments is to bring the rights of parents of disabled children into
line with the rights of other carers and ensure that they are
consolidated into primary legislation where they can be better
understood and used. Amendments 57ZA and 57ZB update the existing law
that gives parents of disabled children under 18 the right to have a
carer’s assessment that looks at the impact of caring on
them—the parent carers. It updates and aligns these rights with
the changes being brought forward in the Care Bill for adult carers of
adults, and in this Bill for young carers. Amendment 57ZC replicates
the new duty to promote well-being that is being introduced through the
Care Bill in relation to adult carers of adults, and applies this same
duty to parents caring for disabled
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000095">As
a result of the Government’s changes, parents of disabled
children will be the only group of carers with lesser rights to
assessment and support, as the rights of other adult carers and young
carers are consolidated and strengthened. Their rights will be left in
rump legislation as the rest of the Carers Acts are repealed. These
amendments are supported by the Law Commission and the Joint Committee
on Human
Rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000096">I
know that the aim of the Government’s legislative reform is to
produce a clearer, consolidated social care system that is easier for
professionals and individuals to use. However, I must point out that
this aim will not be realised without consolidation and enhancement of
parent carer rights. Without this, frontline professionals will have to
navigate complex legislation in order to assess and provide support to
those caring for children. There is little or no guidance in place to
support social workers to use the existing rights for carers to receive
assessments, currently sitting in three different Acts, each taken
through Parliament by Back-Benchers with cross-party support. I was one
of those Back-Benchers on a couple of
occasions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000097">A
lack of guidance and understanding by children’s social services
already means that parents of disabled children find it hard to have
their needs as carers recognised. Parent carers are being passed
between adult and children’s services and are falling through
the cracks. I was most grateful to the Minister for agreeing to meet
last week with the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, myself and several
parent carers and representatives of Carers UK. He was able to
hear at first hand about—and understand—their
current difficulties and duties. These and other parent carers whom I
have met simply do not understand why they are not subject to the same
rights as others. They told the Minister this in no uncertain terms. I
very much hope that he will either agree to these amendments or agree
to bring something back at Third
Reading.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000098">I
turn briefly to the need for a well-being duty for parent carers. The
Care Bill introduces a new statutory principle that embeds the
promotion of well-being as the driving force underpinning the provision
of care and support. This new principle is widely welcomed. I
cannot overemphasise how strongly this has been welcomed and how
important it is. The well-being duty in the Care Bill does not,
however, apply to 
<?notus-xml column=1194?>parent carers. Unless we put it in here, it will not apply to them at
all. They face different challenges to other parents, but they have
often struggled to establish rights as individuals on a par with other
carers, and they are at particular risk of having their own rights as
individuals overlooked. Too often they are seen only as parents, and
their needs as carers are not identified or
supported.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000099">At

through other parts of the Bill, the new right to assessment and
support that have been introduced for young carers is wonderful.
It was also my privilege to look at the detailed scrutiny of
the Care Bill. Again, the new right to assessment and support for adult
carers is a landmark piece of legislation of which we can all be proud.
As has been set out, the one group that falls between the stools are
parent carers—generally parents who look after disabled
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000111">I,
too, had the privilege last week of attending the meeting with the
Minister. It was a very poignant meeting at which we heard three parent
carers explain what life was like for them. One, I particularly
remember, was looking after not one but three disabled children. She
explained how she simply never had a minute for herself. She said that
she was grateful for the support that she got in respite care for her
children, but that she would be lucky to have the time to pop into the
supermarket on the way home before having to go and collect the
children or do something for one of her other
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T22:10:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerns why I think that well-being is so important. What is often
forgotten is the impact on the personal and family relationships of
parents who look after disabled children. I felt that this was
underlined very well in an excellent report in 2011 from Contact a
Family. This showed the mental health problems that parent carers were
having, including anxiety, depression and breakdown. They had to see
their GP because they felt that their well-being was so poor, and they
often had medication or had to see a counsellor. There was also an
impact on their marriage, often with a breakdown in the
relationship<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T22:10:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

course, in a Bill on children, when we are looking at children’s
issues, the welfare of the child must almost always be paramount, but
that is true throughout the legislation that we look at, and it would
have been true if this issue had been looked at in the Care Bill.
However, the Minister will remember that in the discussions on the Care
Bill it was felt that this was a children’s issue and therefore
better dealt with in the Children and Families Bill. Again, the split
has meant that this matter has not been properly dealt with, and
therefore I hope that the Minister can pick it up and deal with it
properly

with families as a family social worker for many years will know that,
unless you pay attention to the needs of parents, you can in no way
help their children. It is the parent who is going to make the
difference to the child by providing the care. If they have a life of
their own and feel cared for themselves, they will give better care to
the disabled child whom they have to manage day in and day out. Having
met those families, the Minister will know the toll that that has on
the humanity of these people, never mind everything else. It is very
difficult to continue loving and caring for your children when the
stress you experience is so high and the level of support you receive
is so

do not think that it is beyond the wit of the officials and the
Minister to think this through, just as the issue of young carers has
been thought through, to get a much better package that ensures that
parent carers form part of a total assessment and that the assessment
is not split down the middle because we just happen to split services
down the middle. The whole issue needs to be looked at as a total
package in a holistic way, and a proper plan should be made for the
whole family and not just bits of it. In that way, we will have much
more success both for the children and, most certainly, for the adults
who give their lives day in and day out to caring for their children.
If that does not happen, the children will end up either in respite
care or in the care of the local authority, and that will cost the
nation a great deal

the principle that the needs of the child are paramount is essential in
Section 17 of the Children Act 1989. We must not do anything that
confuses that principle for any child, but in assessing a
child’s needs social workers are required to look at the needs
of their family. An assessment under Section 17 of the Children Act
1989 should look at parental capacity to cope and the services which
can be offered to parent carers, and should lead to that support. Just
as it should under the Care Bill for adults caring for adults, such
support might include: respite in temporary foster care for the child,
direct payments, or access to support from a local carers’
centre.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000123">Parent
carers have told me that sometimes their needs are not assessed or the

legislation is not being implemented as effectively as it should be and
there is a need for greater clarity about the rights of parent carers

Social Worker for children, who has emphasised the support that should
be provided to parent carers under the existing legislative framework
provided by the Children Act 1989.</hs_para>

discussions with representatives of parent carers and local

existing legislation on parent carers into the Children Act 1989.
Putting all the relevant legislation in one place may help to ensure
parent carers are better able to understand it and local practitioners

children to participate in the creative arts is inspirational.
Before Christmas I had the great pleasure of a meeting with my noble

Cinema and Television. We discussed how to remove barriers that
restrict children’s opportunities, without diminishing the
important safeguards currently in place for child performers. Many
children grow up to have careers in our cultural industries, which are
of real economic significance, and are recognised and admired
throughout the world. Some children simply enjoy performing and they
want to have fun. Taking part in a performance can increase their

and communication.</hs_para>

children must be able to access performance opportunities and should
not be prevented from doing so by outdated rules or excessive red tape.
It is essential that those who put on
performances with children take steps to keep them safe and

am pleased to say that we have found a way forward and we plan several
actions to improve the system. First, Amendment 57A will insert a new
clause in the Bill to repeal Section 38 of the Children and Young
Persons Act 1963. That repeal would remove restrictions on the
circumstances in which a local authority can issue a performance
licence to a child under the age of 14. Currently, a local authority
can issue a licence to a child under the age of 14 only where the
licence is for acting or dancing in a ballet and the part can be taken
only by a child, or where the nature of the child’s part is
wholly or mainly musical and either the nature of the overall
performance is also wholly or mainly musical or the performance
consists only of opera and ballet.

are taking forward changes to the regulations. We will remove the
requirement for medical certificates; remove unnecessary restrictions
on the types of activities that children can do each day; and
streamline and align the hours that children can take part in different
types of performance so that there is consistency between them. In
addition to the changes we plan to make to legislation, work is in hand
to improve consistency of approach in local administration of child
performance licensing. The Department for Education is working with a
range of partners, including the local authority sector, professional
and amateur theatre groups, the broadcasting sector and casting

also working with the Local Government Association to ensure that this

were pleased to support the noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin, and the
noble Viscount, Lord Colville, in seeking to update the legislation
applying to child performance. As has just been made clear in the
exchanges that preceded my speech, this is something that has been long
overdue since 1963. Clearly the world of television and film
performances has been transformed since then, and it is good that the
Government are bringing forward their own amendment on this point, so
that the legislation can properly reflect the full range of
opportunities available to young people today, while at the same time
building in the necessary safeguards that will protect them from
exploitation, or physical or mental
harm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140128109000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-0003.htm#140128109000136">It is

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a draft amendment to
the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2011. The order is an
enabling power concerning charging for visa, immigration and
nationality services. It enables the Home Office to specify
applications, processes and services for which it intends to set a fee.
Specific fee levels will be set out in separate legislation to be
brought before this House shortly. For applications and services where
we charge more than the administrative cost of delivery, the
regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure. Noble Lords will
have the opportunity to ask searching questions—and I am sure
they will—about fee levels in that
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000004">In
accordance with our legal powers, this amendment to the Immigration and
Nationality (Fees) Order 2011 sets out new applications and services
for which we intend a fee to be paid in future, and clarifies the
powers under which some existing fees are set. First, the order enables
us to expand our premium services. These are optional services, offered
to customers who want faster processing or more convenience. It will
allow premium service fees to be charged for all applications where the
Home Office is able to offer such a service. It will also allow us to
charge for services offered at locations other than Home Office premium
service centres—for example, at business or university
premises.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000005">It
will also bring fees for certain Border Force premium services within
the immigration charging framework. As a result, these services may be
charged to generate additional revenue, rather like other optional
premium services provided by the Home Office. For example, it will
enable fees to be charged for the registered traveller scheme, in
operation as a pilot since September 2013, which will speed up the
processing of frequent travellers from low-risk countries.</hs_para>

enable new fees to be introduced for the process of conducting a review
of a refusal decision for certain applications. Such reviews are likely
to form an increasingly important part of our service as a result of
changes to the current appeals process being proposed under the
Immigration Bill 2014. The Bill will reduce the range of immigration
decisions that attract a right of appeal. However, applicants will be
able to request a review of a decision to refuse leave. The order will
allow a fee to be charged to those who request such a review. The fee
will be refunded if it is decided that the initial decision was
incorrect. The order is not seeking to predetermine the outcome of the
Bill in any way; that will be resolved in separate
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000007">We
also wish to take this opportunity to make clarifications to the
current fees order. First, we want to clarify the basis on which fees
are charged for residence and registration documentation issued to
European Economic Area nationals and their families. We also want to
make clear that fees charged by our commercial partners overseas are
within the scope of the charging regime. We recognise the benefits that
managed legal migration can bring to the United Kingdom and seek to
ensure that the fees for visa, immigration and nationality services
demonstrate that the UK retains its position as an attractive
destination to work, study or
visit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000008">As
I have said, the order provides the enabling powers to set fees and we
will return to Parliament in due course to debate further regulations,
under the affirmative procedure, specifying the fee levels that rely on
the powers in Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act
2006 and additional powers in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of
Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, as amended by Section 20 of the UK Borders
Act
2007.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000009">I
believe noble Lords would want to ensure that the immigration system
controls migration, commands public confidence, serves our economic
interests and is paid for in a fair and sustainable manner. The order
will ensure that we can continue to strike the right balance between
the contribution made by taxpayers and by those who use and benefit
most from the immigration and border services provided by the Home
Office. I commend the order to the House. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000010"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Lord Bilimoria" PimsId="5110" UID="14012896000187" xid="1960" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000187">Lord
Bilimoria (CB):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I know that we will be
debating the Immigration Bill very shortly, but I should like to
comment on this matter of fees and the premium services that are being
offered—presumably to try to make it easier. Speaking as the
founding chairman of the UK India Business Council, if there is one
complaint about the United Kingdom and our relationship that I hear
when I go back to India, as I do regularly, it is about visas. This is
particularly true of students, and of the business community. We have
serious problems in that the UK Border Agency, as it was, was not fit
for purpose and has now been dismantled. Can the Minister confirm that
the levying of fees is a caseworking function and falls within the
remit of UK Visa and Immigration and not that of the UK Border
Force?</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=369?><hs_para UID="14012896000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000011">Furthermore,
it is quite clear when I come in and out of Heathrow in particular that
it is very difficult; the queues are very long. We are not adequately
resourced to cater for the passengers arriving in the UK. With this
system, I presume that the Government are trying to make it easier for
someone, by paying a premium fee first, to get a visa and then, once
arrived, to get in quickly and escape the queues. Can the Minister
confirm that? It is very off-putting, whether you are a tourist or a
business traveller, to be confronted by those queues at
Heathrow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000012">Quite
apart from this, the Government—as I have said
before—should surely be thinking about joining Schengen, which
is much better value for money. It would encourage many more visitors
to come. This government measure is a step in the right direction but
it is completely avoidable if we join Schengen. That would hugely
enhance the number of tourists and increase the number of business
visitors. It would be much better value for
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000013">Next,
from the point of view of students from abroad, Britain is a very
expensive country to study in. They want to study in Britain—our
higher education, along with that of the United States, is the best in
the world—but both the fees and the cost of living in the UK are
high. This has not helped countries such as India, for example, where
the exchange rate has deteriorated rapidly and the rupee is now much
weaker, making it even more expensive for Indian students. Having to
pay an even higher fee for a premium service makes it that much more
expensive for them to come to this country. The number of Indian
students has dropped by 25%. Our economy desperately needs the income
from foreign students—what they spend on fees and what they
spend while they are here—which is estimated at possibly
£14 billion a year. This is quite apart from the generation-long
links that are
built.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000014">Moreover,
while we are focusing on the fees, the Government are completely
ignoring—again, we will address this in the Immigration
Bill—the introduction of exit checks when people leave the
country. It is very simple, with today’s technology, to scan
every passport as people leave the country, whether they are EU or
non-EU. Then we would know who has left the country and who has come
into the country, which would also help to address the huge problem
with illegal
immigrants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000015"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:39:25"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Smith of Basildon" PimsId="5786" UID="14012896000188" xid="2058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000188">Baroness

pounds every year for firearms licences. Given that it establishes a
principle here, I hope it will apply to other areas of government

new provisions here talk about the new services that can be provided at
a cost. The Minister said something about this but it seems to me that
there is still an area of flexibility. He talked about the new optional
premium service and where it could be provided. Can he can say anything
more about that, or am I wrong and there is no flexibility? However,
from what is here and what he was saying, it is implied that there is
some flexibility in the services that can be charged for. I am
interested to see whether there is a definitive list of those services
that are not being charged for now but would be charged for in the
future. That would be a useful list to
have.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000018">I was
looking at the debate yesterday in the other place and one of the areas
that struck me, and is something that I have been looking at, was the
consultation. I did not think there was a consultation on these
proposals. It has closed but it has never been published. As a matter
of principle, it is always helpful if information on consultations is
published prior  to the debates on the issue because presumably
the consultation was to inform policy and this debate is to help form
policy. I would have greatly appreciated having the responses, or a
summary of them, and the details of that consultation prior to
today’s debate. Given that the discussion on fees will continue,
it would be helpful if the noble Lord could circulate, at least to
those interested in today’s debate, or place in the Library,
details of that consultation and the Government’s response to
it. We will not oppose the order today or pray against it because of
that, but I do not think it is a good

part of the proposal is that what the Government call
“commercial partners”—and most people call
contractors—would be able to charge for services they provide,
particularly visa applications. They would also be providing new
services and new fees. I hope that, when we discuss fees at a later
date, more information can be given to your Lordships’ House on

new services, new fees and

am curious about what appears to be an extended role for contractors in
visa applications. Can the noble Lord can say something more about what
work contractors will be undertaking that the Home Office is currently
undertaking? Will there be a transfer of responsibilities or of work? I
am not clear exactly what the contractors will be doing under the terms
of this order. Does the Minister know which contractors will be used?
Will there be new contracts to bid for? Who are the contractors, if
that information is available? What will the process be and what will
the work be? How long will any contracts be given for? The key point is
that presumably there has to be careful monitoring and high
expectations of the standards to be reached by contractors. There have
been issues with some big contracts, such as security for the Olympics,
which the Minister and I and debated on the Floor of the House.
Recently, we have seen security concerns raised over 
<?notus-xml column=371?>one of the private prisons and problems with electronic tagging. I think
there are multimillion-pound paybacks from some companies that the Home
Office has employed to undertake work on its behalf. If this is an
extension of contractors, we need some very clear assurances on what
the monitoring arrangements will be and how they will be enforced to
ensure high standards, especially if new fees are coming in to pay for
those services.</hs_para>

sums up the standards that we expect in the work being done by
contractors. We also want to know a little more about the fees and what
services will be covered by them. I hope that the Minister can answer
those questions. If he cannot, I shall be happy for him to write to me.

Popat (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the order will allow, along with
other secondary legislation, effective enforcement against foreign
vehicles that have not paid the new HGV road user levy as required by
the HGV Road User Levy Act 2013. The levy is due to start from 1 April
this year and is intended to ensure a fairer arrangement for UK
hauliers. At the moment, when UK HGV drivers travel to the continent,
they face road charges or tolls in most European countries. However,
when foreign-registered HGVs come to the UK, they pay nothing to use UK
roads. The levy will correct this imbalance and ensure that all HGVs
weighing 
<?notus-xml column=374?>12 tonnes or more using UK roads make a contribution to the upkeep of
those roads. At the same time, the Treasury is reducing vehicle excise
duty so that more than nine out of 10 UK vehicles will pay no more when
the levy is introduced than they do now. The levy must be paid before
using a UK road. Foreign vehicles may pay daily, weekly, monthly or
annually. The daily levy ranges from £1.70 to £10
depending on the nature of the vehicle; most foreign vehicles in the UK
are sufficiently large to pay £10 a
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000040">First,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:07:19"></hs_TimeCode> will summarise
how the enforcement process will work. It is an offence to use or keep
an HGV on a public road in the UK without paying the appropriate levy.
Enforcement will be carried out by the Driver and Vehicle Standards
Agency—the new name for the combined Vehicle and Operator
Standards Agency and Driving Standards Agency—and the police. We
will have information on foreign vehicles in the country sourced from
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. Since we also know which
vehicles have paid the levy, we can combine these two information
sources to target those vehicles in the country that have not paid.
DVSA can use this information to help determine which vehicles to stop.
Non-compliant foreign vehicles that cannot provide a satisfactory UK
address may be required to pay a fixed penalty deposit of £300
before they are allowed to continue on their journey. Failure to do so
will lead to impounding of the vehicle and fines of up to
£5,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000041">The
advantage of fixed penalty notices over taking forward a prosecution is
that they avoid adding to the burden on the courts. Furthermore, a
significant benefit from the levy is that the ability to require
financial penalty deposits at the roadside enables enforcement against
persons using vehicles registered outside the UK, who are difficult to
pursue effectively once they have returned to their country of
origin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000042">The
order builds on existing legislation. The Road Traffic Offenders Act
1988 enables the use of fixed penalty notices by police officers and
DVSA officers where a person given a fixed penalty notice is unable to
provide a satisfactory address. The monetary amount of such deposits is
set out in the Road Safety (Financial Penalty Deposit) (Appropriate
Amount) Order 2009. The order before the House today adds a new
financial deposit amount to the 2009 order of £300 for the
offence in Section 11(1) of the HGV Road User Levy Act
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000043">During
the passage of the 2013 Act, my noble friend Lord Attlee informed the
House that the amount of the financial penalty deposits would be
£200. However, since then, the Department for Transport has
conducted a general review of the levels of fixed penalty notices and
financial penalty deposits, which resulted in a general increase. As a
result of these increases, we have decided on an amount for a fixed
penalty notice and its associated financial penalty deposit of
£300 for the offence in Section 11(1) of the 2013 Act to ensure
that the penalty is broadly consistent with penalty levels for similar
offences. I commend the order to the

short debate on the road safety financial deposit order. One of the
things that concerns many 
<?notus-xml column=375?>people about road transport is not the fact that they pay a levy, but
rather that there are people who do not pay. They have all sorts of
means of avoiding doing so. It is no good just fining them £300
every time they do it; there should be a means of reckoning up if a
haulier or a company does the same thing time and again. I would like
to know if there is any method that would prevent them coming back here
to offend again. People do not like paying charges and will do
everything they can to avoid

this charge as perhaps the first step towards having a rational system
of road pricing in this country. The calculation has taken into account
such things as vehicle weight and other factors. However, it might be

road, and rather less from those who do not use it very

it may well be that the points I wish to raise will reveal that.

the Minister has said, the order provides for financial penalty
deposits to be applied where a relevant heavy goods vehicle is on a
public road in the UK without the appropriate road user levy having
been paid. Paragraph 7.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum states that, for
an HGV registered in the UK, the levy can be paid on an annual or
six-monthly basis. For an HGV registered outside the UK, the levy will
reflect the amount of time it is intended to use or keep the vehicle on
a public road in the UK and can be paid on a daily, weekly, monthly or
annual basis. This is hardly an earth-shattering point, but why has it
been decided that, for vehicles registered outside the UK, payment
cannot be made on a six-monthly basis, as it can for vehicles
registered in the
UK?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000048">Since, for
vehicles registered outside the UK, paragraph 7.2 uses the
word “intends”, does this mean —I think it
does—that a levy payment will have to be made prior to the
vehicles being allowed to enter the UK? Also, are there many vehicles
registered outside the UK which in reality are here for most or all of
the time? For vehicles registered outside the UK, what will be the
daily levy rate as a percentage of the weekly and monthly rate for the
same vehicle? That is, do you in effect get a discount if you are
paying on a weekly, monthly or annual basis, or is it a straight
multiplication of the daily levy rate?</hs_para>

7.3 refers to the police and DVSA officers being able to impose fixed

unable to give a satisfactory UK address. In the case of a fixed
penalty notice, I take it that it would be the same irrespective of the
length of time the vehicle had been used on a public road without
payment of the levy. If 
<?notus-xml column=376?>that is the case, can the Minister say why that is so? Why does it not
take any account of how long the vehicle has been used on a public road
in the UK without payment of the levy? To an extent, that develops or

ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000050">Since the

determine that judgment? What guidance will be given, and by whom, to
police officers and DVSA officers on this point, or will it be up to
each chief constable or police and crime commissioner—in the
case of police officers—to make the decision as to whether the
matter should be pursued by a fixed penalty notice or deposit, or
pursued to court? Is it the intention that police community support

come back to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made, under
what circumstances would a driver who was unable to give a satisfactory
UK address be taken to court for this offence, as opposed to being
asked for a deposit equivalent to the fixed penalty notice? What steps
would be taken to ensure that such a driver, or the company concerned,
turned up at court when told to do so? Of course, one of the arguments
for the deposit is that it is very difficult to find people if they
have left this country and gone back to the country from whence they
came. There may presumably be circumstances, possibly related to the
number of times they have offended, when you would wish to take these
people to court as opposed to dealing with it in this particular way.

regard to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, the HGV
Road User Levy Act 2013 establishes the levy. There is secondary
legislation to allow levies to be administered effectively. This
includes SIs to enable enforcement. Enforcement will be applied
severely where the levy has not been paid, and may include the
impounding of the vehicle.</hs_para>

</I>retrench the offences? The maximum levy fee is £1,000, or
£10 per day. Hopefully, the £300 fine each time a driver
is caught will prove a sufficient deterrent to not paying the necessary
levy. We give the choice of paying on a daily, weekly or annual basis.
The annual fee will be £1,000. What if the deposit is not paid?
As I mentioned earlier, if the driver is not able to pay the
£300 levy or if he has not had permission to drive in the UK,
the vehicle will be impounded until the levy is paid. Either the driver
pays or his company does. There are several ways of paying, including
credit cards and cash, preferably in pounds rather than
euros.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000058">Another
question was about why the fine is not related to the length of time
that a vehicle has been non-compliant. There are technical and legal
reasons for this, however we will know a vehicle’s history with

basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000059">Who
decides what enforcement approach to use? The DVSA will decide
this—it has a lot of experience of enforcing other offences. For
example, it is no different from paying £8 to drive in the city
of London through the congestion charge, whereby technology picks up a
car that has not paid the charge and a fine is immediately
issued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000060">With

that hauliers from the Republic of Ireland regularly flout the
driver’s hours regulations, the maintenance regulations of the
vehicle and the overweight regulations. The same hauliers come back
again and again. Apparently, under present regulations, the job of
enforcing these falls to the country of origin, so we are not able to
enforce anything unless 
<?notus-xml column=378?>we actually catch the person doing it. I am anxious for this to be
watertight. Impounding the vehicle is by far the most stringent penalty
you can impose, particularly—and I know a lot about
this—where the police officer has said to the driver who will
not pay or say where he is from, “Leave the vehicle and turn off
the refrigeration unit”. That usually leads to the money being
forthcoming. Therefore, while there is some intelligent policing, I
want to know whether we can enforce the thing

Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, under this legislation it is an offence
to keep a heavy goods vehicle on the road without having paid.
Impounding is one way of enforcing this. The chances are that a very
small number of vehicles will be impounded because most drivers carry
credit cards, or quite often they will ring the owners of the haulage
vehicle to see if they can make a payment over the telephone. Over
time, we will know if there are any shortcomings in the system and we
will do something to improve it. The noble Lord is quite right that
impounding vehicles for a long time is not practical, especially when
the police have to look after the vehicles. I can assure the noble Lord

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Faulks)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this statutory instrument revokes and
replaces the County Courts Jurisdiction Order 1981. A draft was laid
before Parliament on  18 December 2013. Subject to your
Lordships’ approval, the substantive change made by this
instrument concerns the county court’s jurisdiction in respect
of equity proceedings. Equity proceedings, which are specified in
Section 23 of the County Courts Act 1984, include the administration of
the estate of a deceased person, 
<?notus-xml column=380?>the execution or declaration of a trust, the dissolution or winding up

purpose of this instrument is to increase the relevant financial limit
in the 1981 order from £30,000 to £350,000 to extend the
equity jurisdiction of the county court. This will mean that the county
court may hear and determine equity proceedings up to a value of
£350,000. We do not intend to change the current financial
limits with regard to the county court’s jurisdiction in respect
of other proceedings which are also specified in the 1981
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000073">There
are two objectives underlying this reform. The first is to optimise the
use of judicial resources by ensuring that, where appropriate, cases
are determined at the most appropriate level of the court system,
commensurate with value and complexity. This will contribute to
rebalancing jurisdiction between the High Court and the county court,
where they both have concurrent jurisdiction, enabling the High Court
to focus on those complex matters that genuinely require its expertise.
The second objective is to reduce the number of equity proceedings that
are transferred from the High Court to the county courts, and therefore
reduce waiting times so that disputes are resolved expeditiously and
with proportionate costs and procedures for court users. This, in turn,
will contribute to promoting public confidence in the operation of our
courts.</hs_para>

setting out further details about this instrument and why the
Government are taking this action, I will briefly explain some
background to the reform. The Government are committed to providing an
effective and efficient civil justice system with a flexible judiciary
that is deployed in the most appropriate way. As part of this, we set
out our policy to reform the structure of the civil courts
in a series of proposals in the public consultation
document, <I>Solving Disputes in the County Courts: Creating a Simpler,
Quicker and More Proportionate System</I>,<I> </I>published by the
Government in March
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000075">Those
proposals were based on some of the recommendations made by Sir Henry
Brooke, a retired Lord Justice of Appeal, in his report, <I>Should the
Civil Courts be Unified?</I>, published in August 2008. His
recommendations were aimed at improving the administration of civil
justice and providing a more efficient use of judicial resources. The
Brooke recommendations included the establishment of a single county
court for England and Wales and the repeal of the requirement for the
Lord Chief Justice to seek the Lord Chancellor’s agreement in
deploying High Court judiciary to the county court. Both of these
recommendations were approved by Parliament in the Crime and Courts Act
2013 and will be implemented by the Government in April
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000076">By
statutory instruments shortly to be brought before Parliament, the
Government also propose, subject to approval of the House, to implement
three more Brooke recommendations, which are: extending the
jurisdiction to grant freezing orders to the county court; bringing
certain specialist proceedings under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
High Court; and increasing the financial limit below which non-personal
injury claims and certain Chancery proceedings may not be commenced in
the High Court from £25,000 to £100,000. Finally, of
course, subject to the approval of the 
<?notus-xml column=381?>House, we also intend to implement in April 2014 the Brooke
recommendation on equity jurisdiction that is before your Lordships
today.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012896000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000077">With
that background in mind, I will set out the problem with the current
financial limit of the equity jurisdiction and why the Government are
taking this action. Section 23 of the County Courts Act 1984 gives the
county court concurrent jurisdiction with the High Court to hear and
determine those equity proceedings specified in that section, subject
to the “county court limit”. Proceedings may be
transferred between the county court and High Court, subject to

criteria set out in Part 30 of the Civil Procedure Rules
1998.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000078">The
county court limit, set by the 1981 order, requires that equity
proceedings above a value of £30,000 be commenced in the High
Court. The rationale for the financial limit is to provide a benchmark
which will ensure that only appropriate cases, mainly those with
relatively high financial value and complexity, are heard in the High
Court, thereby limiting the volume of cases issued there. Over time,
however, the value of the £30,000 financial limit has fallen in
real terms, as the rising cost of properties has rendered it far less
effective than was originally
envisaged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000079">In
1981, when the limit was set, average house prices were only around
£25,000, which meant that the county courts were able to hear
the majority of property disputes involving equity. However, since
1981, house prices in the UK have increased by more than 600% in
nominal terms, so that, by 2013, average house prices in the UK had
risen to more than £175,000, which is seven times their value in
1981, and to around £345,000 in London. The financial limit,
therefore, has not kept pace with the rising cost of house prices and
has become detached from contemporary property values, which have risen
dramatically since the £30,000 limit was set. This has resulted
in many cases of relatively low complexity being heard unnecessarily in
the High Court. In some instances, cases are issued in the High Court
only to be transferred to the county court because the issues are
straightforward. In view of the administrative and judicial time taken
to allocate these cases in the High Court and the time taken to
reconsider them for transfer and the transfer itself, these transfers
often result in delays in dealing not only with that particular case
but with other
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000080">Following
the Brooke recommendations, the Judicial Executive Board, chaired by
the then Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge,
considered the evidence and concluded that the financial limit of the
equity jurisdiction of the county court should be raised from
£30,000 to £350,000. The report was then presented to the
Government for consideration and implementation. On the strength of the
evidence and of further engagement with the judiciary, the Government
consulted on the proposal in their <I>Solving Disputes</I> consultation
paper. A majority of respondents, who included legal practitioners,
members of the judiciary, judicial bodies and regulatory bodies, was in
support of an increase to £350,000. In view of the overwhelming
support from consultees, the Government announced their intention to
increase the financial limit to £350,000.</hs_para>

instrument seeks to give effect to that commitment. The changes
introduced by it support the Government’s commitment to an
effective and efficient civil justice and courts system. We consider
that the £30,000 financial limit set by the 1981 order is too
low. Consequently, with your Lordships’ approval, we will
increase the financial limit which divides the equity jurisdiction
between the High Court and the county courts from £30,000 to
£350,000. The increase would mean that more equity proceedings
are issued and dealt with in the county courts and may be transferred
to the High Court only if they are complex. It could potentially reduce
the volume of transfers from the High Court to the county courts,
thereby providing efficiency benefits for the courts as less time and
fewer administrative and judicial resources will be needed to allocate
and transfer these cases to the appropriate
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000082">Court
users, on the other hand, could experience a more streamlined service
and a reduction in hand-offs between jurisdictions. This is because
more equity proceedings will be issued in the county courts rather than
the High Court, which would lead to fewer cases being transferred from
the High Court to the county court, and the time taken to consider
cases for transfer—and the transfer itself—would be
reduced. I therefore commend this instrument to the Committee. I beg to

2012, and it has taken them a year since publishing the response to
produce this fairly straightforward order. This is not a political
matter. It does, however, suggest either that the department is
overworked and understaffed, or that it is congenitally incapable of

expressing 
<?notus-xml column=383?>their lack of confidence in the system—particularly in the

constructive points, thereby briefly breaking the habit of a
parliamentary lifetime. First, I suggest there should be some mechanism
by which the level could be periodically inflated without the necessity
for prolonged consultations and a ritualistic procedure such as we are
going through today. Why should not the Government say that, every five
years, the limit would be increased by the rate of inflation or
something of that kind—there might be a simpler way of going
about things—unless they concluded that it would not be sensible
to do that, in which case they would at that point come

second issue is of a different order, about the system as a whole and
how it might be made more efficient. Here I declare a paternal
interest, because my question is about the role of deputy part-time
district judges who sit in the county court dealing with a wide range
of matters. Have the Government looked, or are they looking, at the
distribution of cases between the full-time country court judiciary and
the part-time judiciary, and at whether one or the other might be
augmented in order to facilitate the kind of access and quicker
turnaround of cases, which the order should help in one, admittedly
fairly narrow, field? I do not expect the Minister to give an answer
off the cuff to that, but perhaps the department could look at
it—and perhaps the Minister could look at it personally, with
his obviously rich experience of the courts. It might be a way of
improving the system and possibly even saving some taxpayers’
money as well<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.

I am glad that he was taught equity by such a distinguished teacher. He
will know that for some these are difficult areas. However, he is
sceptical about the aspect of public confidence to which I referred.
The point is a simple one—namely, that cases that plainly ought
to be heard in the county court should not be heard in the High Court.
A lot of time has passed, property values have increased and, plainly,
the people who are concerned in these disputes would expect them to be
dealt with expeditiously and at an appropriate level by courts that are
convenient to them rather than at the county court. That is the element
of public confidence—a speedy, convenient

to the mechanism, a lot of time has elapsed and property prices have
increased far more quickly than they used to. I take the noble
Lord’s point that the mechanism might appear to be a little
laborious. However, there was a widespread consultation and, although
it may seem in retrospect that these things should be done more
quickly, the consultation included judicial and legal bodies,
regulatory bodies, representative bodies, local authorities, mediators
and mediation advocates, academics, citizens advice bureaux, financial
organisations, government departments and agencies and, indeed, members
of the public. Although the majority were 
<?notus-xml column=384?>very much in favour of this move, different views needed to be
considered. No doubt the question of the appropriate level of expertise
had also to be

terms of the judiciary, the noble Lord makes the point that
consideration might be given to the deployment of deputy judges and
declared his interest appropriately in that. The question of the
appropriate expertise is considered by the Judicial College, which
always considers any training requirements needed for the judiciary to
consider equity proceedings of a value up to £350,000. However,
of course, if a county court judge considers that a case is
particularly complex, it is still possible for him or her to transfer
the matter up to the High Court under Section 42 of the County Courts
Act 1984, so there is still that possibility. I will, of course, take
his comments about the deployment of judges back to the department. I
know that the Ministry of Justice always considers how best to use the
available judicial talent at all levels, as I indicated in my opening

local government elections in Northern Ireland use the single

boundaries were not finalised by the Executive prior to the end of the

recommendations on district electoral areas. The boundaries of the
local government districts and wards were finalised by the Executive in
November 2012. Since the District Electoral Areas Commissioner’s

However, they show, for those familiar with the geography, that a
fundamental injustice has been committed with the designation of the
boundaries for some of the councils. A glance at the map and a glance
at the proposals for Belfast show that it has been gerrymandered in the
most obvious and blatant way. Areas such as Dundonald and Ballybeen
have been excluded from the City of Belfast, along with Rathcoole, and
included, in the case of Dundonald and Ballybeen, with Lisburn and

commissioner and his team should be commended for their work in
liaising closely with community groups in Derry/Londonderry,
particularly given the historic sensitivity that surrounds polling
districts in the city. However, does the Minister agree that, on this
occasion, the commissioner should perhaps have listened more to the
advice of local community groups and accepted the recommendation to
change Rosemount DEA to Edenballymore? Those are a couple of technical
questions. If the Minister has the answers, fine, but if not she can

on precise decisions that have been through an arms-length, politically
neutral process and through a period of public consultation followed by
a series of public inquiries. Reports were written, decisions were made

to intervene or to change any of those decisions. I met the District

focus issues relating to individual communities, and people feel very
strongly about that. However,  as the noble Lord said,
consideration of the Bill next week will allow us to discuss the move

this matter out of curiosity rather than anything else, because, around
the north side of Glasgow, a great many of the constituency and county
boundaries mark out the boundaries of our estate. A lot of them have
remained so. That there is an East Dumbartonshire and a West
Dumbartonshire is due to some of the interests that we had in the 16th
century and they still remain. I am very interested to see this shift
in the constituency boundary, which is marked on the back of the order.
It looks like a map-maker ruled a line—I do not think that it is
our estate, but, if it is, we obviously made a mistake and did not make
the correct boundary previously. It is nice to see it being brought
into some sort of line, so I welcome the

their response to the order. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, asked
whether we would have to continue to consider orders of this nature.
The answer to that is yes, we will have to consider them in the future,
as Scottish parliamentary boundaries have not been devolved. As I have
explained, we are bound to implement the recommendations of the
Boundary Commission for Scotland, which is sponsored and funded by the
Scotland Office. However, there is some reason in what the noble Earl
suggests in that the Scotland Act 2012 devolved powers to Scottish
Ministers to make provision for the conduct of the Scottish Parliament
elections but not the boundaries. That is the reason for the confusion.

for town and green registration to resume if a development proposal is
withdrawn or rejected, as set out in “terminating
events”. The principle of what we are proposing is therefore
already established and was extensively debated during the progress of
the Growth and Infrastructure Bill. During the debates on that Bill
last year, my predecessor, my noble friend Lady Hanham, said on behalf
of the Government that we intended to extend the provisions to
development under other planning procedures. We explained that we
needed to consult on these extensions. Having done that, this order
delivers on that commitment.</hs_para>

order deal with two matters. First, the provisions in the Act relating
to local and neighbourhood plan preparation did not cover every
eventuality. We need to ensure that all outcomes in plan-making are
covered. That is why we are proposing a new catch-all terminating event
for local or neighbourhood plans, which will ensure that, in those
cases where a draft plan has not been adopted or made within two years
of its publication by the local planning authority, the exclusion on
the right to apply for registration of land as a green lifts. In other
words, the opportunity returns to local residents. This is to avoid the
situation where the exclusion on town and village green applications
remains in place even where development is no longer proposed under a
plan. This proposal has been welcomed by the majority of respondents to
the
consultation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000129">Secondly,
the order extends the protections to local development orders,
neighbourhood development orders and applications for deemed planning
permission in respect of Transport and Works Act 1992 orders. What
those measures have in common is the ability to grant deemed planning
permission for development, meaning that a developer does not have to
apply separately for planning permission from their local planning
authority.</hs_para>

order sets out trigger and terminating events for each of these
procedures, to signal when a town or village green application must be
excluded and when it can resume. If proposals are ultimately not taken
forward under these measures then the terminating events will ensure
that the right to apply for town or village green registration will
resume. We think it only reasonable to introduce protections for
development under consideration through these measures. Again, the
principle of this is supported by respondents to the consultation. It
makes for a consistent and open system.</hs_para>

within planning legislation to ensure that people have opportunities to
engage with the planning process and that their views are known when
these measures are prepared. These changes will apply only to
applications to register new town and village greens. Applications sent

proposals are uncontroversial and indeed have been broadly welcomed
during our consultation process. They ensure that land cannot be
registered as a town or a village green to prevent the consideration of
development, or to frustrate and delay planned and permitted
development. Instead, it means that decisions about development will
take place in the context of the planning system, which provides for
public involvement and where all material considerations are taken into
account. However, it also means that when development does not go
ahead, the right to apply for registration of a green will not be
unnecessarily excluded. In those circumstances there is no reason why
communities should not be able to apply to register the land as a
green.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000133">I

the two new terminating events: where a draft local plan is not
adopted, or a neighbourhood plan is not made by the end of two years.
As part of the justification for this, the impact assessment cites
evidence on the timing of plan preparation. Can the Minister expand on
this point so that we know more precisely what that evidence is? We are
told that no development orders have been made to date—I think
that that was as of 4 December—and I presume this is still the
position, so none of the responses to the consultation in that regard
is based on actual experience.

understand a little bit what that means. How many actually are there?
Given the circumstances where they have or might be used, what is the

give us an update on the number of TVG applications? The most recent

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, for his support, in principle, for the order. I will deal
first with the point that he raised about the consultation period. As
he acknowledged, prior to issuing the consultation document, we
identified a list of interested parties, who were notified of the
proposals on the first day of the consultation period. None of them
expressed concern about the length or timing of the consultation.
Clearly we ensure, as we did in this case, that we act in accordance
with Cabinet Office guidelines on consultation, and look carefully at
the nature and impact of proposals in considering the length of time
for consultation. We felt that six weeks was reasonable and
proportionate, as the measures proposed here are an extension of
measures consulted on and debated in the House during the passage of
the Bill last year. The principle was there and in place, and we feel
that the consultation approach that we undertook was appropriate for
these
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:40:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000144">The
noble Lord raised a couple of points around the evidence of the need
for the measures in the order. I will see in a moment whether I can
provide him with some specific data in response to that question but
the point to stress is that the extension of the trigger and
terminating events supports the policy objective that decisions on the
use of land should be taken through the planning system and related
consent regimes. If we did not address that gap through this order, we
would leave the system incomplete. It might mean, for instance, that a
town or village green application could be used to block developments
supported by a local community through a neighbourhood development plan
and that applications for deemed planning permission in respect of
important infrastructure works under the Transport and Works Act could
be delayed or prevented. As I tried to make clear in my opening
remarks, it is also about making sure that, at a point at which the
application for development under either of those schemes does not
transpire, it should be possible for local people to put forward an
application to make a piece of land a town or village green. We want
that to be possible and we want it to be clear when that should take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:42:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000145">That
leads me on to the noble Lord’s points about the two-year limit
and why we have used that timeframe. We believe that a two-year period
strikes the right balance and should allow sufficient time for local
planning authorities and others to get a plan or order in place,
including any amendment or consultation that is required. At the same
time, it is not so long as  to exclude town and village green
applications for an unnecessarily long period that would place no
onus  
<?notus-xml column=395?>on the local planning authority to undertake a plan or order-making
expeditiously. This is something that we will of course keep under
review as more evidence becomes available. There are powers in the

noble Lord raised the question of local development orders and whether
their existence might prevent applications for town and village green
registration. Parliament has agreed the principle that the planning
system should not be held up or derailed by the town and village green
registration system. Local development orders are prepared by local
planning authorities and are usually focused on a specific area where
the authority wishes to encourage development, for example enterprise
zones. A local planning authority that brings forward a local
development order must justify it or believe that, where built
development is proposed or permitted, the right to apply for a town or
village green should be
excluded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012896000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140128-gc0001.htm#14012896000147">The
noble Lord quoted from the National Planning Policy Framework document
and asked some questions about it. The document allows communities to
designate land that is special to them. There is no requirement for use
of land by the public. I am struggling to understand this. I shall say
what I think is the answer to the noble Lord’s question and if
my colleagues want to shove that piece of paper at me again, I will go
back to it. My understanding is that communities may consider using the
new local green space designation introduced in the National Planning
Policy Framework. Local communities can identify land of particular
importance to them for special protection as local green space either
by engaging with their local planning authority in the local
plan-making process or by taking steps to bring forward a neighbourhood
plan. My interpretation of that is that if, as part of drawing up a
local plan, a local community designates an area in that way as part of
that framework, it is then given the equivalent status of a town and

village green<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:47:13"></hs_TimeCode>. I

conclusion, the introduction of this order will ensure a consistent
approach to town and village green registration in situations where a
development is proposed or permitted. It will help to stop the
potential for misuse of town and village green applications to
undermine planned development. It will address overlapping consent
regimes and reduce delay, uncertainty and cost to all concerned. It is
an important precautionary measure, as I have already said, and will
not affect the existing strong protection for registered town and

appeal against designation made under the Terrorism (United Nations

to designations are also ongoing, one brought by Gulam MASTAFA against
the Treasury and other government departments, and another brought by
an individual, known as “M”, against the Treasury. The
challenge under s63(2) of the Counter-Terrorism 
<?notus-xml column=50?>Act 2008 brought by Mohammed AL GHABRA against the Treasury and joined
to be heard with his claim for Judicial Review against the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office, was withdrawn by the Claimant. In the quarter to
