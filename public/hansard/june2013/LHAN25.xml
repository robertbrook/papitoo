strategy under review. Indeed, since 2011 it has announced a new
development relationship with India and South Africa. In addition, the
multilateral aid review is being updated, with full publication planned
for the end of 2013. That, of course, relates to the international
organisations with which we
work<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
policies continue to evolve with the progress that countries make on

McConnell of Glenscorrodale:</Member></B> Between 1993 and 2005,
Burundi lost almost one in 20 of its population during the civil war,
and today it is still the 10th poorest country in the world. Despite
that, and despite the fact that it is increasingly stable, the UK
withdrew all overseas development assistance to Burundi two years ago.
Given that the Government have been willing to
review the decisions on India and South Africa in one direction, would
they be willing to reallocate some of that money to Burundi and
reinstate a

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> The issue of Burundi is an important
one, and I acknowledge the efforts that the Burundi Government have
made. The review that was done on the allocation of bilateral aid
resulted in the decision to which the noble Lord just referred.
Nevertheless, I assure him that DfID continues to support Burundi
through a range of other channels. For example, DfID contributes to
multilateral efforts in Burundi by providing 15% of EU funding and more
than 14% of World Bank funding. DfID is committed to development in
Burundi and will continue to support it through efforts with
international

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My noble friend raises a very
important point. In all DfID funding, this concern has been expressed
across the board, by both the previous Government and the current
Government. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister has taken up
this issue personally. Indeed, in his golden thread, he sees the rule
of law and good governance 
<?notus-xml column=856?>within countries as essential features of continuing support. Indeed, we
are looking at countries such as Pakistan, where tax collection is very
low, to ensure that tax levels and collection rates are improved

Ministry of Defence expenditure and DfID

What sort of expenditure is meant to be covered, what sort of events
are now meant to be part of the DfID budget as opposed to the MoD
budget, what proportion of the DfID budget is covered by this, and how
does it affect the overall commitment to funding of 0.7% of

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I am delighted to say that, as no
doubt the noble Lord heard, my right honourable friend the Chancellor
announced yesterday that DfID funding will continue to be at 0.7%.
Indeed, we are the only country to do so and we are leading on this,
which is something to be proud of. On the issue that he raises of the
Ministry of Defence and the FCO, we continue to work across government
with DfID to ensure initiatives that can be run and where there are
economies. The Building Stability Overseas initiative is a great
example of how DfID, the MoD and the FCO work together. However, DfID
funding is for DfID purposes and, as my right honourable friend
announced yesterday, is being protected at
0.7%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T11:09:29"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Chidgey" PimsId="4872" UID="13062765000623" xid="1881" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000623">Lord
Chidgey:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend mentioned Pakistan in
an earlier answer. I believe that the Government plan to more than
double aid to Pakistan to more than £350 million per year,
making it the largest recipient of UK aid, dependent on progress with
reforms at federal and provincial level. I think my noble friend will
be concerned by reports from global aid agencies of a failure to
deliver effective provincial health organisations, while at the same
time dismantling the national federal systems, which is compromising
the country’s vaccination programmes. Are the Government now
reviewing Pakistan’s aid package in the light of what appears to
be a failure to achieve the reforms
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T11:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="13062765000624" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000624">Lord
Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> First, I say to my noble friend that
we should be encouraging countries such as Pakistan. For the first
time, we have seen a successive Government take over and democracy and
corporate governance in the country are being strengthened. We should
welcome that. Certainly, as a key partner in various initiatives,
Pakistan is very important to the future of our relationship. The noble
Lord raises an important point about the work done with the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. I pay tribute to the work it
does, particularly in countries such as Pakistan; indeed, it is about
to announce a new initiative to tackle the measles epidemic that is
sweeping Pakistan. However, my noble friend the Minister for Pakistan,
who happens to be sitting right next to me, has several times raised
the importance of ensuring that aid at local and regional levels
reaches the people we intend it to
assist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T11:12:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I think I have made my position clear.
We as a Government have ensured that DfID funding at 0.7% will be
protected. That is unequivocal; it was made clear by the Chancellor and
the Secretary of State, and we should welcome this. As for
international development, we are not only playing our part but leading

Commonwealth Development Corporation? It was originally a superb
instrument for promoting entrepreneurship, small business and farm
development throughout the developing world, particularly the
Commonwealth. It rather lost its way, but now, with DfID’s help,
it is getting back on stream again; it is a very good instrument. Does

shows how important aid is in terms of our position and status in the
world and what one might loosely call impacts on soft power, although I

opposition. The agreement to lift the arms embargo for the Syrian
national coalition sends a clear signal to the Assad regime that it has
to negotiate seriously, and that all options remain on the table if it
refuses to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T11:15:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Our priority
remains to advance a political transition that ends the conflict,

that response. I am sure we all recognise the dilemma that faces
anybody who wants to see the end of the Assad regime. However, the
Government argued long and hard to secure lifting the EU arms embargo,
so can the Minister explain how sending arms to Syria will decrease the
violence there, particularly as, if it were to happen, it is likely to
incite more arms to go in from Russia to support the Assad regime? Can
the Minister also tell the House how the Government could be certain
that any arms exported to Syria did not fall into the hands of al-Qaeda
or other terrorist organisations that we believe are fighting alongside
the legitimate and indigenous Syrian
opposition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T11:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="13062765000634" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000634">Baroness

we can see from the way the House is responding that these are
questions that other noble Lords want answering too. I have a huge
amount of respect for the noble Baroness, but it would be wrong of me
to start hypothesising about a decision that has not yet been taken. I
can assure her that a decision has not been taken at this stage to
supply arms to the Syrian opposition. I hope that she and the House can
take great comfort from the fact that when we have, for example,
supplied non-lethal assistance to the opposition, we have been
incredibly cautious about ensuring that even that equipment, whether in
the form of humanitarian support or indeed armoured vehicles, does not
get into the hands of

conference where the UN, the US and Russia sit round the table with the
opposition and members of the regime to try to find a political

million over the spending period to prevent rough sleeping and tackle
homelessness, including £34 million to the Greater London
Authority to tackle rough sleeping across the capital, and £20
million to support the national rollout of the No Second Night Out
initiative and protect vital front-line services. The ministerial

Roberts of Llandudno:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for
that reply. Does he agree with the conclusions of the report produced
yesterday by St Mungo’s, which suggests that the factors more
often present in the lives of those who slept rough were, first, a
traumatic childhood; secondly, drug and alcohol use; and thirdly,
mental ill health? Will the Minister and the Government be ready to
join with organisations such as St Mungo’s, which do tremendous
work with the homeless and rough sleepers, in setting up a permanent
group to look continuously at these

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> On my noble friend’s final
point, of course the Government are always looking at such groups and
how we can take good practice forward. I will certainly take that
suggestion back to the department. The homelessness figures for London,
for example, show that more than 53% of those who are sleeping rough
are non-UK nationals. However, my noble friend raises the important
issue of mental health and there are statistics to substantiate his
point. Many people who find themselves homeless suffer from mental
health illnesses, and it is important that that responsibility is not
shunned in any

Laming:</Member></B> My Lords, further to the Question of the noble
Lord, Lord Roberts, does the Minister agree that the vulnerability of a

for concern? Will the Government not just give further thought to their

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> Again a valid concern is raised. I
should add to the noble Lord’s comments that last year only six
young people under the age of 18 were found sleeping rough in London,
for example, out of about 6,500. That said, they are among the most
vulnerable. Certainly young people between the ages of 18 and 25 are

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, is the Minister aware that one
of the reasons for homelessness, and in particular rough sleeping, may
be that there is often a delay in benefits being paid? People simply do
not know what to do, particularly if they are on their own, and they
therefore end up sleeping
rough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T11:33:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="13062765000666" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000666">Lord

raises about benefits being paid, I know that we are considering moving
from a three to a seven-day period. I heard the shadow Chancellor say
in the other place only this morning—and certainly in his media
appearances—that he would perhaps support the move to a
seven-day period. It is important to share information so that we can

Hussain:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that
homelessness and rough sleeping have some connection with human
trafficking? A BBC documentary of 27 February last year suggested that
some rough sleepers may have paid huge amounts of money to agents
abroad to come to the UK, only to find themselves on arrival homeless,
out of work, suffering from various illnesses and ending up sleeping
rough. What measures are being taken to tackle this complex
issue?</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My noble friend raises another
important point. As I have said in a previous answer, 53% for example
of the homeless in London constitute non-UK nationals. I share with him
that it is important that the Home Office together with others 
<?notus-xml column=864?>take initiatives to ensure that people who travel to our shores are
checked and vetted for their employment opportunities and whether they
can afford to sustain their lives here. If not, that information needs
to be shared with them at the port of embarkation, not in the UK. We
are working with some of our partners in Europe to produce that
information, and translating and making it available in Europe and
other countries, to ensure that, before travelling, people are aware of
what they are doing and that if they do not have a job or a place to

pursuing policies that will increase homelessness, notably the way in

benefit cap into context. In 2010-11, £201 billion
was spent on welfare and pension payments. We simply cannot sustain
that. The Government are ensuring that we tackle homelessness. I am
delighted to say that my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary to
the Treasury has just announced in the other place a new, three-year
affordable homes programme for 2015 that adds close to £2.8

Chief Secretary ever to have had this pool of commercial expertise at
my disposal during a spending round. They tell me that we can do more
to save money for the taxpayer. So, working closely with the Minister
for the Cabinet, I will conduct a further rolling efficiency review of
all departments to unlock savings to support our economic priorities. I
will strengthen the financial management capability in government, too.
We will take action to sell off £15 billion-worth of public
assets by 2020. Some £10 billion of that money will come from
corporate and financial assets, such as the student loan book, and the
other £5 billion will come from land and
property.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000067">The
Government are the custodians of taxpayers’ assets. When we no
longer need them we should sell them back at a fair price and not act
like a compulsive hoarder. Too often, local and national government sit
on an area of land that could be put to good use for the economy,
housing or schools. Today, we say this to businesses and communities,
‘If there are any publicly owned sites out there that you can
make economic use of, then tell us’. Unless Ministers can be
convinced that the site is needed, we will sell that land at a fair

us not forget that the plans we inherited from the previous Government
included significant cuts to capital spending in this Parliament. We
have added to those plans year-on-year with more money for investment

since we came to office more than 30 transport schemes have
been completed, 150 railway stations have been upgraded and we have
built 84,000 affordable homes. However, we need to work more smartly to
improve delivery. No single Government infrastructure project in recent
memory has been quite as triumphant as the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic
games, so we appointed Lord Deighton, the man who oversaw that success,
to improve infrastructure delivery across government. He is working his
way through Whitehall department by department, helping to develop
clear delivery plans. Today, the Government are accepting his central
recommendation that we take crucial infrastructure delivery out of the
hands of civil servants and into the hands of commercial
experts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000069">Our

school nearby in a good state of repair, and this is how we will give
it to them. First, some buildings simply are not good enough, so we are
rebuilding 261 of the worst schools as part of the Priority School
Building programme. With the moneys I have committed today, we will
complete this by 2017—two years early. There are many other
schools in need of repair and investment. The previous Government
stopped even checking just how many schools were in need of repair. We
have started again. We will put £10 billion behind this, which
will be enough to clear the urgent backlog. We are investing, too, to
create 1 million new places in a decade across the country, including
in Lancashire, Leeds and London—better buildings and a place for
every child are the best investment in our future
generation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000071">We
will continue to invest in the health of the nation, too. The health

infrastructure, including facilities for our world-leading work on

new approach to housing is truly transformative. Our Help to Buy scheme
is already getting people on to the ladder. But, put simply, this
country does not have enough homes that people can afford. The previous
Government allowed the number of affordable homes to fall by a shocking
420,000. A good home should not be a luxury for the few, but an
achievable aspiration for the many. We are already ensuring that the
affordable housing supply increases every year, not decreases, as it
did in every year but one under the previous Government. But our
housing associations have told me that they can do more. To do that,
they need certainty on rents, alongside public investment. So today I
can provide both those things: I can guarantee that social rents will
be set at the consumer prices index plus 1% out to 2025—the
longest period of certainty ever; and I can provide £3 billion
more capital over three years from 2015 to deliver 165,000 new
affordable homes. On average, that is more each year than in any of the
past 20 years; it is more in three years than the previous Government
managed in seven. And we can do all that because our approach gets
twice as many houses as they did for every pound we put in, getting
more for the taxpayer and more for this country. This spending round
also funds over 2,500 more new homes specifically designed for older
and disabled people, and £160 million for decent homes, mainly
in London. I know that issue is important to many MPs, particularly my
right honourable friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark

many Members of this House, on both sides, have in recent years seen
the devastation that flooding can cause in their constituencies. We
need to work with the private sector to protect families from the
threat of flooding, so we will provide £370 million in 2015 and
increase that in real terms every year to 2020. More than 400,000

vital role to play in 
<?notus-xml column=868?>helping households deal with the consequences when flooding does occur.
I am pleased to tell the House that we have now reached an initial
agreement with the Association of British Insurers on the future of
flood insurance. The industry wants to do the right thing and so do we.
We have always said that we wanted to find a solution that works for
households at risk of flooding, wider bill payers and the taxpayer. The
industry’s proposed scheme, known as Flood Re, promises to do
that by effectively limiting insurance prices for high-risk households.
Up to 500,000 households would be helped, with support targeted towards
those on lower incomes. Support would be funded by a levy on insurers,
something the ABI has promised us will not increase customer bills in
general. Importantly, there will be no cost to

1927, so we have set out a clear, long-term plan to cope with that
demand. Last year, we announced that Network Rail had been funded to
deliver the largest programme of rail investment since the Victorian

new life to our rail networks, upgrading stations such as King’s

well as revolutionising the way in which we get our energy, we are
transforming how we generate and supply it. As we face the challenge of
climate change, we need to bring forward investment in low-carbon
technologies. This country has massive potential in wind, wave and
tidal. We need to harness it. We are putting in place a comprehensive
energy policy through the Energy Bill that is in front of this House.
This is an approach that we know will work for consumers and investors
alike. Last year we made the unprecedented decision to set out funding
plans for low-carbon generation all the way to 2020, providing up to
£7.6 billion in real
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000094">Now we
can set out what this means for investors. We do this through setting
strike prices. If future prices are below this level, we will guarantee
a price to the generator, giving them the confidence to invest now. But
if they rise above it, we will claw back money for consumers. We were
planning to set strike prices next month, but we have been able to make
faster progress so, today, I can announce that we are publishing the
prices for renewable generation ahead of schedule. Prices have been set
for key renewable technologies, including onshore and offshore wind,
tidal, wave biomass and solar. The prices are broadly similar to those
we 
<?notus-xml column=872?>would have to pay under the renewables obligation. We will set the price
at the level we need to bring forward sufficient investment, but not a
penny higher. As these technologies develop, costs will fall, so we
will reduce the price too. For instance, next year we will guarantee
generators £155 per megawatt hour of offshore wind. By 2018 this
will fall to £135. We expect our reforms to bring forward 8 GW
to 16 GW of offshore wind capacity. Industry asked for certainty; we
have given it. Now industry needs to get on with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000095">Yes,
this approach has costs now but, in the long term for consumers, they
will be more stable than they would otherwise have been. In fact, when

2020. We are taking the right decisions now for the good of our
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000096">In
addition, we need to guarantee that capacity will be available at short
notice to meet spikes in demand, for instance through gas-fired
stations. Today we can provide details on a new regime that will
achieve this. The first auction for this new capacity market will run
next year to provide certainty for the winter of 2018. But there is
financial risk for construction, too. That is why we have set up a
Green Investment Bank to back green energy projects. It has committed
over £600 million already; for instance, it has
invested in the Walney wind farms off the north-west coast of England,
which are expected to provide energy to the equivalent to 300,000
households. We have already pledged to provide £3 billion for
the bank and, today, I can announce that we will provide an additional
£800 million so that it can expand further. Crucially
this will include, for the first time, the power to borrow half a
billion pounds in 2015-16 from government. This is a real milestone in
green investment, delivering a key promise we made in our election
manifesto, unlocking over £100 billion of private investment

year or next, and a real-terms cut in capital investment in 2015? Can
he confirm, as the Office for Budget Responsibility has, that in the
three years since 2010 the Government have actually spent £5.6
billion less than the previous Government had planned on
infrastructure? Can he also confirm that, in consequence, in 2010 the
Government cancelled a string of shovel-ready infrastructure schemes,
some of which they are now trying to reinstate although, of course,
they are no longer shovel-ready? These include the cancellation of 715
new and refurbished schools and a string of major road schemes,

did nothing for two years. Then, last year, the Prime Minister
appointed a commission, but the commission will not even report for

projections in the infrastructure programme. Perhaps I may remind the
House that this is a proposal for long-term planning for
infrastructure. What was the long-term legacy left by the previous
Government of whom the noble Lord was a member? It consisted of a note
that said, “There is no more money left”. His Government
presided over what we now know was a GDP falling by 7.2%, which we have
spent the last three years turning round. We are now doing what
everyone involved in infrastructure wants to happen—that we set
out a long-term, credible plan for infrastructure development. He talks
about the level of planning and the expenditure planned. However, this
Government, and these plans, would generate a degree of expenditure on
capital investment and infrastructure over this decade that is greater
than that achieved over the lifetime of the last Labour Government.

out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000114">The noble

stimulate the housing market and house purchases had been successful.
He will know that the announcements made by the Chancellor at the
general election have already resulted in many people who would

delivery and implementation over the years? He may be too young, but
does he recall that back in 1980, I announced in the House of Commons

giant pressurised water reactor nuclear power stations, but only one
ever got built? Of course, life would be very different today for our
power sector, and we would have much more opportunity for low carbon,
if we had those machines in place but the programme failed. Will he
make sure that his colleagues in government, particularly in the
Department of Energy and Climate Change, are fully aware of why the
failures occurred, why the vast stabilisation and drop in fossil fuel
prices undermined most of the economics of nuclear and why the
political resistance built up? There are lessons to be learnt there

view that low interest rates are here to stay for a significant period
ahead. Only an idiot would predict what interest rates will be in 2020
but if we look at the next three or four years, I do not think that
anybody would say that interest rates were going 
<?notus-xml column=878?>to rise significantly, if at all. As for whether employing lots of
people to build houses or roads means that fewer people are unemployed,

on infrastructure investment, in particular the commitment to removing
bottlenecks on the A19 in Tyne and Wear, both to the south and to the
north of the Tyne Tunnel. May I ask him about the proposals for the A1
north of Newcastle and the western bypass? As I understand it, there is
a feasibility study to consider problems and solutions to the A1 north
of Newcastle. The solution is clear; it is the dualling of the A1. I

told yesterday has increased in cost by a third even before a single
activity has happened on the ground? It is now set to cost more than
£40 billion. It is perfectly possible to have privately funded

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, three years ago when this coalition
Government were first formed, both the Liberal Democrats and the
Conservatives made it plain that despite our political differences, and
there are inevitably many, we had to come together to focus on the
economy, moving the country out of recession, and to get spending back
into balance. I think that most Governments across the world have found
coping with the effects of the global recession challenging, and we are
no
exception.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000144">Yesterday’s
comprehensive spending review announcement showed that we are not
through the tough times. However, talking to businesses, I am beginning
to hear a different tone. The heads down, “let’s just
survive this” approach is beginning to lift, and for some
sectors, notably the knowledge economy, there are some signs of early
growth. Vince Cable MP, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation
and Skills, has created an effective industrial strategy, investing
£5.5 billion in supporting science, high-tech manufacturing and
renewable energy to build jobs for the future, many of which will be
competing

focus on the global market is critical to growth. Some 80% of the
UK’s small and medium-sized enterprises are not exporting. While
for many local businesses exporting is not appropriate, there are some
that would really benefit. Statistics show that there is a 34% increase
in productivity in the first year of exporting. It also helps with the
survival rates of businesses. UK Trade and Investment has a key role in
supporting local businesses as they take their first steps in
exporting, which will strengthen their chances of survival and help
them to
grow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000146">They

well as providing clear 
<?notus-xml column=881?>expectations of the banking sector in its approach to lending to SMEs.

absolutely critical to the economy, and for an individual’s life
chances. We need a strong economy to be able to compete on the global
stage and we need sustainable jobs for a fairer society, helping
everyone to get on in life. Yet business organisations continue to
report that serious skills shortages are getting in the way of them
competing effectively. Worse, many report losing business to
international competitors. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills
reports that 16% of vacancies are due to skills shortages; that is,
there are not enough qualified applicants for specialist roles such as
technicians. Nearly half of those businesses say that they struggle to
meet their customer service objectives, and that they also have to
delay developing new products or

also report that an estimated 1.5 million employees—that is 5%
of the UK workforce—do not have the right skills to be able to
carry out their job. This is known as skills gaps in the jargon. This
often causes friction, with other staff having to help out, and
difficulties in meeting quality standards. Nearly a third of businesses
report that skills gaps have increased their operating costs and
therefore reduced productivity. The UKCES highlights the importance of
workforce skills, making it one of the five drivers of productivity; in
turn, that increased productivity will help growth.</hs_para>

critical to sustainable jobs. Frankly, UK plc has not done well enough
in the past. Future Governments must address this. Courses,
particularly in science, technology, engineering and maths, at further
and higher education levels, must be promoted and supported,
particularly for these critical technician jobs. Core skills in
literacy, numeracy and ICT must be strengthened, and it should not be
possible to drop either literacy or numeracy at 16. Applied short
courses should be available for 16 to 18 year-olds—for example,
English for engineers, or statistics for humanities students such as my

study is not always appropriate for young people. For many, the best
route into work is through an apprenticeship. This Government have
created more than 1.2 million new apprentices. Last year there were 11
applicants for every apprenticeship, which says quite clearly that
currently there are not enough employers offering apprenticeships.
Those that do offer apprenticeships use them to train staff over a
number of years, so that the progression from intermediate level, at
which most young people start an apprenticeship at 16, to advanced
level and on to higher apprenticeships is becoming more
common.</hs_para>

3,700 new starts for higher apprenticeships—a whopping 67%
increase on the previous year—specifically responding to the
skills shortages to which I referred earlier. Marshall Aerospace in
Cambridge is one such employer to offer apprenticeships across the
company, not just in technician roles. Young people from all over the
country apply, knowing that they will be supported from the age of 16
right the way through degree-level courses and some postgraduate study
for a satisfying job, which also helps the economy and exports. In
evidence to the Work and Pensions Select Committee in 2010, the CBI

return briefly to the OECD report. The lower your skills level the more
chance there is that you will be out of work. Of young people who are
unemployed, a quarter are without five good GCSEs, 14% have 
<?notus-xml column=883?>good GCSEs but no further qualification, and 8% have a
degree. That is stark. Skills are essential for jobs in the 21st<Sup>

and employment, whether apprenticeships or courses at their local FE
college. Last year, further education colleges saw an 83% increase in
applications from unemployed young people recognising that they needed

problems like this, the Youth Contract and apprenticeships are clearly
having an impact on youth unemployment, unlike the problems with
Labour’s New Deal and the Future Jobs Fund during the previous
Government, which did not create new jobs or help people into work, and
were very expensive. For example, he Future Jobs Fund cost
£6,500 for every job it created, and in Birmingham, only 2% of

on the right track. Even though the road from the economic collapse in
2008 is hard, we are making progress. Sustainable jobs are a key part
of the rebalancing needed in the economy. We have helped businesses to
create more than 1 million private sector jobs since taking power,
which has more than offset the number of public jobs
lost—painful as that is. We have created 1.2 million
apprenticeships and provided £2,000 worth of support for
employers. We have created 110,000 work placements for unemployed young
people. Being in work improves your health and well-being; it gives
workers’ children a better start in life; and it helps prevent
isolation and social breakdown. More than this, jobs created to help
companies grow increase productivity and the UK’s ability to
export and trade abroad, bringing in much needed extra wealth. It is a
virtuous circle which will give us a stronger economy and a fairer

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I was at the final two debates last
night, one of which was about small and medium-sized enterprises and
exports. Many noble Lords commented that language was one of
the challenges for small and medium-sized businesses in exporting. One
of the most difficult areas of language, with which Google
Translate would never deal, is sayings or colloquialisms. One of the
first I ever learnt was, “To every cloud there is a silver
lining<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:20:03"></hs_TimeCode>”.

it is carbon emissions. It causes global warming and is a real issue.
Now that we have passed 400 parts per million in carbon emissions and
are moving towards higher temperatures, we have, as noble Lords know,
the retreating polar ice caps and sea levels going up some 3
millimetres every year. It is carrying on. I was obviously delighted by
my noble friend’s pronouncement about investment this morning,
but I was even more ecstatic about President Obama’s recent
pronouncement about the United States restarting its global and
national engagement on climate change and global warming, particularly
on restricting American coal emissions and making a major contribution
to the reduction in global carbon emissions.</hs_para>

think of China as one of the world’s greatest polluters, it is a

is the silver lining? It is clearly that this offers opportunities to
us as a nation, uniquely, to take advantage of the technologies and how
the way in which we live needs to change. As someone who often speaks
on energy and climate change, that is why I supported the coalition so
strongly when it was formed and the coalition agreement was authored:
we were to be the greenest Government ever. I agree that we have
struggled with that. We are still there and are still moving forward,
but that aim and the policies arising from it—I will go through
some of those—are the major reasons why we can look forward to
growth beyond our recent track record and that of other European
nations. Over<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:22:48"></hs_TimeCode>
the past couple of years, growth in green industries has been at around
2.5% per annum, while we have had relatively difficult

will really help us in three main areas, and they are not always the
ones that we think about; we sometimes think about investment in wind
farms and that sort of area, but I will come back to that. One of the
key areas is competitiveness. We often hear about how shale gas has
reduced energy costs in the United States and about how, because of
that, US industry has become more competitive. However, that is an
economy that thrives on energy inefficiency. That is the background to
the power of the United States: wasteful carbon emissions and energy
use making it the great manufacturing and industrial nation that it
was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:23:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a very different model for potential energy efficiency. For the long
term, we can perhaps reduce energy costs for business through the lower
gas prices that we are yet to see from any shale gas development, but
clearly we can ensure that we can do so through energy efficiency. That
is why the programmes that the Government have brought forward,
particularly the Green Deal, are important for our future not just for
our homes but for businesses as

only just started. The Government have been absolutely right to make
sure that the programme has had a fairly soft start so that we learn,
as that process goes forward, that it does not rely on public
expenditure, making it future-proof against budgets and Chancellors of
whatever colour taking decisions. Once that investment programme works,
it has the benefit not only of relieving fuel poverty and reducing fuel
bills but of making our industry more competitive and producing a large
number of real jobs in the semi-skilled area, which are so important,
as well as the skilled areas as we move through the long term to the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000170">I
think that we have made the right decision on energy-intensive
industries, although I was somewhat iffy about this at the time. I have
to admit that we risk increasing carbon and energy costs and offshoring
energy-intensive industries. By doing that, we just shift those
emissions geographically from the UK, where there is relatively better
environmental regulation, to other economies where perhaps that is not
the case. Therefore I welcome a transition for those industries, and it
has to be a transition until we have a much more level playing field

on from competitiveness, we come to investment. In the green economy,
we have, as my noble friend the Minister has already announced, a huge
programme of potentially £100 billion for energy investment.
Much of that will be very highly skilled work, which will be local and
will produce local jobs and local skills. We have to make sure that we
get the current Energy Bill on to the statute book and make some of the
detail better than it is at the moment, but we have a real focus on

million of investment and 500 extra jobs. In addition, we have a number
of potential wind farm sites. In Scotland we have AREVA, where we hope
to have another 750 jobs. We will see if those arrive. This

these austere times in which we live, it is not rocket science to
realise that jobs are extremely difficult to come by and that each and
every opportunity that exists to create jobs must be exploited to the
full. SMEs provide vast opportunities for job creation. They simply
must be encouraged, be it through the ability to borrow funds for
expansion, or through the simplification of bureaucracy and unnecessary

people and has an engineering academy, which is to be applauded. For
many years I have taken a considerable interest and have acquired
friends in various industries both within and outside that region. I am
well aware of the many obstacles which normally face SMEs. Recently I
have been made aware of situations in which a government agency is
making life exceptionally difficult and, tragically, sometimes terminal

its website without any adequate consultation, which had the effect of
frightening off the customers of the company. Those customers were
fully satisfied with the product that they were purchasing
but did not wish to risk the wrath of the EA, which can be very
dangerous indeed. However, the company had the benefit of the opinion

complying with the European directive that governs this area.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:33:18"></hs_TimeCode> appears that
the EA takes very little notice of the European directive’s
spirit and purpose. Instead it follows entirely its own agenda, leaving

looking at the figures behind what is happening in the field of
employment and unemployment, there are of course some very welcome
signs of improvement. It would be wise to note at the beginning that
the direction of travel is correct. For example, unemployment in the UK
over the past year has fallen faster than in Germany and the G7 as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000185">Since
the 2010 election, the number of people who claim the main out-of-work
benefits has fallen by more than 300,000, while the youth claimant
count—a very important figure—fell by 2,500 this month
and is lower than it was at the May 2010 election. The other side of
the coin is that private sector employment is up 46,000 on the latest
quarter, which more than offsets the 22,000 jobs that were lost in the
public sector. If you take that as a whole since May 2010, private
sector employment is up by 1.3 million jobs, while of course public
sector jobs have fallen by 423,000 over the same
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000186">The
direction of travel is good and encouraging but there is no reason for
complacency. It is important that we continue to tackle what is of
fundamental importance for our people. For those of us who want a
fairer society, ensuring that people can get into work will have
dramatic effects on health and well-being and on future life chances,
for them and for their families. For those who want to see a stronger
economy—of course the subject of this debate covers both those
topics—each new job adds an average of about £9,000 to
the economy. For those who just want to reduce welfare spending, the
best way to do that is to get people into sustainable, well-paid work,
not to slash support for the
vulnerable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:36:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the demand side. Today we have clearly had some important news. This
morning we published the latest figures on the UK Government’s
Work Programme, the Government’s main vehicle for getting
long-term unemployed people into work. The key headline message that I
take from today’s figures is that the Work Programme’s
performance has significantly improved. It is designed to help people
who are at risk of becoming long-term or very long-term unemployed.
Many of those supported by the Work Programme are in receipt of benefit
for nine or 12 months before joining and are then supported for a
minimum period of two years. The Work Programme has not yet been
running for two years, so today’s signs are very
encouraging.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000188">The
Work Programme not only supports people into employment, but is also
designed with the crucial aim of keeping them there. It encourages
long-term private sector employment and is not just a short-term fix.
Today’s figures show that 132,000 people have escaped long-term
unemployment and got into lasting work, normally for at least six
months. This is a large increase compared to the first year of the
scheme. However, that is not the whole story. Far more people have
started work but have not yet reached that target point of six months
in work. Therefore, today’s figures from the Government are only
for those who have been in work for six months or longer. However,
figures from industry that were published last week showed that 321,000
people who were on the Work 
<?notus-xml column=889?>Programme have now started a job. The Work Programme is helping people
who would otherwise have been consigned to the unemployment
scrapheap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000189">There
has been a significant and very welcome improvement from the providers.
About half of the contract holders are now getting more jobseekers into
lasting work than the level to which they were contracted by the
Government. Last year not a single one managed that. We also know that,
unlike the short-term job focus of previous schemes, which left many
people on benefits after they had been completed, most people now stay
in work well beyond three or six
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000190">The
evidence of that improvement is clear. Figures this morning show that
contractors are measured on how many participants they get into work
each year, as a proportion of people who are referred to the scheme in
that 12 months. As I just said, in year one of the scheme, not a single
provider met its contractor level of getting 5.5% into work for that
period. However, in the second year providers got an average of
31.9% of jobseeker’s allowance claimants below the
age of 25 into sustained work. They were contracted to get
33%, so it is very close. For jobseekers aged 25 and over, the
providers got an average of 27.3% into sustained work, against their
contracted level of 27.5%—almost exactly bang on
target.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000191">More
people are getting into work within a year of joining the Work
Programme. The UK Statistics Authority has said that it was wrong to
claim that only 3.5% of people got into work in the first year of the
scheme. It says that the performance is best measured by counting how
many people got into sustained work in their first year on the scheme.
While on this measure just 8.5% of those who started the programme in
June 2011 completed at least six months of work in their first year,
this success rate dramatically increased to 13.4% for the more recent
recruits who joined in March 2013.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000192">This is a clear and
demonstrable improvement. If you join the Work Programme now, you are
more likely to get a lasting job. Of course, the Work Programme is also
designed to give taxpayers a good deal. Providers are paid when they
get jobseekers into work, rather than getting most money up front,
regardless of success. Significantly, more people being helped by the
Work Programme are moving off benefits and into work, and providers are
keeping them in sustained employment. Most claimants have been on
benefits continuously for nine or 12 months before even joining the
Work Programme. Now providers are either exceeding or hitting the level
set out in their contract for getting jobseekers into long-term work
after substantial improvements in performance.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000193">Last time it was too
early to say whether the programme was working. Today’s figures
reinforce the point that we now know where we stand. Unfortunately, the
figures also reveal some weaker parts of our agenda, mainly related to
the people who move into the Work Programme from employment and support
allowance. The numbers of ESA claimants moving off benefit and gaining
a job are lower than I would have hoped. Previous attempts to help
these claimants into work were not successful. We still have a lot to
learn about what works for ESA claimants. We have to work with 
<?notus-xml column=890?>those providers to improve performance for this group and build
expertise in supporting those who are hard to
help.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000194">There
is a ladder of helping people back into work. The rungs may be very
short, and it may take a long time to get to the top of the ladder and
into employment. First, people may have to be encouraged into
self-belief. They have to have confidence in themselves and know their
self-worth. We have to learn from those who have experience and
expertise in that area. The term that is used for this in the Work
Programme is the “black box”. I always thought this was
rather a strange term to use when talking about a work programme. It
gives me the impression that when you open the lid there is darkness
inside and you do not know what is there.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000195">What it really
means—and the purpose of the black box approach—is that
it allows providers helping people back into work to use whatever
approaches they find work for those groups of claimants: localised
results helping people individually. I hope that the Minister will tell
us in his summing-up what approaches have been the best. Which are the
ones we have to learn from, because these particular groups on
employment support allowance are the most difficult to help? It is
important that we learn lessons from the best providers and learn them
rapidly.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062765000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000196">The
other area that is still of concern is youth unemployment. It is good
to note that it has fallen, but it is still far too high. I know that
we have to use the international comparators, which include all
full-time equivalent students, so full-time students are included in
the figures. However, if they are stripped out of the figures there are
still 659,000 unemployed people in that youth category. I know that
this is down 13,000 over the last quarter, but it is still a great
problem because it has a scarring effect on young people. It is a
distinctive scarring effect, because it is caused solely by the single
experience of being unemployed. This brings a loss of personal esteem
and of earning potential and can persist for decades. Youth
unemployment, of course, can also lead to an increased crime
rate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000197">This is
not a new phenomenon. Over the years from 1993 to 2011, the figures
show a substantial growth in the unemployment rate for 18 to 20
year-olds. Crucially, the bar of five GCSEs or more shows the level at
which young people can escape from youth unemployment in a large way.
One of the crucial things we have to do is ensure that people reach
that standard of skills. That is why the apprenticeship programmes are
also crucial to building up those skill levels. That five GCSE bar, the
bar between level 1 and level 2, is the one that distinguishes between
those who gain employment and those who do
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000198">There was

Sharp of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, I join others in thanking my
noble friend Lady Brinton for introducing this timely debate. The
subject is the importance of sustainable jobs to the Exchequer and the
British economy, and there is a certain truism in that statement.
Obviously the more jobs that we can create, the more tax revenues there
are for the Exchequer, and the less it has to pay out in welfare
payments—so it is very good for the Exchequer—and the
more jobs that we can create the more we add to GDP and therefore to
measurable growth, which is the yardstick by which we currently measure
success in the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000200">What
do I mean by sustainable jobs? There is in fact considerable churn
among the unemployed. Some 70% of those who register as unemployed find
jobs within six months. However, there are differentials between
different quintiles of income distribution. Of the lowest-earning
quintile, the bottom 20%, 30% of those who were unemployed had spent
less than a year in their current job. This compares to only 7% of
workers in the top quintile spending less than a year in their job. Of
those in the bottom quintile, 24% were in temporary, not permanent,
jobs. One-third of those claiming jobseeker’s allowance claim
benefits again within eight months of starting work; 8% of them work
less than 16 hours a
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000201">The good
news that we heard from my noble friend Lord German about the way in
which the Work Programme is becoming effective perhaps makes one a
little more optimistic about what Jobcentre Plus can achieve. However,
to some extent its role is to place people in jobs, with the emphasis
on getting them off welfare and into work, and perhaps too many of the
jobs are short-term and non-sustainable. This is disproportionately the
case for the bottom 20%, many of whom have very low or no
qualifications, a point again picked up by my noble friend Lord
German<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:49:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000202">The
group I am particularly worried about comprises young people in the 18
to 24 age bracket who now find it extremely difficult to find jobs. As
my noble friend Lord German mentioned, the group that experienced
unemployment in the 1980s and the 1990s is now referred to as the lost
generation, as the unemployment had knock-on effects on their
self-confidence and their ability to hold down jobs. Many of them have
experienced substantial periods of unemployment since then. It is
noticeable that in this recession there has been relatively less
unemployment. Nevertheless, 12% of the 22 to 24 age group who make a
new claim to Jobcentre Plus have spent at least half of the past four
years on benefit, so while there is good news here we also have to
address problems, such as the paradox raised by my noble friend Lady
Brinton in introducing the debate, of there being very high levels of
skills shortages in some industries. Currently, 16% of vacancies exist
because employers cannot find people with the critical skills. As I
think she mentioned, this applies particularly to intermediate skill
levels—the three-year apprenticeships for craftsmen and the two
years on top of the three-year apprenticeships to gain the equivalent
of higher national diplomas or foundation degrees. We are particularly
short of people qualified at technician
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:52:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=892?><hs_para UID="13062765000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000203">As my noble friend Lord
German mentioned, although there is no relationship between youth
unemployment and immigration, it is certainly true that many employers
are importing people with these skills because we are not growing them
ourselves. As I say, a somewhat difficult paradox exists at the moment,
as we know we have these crucial skills shortages, which are limiting
the degree to which some of our new industries can grow, yet we do not
have the skilled people to fill the vacancies that need to be filled.
We are failing to train our own people to fill these
vacancies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>, so
the apprenticeship programme is very important and is a great success
story, and we are beginning to see some of these vacancies being filled
due to that programme. However, that takes time. To train somebody to
HND level can take five years. We are beginning to see this progression
within the apprenticeship programme, but it is a slow
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000204">As
I say, the fact that 1.2 million young people now have apprenticeships
is good news. However, those apprenticeships are still
disproportionately at level 2: that is, one or two-year apprenticeships
whereby participants qualify immediately as plumbers, electricians,
retail workers or workers in hospitality or care services. The level 2
qualification is now the minimum qualification that is required. We are
seeing more young people going on from a level 2 qualification to gain
a level 3 qualification, which is the craftsman qualification, but
sadly not nearly enough are doing so. Of the 1.2 million,
only about 300,000 are going on to the higher-level qualification. We
need to see many more of them proceed to the level 3 qualification.
Indeed, the Government have made it known that they would like to see
most apprentices move on to a level 3
qualification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:54:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000205">The
other problem that has arisen is that these apprenticeships have been
taken up disproportionately by 19 to 25 year-olds, and indeed by those
in the 25-plus group, as opposed to 16 to 18 year-olds. In many senses
this is very good and reflects the fact that employers want to take on
as apprentices those who have some experience of work and who they can
rely on to get to work on time. Nevertheless, it creates something of a
problem for the 16 to 18 year-olds. For that reason, the Government
have created the trainee programme, which is a pre-apprenticeship
training programme. Yesterday, we had the good news that this
pre-apprenticeship training programme is now being extended to the
over-19s. It had been concentrated on 16 to 18 year-olds, but its
extension is good news. However, it is very important that we get more
of these younger people into apprenticeships that not only provide them
with very satisfactory training programmes but help them to get
satisfactory, sustainable jobs over the longer
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:56:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000206">This
raises three questions that I would like to put to the Minister. Are we
doing enough to make sure that these young people know about the
opportunities that are available in the apprenticeship field? Raising
the participation age in schools means that next year those aged 17
will stay on in education or training. Training is very important, but
many of them, perhaps too many of them, may be told by their schools
that the choice is for them to stay on at school in the sixth form and
take subjects that may or may not include some form of vocational
training, rather than being 
<?notus-xml column=893?>told about alternatives such as apprenticeships or other more practical
vocational college courses. We need to look to the schools careers
service, but that is experiencing real problems. Indeed, it has
collapsed to a considerable extent. Does the Minister feel that the
careers service is sufficiently engaged in schools, particularly in
advising young people aged 13 to 14 to know what opportunities are
available, as they face crucial choices at that
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:57:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000207">Secondly,
is Jobcentre Plus geared too much towards finding short-term jobs
rather than helping young people into training to enable them to get
sustainable jobs? I, too, was present at the APPG meeting at which two
principals from FE colleges gave evidence that indicated that a number
of young people were taken off college courses by Jobcentre Plus in
order to fill short-term job vacancies. Rather than thinking
holistically about what was necessary to train the young people, they
were pushed into short-term jobs that were jobs not careers, if you
like, and were not given the opportunity to develop a career. Should we
not learn rather more from the Scandinavians, who see unemployment as
an opportunity for people of all ages to upgrade their skills and move
into higher levels of employment within their
range<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T12:58:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000208">Finally,
it is entirely in this country’s interests to minimise
unemployment and maximise job creation, but in doing so it is also
vital to upgrade the skills profile of the population. We have
succeeded in encouraging a lot of young people to go on to university,
but far too many still leave school with no, or low, qualifications.
They are the ones who find it difficult to find jobs. I suggest that
for these young people unemployment should be seized upon as an
opportunity to undertake training to gain a career and a sustainable
job and should not be seen just as time out before being pushed into
another short-term
job.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/7036B86E263657D7D601348CF8139DBFA251C47F" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

to use this opportunity to highlight the potential contribution that
co-operatives and other social enterprises have to offer to sustainable
job creation. In delivering the spending review yesterday, the
Chancellor talked about the need for growth, reform and fairness. The
growing social enterprise sector meets all three of these criteria,
providing a business model that delivers sustainable economic growth
while fostering innovation and social
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000212">Damage
to the reputation of the important parts of the UK economy in the wake
of the financial crisis and concern about the social impacts of the
recession and public spending cuts have brought social enterprise 
<?notus-xml column=894?>to the fore. People want a different way of doing business that is about
creating shared value, not just profit—where the motivation is
more than just making money, where the proceeds are reinvested locally
for the benefit of the whole community and where employees and
customers are actively engaged in decisions that directly affect
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000213">Here are
a few statistics that demonstrate the potential of this sector,
courtesy of Social Enterprise UK. At present there are around 70,000
social enterprises in the UK, contributing at least £24 billion
to the economy and employing more than 800,000 people. Social
enterprises are twice as likely to have grown in the past year as other
small and medium-sized businesses, and 82% of social enterprises
reinvest their profits in the communities where they operate. Social
enterprises create more jobs relative to turnover than mainstream
businesses, and 39% of all social enterprises operate in the 20% most
deprived communities in the United Kingdom, helping to create jobs
where they are most needed.</hs_para>

is a dynamic and fast-growing sector with the ability to create and
sustain employment. One in seven social enterprises is less than two
years old, more than three times the start-up rate for small businesses
generally. At the same time there is a core of older, well-established
social enterprises. Nearly half of all social enterprises have been
trading for more than 10

created in this sector are sustainable in other ways, too. Research
shows that employee engagement correlates with increased productivity
and performance. Engaged employees are much less likely to leave their
organisation and are more likely to report high levels of job
satisfaction. For a voluntary sector organisation, income from social
enterprises can provide a more reliable source of income than external
grants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000216">Enough
of the statistics. Now for two examples that I hope will show why I
believe that social enterprises have so much to offer. The first is an
initiative set up by Portsmouth’s Anglican cathedral to support
entrepreneurs and business start-ups. The Cathedral Innovation Centre
provides entrepreneurs with office space, start-up loans and mentors,
helping to create jobs at the same time as providing a new purpose for
underused buildings. There are already nine businesses at the
Portsmouth Cathedral Innovation Centre, including a computer games
firm, a catering company and a business that redevelops old land for
wider civic use. Together they occupy 14 desks and are currently
recruiting three new apprentices with support from the centre. With
hardly any resources, they have levered in-kind support worth around
£500,000. The initiative is also being funded by local people
who are being asked to invest £75 or more as shareholders.
Discussions are already taking place to open similar centres in Derby,
Cheshire, East Anglia, Bournemouth and the north-east. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Berridge, who attended the official launch in May of
this year, said:</hs_para>

second example is Worth Unlimited, a Christian charity based in
Birmingham, which has established a family of social enterprises

social exclusion. One of these social enterprises is the DevenishGirl
Bakery, which produces a range of home-baked cakes using locally
sourced, organic and fair trade ingredients, as well as vintage tea
parties and picnic hampers. Young unemployed people are given
accredited training in how to run a small business, as well as
practical cookery and personal development skills. The six-month

work with into sustainable employment, whether through job creation
within the organisation or other opportunities outside the

he has said. He was absolutely correct to concentrate on the
contribution that social enterprises can make to our economy. I can say
that as a non-remunerated, non-executive director of the Wise Group in
Glasgow, which is a social enterprise that has been involved in
employability for the past 30 years. It adds value to the
provision of support for unemployed people in a way that I think other
more statutory government bodies struggle to do. I am very pleased to

debate. I add my congratulations to those already offered to my noble
friend on securing the time. I want to take a slightly different
approach to the debate and I want to start by making a political point.
I hope I can carry the House with me on this but I am very concerned
about the potential stigmatisation of the unemployed. In my experience,
which is mainly derived from my work in the Wise Group, people in
households that suffer worklessness are strivers as much as anyone else
and they try to better themselves and their families.</hs_para>

course, I have been in politics long enough to know that a game is
played but I do not say that pejoratively. I know that there are points
to be scored in the public debate in trading positions and policies as
part of the coming and going of politics, but I am worried. I have been
concerned about this policy area for some time and I have never known
the psychological effect to be so bad on people who suffer
unemployment. My plea to my noble friend on the Front Bench—this
is certainly not directed at him personally, as he knows—is that
he will take the message back from me, if from no one else, that we
need to be careful about our use of language.</hs_para>

want to talk about is the environment of unemployment and
welfare-to-work, which has substantially changed, certainly since I was

<?notus-xml column=896?>initially elected to the House of Commons in 1983, and whose development
I have been following during that time. It is now harder to make work
pay. Colleagues are probably now familiar with the substantial change
that is encapsulated by the fact that the majority of poor, working-age
adults and children in the United Kingdom now live in families
containing at least one worker. That is a hard prospect for
policymakers and none of this is easy. The adage that we all used to
hide behind, because it was true 10 or 15 years ago, that you could
work your way off benefits and out of poverty is not necessarily true
at all. We therefore need to weigh that in the balance when we make
changes.</hs_para>

environment that we are now in is characterised by no guarantees of
secure work in contracts of employment. The labour market that we now
face has a problem about low wages, temporary jobs and zero-hours
contracts, which used to be peculiar employment devices used in proper
circumstances and for understandable reasons in industries such as
hotels, catering and entertainment. These contracts are now being used
much more widely, including in education and health. If we do not
recognise that, we are not properly doing our job as policymakers. It
has also been suggested to me that a massive 20 million hours a month
of underemployment persists in the United Kingdom labour market. That
is completely new and none of us has properly started to address it in
a way that is
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:12:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point about the context because I have noticed from working with a
client group in Glasgow that the level of uncertainty about being in
work has changed significantly. Even if you can get people off
benefits—and you can if you give them proper support—they
go into a world of work that is full of uncertainty. It has one of the
most destabilising effects on households because you never know just
how long it will be before you are going to have to switch back to
benefits, low-hours contracts or low-pay contracts. I accept that
universal credit will help, at least in theory, if we can introduce it
safely and as soon as possible. However, we need to do more to address
uncertainty in the workplace, which is a serious

what my noble friend Lord German said about the Work Programme, of
which I have some experience. I am interested to hear that the figures
for the second year of the programme are now available. I should be
grateful if my noble friend, if he has the figures, could differentiate
between the minimum performance levels that are in the contracts for
the prime providers—levels that I have always thought were
unrealistically high; and the DWP was not sensible in setting them at
these levels. As far as I can recall, the JSA 25-plus minimum
performance level for providers was 27.5% of the referred group, the
JSA 18-24 cohort figure was 33%, and the ESA caseload was 16.5%. These
are not targets. DWP expectations were much higher. I have not had the
benefit of access to the latest figures and I look forward to studying
them as soon as the debate concludes because I am interested, but I
should be reassured if my noble friend could confirm that if the
minimum performance levels are not reached by prime providers their
contracts will be re-examined. That was the promise made: if they did
not reach these 
<?notus-xml column=897?>levels in year two, the contracts would be at risk, and rightly so
because the figures for the first year were de minimis. That was
perhaps understandable in year one but we would be looking for serious
progress in year two. I am not satisfied that we are looking at only
minimum performance requirements. We should look at the DWP expectation
levels for these client groups in order to test whether we are making
progress in the Work

the DWP to offer people who have done their two years on the Work
Programme and have still not found work to the Troubled Families

cheese. The Work Programme people are there because they are required
under the jobseekers commitment to be there. The Troubled Families
initiative, which I support and was pleased when it was given extra
money from the Government in the past few days, is a voluntary
programme. In my experience, you cannot put conscripted people into a
programme that was originally designed for volunteer clients and have
any expectation that it will succeed. That idea needs to be

£248 million underspend on the Work Programme—I think we
can all understand that an underspend might be a consequence of not
having as many people on the unemployment lists as we had anticipated
in the first year—can my noble friend confirm that the full
amount for the programme will be spent supporting moving people from
benefits into work? It is a flagship, essential and crucial programme,
and I wish it well. I support it but I have some serious concerns about
how it is being implemented. In fact, it may well be that we should
talk to colleagues on local authorities about increasing their
involvement in delivering and implementing some of these national

briefly to raise two other matters before I sit down. First, can we
work more with employers? It is absolutely right that we concentrate on
supply-side measures, upskilling people, and helping people who are
furthest from the market. There remains a problem of “parking
and creaming” in some of the schemes and I understand that we
will need to address that issue. However, can we get alongside
employers more systematically? They need help as well if they are
offering contracts of employment to people who have sometimes been out
of the labour market for more than two years. That would be a
development that would help the Work Programme to improve and be more
successful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:18:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

three priorities, all of which have been touched on by colleagues in
their excellent speeches in this debate in which I am pleased to take
part. The three priorities for me include youth unemployment, which
affects just shy of 1 million young people. They in
particular suffer from the precariousness of
unemployment—and employment, even when they
get jobs. We really need a concerted cross-party approach to
youth unemployment. Also, nearly 36% of the caseload is made up of
people in long-term unemployment. It is a proxy for household distress,
which the Troubled Families programme is beginning to address. If
people are unemployed, have been through 
<?notus-xml column=898?>the Work Programme for a full two years and still cannot find their way
into the labour market, we should treat them more holistically. A
multiagency approach such as that provided in the Troubled Families
programme—it is a horrible name and I wish we had a different
one—is important. Finally, there is the hard-to-reach group, who
are the third category of clients whose chances we need to do more to
improve in the
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/F5342DDF9C5FE3D96187C59B750B0D0001F6F921" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

again apprenticeships—this route to jobs—are still not

In many parts of the country, certainly when I have had meetings with

I know that the Minister shares the view, as we have talked about it
before, that we must talk about apprenticeships and training, but I
make the plea that in training and for all who are concerned with it in
this country we give a very high priority to training for management.
Sometimes we do not attain the very best level of management, and we
are seeing this increasingly day by day in various spheres of activity.

Shipley:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Brinton
for initiating this important debate on sustainable jobs, in which the
word “sustainable” is of crucial importance. This is
about creating growth and long-term employment opportunities for
everyone who wants to
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000244">We
should note some helpful trends in the overall position on jobs in the
past year or so. There are almost 30 million people employed in the UK,
which is up by 432,000 from a year ago. Unemployment remains stubbornly
and worryingly high at 2.5 million. It is, however, down by 88,000 from
a year ago. More than a million jobs today are held by the over-65s.
Nearly 10% of those aged over 65 are now employed, which is the highest
level since records began in 1992. I welcome that. It is in part a sign
of the times and, no doubt, with the rise in the pension age that
figure will continue to
rise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000245">In
vacancies, there has been another helpful trend. In the latest quarter,
there were 518,000 job vacancies, up 48,000 year on year, which is the
highest number of vacancies since 2008. In March—the latest
figures we have—there were 24 million private sector jobs, up
46,000 from December 2012, and 5.7 million public sector jobs, down
22,000 from December 2012. We can see a reduction in public sector jobs
but an increase in private sector jobs, and we should note that,
despite the loss of public sector jobs, 1 million private sector jobs
have been created since 2010.</hs_para>

major disparities. The employment level in the south-east outside
London is 75% but in my home region, the north-east of England, it is
67%. There are some 458,000 people who have been unemployed for more
than two years. I agree with my noble friend Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope
about the stigmatisation of those who are unemployed through no fault
of their own. We need to be very careful about our use of language.
There are 458,000 people who have been unemployed for more than two
years, and we need to get that figure down. There are 401,000 people
aged 18 to 24 who are on jobseeker’s allowance. That figure is
down 63,000 since May 2012. There are 950,000 unemployed people aged 16
to 24. That figure is down 60,000 since the previous year, but it is
still worryingly high. The Government have recognised the geographical

addressed.</hs_para>

on growth. Skilled people are needed to do the jobs that drive growth,
and can drive exports and reduce imports. As we know, with more people
in employment, tax revenues will rise. I shall address the first of
those four statements on growth. I have no doubt that government
actions are helping. The funding mechanisms include: the regional
growth fund that my noble friend Lady Brinton referred to, and I
declare that I am deputy chair of its advisory panel; the single local
growth fund which was announced yesterday by the Chancellor; the
£500 million committed for superfast broadband in rural areas;
the Green Investment Bank; the business bank due next year; and, as
announced in the Budget, the reductions in national insurance to give
employers a £2,000 cash payment to make it easier for them to
take on staff.</hs_para>

success story on apprenticeships. This Government have created more
than 1 million apprenticeships. We want to double to 200,000 the number
of businesses that offer apprenticeships. There are 5 million
businesses in the UK, but only 100,000 offer apprenticeships. I feel
optimistic that the Government are doing a lot to deliver growth, but
one of the barriers is skills and vocational education. We need to
enhance the offer in vocational education to give people skills to do
jobs rather than, as we have done in the previous decade, encourage
very large numbers of people to go to university, at the end of which
they may not have the skills to undertake some of the jobs we need
done. For example, there is a critical shortage of engineers at senior
levels.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062765000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000249">I
shall make a point about gender: there is a shortage of women in
business. Just one in 10 engineers is a woman and just one
in 20 engineering apprentices is a woman. Something needs to be done
about encouraging girls at school and in education to become scientists
and engineers. When I read that in half of state secondary schools not
one girl is doing A-level physics, I become very concerned about the
career pathways that are being discussed with pupils.</hs_para>

why we have unemployment at the same time as we have skills shortages.
Employers in all parts of the country say the same thing: there are
serious difficulties in recruiting skilled staff in engineering,
processing and manufacturing. We have a large number of young people
who are unemployed—410,000 of them in receipt of JSA—but
at the some time we are being told by employers that there are many
jobs that they want to fill but they cannot find qualified people to

things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000251" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0001.htm#13062765000251">My
noble friend Lord Teverson talked about the language issue in imports
and exports. It is a major barrier for firms exporting from the UK.
Another problem has emerged in a recent survey undertaken by the
British Chambers of Commerce. It is the lack of knowledge about
regulation in other countries. That chamber of commerce survey showed
that 60% of chamber members say that they do not export. We need more
companies to export, and that means that UKTI, local enterprise
partnerships, British embassies and local authorities have to make it a
greater priority because exports drive growth. I am proud to live in
the one region of this country that has a positive balance of trade.
The north-east of England exports more than it imports. We should build
on the potential of that record.</hs_para>

have is that we import too much because our indigenous supply chain is
not strong enough. If we imported less by building up our own supply

have an industrial strategy in place, with a British supply chain as an
important element.</hs_para>

of long-term unemployed young people. Sustainable employment is part of
social inclusion. We have to make sure that everybody is able to take
part in the future growth of this country. That 
<?notus-xml column=902?>means that jobs need to be created, preferably though apprenticeships,
for everybody. It is an obligation not just on government but on the
private sector, the voluntary sector, the third sector and the public
sector. We all have to do everything we can to get everybody who wants
a job into one. There have been many schemes in recent years: the
Community Programme, Employment Action, the Community Action Programme,
the New Deal, Step Up, the Community Task Force and the Future Jobs
Fund. History suggests that it is difficult. There have been so many of
these schemes, but I was somewhat surprised to discover yesterday that
there are 33 different funds and schemes supporting young people in
England at a combined cost of more than £15 billion per year.
There are two ways of looking at 33 schemes. You can say that each one
has a specific aim and is doing a specific job, and that may well be
true, but it is also possible that it simply confuses the landscape so
that those who want to employ more people find it more difficult to do
so and young people find it difficult to engage because they do not
know where they should be engaging. We need to look at that very
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000254">I

economic downturn that followed the crash of 2008 has been the most
severe since the great depression and the most protracted since the
Industrial Revolution. However, a conventional wisdom about the crisis
has taken root, that although it is a growth crisis and a living
standards crisis, it is not an employment crisis. This excellent debate
has shown how misleading that conventional wisdom is. It is of course
true that the headline unemployment rate, although too high, has
remained remarkably stable over the past few years, despite a very poor
record on growth over that period. However, it would be complacent in
the extreme to point to the headline rate, or to the new private sector

<?notus-xml column=903?>jobs created, and think that that is the end of the story. The truth is
that we should be concerned not only by continuing patterns

will start with unemployment, and with youth unemployment in
particular. We may not have a crisis of the proportions of Spain or
Greece, but youth unemployment in Britain is now at an all-time high.
There are now just under 1 million 16 to 24 year-olds unemployed in our
country. This sits alongside a continuing rise in long-term
unemployment, as discussed by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley. The number
of people out of work for over a year is now at 900,000, three times
the figure of seven or eight years ago. Just under half of this group
have been out of work for two years, not just one. It is cold comfort

coalition’s response to this problem was to scrap
Labour’s Future Jobs Fund and introduce a new welfare to work
scheme, the Work Programme, discussed in detail by the noble Lord, Lord
German. Last year, this programme not only missed its targets, but
evidence showed its success rate in placing the long-term unemployed
was lower than the expected rate if there had been no programme at all.
Recent evidence suggests that it is doing better. However, I am afraid
that there is a big gap between doing better and doing well. More than
900,000 of the 1.2 million people who have gone through the doorway of

relation to youth and long-term unemployment is baffling and should
concern us all. We know that protracted spells out of work have
stigmatising effects, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, described so

mental health. They also rack up huge costs to the taxpayer. Therefore,
preventing worklessness must be a priority as much for people concerned

now turn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:43:12"></hs_TimeCode> from
the world of unemployment to the changing world of work. One of the
reasons that overall levels of unemployment have been lower than many
expected is that much of the burden of adjustment in this crisis has
been borne by those in work. For millions, pay, conditions and security
of employment have changed significantly for the worse in the past five
years. Let us take pay. Workers in Britain have experienced
unprecedented cuts in real terms pay of, on average, 6% since the
global financial crisis began. Over two-thirds of all workers have
experienced real wage cuts. One consequence of this has been the rise

composition of employment is also undergoing significant change, with a
marked shift away from longer term, more secure work to shorter term,
more precarious work. First, the number of jobs that are temporary
contract jobs has gone up by a staggering 76% since 2008. Secondly, we
are seeing a substitution away from full-time work. Since 2008 the
number of full-time jobs has fallen by more than half a million while
part-time employment has risen by well over a quarter of a million and
part-time self-employment—mostly among lower income
workers—has risen by the same figure. Thirdly, we have seen a
dramatic rise in the incidence of zero-hours contracts.
Official estimates are that more than 200,000 British
workers—predominantly younger and unskilled workers—are

First, the effects of long-term unemployment and insecure work are
becoming increasingly obvious wherever you look in Britain and they are
imposing significant costs on us. The Trussell Trust, a charity that
operates food banks in the UK, says that many of the 300,000 people
that it is helping are low-income working
families. The national helpline charity National Debtline says that
almost half of the 250,000 calls that it received in 2012 were from
people in work. The size of the UK’s payday 
<?notus-xml column=905?>lending industry has increased in size by about 150% since 2008. Paying
less in more insecure jobs is far from costless for all of

second reason that we should be concerned is that restoring strong wage
growth and building more secure jobs is sensible fiscal policy if we
are to relieve the ever-growing pressure on the social security system
to support low-income families. We must aim to shift some of the burden
of supporting lower income workers from the state to the private sector

third reason that we should be concerned is that it is hard to see how
Britain can compete internationally with an economy that is
increasingly characterised by lower-wage jobs in more and more

emerging African economies over the next 50 years if our model of
competition at home is one of a deregulatory race to the bottom. There
is no low-wage, low-skill, low-investment route to our country
succeeding in a world where labour costs are significantly cheaper and
skills are being built up significantly faster, as they are in many
developing and emerging economies. We will succeed only if we build a
higher road to economic success, not one built on insecurity in our
labour market or tolerance of entire cohorts of people in our country

can we do to bring about more sustainable employment? In the short

should reform the Work Programme so as to have better
integration with the employment and support allowance tests. Most
importantly of all, the Government should realise that they are not

alone. It means reforming our banking system and re-examining the rules
that generate short-termism in too many of our largest companies. As
the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, discussed, we need to address the
UK’s poor record on technical skills and ask how our
education system and our employers who do or do not offer
apprenticeships need to be challenged to turn this around. We should
use the power of government procurement to say that any

constantly about the need to rebalance our economy, but as this debate

<?notus-xml column=906?>is bad for our economy and it undermines our competitiveness. If we
really want to break from this, we have to abandon an approach to
economic management that sees wealth creation as the preserve of the
wealthiest and which mistakenly seeks to succeed by giving lower taxes
to the best off and less protection to the vast majority of workers.

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Brinton and
all noble Lords who have spoken in this extremely interesting debate.
The Government remain committed to creating the right conditions for
the private sector to grow and to create jobs. Despite the challenging
economic context, employment has been increasing robustly and today it
stands at record levels. While employment in the UK is higher than it
was before the recession, it remains below its pre-recession level in
the US, Japan and all the major European countries except Germany. Over
2012, UK employment growth was the strongest of all the G7 economies,
and the Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast employment to
continue rising, to reach 30.5 million by 2017. The performance of the
UK labour market has also been strong compared with previous downturns.
At this point after the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s, employment
was still around four percentage points below its pre-recession
peak.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000275">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:52:12"></hs_TimeCode>
of the increase in employment that we have seen since 2008 has come
from an increase in part-time working and self-employment. While these
increases have been part of a longer-term trend, the last few years
have also seen an increase in those who are working part-time, but
would like a full-time job. The shift in the composition of employment
during this downturn has been a testament to the flexibility of the
labour market. This is something we have not seen to the same extent in
previous recessions. While it means that some may be working fewer
hours than they would wish, they are employed, keeping unemployment
lower than it otherwise would have been and meaning that, as growth
strengthens, we will be in a better place to benefit from the recovery.
Over the past year alone, over 80% of the increase in employment has
come from full-time
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000276">Policies
announced by the Government have increased the incentives for people on
benefits to enter paid work. Participation in the labour market is now
around its highest rate for 20 years and is in stark contrast to
previous recessions when vast swathes became discouraged and gave up
looking for work. From our experience in previous downturns, we have
learnt the potential lasting costs of detachment from the labour
market, a point that a number of noble Lords made clear, so we are
encouraged by the flexibility and resilience of the labour market over
the past five years. This flexibility has also been demonstrated as a
result of relatively low earnings growth, which has supported the
strength we have seen in employment. While earnings growth has not been
keeping pace with inflation because of the strength in employment,
household income has risen by 2.1% more than consumer prices over the
past year, and that is not least because of the increase in the income
tax threshold. With less flexibility and higher 
<?notus-xml column=907?>wages, employment would be lower and unemployment would be higher, and
this would be a less fair way of making the necessary adjustment after
the
crisis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000277">When
this Government announced the difficult decisions we had had to take to
reduce the budget deficit and reduce employment in the public sector,
we were told that the private sector would never replace the public
sector jobs being lost. But, instead, private sector job creation has
offset public sector job losses more than three times over.
Nevertheless, as many noble Lords have pointed out, unemployment still
remains too high, particularly youth unemployment. We are not
complacent, but have introduced several policies to support those out
of work back into employment, alongside the £3 billion a year
the Government spend on employment support to job seekers through
Jobcentre Plus.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000278">This Government
recognise that young people may be more vulnerable when the labour
market is tough, and so last year we launched the £1 billion
youth contract. This support brings together a menu of options to help
young people build the experience and skills that they need to compete
in the job market. These options range from getting young people into
the jobcentre on a weekly rather than fortnightly basis to help focus
their job search, to funding more work experience and sector-based work
academy places so that we have at least 100,000 of these places to
offer our young people, and offering 160,000 wage incentives worth up
to £2,275 to an employer who recruits an 18 to 24 year-old who
has been unemployed for at least six months. For an employer, this wage
incentive covers four and a half times the national insurance
contributions cost of taking on a young person. The point of this, and
of the youth contract more widely, is to help provide young jobseekers
with sustained job outcomes and to help them build their longer-term
employment prospects.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000279">We know that long-term
unemployment can have potentially damaging effects on a person’s
longer-term employment prospects. While 90% of those claiming
jobseeker’s allowance move off benefit within the first 12
months of their claim, there is still 10% who do not. To help combat
the cycle of worklessness and despondency that long-term unemployment
can bring, the Government launched the Work Programme in 2011, the
purpose of which is to provide personalised support to an expected 3.3
million long-term and vulnerable jobseekers over the next five years.
The premise of this support is simple. We have given providers the
freedom to design interventions that are better tailored to individual
and local needs. The incentive is strong: to providers we say,
“If you do not get these people into work and stay in work, you
do not get paid”. Moreover, the concept is innovative. For the
first time, providers will be paid partly out of the benefit savings
that they help to realise by getting these people into sustained
employment. This is the biggest individual payment-by-results programme
ever attempted in the United Kingdom.</hs_para>

Kirkwood observed and as we recognise, people coming out of the Work
Programme who have still not found sustained employment are the hardest
to help and many in this group face significant and multiple barriers
to work. Building on the expert training and support that the 
<?notus-xml column=908?>Work Programme will have delivered, all claimants will receive flexible
support tailored to their individual needs and underpinned by a core
regime of face-to-face meetings. Those who do not take the necessary
steps to prepare for work face a tough sanctions regime. These
programmes replace much of the complex range of employment support that
was previously on offer, such as the New Deal, employment zones and the
Future Jobs Fund. Those programmes were overly prescriptive, failed to
achieve enough sustained job outcomes, and did not deliver good value
for money for the
taxpayer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

German and Lord Kirkwood discussed the effectiveness of the Work
Programme. As my noble friend Lord German pointed out, the figures
released today show that since March this year, the number of people
who have found lasting work through the programme has increased to
132,000. I am not saying that that is enough, but it is a very
significant increase from the position in the previous year. My noble
friend also pointed out that the outcomes in terms of ESA recipients
were significantly below those we had expected. That is undoubtedly the
case, but this is by common consent the most difficult group to deal
with. We have a double problem here in that it is not just about
getting recipients ready for work, but persuading employers to consider
them as potential employees, particularly in an environment where many
people are looking for a job. Lastly, my noble friend asked what we
could learn from the black-box approach. As I said, we are allowing
providers to innovate and test new methods. We are asking them to share
best practice and we are doing our best to facilitate it so that when
we can see that something is working, we can replicate
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:59:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Kirkwood, asked what happens if providers do not reach their targets.
We are taking decisive action with those who are not delivering the
standards we expect. We have issued performance improvement notices on
12 contracts that we deem are not delivering the Work Programme to the
agreed standards and we are also introducing the concept of
market-share shift which means that we will be increasing the
proportion of claimants we refer to those providers who have
outperformed their competitors by reducing the number of claimants we
send to the lower-performing providers. We will be implementing this
programme in at least 16 instances from August.</hs_para>

Kirkwood, also asked what happened to the underspend. Any underspend in
the Work Programme will be subject to the usual budget exchange rules
which means that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has the discretion
to allow a proportion of a department’s budget to move across to
the following financial year. I direct the noble Lord to my right
honourable friend Danny Alexander because he is the man who can deal
with that
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000284" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000284">The
noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, very astutely started with export, an
area where we have seen and will see many new jobs. She talked about
the need to build up the work that UKTI is doing. We are doing that.
More resources are going into UKTI, as we announced in the Autumn
Statement. We are redirecting people working for UKTI to the
higher-growth markets 
<?notus-xml column=909?>and we are already beginning to see some improvement in that area. The
British Chambers of Commerce survey of members which came out earlier
this week showed that the proportion of their members who were
exporting had increased over the year from 32% to, I think, 39%. That
is a sample but over a year it is a significant shift. However, there
are major barriers to exporting and one of the chilling figures in that
survey was that 70% of BCC members who export do not have a single
member of staff with the relevant language skills to undertake
business. So language training, among many other things, is very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000285" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000285">The
noble Baroness raised the point that if we are going to get small
businesses taking on more staff, we are going to need greater bank
lending. This, as she knows, has been a huge source of frustration to
the Government. We have introduced the Funding for Lending scheme with
the express purpose of incentivising banks to lend to SMEs and in the
last Budget we increased that incentive by introducing a 10:1 ratio in
terms of the amount that banks can draw down under Funding for Lending
for every pound they lend to SMEs. There is a bit of evidence that that
is beginning to work. Much more encouraging is the growth of new,
admittedly smaller, challenger banking institutions which are lending
to SMEs. We have discussed in this House before the success of
Handelsbanken and Aldermore. Cambridge &amp; Counties is a very
interesting new institution which has been set up by Trinity Hall and
the Cambridgeshire County Council pension fund specifically to lend to
SMEs in the east Midlands. It is new but it has grown at a rapid rate
which gives the lie to the argument that there is no demand from SMEs
for borrowing. The more these challengers grow, the quicker we will see
a more positive response from the larger lenders who, in fairness, are
trying to do
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000286" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000286">The
noble Baroness talked about the importance of literacy and
numeracy, not least in respect of apprenticeships. From next year all
apprentices who begin an intermediate apprenticeship with level 1 in
English or maths will have to take up study of level 2 in those
subjects, and apprentices who begin their apprenticeship without level
1 in English or maths will be offered the chance, but not be obliged,
to study at level 2. They will still be required to achieve level 1 in
English and maths as part of their intermediate apprenticeship, so we
are doing something about that. I will not repeat the extent to which
apprenticeships have increased in numbers and the extent to which they
are popular. I was very struck by the point the noble Baroness made
about Jobcentre Plus pulling young people off college courses to go for
job interviews so that they then lost their place. This seems
short-sighted and I will certainly raise that with ministerial
colleagues because that is not what we are seeking to
achieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000287" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000287">The

Teverson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:05:18"></hs_TimeCode>, talked

that we will be making an additional £800 million available to
the Green Investment Bank which is doing very well and is proving
popular. We are already seeing a growth in employment in that sector

to be able to help pilot through Parliament the Public Services (Social
Value) Act, which makes it easier for public sector bodies to take on
co-operatives and social enterprises, and I hope very much that it has
the effect that we wish. The most telling figure the right reverend
Prelate gave was that 39% of social enterprises operate in the top 20%
most deprived wards. I urge him and his fellow prelates and the church
as a whole to build on the Portsmouth model. I cannot help saying that
if the church spent more time doing that and less time worrying about

society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000290">With

agree with him. It is a very large and undervalued industry in respect
of jobs. The visa issue has been widely discussed and we hope that we
will move further in a sensible direction on that. I agree with almost
everything that the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said, and I certainly
agree that doubt about EU membership generates problems in terms of
international employers thinking about the long-term sustainability of

finish by touching on the issues raised by the extremely thoughtful
speeches by the noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Wood, which were on
the same theme. It is now a well established, if not hugely
long-standing, trend that there is a decreasing proportion of jobs as
we know them in the labour force as a whole. Instead we are seeing jobs
with no guarantees, temporary or zero-hours contracts and low wages,
even for people in work. The noble Lord’s suggestion that we
discuss this on a cross-party basis is extremely sensible because of
long-term development. This situation may have been hastened somewhat
by the recession but it was not caused by it. It predated it and it
will undoubtedly carry on. There are so many examples of very
successful companies operating like this. Amazon is a good example as
one of its major distribution centres pays a penny more per hour than
the minimum wage. There is very little job security. However, it is
seen by the outside world as an immensely successful company and a
company of the future and the fact that it is doing that kind of thing
is rather
depressing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000292">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:10:14"></hs_TimeCode>

Loomba:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a privilege to stand here today
and see so many of my colleagues keen to contribute to this debate.
However, when I look around me day to day, I am more struck by who is
not here. In our lifetimes, we have seen such radical change to the
opportunities open to women and to their legal status in the UK that it
can be tempting to rest on our laurels and feel that we can lecture
other countries about removing obstacles to women’s
participation in public
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000299">However,
the figures tell a very different story—422 women
missing from our own Parliament. Where are the women who ought to be
here contributing their expertise and their scrutiny? World wide, 80%
of politicians are men—even now, when women’s
representation is at a record high. With some exceptions—the
right reverend Prelates will understand what I mean—politics is
open to women in this country. However, like a shop that is open for
business but forgets to turn on the light and flip over the
“Closed” sign on the door, it is not doing very
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000300">The
title of this debate speaks of the challenges facing women. It is time
that we, as a Parliament, challenged ourselves to develop a zero
tolerance to sexist attitudes and comments, to promote and encourage
women, and to show the country and the international community that
women’s voices must be heard. Achieving this may involve asking
tough questions about how we challenge entrenched attitudes. The
Hansard Society issued a report last year that
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062765000540" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000540">“Without
special measures across all parties there will always be a risk of
constant ‘boom and bust’ in women’s
representation. But a backlash against positive action is now rife in
all the parties. There remains a stubborn insistence that selection has
to be ‘on merit’ as if no mediocre men had ever been
selected in the
past”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13062765000520" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000520">The
three main parties are committed to bringing more women into politics
but we often hear the excuse that women are just not interested in
participating. Why would that be? Reports of sexual harassment,
patronising attitudes—for example, a female Member being told
to, “Calm down, dear” by our own Prime
Minister—and intense media scrutiny of parliamentarians from
their hair to their shoes, are all looked on as separate issues to the
underrepresentation of women in
politics.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062765000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000301">Too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:03:24"></hs_TimeCode>
often the emphasis is put in the wrong place. A recent report noted
that events aimed at improving the prospects of women within my own
party were almost all aimed at the women themselves. I have attended
more events than I can count that attempt to solve the problem of
underrepresentation of ethnic minorities. The solution cannot be looked
for only among those who suffer from the problem; you have to look at
those who are causing it or choose to ignore it. Asking women and those
from ethnic minorities to solve the problems caused by sexism and
racism is like trying to help someone trapped under a car by suggesting
that they lift it off
themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000302" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000302">It
is not just the political world that should be asking itself where the
women are. No one wants to see future generations miss out on a cure
for cancer, a new source of clean energy or an inspirational advocate
for peace because these solutions are germinating in the mind of a girl
who will never have the chance to fulfil her potential. The millennium
development goals 
<?notus-xml column=913?>have been a powerful means of pressurising countries into ensuring
better access to education, and the charity ActionAid reports that
there is now parity in girls’ enrolment in primary schools.
However, we still have a long road to travel before we can get to the
stage where every female child can hope to contribute on an equal level
with her
brothers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000303" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000303">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:03:24"></hs_TimeCode>
Liberia, for example, the success of bringing girls into education is
marred by barriers that are not accounted for in the current MDGs.
Violence at school and while travelling to and from home, child
marriage and the pressure to help with domestic work all mean that
girls across the developing world are still far less likely than boys
to complete their education and gain qualifications. I am sure that no
one will need reminding of the example of Malala Yousafzai, one of a
huge number of children targeted with violence for the crime of going
to school while female. A girl growing up in South Africa is still more
likely to be raped than to learn to read. Perhaps it is not surprising
that even today twice as many women as men are
illiterate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000304">This
is why it is so crucial that the next series of MDGs looks at the
obstacles to equality far more comprehensively. It is encouraging that
the 12 goals proposed by the high-level panel include a stand-alone
goal to empower girls and women and achieve gender equality. This
reflects the priorities of DfID and the inspiring work done by my noble
friend Lady Northover. This specific and wide-ranging goal must be
protected. The advantage it creates will stimulate Governments to look
at the whole experience of women and girls, and open up funding streams
to projects where women are leading the way in creating societies that
are more
equal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000305">This on
its own is not enough. It is vital that we retain the current
commitment to integrate gender equality into all the goals. Considering
the experiences of women and girls cannot be an optional extra when
trying to reach targets that include ending poverty and
creating sustainable livelihoods. Some 70% of the
world’s poor are women. Ending poverty without tackling the
inequalities that make it difficult for women to study, gain properly
paid employment, own and inherit property and retain access to their
earnings is
impossible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000306">I
declare my interest. My own organisation, the Loomba Foundation, is
funding UN women in Guatemala, Malawi and India to end violence against
widows and support them socially, economically and politically. Too
often, certain practices are glossed over under the guise of cultural
sensitivity. Culture is not set in stone, and it should never trump
basic human rights. When I started out in business in the early 1960s,
it was the culture in the UK to pay women less than men for doing the
same work. Legislation that came into force in 1975, alongside societal
changes, makes that completely unacceptable, even unimaginable, for
young people entering the workforce
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000307">When
one race restricts the economic and social opportunities of another, we
call it apartheid. When, in some countries, men do the same to women,
we call it culture. Ending poverty means agreeing, as a global
community, to eradicate cultural attitudes and practices that restrict
women’s rights. We cannot hope to reach 
<?notus-xml column=914?>the goal of ensuring healthy lives without taking into account the
unique impact of inequality and gender-based violence towards women and

last week the World Health Organisation reported that more than a third
of women worldwide have experienced physical or sexual violence. The
same report puts the proportion of female murder victims who died at
the hands of a husband or partner at 38%—a “conservative

41.2%, high-income countries, including England, were above the global
average, demonstrating that so-called developed countries still too
often let down women by failing to protect them from
violence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000309">Ensuring

recent years, FGM has become a topic of mainstream political debate,
and is the subject of Lynne Featherstone’s current campaign.
Opening up discussion and raising awareness of research about the
mental and physical risks of such practices is a key to bringing about
the legal and cultural changes that will end them. It is crucial to
remember that women in developing countries do not need or want Britain
or other rich nations to be a knight in shining armour. Every country
has determined women and men who see injustice and want social and
political change. The campaign against FGM would never have happened
without leadership from brave women taking a stand against cutting in

explores the similarities and differences of women’s

fascinating, strong and extraordinarily original women are, but also
that their voice and perspectives are too often missing from public
discourse, including in this country. I welcome the What I See project,
and all other efforts like it, that give women an opportunity to
express themselves without bias, judgment or agenda. It will also, I
hope, give encouragement to women and girls who lack self-confidence

in it. I only reiterate that domestic violence is a hidden scourge. We
all know someone, however unlikely, who suffers from it. I was struck
by a recent people’s panel blog on the <I>Guardian</I> website

the problems that women and children will face when our troops leave
next year; in the DRC, known as the rape capital of the world and the
worst place on earth to be a woman; or in Saudi Arabia, where women
cannot drive and have no right to vote? I was struck by a photograph I

which noble Lords have already referred, there are so many issues to
discuss, as the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, mentioned, such
as violence against women, their lack of representation,
issues of access to employment, the fact that so many of the poorest
people in the world are women, and access to all kinds of rights such
as property and health. All are connected and will be anatomised by
others in this debate. Essentially, however, they are all about power,
position, mindsets, traditions and, of course, economics.</hs_para>

of that wider picture which I will draw out. It was mentioned in the
House of Lords Library briefing for this debate in the form of a
quotation of Kofi Annan, saying that women are the most important
actors in development. It also made the point that the empowerment of
women, the equality agenda, is right in itself but is also an
instrument for progress in the world. We can all think of positive
examples; I will mention just two. The first, well cited in health
circles, is that if a girl in India has five years of education, her
child is 40% more likely to reach the age of five. It is that simple.
Education of girls is probably the most effective intervention in
healthcare. The second is of course microfinance. The story is well
told there as well, of how women have been able to revitalise
communities and save their families from difficult situations through
the application of microfinance.

health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:51:33"></hs_TimeCode> more
specifically, I start with a wider point about gender and the
importance of disaggregating data—which I know is an issue close
to the heart of DfID—and knowing the facts. An important paper
by Sarah Hawkes and Kent Buse appeared in the <I>Lancet</I> on 18 May
entitled <I>Gender and Global Health: evidence, policy, and
inconvenient</I><I> </I><I>truths</I>. The inconvenient truth that it
brings out is that—obviously leaving aside reproductive and
sexual health—men have the bigger problems in terms of the
global burden of disease and shorter lives. I am not going to talk
about men, but the point here is that gender is not just a
women’s issue. We need to disaggregate our data much more
clearly if we are to have a real impact on health for everyone in the
world. We need to think about gender as a key factor in
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000350" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000350">On women
and health, all the issues are linked to the wider picture I mentioned
earlier. I suspect that we are going to hear lots of numbers on
pregnancy-related mortality today. The numbers I have are that 287,000
women died from pregnancy-related issues in 2010—that figure may
have halved in 20 years but it is still extraordinarily high—and
99% of those women lived in developing countries. Again, as I suspect
we will hear today, it is not just about mortality; it is also about
morbidity. I have seen estimates varying from six times to 30 times as
many women being affected as result of pregnancy-related complications

injuries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:53:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

part about how you get healthcare and proper health provision to
people. They are partly about money, and ensuring that there are
facilities to which women can get, but they are also fundamentally
about society. They are about, as has already been said, unwanted
pregnancies. They are about girl brides whose bodies are too small to
bear the pregnancy which they have had inflicted upon them. It is about
how men handle that. It is interesting to see a number of interesting
projects around Africa where male, often traditional, leaders have been
encouraged to develop programmes to ensure that their wives and women
actually get access to hospitals and facilities when they need
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:54:05"></hs_TimeCode>. For
example, there is an interesting project in Zambia where traditional

sexual health. It is not surprising when one thinks of powerlessness
and violence that more than half the people affected by HIV/AIDS in the
world are women. They are often powerless on contraception. I was
staggered to hear that some surveys indicate that men in developing
countries understand the importance of contraception and the relevance
of using a condom more than women do; that says something about
education. Of course, we have already heard about
child marriages and the fact that, according to the latest figures,
something like a third of girls in developing countries, excluding
China, will be married by the time that they are

statistics, which is another important argument for disaggregating the
data. Disabled women are twice as likely to have AIDS as the general
population. They have much poorer access to education and jobs. More of
them are in
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000355" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000355">My
final point about the challenges facing women is to recognise that it
is often the women who pick up the pieces. In the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
Africa, the principal carers of dying people are their female
relatives. They are in a difficult position. There is some interesting
research on this from the Commonwealth Secretariat which shows that,
because of the stigma of HIV/AIDS in many countries and the weakness
and poverty of the people involved, they are working in the most
desperate conditions. The people bearing that burden are highly
disproportionately women relatives.</hs_para>

other research, I note that in Tanzania, for example, women are
literally left holding the baby when their husbands have gone off to be

face all these challenges. What is the way forward? Some of these are
societal and cultural issues, as I have already said, although I was
struck by the opening words of the noble Lord, Lord Loomba, who said
that when people discriminate on the grounds of race we talk about
apartheid, but when they discriminate on the grounds of gender we talk
about culture. Culture needs to be handled sensitively; I speak as the
husband of an anthropologist, and I understand that. Changes have to
happen within societies, and to come from a society’s own
leaders. We need the skills of the anthropologist as well as those of
the legislator and project manager. However, there is much that we can

it is easy to talk about large-scale policy in terms of millions, and
so on. Ultimately, this is personal; it is about individuals. So I will
end on a personal note. I well remember, some years ago, my mother

born and saying, “What a different life she is going to have
from me”. She said it both with sadness and with confidence.
This surprised me, coming from somebody who had more advantages than
many of her generation, having graduated from one of our top
universities almost 80 years ago; but she spoke with confidence. Are we
holding out the same promise for today’s daughters and

better equally

Parekh:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by congratulating the noble
Lord, Lord Loomba, on securing this debate. It is important to bear in
mind, when we talk about developing societies and developed societies,
that the picture is quite complex. It is never the case that developed
societies have been able to achieve equality for women or that the
women’s status in all areas is necessarily better. After all, it
is striking that, for example, the first woman Prime Minister was in a
developing country and not in ours; and that at one time India had far
more women ambassadors than we
had<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:01:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000363" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000363">It
is also very striking that, if you look at religion, in many developing
societies the tribal religions based on fertility cults tend to be far
more sympathetic to women than many of the organised religions in
developed countries. It is also very striking that when Christianity
and other great religions travelled to developing countries, they were
suitably interpreted so as to support the position of women. I say this
simply to make it clear that not all developing societies are
necessarily places where women are always in an inferior position; nor
are developed countries necessarily free from the problems that women
face.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=924?><hs_para UID="13062765000364" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000364">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:02:34"></hs_TimeCode>
said that just as a point of clarification and qualification, I move on
to developing countries, because they are the main subject of our
debate. The question is: what are the major challenges that women face
in those countries? I want to highlight five. The first challenge is
the question of personal insecurity. In developing countries, women
generally tend not to enjoy the same degree of physical security, at
home or outside, as do men. Rape and sexual harassment
are fairly common, and this tends to be particularly acute
during situations of civil war. For example, in the Bosnian war,
between 20,000 and 50,000 women were raped, and some 400,000 women were
raped during the Rwandan genocide of 1994. It is not just a question of
rape and the brutality; violence and humiliation also go with it. Rape
also becomes a political weapon, forcing women indoors, making sure
that they do not come out into the street or the public square and
making them suffer from acute isolation and
depression<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000365" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000365">The
second challenge has to do with education. In many developing
societies, the literacy rate among women is rather poor. Among men, it
generally tends to be around 60%; for women it tends to be between 30%
and 45%. Although it is widely realised that better education for women
generally means faster economic development, less sexual violence,
later marriages, fewer children and better health, education for women
is by and large neglected in many developing countries. In order to
deal with this situation, sometimes female education is made
compulsory—and rightly so—and this is imposed by law.
However, some countries have tried an experiment that has been
extremely successful and is worth thinking about: cash transfer,
conditional on school attendance. This has been tried very successfully
in Mexico, Turkey and Pakistan, and has delivered very good
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000366" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000366">The third challenge
facing women in developing societies has to do with the economy. A
large number of them are not allowed to go out to work or, when they
do, they are subject to discrimination, and promotion prospects for
many of them are inevitably limited. Very few of them engage in
independent business. It is striking, for example, that, in developing
countries as a whole, only between 2% and 4% of the women are in
independent business and function as employers. Furthermore, they have
no control over household resources, although it is generally known
that, when women do have control over household resources, they tend to
spend the money much more sensibly than men, especially on the health
and education of their
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:05:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000367" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000367">The
fourth challenge has to do with their lack of power, not just in
politics, with the qualification that I mentioned earlier. Women are
not very widely represented in Parliament or in positions of power. It
is also very striking that in many of the senior positions in civil
society and elsewhere female representation tends to be rather poor.
One way to deal with that has been to guarantee not so much a quota
system but some kind of positive action, to ensure that a certain
percentage of positions are filled by women. It is such positive action
that partly explains why Rwanda, for example, a country where one would
not have expected an excellent record, has more female MPs than we
have. 
<?notus-xml column=925?>Sweden also has a better record in women’s representation than
some other countries because it has followed a policy of positive
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000368">The
fifth challenge goes much deeper. It is not institutional, and it has
to do with the prevalence and domination of patriarchal culture. Women
are treated as inferior. They are sexualised and largely treated as
objects of sexual gratification, and are sometimes expected to meet
impossible standards of beauty and therefore suffer from all kinds of
physical ill health. They lack autonomy and control over their lives,
which very often results in forced marriages. Female foeticide tends to
be quite common, which partly creates a certain amount of stigma
associated with the female gender.
All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:09:03"></hs_TimeCode> this results
in poor ambition in women, living not their lives but somebody
else’s and modelling themselves, not according to their norms
but on somebody else’s. It is important to bear in mind that in
all developing societies there is an important sociological tension,
which aggravates the situation in the short term, although it improves
it in the long run. The tension is that there is a still residual
patriarchal culture—even more than residual—but at the
same time there is a greater awareness of rights for women and a
greater assertion of equality. What you therefore have is a legacy of
patriarchal culture, confronted by women asserting their equality,
which men are not ready to accept, with the result that men strike out
in whatever ways they can. Therefore, in the transitional period, you
see more domestic violence than you did before. You also see more cases
of rape, as a kind of punishment for women’s insubordination or
getting too big for their boots.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062765000369" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000369">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:09:02"></hs_TimeCode>
is not just in developing countries that this happens. Many
sociologists have pointed out that this also tends to happen in
developed countries, where there is still a patriarchal culture,
although much attenuated, and on the other hand there are men who are
used to thinking of themselves and of women in a certain way being
confronted by women who have a great sense of their own dignity and
equality. That confrontation results in men not wanting to give up
their power, and therefore results in acts of rape, domestic violence
and other
situations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000370">These
are some of the challenges that women face in developing countries. If
we are content not just to debate but to do something about it, we will
have to think not merely in terms of new ideas and policies, but also
about perhaps being more generous with the aid that we give to those
countries for specific women and children-related

inequalities in Sudan, particularly pertaining to female genital

education in 2010 was 12.8% for females compared with 18.2% for males.

I was ruminating early this morning about how I would begin my speech,
I decided to glance at my e-mails first. You know how it is: you cannot
quite get down to composing, so you think: “I will do my e-mails
first”. There was a message from a Kevin Rudd. Did other noble
Lords receive one? It was quite extraordinary. I do not know why I was
singled out for this honour, and it caught my eye. I know some
Australian MPs, so that is probably the reason. After pledging to stop

Yes, it was the new Prime Minister of Australia trying to wipe out a

Minister by Members of Parliament in a developed country—one of
our own. What example is that to male politicians all over the world,
particularly in developing countries: that it is okay to be macho,
abusive and insulting to women? Australia is not alone. I still could

this place, at least, the vast majority of us are free from sexual
harassment and denigration, even though we are sorely underrepresented.
However, we must always use every opportunity to remind men in this

social and economic development for families, communities

richer and their wallets will be fatter. We must convince them of

the Gates foundation and the UNFPA for the FP summit held in
Westminster last year, which was followed up by the pre-G8 conference
that the all-party group and the European parliamentary forum hosted

and Cameroon on parliamentary strengthening visits organised by the

talk about women. In his view, there were male issues too. It was
right, he said, that boys should go to school and be educated because
they needed to work, but he was not sure that it was worth doing the
same for girls, because it was their job to help their mothers at home
and anyway they would soon have children and be unable to work. He
regarded girls as second class citizens. He was equally strident about
violence. He told us that men had to keep their womenfolk under
control. He also astonished us by saying that what we call female
genital mutilation was exactly the same as circumcision for boys.
Fortunately, the leader of our delegation, who at that time was a woman
Labour MP, rose to give him a good ticking off. After dismantling all
the points that he had made she finished by saying: “So let me
be clear: girls are equal to boys, women are equal to men, and if you

to birth control is patchy or non-existent in many countries, leading
to women being unable to limit the size of their families. In Sierra
Leone, we were proudly told that the abortion law was exactly the same
as that in the UK. Unfortunately, that was a reference to the 1837 Act,
which decreed that abortion was illegal. The result is that abortions
take place in that country but are done illegally in the backstreets,
and many women die as a
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000400" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000400">Professor
Nynke van den Broek, head of the maternal and newborn health unit at

women—the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, said the figure was
270,000—die each year from complications of pregnancy and
childbirth. This equates to a woman dying every two minutes. The noble
Baroness, Lady Jenkin, said that it was every minute and a half.
Professor van den Broek added that for each death, 30 women live but
suffer life-long morbidity. She said that there are at least
2.6 million stillbirths every year and that 99% of maternal
deaths are in developing countries. Most deaths are preventable.
Maternal conditions are the second most common cause of death in women
of reproductive age, between 15 and 44 years, in low and middle-income
countries. In sharp contrast, in high income countries such as ours,
maternal death does not feature in the 10 most common causes of

often desert women who bear their children. The number of children born
outside marriage is startling. I have no figures for most African

Dominica 76%, St Vincent 84%, Panama 83%, Seychelles 80%, Guadeloupe
77% and 
<?notus-xml column=932?>French Guyana 87%. Before we get too smug, let me tell noble Lords that
the figure for the United Kingdom is 46.3%, similar to that of Belgium
with 47%. The country with the lowest proportion of children born
outside marriage is Turkmenistan with 3.8%. Of course, in many
developed countries, couples live together without marrying, but that

Jolie for appearing this week before a UN committee to campaign against
rape in war zones. However, it is not just in war zones where women are
abused. Last year, I attended a conference here in Parliament organised
by the UK branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the
Inter-Parliamentary Union. The theme was how to encourage more women to
become parliamentarians or councillors—to become leaders. There
were delegates from developing countries in Africa, Latin America and
Asia, alongside those from first-world countries. The most moving
session was on domestic violence. I was one of only three men present
among 100 women. The atmosphere was electric. We heard from three
inspiring keynote speakers: my colleague Lynne Featherstone, a Minister
in the Department for International Development; the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Scotland, who is passionate about this issue; and
Harriet Harman, who did a lot on this issue when she was a Labour
Minister in the previous Government. After the presentations, delegates
poured their hearts out about the dreadful conditions that women face
in their countries, including violence, mental abuse, rape and female
genital mutilation. You name the abuse, it got mentioned, and it was
happening in their
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000403" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000403">Things

the home has reduced, but it still goes on. My noble friend Lord McColl
of Dulwich cannot be with us today because he has an appointment with
his dentist. He told me yesterday of the lady in Dulwich who wore
sunglasses in winter, not because it was sunny but because she had two
black eyes from an abusive husband. At least a third of women suffer
violence at some time in their lives. Figures released this week
suggest it is up to two-thirds. Sometimes physical violence is not
involved; it can be mental attacks with constant shouting, undermining
a woman’s self-confidence. It is still abuse. The effect on
children in households where this abuse takes place is particularly
corrosive. In one family that we heard of in the conference last year
the children could tell from the sound of the key in the front door

country if you hit someone in the street, that is a crime. If you hit
someone at home, that is a crime too. We must end this misery.
Parliament must oblige the police and social services to protect the

prevent another tragedy. Women, children and, yes, men need to be able

the few advantages of getting into one’s anecdotage is that you

one of 4%—that is 27 out of 635—and I know the progress
that can been made. At that time I also experienced having to come into
the House of Commons two days after leaving hospital after the birth of
my first child. Maternity leave was not considered relevant. It is an
enormous joy when I now see the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime
Minister taking paternity leave. Things have improved since the days

quite differently, about women in the developing world and to echo some
of the things that have already been said about the crucial
role—the Kofi Annan line—of women in development overall.
It is important to recognise that what we consider as women’s
rights—access to education, freedom 
<?notus-xml column=934?>from violence and forced and early marriage, the right to participate in
political and civic life, economic empowerment and the provision of
health services for women in the developing world—are not just
matters of individual women’s rights. Those rights are also the
key to development in the families, communities and countries in which
those women live. If those women are not empowered, if they are not
allowed to thrive, the countries in which they live will not develop
and flourish either. Like others, I was enormously heartened by the
work that has been done by the Secretary of State and by the Prime
Minister in his role as co-chair of the high level panel on ensuring
that a stand-alone goal on gender equality will be taken into account

address particularly one of the goals in the MDGs up to 2015 that will

Loomba, quoted the chilling statistic that a girl in South Africa is
more likely to be raped than to learn to read. I want to quote an
equally chilling statistic: a girl born today in South Sudan—a
country to which reference has already been made—is
statistically more likely to die in childbirth than to complete her
primary school education. I read “education” as meaning
secondary school education, but it is her primary school education.
That is a terrible statistic, and we have heard about the hundreds of

that the majority of those deaths are preventable. Some of them are
preventable by changes in major structural issues which have already
been referred to. We know the effects of early marriage, and we know
the effects of excluding girls from education and basic healthcare. In
development, I normally speak about neglected tropical diseases. Those
diseases in themselves create a high risk of death and morbidity in
pregnancy and childbirth. The anaemia that comes with malaria means
that women are more prone to die. Access to fundamental healthcare is

access to family planning and the ability to choose when and whether to
have children.</hs_para>

the Prime Minister’s work in the United Nations
Secretary-General’s High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the
Post-2015 Development Agenda. Their recent report has proposed a
standalone goal on gender and a target to eliminate discrimination
against women in political, social and economic life. That report will
now inform the global conversation that will continue over the next one
and a half years and the recommendations will be put forward when the
UN General Assembly meets in September. It is vital that the UK

the Government will soon review their Strategic Vision for Girls and

whether they will specifically measure change in the social attitudes,
norms and behaviours that constrain girls’ and women’s
lives, and which 
<?notus-xml column=936?>perpetuate exclusion and poverty. As the noble Baroness, Lady Jenkin,
also highlighted, women are estimated to account for two-thirds of the
1.4 billion people globally who are living in extreme poverty. However,
women perform two-thirds of the world’s work and produce 50% of
the world’s food, but earn 10% of the income and own only 1% of

most affected by poverty have the least access to and influence over
the decisions being made to tackle it. After recent events in
Bangladesh, we cannot ignore our own responsibility. The Rana Plaza
disaster which killed 1,129 people last April is a stark reminder of
the human cost behind behind cheap fashion in our high streets. Some
3.6 million women work in Bangladesh’s garment industry, most of
them in factories similar to the Rana Plaza. Retailers have now been
forced to react, including British companies like Matalan,
Bonmarché and Primark, by signing up to a legally binding
building safety agreement backed by the international trade union,
IndustriALL and the Bangladeshi Government. Under the terms of the
deal, brands including H&amp;M and Marks &amp; Spencer, as well as
Primark, have each agreed to contribute up to half a million dollars a

need to act too. The disaster underlines why we need decent
international labour standards. It is essential that the UK Government
take the lead in advocating the change needed to protect the lives of
workers around the world. With so many major companies that operate
globally based in the UK, DfID must start taking decent labour
standards seriously. In March, the Secretary of State for International
Development, Justine Greening, gave a speech at the London Stock
Exchange outlining how her department would work with the private
sector to encourage economic growth in developing countries. I would
like to ask the Minister what criteria the department uses to determine
whether to award a contract to a UK company for work in a developing
country. DfID should ensure that companies receiving its support can
demonstrate that they do not undermine the tax revenue collection
capabilities of developing countries; that they have decent employment
practices throughout their supply chain, including acceptable levels of
pay to workers in developing countries; that they do not undertake
activities that are degrading to the natural environment in which they
operate; and that they have competed in a fair and transparent
tendering process. When receiving support from the UK Government,
companies should demonstrate support for sustainable and inclusive
growth with an explicit focus on reducing poverty and inequality, and
ensure transparency and accountability throughout their business and
supply chain activities.</hs_para>

financial services and in doing so proves that no one is too poor to

the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, highlighted, such microfinance initiatives

local economies. The personal stories that I have heard from women in
Africa have made me realise just how important breaking the barriers of
financial exclusion in this country is to helping transform local

noble Lords have referred to the need to tackle the underlying problems

years ago the unanimous adoption of Resolution 1325 on women, peace and
security was a landmark decision. It specifically addressed the
situation of women in armed conflict and called for their participation
at all levels of decision-making on conflict resolution and
peacebuilding. The UN recognised that women’s exclusion from
peace processes not only contravened their rights but also weakened the
prospects for sustainable peace. Since the adoption of
Resolution 1325 we have had four supporting resolutions—1820,
1888, 1889 and 1960. All focus on three key goals: strengthening
women’s participation in decision-making, ending sexual violence
and impunity, and providing an accountability system. Together the

for securing this important debate and for his absolutely outstanding
speech in introducing it. It was an astonishing overview, with such
understanding of the situation of women and girls, whether here at home

their contributions. As I looked across at my noble friend Lady Hamwee

we have heard bears out why DfID puts the support of women and girls
front and centre of its work. In a world where poverty abounds, it is
women who are at the very edge. As my noble friend Lord Jones and the

world’s work and produce 50% of the food but earn only 10% of
the income and own only 1% of the property.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:06:19"></hs_TimeCode> also know
that there is much to do in our country. My noble friends Lord Loomba,
Lady Jenkin, Lady Hamwee and Lady Tonge, along with other noble Lords,
emphasised that there is a lot to do. I note the Private
Member’s Bill introduced by Bill Cash and think he should extend
it to equality in the United Kingdom as well as in developing
countries. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Collins, said about the

the issue of women worldwide, we know that two-thirds of the 750
million illiterate people in the developing world are women. Reflecting
the secondary status of women, one in three women are beaten or
sexually abused by a partner in her lifetime. The noble Lord, Lord
Parekh, pointed to the use of sexual violence as a method of punishment
and control. One in nine girls are forced into marriage before they
reach their 14th birthday. Investing in girls and women has a
transformative effect on poverty reduction and is critical to building
freer and fairer societies and economies. When reading the <I>African
Economic Outlook</I> report for the Question earlier today, I noted how
greater gender equality went hand in hand with greater economic
prosperity. DfID’s strategic vision for girls and women,
published in 2011, outlines the department’s commitment to girls
and women. It focuses on education, combating violence, trying to
improve economic empowerment, and sexual and reproductive health and
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000430" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000430">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>

legal frameworks

DfID recognises that economic and political empowerment is crucial for
the status of women. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, the noble
Lord, Lord Crisp, and other noble Lords stressed, education is often
the critical first step to opening up opportunities for girls and
women. More time in education means that girls face a lower risk of
sexual violence, marry later, have fewer children and have better
health outcomes for the children they do have. As the noble Lord, Lord
Crisp, put it, the education of girls is one of the best health
interventions. DfID’s Girls’ Education Challenge aims to

noble friends Lady Jenkin and Lady Tonge focused on sexual and
reproductive health and rights. As they know, medical complications
from pregnancy and childbirth are still the leading cause of death

right honourable friend Andrew Mitchell really understood its
significance. The London summit on family planning in 2012 committed to
increase access to family planning for an extra 120 million girls and
women in the world’s poorest countries. We know that this
benefits women, their families, societies and the economies of their
countries. I have to say that it is absolutely wonderful to be basking

that summit last year, a west African leader, clearly expecting much
acclaim, noted that his contribution to reproductive rights was that he
no longer availed himself of young girls. He was somewhat perplexed by

have said, where economic and political empowerment is critical,
violence against women and girls reflects their current status. Many

what works. In March my honourable friend Lynne Featherstone announced
a new £35 million programme to support efforts to end female
genital mutilation in Africa and beyond. My noble friend Lord Hussain

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, the order was made on 3 June
and came into force on 10 June 2013. The order specifies four N-BOMe
and six benzofuran substances, including their simple derivatives, as
drugs subject to temporary control under Section 2A(1) of the Misuse of
Drugs Act 1971. On 29 May, the Government received a recommendation
from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) under the
temporary control provisions of the 1971 Act, advising that the N-BOMe
and benzofuran substances are being misused, and that their misuse is
having sufficiently harmful effects to warrant legislative action. My
honourable friend the Minister for Crime Prevention was satisfied, in
consideration of the latest available evidence and the ACMD’s
assessment, that the conditions to make a temporary class drug order
were met.</hs_para>

hypertension, agitation and aggression, visual and audio hallucination,

evidence that these two drugs, N-BOMe and Benzo Fury, and their

supporting the order I refer to some of the key issues that are
relevant to this discussion, and on which I would find it helpful if
the Minister could provide some clarity and information. I understand
and appreciate the process that has brought this specific order before
us, but I am not altogether clear on some issues, such as timescales
and action taken by other countries, whether it is on similar
timescales and whether 
<?notus-xml column=944?>greater co-operation is now available. The Minister will be aware of the
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which has a
key role in detection and assessment of new drugs across the entire EU.
Can the Minister tell me—I think that we have had similar
information from Ministers previously—how many new substances
have been identified by the EMCDDA since 2010, and how many of those
have now been identified by the Home Office early warning system? The
Minister may not have the figures to hand and I am happy for him to
write to me. We learnt from the debate on an earlier order that the
Home Office had identified only 11 out of 90 substances identified by
the EMCDDA in 2010-11. My understanding is that now more than 200
substances have been identified by the EMCDDA. How many of those have
been identified by the Home Office? I ask because I am keen to see that
we are keeping pace with the rest of Europe in identifying and taking
action on new drugs and substances as they enter the UK
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000463" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000463">The
Minister mentioned that they are sometimes referred to as legal highs.
That lulls some people into a false sense of security that a drug is
safe because it is not illegal. Yet the only reason it is legal is that
the formal process of making it illegal has not been completed.
Yesterday I Attended an IPU briefing on the drugs trade and I was
struck by one specific fact: that synthetic drugs now account for 20%
to 25% of the drugs market. As their use is growing, the need to be on
the ball with identification and action becomes all the more important
and
crucial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000464" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000464">When
debating a previous order I asked the then Minister if he was aware of
the reasons for the difference in the number of drugs identified by the
EMCDDA and those identified by the Home Office. He was not able to
respond to me on that occasion. It would be helpful to know and, again,
I shall understand if the Minister prefers to write to me with the
accurate statistics and explanation. I suspect that there are probably
a number of genuine and understandable reasons. Is there just a short
time lag between one body indentifying a substance and the information
being fed through to the Home Office? Are the Government waiting for
advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs? I will come
back to that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>, because
we do not want any unnecessary delay in identifying and taking action,

am keen to ensure, as I am sure the Minister is, that we make full use
of co-operation with other European countries that are tackling the
same issues, which are incredibly difficult. Co-operation across
international boundaries is essential as we are all facing similar
problems that are having a similar impact on our societies. We all want
to be reassured that we are acting on these issues with the sense of
urgency that the public deserve and expect. I do not for one second
doubt the Minister’s intentions; I would not want that to be

the information contained in the letter that the Home Secretary
received from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs indicated
that Benzo Fury, the drug that we getting a temporary banning order on

I am not suggesting that that on its own would be enough to bring us to
this point, because obviously the drug has to be properly assessed.
However, the chair of the ACMD, Professor Les Iversen, recently said
that the council had the resources to assess only two or three new
substances a year. If between 70 and 200 dangerous and damaging
substances are on the market legally and there is an increase in the
manufacturing of synthetic drugs—many of which there will be a
strong case for making illegal—to be identifying or assessing
just two or three a year is completely inadequate. Is there more that
we should be doing now to ensure that we are not constantly lagging
behind what is happening in Europe? Such a lagging behind is likely to
lead to increased dangers and increased hospitalisations, and possibly
worse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062765000467" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0002.htm#13062765000467">Does
the Minister know how long it took for the drug Benzo Fury, for

him notice that I would be asking this question today—between
the National Poisons Information Service, the TICTAC database on

provided just £200,000 from the health budget for this purpose,

consideration and our wider response. It works by test purchasing
samples for analysis from the internet and “head
shops”—whatever they are—collecting music festival
and non-casework police samples, and other sensible courses of action.
This has made a vital contribution to health and safety at summer
festivals. Data from FEWS has been shared with ACMD to inform its

the Home Office. So we are not on our own. UK Focal Point can also
liaise directly with the National Poisons Information Service when
required. When, for example, a threat from a new psychoactive substance
becomes 
<?notus-xml column=948?>apparent, the Home Office will ask UK Focal Point—and has done so

Europe cannot be used as a barometer to measure the extent of the

future-proof our legislation by catching families and groups at a time,

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for his explanation. I have a couple of questions for clarification on
the order. At the top of page 2, Article 4 inserts two new articles, 8
and 8ZA. Article 8 has a new process of an oral grant or refusal of
leave, whereby an individual who has been granted leave to remain or
refusal to remain can be told that by telephone. I am slightly puzzled
about the mechanics of how that would work. I indicated to the noble
Earl that I intended to raise this

will, of course, not have English as their first language and may have
difficulty in understanding. What process is undertaken to ensure that
the person receiving the notice to leave the country or to remain fully
understands what they are being told, so that there is no
misunderstanding? If someone receives something in writing saying that
they do not have leave to remain in the country, they can take it to a
solicitor and get advice, but if they receive that information over the
telephone they will have to digest it at a later date. I am slightly
concerned that someone may get information but not fully understand the
nature of that information and not be able to act on it because they
are puzzled or do not have any proof of that information. How is it
possible to be assured of the identity of someone being notified that
they may be granted leave to remain or refused leave to remain in the

began for me in this House when we were recalled in August 2011
following those deeply disturbing riots. I raised the point then that
we should perhaps consider some form of national service, or community
service, for our young people, and look at the idea of a citizenship
ceremony in which they recognised their rights and responsibilities. As
a result of that, colleagues on both sides of the House contacted me
and we had a series of meetings. The noble Lord, Lord Butler of
Brockwell, who cannot be here today, and the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, were among Cross-Benchers who took part in the discussions.
We were helped, too, by the advice that we received on the
recommendation of the noble Baroness, Lady King of Bow, from Professor
Ted Cantle. Those meetings inspired me to seek this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000003">There
is a very serious and pressing case for formally marking the transition
of our young people to full citizenship at the age of 18. It is a sad
fact that young people are far less likely to take part in the
democratic process these days, or even register, than used to be the
case. Perhaps that is not surprising when we do so little to suggest
that coming of age matters. Citizenship is about far more than voting.
I do not suggest that there are not hundreds of thousands of young
people in the country who are proud to be members of their local
communities and give real service to them. This is not a critical
speech but one that seeks to move forward. Although many make real and
important contributions, the idea and the ideal of public service are
not as fashionable as they once
were.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000004">We
need to provide for all 16 to 18 year-olds the opportunity to engage in
some form of structured community service, working with civic and
voluntary organisations. This should culminate in a citizenship
ceremony that could be a real occasion, not only for the young people
concerned but for their friends and families. We already have a
positive process for migrants and longer-standing residents who wish to
become UK citizens, but there is nothing to acknowledge that our 18
year-olds have suddenly acquired new rights and responsibilities. When,
for those who wish to become UK citizens, a citizenship ceremony was
first mooted, many said that it was a jingoistic, flag-waving and
pointless exercise. That has not proved to be the case. Many people in
our country have taken part in these ceremonies, accompanied by their
families and friends, with a real sense of pride and commitment. Anyone
in your Lordships’ House who is fortunate enough to be a deputy
lieutenant of a county might have experienced such ceremonies. I
suggest to your Lordships that the sceptics have indeed been
confounded, because those who come appreciate that they are being
formally and publicly welcomed into the fold. They are very happy to
take an oath of allegiance in front of the Queen’s
representative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000005">I

Citizen Service is aimed at 16 and 17 year-olds. It
introduces young people to volunteering in blocks of several weeks
across the summer. Up to 30,000 youngsters take part. It is no doubt a
very good scheme, and I warmly commend it, but I propose a scheme that
is, first, much simpler and, secondly, made available to every young
person. Around 700,000 young people come of age each year. The formal
marking of the 18th birthday—of course, not necessarily on the
exact day—with a ceremony supported by a short school or
community-based programme would incur minimal costs and would have a
great impact. I referred to the role of the lord-lieutenancy a moment
or two ago. Every county has a lord-lieutenant who is supported by
deputy lieutenants, often several dozen of them, who would be able to
support such an extended role conducting ceremonies in the name of Her

integrated and more cohesive than many of our communities. Of course, I
do not know the answer to this question, but I wonder whether, if we
had had such a highly developed programme, those riots would have taken
place two years ago. Whether they would or not, I suggest to your
Lordships that this sort of developed approach has many benefits and
few dangers, and I very warmly commend it to the Government because
they are recognising in the curriculum and through the programme to
which I referred the importance of developing awareness and
responsibility in our young people as they mature and become part of
the adult community. They recognise this as being vital. We all
recognise this as being vital, and I very much hope that the ideas that

noble Lord has spoken about a citizenship programme. I will talk about
that in a moment, but I begin by talking about citizenship education as
it exists in our schools and where I think it can be improved. I am
delighted that the Government have made sure that citizenship education
remains a compulsory national curriculum subject at key stages 3 and 4.
I am also delighted that it continues to include such subjects as our
parliamentary system of democracy, the making of laws, the evolution of
constitutional monarchy and the way in which it functions, national,
ethnic, religious and other identities and the variety of electoral
systems through which people can be represented. This is greatly
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:11:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000011">However,
I am slightly uneasy about three areas. The first is what is being
taught in the name of citizenship education, how it is taught and
within what framework. I put these three together because they are
closely related. It is very striking that citizenship education
concentrates simply on providing information about institutions. It has
very little to say about political ideologies: about conservatism,
socialism, liberalism, fascism—the variety of spectra through
which people have perceived and tried to organise political
arrangements. It is very important that our students know what these
ideas and ideologies stand for and how to arbitrate between them. That
is my first area of
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000012">My
second concern is that we live in a multicultural society and that it
is therefore important that its citizens are able to relate to each
other and to form a cohesive community by developing what I call
multicultural literacy or multicultural competence. By that, I mean the
capacity to recognise and live with differences and to uncover the
commonalities that underpin those differences. It is important to be
able to relate to people across cultural boundaries and to be able to
recognise them as one’s fellow humans and fellow citizens
despite those differences. Multicultural literacy is absolutely vital
if a society as diverse as ours is to be
cohesive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000013">The
third important thing that is badly needed is more directly connected
with the way in which we teach. We teach via bits of information,
relying on very fine books, such as those written by my dear friend the
noble Lord, Lord Norton. I admire those books. However, it is important
to take concrete issues and to show how different ideas and agencies
play out within them. For example, if I were teaching politics to 16,
17 and 18 year-olds, I would consider it vital to take a real
situation, such as the Holocaust, the partition of India or a situation
of ethnic genocide, and to use this as an opportunity to see how
different forces come to play so that people who have lived together as
good neighbours—as brothers—and helped each other out in
times of sickness and tragedy can change so suddenly, apparently
overnight, to being at each other’s throats. How does this
happen? What are the preconditions? If we do not understand these
people, we demonise them, saying that they have all gone mad. Have they

<?notus-xml column=956?>become fanatics overnight? In five minutes? That is impossible. There
must be a culture or climate within which certain forces are already at
work. These forces are kept under control in certain situations but may
be released from control when the situation
changes.</hs_para>

want our students to appreciate what it is to live politically, what
political life is all about, we have to discuss not merely bodies of
information but concrete issues. If we do not want to concentrate on
big issues such as the Holocaust or the Rwandan genocide—a
fortnight or a month can be devoted to the study of
those—another thing that can be done is to ask pupils to bring
in headlines from newspapers about important issues that happen to
interest them and, starting from there, help them to understand through
a range of issues the day-to-day reality of what is going on in the
world at

all this is being taught, it is important to stress that citizenship is
a lived reality and should be practised. The ethos and practices of the
school must therefore reflect the principles that the school wants to
impress on its pupils. Pupils can be involved in taking certain
decisions within the school so that they can learn that citizenship
does not begin once they leave school; it is practised within the
school. Decisions are taken on delinquent children, all kinds of acts
of indiscipline and managing the school. Pupils can also put forth
their views on how the school’s resources should be
allocated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:15:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

turn now to the very important point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Cormack, on having a specific citizenship programme rather than just
education. We must realise the following important point. Having lived
here for almost 58 years, having arrived as a student, becoming a
professor, and all the things that followed, I wonder why the great
public institutions of which we were proud and we cherished have one by
one declined in their legitimacy and people have begun to lose faith in
them. We used to be extremely proud of our police service. In India,
the British police service was always held up as a model. Of course, it
can still be held up in that way when compared to the Indians’.
Nevertheless, there are problems. We used to be proud of our print
journalism and the quality, variety and depth of our newspapers. We
used to be proud of our Civil Service, and of the integrity of the NHS.
As one looks at all the cover-ups and so on, one begins to ask what is
going on. Citizenship should be understood not simply in terms of
serving people but in terms of taking custody of our collective life.
If there are qualities that we value, I should have thought that a
citizenship programme would help to ensure that citizens take
responsibility for their society and cultivate the virtues and
competencies that are necessary to have the healthy society that we
once had and that was the basis of our great
reputation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/5933BC91D7B2BDCB87081D0FA92FD32163B668E0" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Cormack, for giving us the opportunity to debate this hugely important
issue. I was much taken with his suggestion, which is worthy of
consideration. But, of course, before that we must get citizenship
education taught properly and correctly in our schools. I think that
citizenship education is vital for ensuring 
<?notus-xml column=957?>that young people are an active and valued part of our society and,
moreover, that they are involved in their communities. All too often,
young people are seen in a negative

us reflect for a moment on some figures that were collected by the
Hansard Society. We know for a fact that in the 2010 general election,
only 44% of 18 to 24 year-olds voted, although the good news was that
that was an increase of 7% on the previous general election, but still
well below the average turnout of 65%. Moreover, the Hansard Society
research suggests that only one-third of 18 to 24 year-olds claim to
know anything about politics while, rather alarmingly, 90% of young
people do not know who their MP is or how to contact
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:19:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

view, citizenship is not about reaching for a syllabus, dusting it
down, teaching it and giving students a body of facts, it is about
creating an ethos in the school and ensuring that pervades everything
that young people do. It has to be about the ethos of the school,
whether that is schools having school councils and young people knowing
about them, electing their councillors and debating issues; whether it
is doing voluntary work in the community—at my school we would
go to the local care centre and sing Christmas carols or work at the
local Jaguar Land Rover factory; whether it is doing charity appeals;
whether it is shadowing people; whether it is bringing speakers in from
the local GP to the local midwife; or whether it is having a rolling
programme of pupils observing school governing bodies, as we had in my
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000020">The
good news is that citizenship as a programme of study will continue in
key stages 3 and 4. We are out to consultation on that but the first
draft, as good as it is, is very factually orientated with no real
indication of the sort of things that the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, was
talking about, so no real voluntary or community engagement. I was
interested to see that our Prime Minister last year asked Dame Julia
Cleverdon and Amanda Jordan to review how we can increase the quality
and quantity of social action and engagement by young people between
the ages of 10 and 20. There were some interesting facts in their
interim report. They found that although there is a wide range of
social activity in the UK, much of it takes place in the voluntary
sector and very little within schools and businesses. They also found a
lack of knowledge and understanding about social action and
opportunities and their value in the education sector was very limited.
And finally they found that young people have no facility to develop
social action over time. I hope the Minister when replying might
suggest it is important that we recognise that fact in the
curriculum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000021">It
is also interesting to see what young people think citizenship is
about. The National Foundation for Educational Research looked at young
people. What did they think being a good citizen meant? Well,
43% thought it was about people having access to their
rights—education, health and housing. Interestingly, 39% thought
it meant working together to make sure that all members of society are
treated fairly. What a lovely result. Only 10% listed voting, politics
and government. If we are going to get citizenship right, it must be
about the quality of the teaching as well as the 
<?notus-xml column=958?>quality of the syllabus. Far too often citizenship is seen as a
Cinderella subject. I can remember my wife who teaches PE and
French—a strange combination—sometimes as a chore being
sent in to teach citizenship, never having had any training in it or
understanding of it. So we have to get that right and we also have to
make sure that from time to time we actually inspect the subject as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000022">I
will make two further quick observations. First, there is a marvellous
organisation run by and for young people called “Bite the
Ballot”. Members of all parts of the House might have been
involved in it. It is about encouraging young people to understand
democracy in all its forms and giving young people a voice in the
issues. I was invited to one meeting in the Jubilee Room, packed with
young people, and I was astounded by their ability to communicate
issues, to listen and to reason. If we can get that happening with this
organisation, why can we not get it happening in our schools as
well?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000023">I
end on a bit of a sad note, and this might seem a bit carping, but we
talk about a national curriculum and we laud the fact that we are going
to have citizenship in our national curriculum for key stages 3 and 4.
The fact is that it is not a national curriculum because half our
secondary schools can choose not to teach it. I was sad to see an
announcement by Stephen Twigg, who I admire greatly, saying that the
Labour Party was going to hand over those responsibilities to all our
schools. So in a sense it is only this party which believes that a
national curriculum should be, as it says on the label, for all
children—slimmed down, yes, but all children should be taught
those important things, including
citizenship.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13062780000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000240">5.24

Lord Bishop of Oxford:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Cormack, for calling this debate. Citizenship
education is an important subject and I will speak mainly about it as
it is lived in, through and around what happens in schools rather than
necessarily what happens after those school years; although what the

education prepares young people for life in a complex, modern society
where we all need to take our political, legal and economic
responsibilities seriously, within the context of a sustaining moral
framework. I want just to draw attention to a particular partnership
which should exist in this whole field of citizenship education, which
is the one with religious education. The All-Party Parliamentary Group
on Religious Education held a meeting last week where a whole number of
young people, from different schools, spoke movingly about how
important RE has been to them as the only opportunity they have at the
moment to examine how they can live respectfully with difference, how
they can understand people who have a very different world view and how
they can live together in a harmonious community when they are
encouraged to be in an adversarial
relationship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000027">It
is undoubtedly the case that you cannot understand the modern world
without understanding religion, which has become more, not less,
important in the past 20 years. Some of that religion of course, as we
know, has been unhealthy; but most of it is of huge 
<?notus-xml column=959?>value, especially when it is realised that religious faith is the
driving force behind the lives of over 70% of the world’s
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000028">Good
RE encourages respect, tolerance, participation,
community building, charitable activity, social engagement—all
the things that we believe are part of citizenship education as well.
Good RE creates active, informed and responsible citizens. The trouble
is that RE is under severe strain at present, not through the
intentional actions of the DfE, but through the unintended consequences
of several key decisions. The English baccalaureate excludes RE; the
reform of the so-called national curriculum excludes RE; RE is way down
the list for GCSE reform; RE teacher training places have been halved
in the last three years; bursaries for teacher training in RE have been
removed; and so on. This has resulted in a reduction in staff, in
classroom time, in resources and in exam entries and a deep fall in
teacher morale. The British Humanist Association is as concerned about
this as the RE council of which it is a
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000029">I
mention this because RE is a natural handmaid for citizenship education
and this malaise in RE is deeply damaging to the long-term health of
society. WB Yeats said that the purpose of education is not to fill a
bucket but to light a fire. The fire here is that of young people
believing in a healthy, participative, respectful, values-based
democracy. Citizenship education and RE are the best tools we have to
shape such a society and to rescue it from utilitarian ideology. The
noble Lord’s Question concerning citizenship education is
therefore deeply important and I am very pleased to take part in this

important contribution when well taught. Citizenship education, which
is a statutory requirement at secondary stage and available as a GCSE

ethical issues of our age. In so doing they should learn the skills of
argument, weighing both sides of an issue, not taking one side
instantly and relying on evidence where it is available. I would like
to think that we could bring about a generation which understood what

education is in all aspects more than a single element in the

that a school does to develop the citizen of the future. It is the
responsibility of every teacher and, above all, of the head and senior
staff to ensure that the whole school is imbued with the values of good
citizenship. That means that every pupil is valued. The relationship
between teacher and pupil is one of mutual respect, 
<?notus-xml column=961?>but where the authority of the teacher is recognised and established. It
means that bullying, cruelty, lying and cheating are never tolerated,

developed through the total experience of growing up, in which school

40 charities that are interested in citizenship

declare a double interest: first, as founder of the Citizenship
Foundation, which was established in the 1980s and now works with more
than half of state secondary schools in citizenship teaching; secondly,
the unyielding passion I have had for this subject since as a young
bloke I started as office boy in a country solicitor’s office in
1957. My principal dragged me round the country courts—all of
them closed now, of course—and I was instantly aware, as anyone
would have been unless they were made of stone, that even then the law
was formidably complicated. In juvenile courts in particular, one often
sensed that the young offenders were completely mystified. I then got a
local headmaster to let me loose on a class of 16 year-olds 
<?notus-xml column=962?>for a year to try to interest them in the law. Most people said it was
impossible but it was not merely possible but actually very easy
because the law is an extremely interesting subject when it deals with
issues of current public
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000046">I
agree wholeheartedly with my noble friend Lord Cormack’s idea
about a ceremony. I think that would be very telling. But I would like
to start with a rather basic fact that we are supposed to give credence
to; namely, equality before the law, which is, after all, the great
boast of our court system and has been from Magna Carta onwards. One
does not need to be cynical to think that to claim equality before the
law in the present age is really not possible—as an ambition,
yes; as a reality, absolutely not. Equality before the law presupposes
that those going before the law have some knowledge and understanding
of what they are dealing with when before a court and that they have,
where necessary, legal aid to enable them to conduct their
cases.</hs_para>

are legislating now at an average rate of 15,000 pages of
new statute law a year, with repeals of 3,000 or 4,000, so there is a
net increase in statute law of more than 10,000 pages a
year—most of it so complex that it is noticeable how the numbers
engaging in debates on Bills are declining year by year. Indeed, at
lunch today I met an extremely able and distinguished Peer who said
that he was not going to take part in debate on the Energy Bill, in
which he is deeply interested, because he could not make head or tail
of it and it rumbles on for tens of pages. That is not good enough. It
is rather like expecting a Christian to be a Christian without having
some knowledge of the New Testament, or a soldier to be put into battle
without arms or protective equipment, or indeed a driver to go on the
roads without having had tuition. That, frankly, is the crude analogy
with the young people we send forth from our schools today into the
big, wide world. Our society is intensely complex in every dimension
and manifestation. To allow our young people to enter the so-called
adult world with no training and no understanding of that world is
self-defeating to a degree that really beggars

old maxim, ignorantia legis neminem excusat—no one is excused by
their ignorance of the law—is of course a grand maxim. Frankly,
however, for us as a Parliament knowingly to deny the young people of
this country the knowledge to escape that ignorance seems to me to be
inexcusable—indeed, to be a derogation from our parliamentary
and democratic duty. To go on as we do, legislating as we
do, paying little or no attention to that is something that I suggest
to the House—particularly to the people who are not

case for mandatory first aid training in schools is, like Gaul, in
three parts: first, there is a real need for it; secondly, it works;
and, thirdly, it is eminently doable. Every year in the UK, up to
140,000 people die in situations where first aid might have given them
a chance to live. Some 60,000 people suffer cardiac arrests outside
hospital, two-thirds at home and the 
<?notus-xml column=964?>other third in a public setting. Almost half of those which occur in
public are witnessed by other people, quite often children. With every
minute that passes, the chances of survival decrease by about 10%, so
it can be literally a matter of life and death whether there is someone
on the scene trained in the necessary skills; for example, to get the
person into the recovery position, or to provide CPR, or to control
bleeding, at least until professional help can arrive. That is why
there is a need for first aid
training.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000060">There
is also clear evidence that it works. Such training is already
compulsory in many countries, including Norway, Denmark, France and 36
US states. The survival rate in Norway from shockable cardiac arrest is
52%; in the UK it varies between 2% and 12% depending on
where the heart attack occurs. In Seattle, where 50% of the population
is trained in emergency lifesaving, the survival rate is two and a half
times
ours.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000061">It
makes sense to teach these skills in schools. The basic training can
take as little as two hours, and several organisations offer well
designed teaching packages to deliver it, including the British Heart
Foundation—BHF—and the Red Cross, as well as St John
itself. St John Cymru-Wales’s Young Lifesaver scheme
offers training covering 11 different aspects of first aid, including
choking, asthma, bleeding, fractures, burns, poisoning, heart attacks
and others. The whole course takes about eight hours, and is offered at
both primary and secondary school levels, from age seven upwards. There
are numerous examples of young people putting their skills into
practice to save lives. The BHF estimates the annual cost of offering
such training as no more than about £2,200 per school, or even
less after the first
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000062">The
argument for making training mandatory in schools rests principally on
the lives that could be saved as a result, but there are other valuable
benefits to be gained. Students enjoy and value their training. A
review of BHF’s Heartstart programme in Northern Ireland found
that 98% of students had enjoyed it, and 68% had shared their learning
with family and friends. It provides a pathway towards continued
volunteering. Emergency life-saving can provide a first step for young
people to go on to volunteer roles, such as becoming community
responders later on.</hs_para>

is a real need to teach first aid in schools. It would produce
significant results and it is realistically achievable. Although I
share the view frequently stated by the Minister that schools should
have as much control as possible over their own curriculum, in the case
of first aid skills this is not working. Only 13% of students leave
school with any life-saving training, even though a BHF survey in 2011
found that 78% of children want it, as do 86% of teachers and 70% of
parents. I certainly had no such training at school, but I have now
remedied this by completing just this week

a number of noble Lords have already stressed, citizenship education is
essential. That means, first, enhancing it as a core part of the
national curriculum, 
<?notus-xml column=966?>and, secondly, ensuring that in content and delivery it demonstrates the
benefits to those being
taught<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:52:28"></hs_TimeCode>.
Citizenship was introduced in 2002 as a statutory national curriculum
subject for all pupils in key stages 3 and 4, as we have
already heard, and must be taught at all maintained schools. I welcomed
its introduction and, like others, I welcome the Government’s
decision to retain it as a statutory national curriculum subject.
However, the commitment to having it has not been matched by the
resources to make it a success, and three years of uncertainty about
its future have not helped in ensuring that schools devote sufficient
resources to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:53:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000071">Citizenship
education is seen too much as a duty and not as something that will
enrich students’ understanding and the reputation of the school.
There is no incentive for schools to take it seriously. It is not a
subject that contributes to a school’s standing in the league
tables. Until there are incentives to take it seriously, it will remain
a low priority for head teachers. Ofsted’s 2010 inspection
report found that about half of schools provide good or better
provision for citizenship. Students’ achievement was good or
outstanding in citizenship in just over half of the secondary schools
visited. Given the lack of incentive to put it on a par with other
subjects, that may be seen as quite creditable but it still leaves
about half of all our secondary schools falling short in the provision
of good citizenship education.</hs_para>

often, as my noble friend Lord Storey noted, citizenship teaching is
left to those who are not trained in its delivery. There are too few
trained citizenship teachers. They are also vulnerable. If school
budgets are under pressure, they are likely to be the first ones to be
let go. Since 2010, the Department for Education has withdrawn funding
for citizenship continuing professional development, and citizenship is
the only subject where trainee teachers do not receive a bursary to
help pay their

starting point is that we not only need citizenship education, but must
also take it seriously. That entails ensuring that adequate resources
are devoted to it and that schools have some incentive to take it
seriously. Can the Minister say what the Government are doing to ensure
that citizenship is enhanced and that head teachers have a reason to
take it
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:55:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000074">My
second point is that not only must head teachers have some incentive to
take citizenship education seriously, but so must the pupils taking the
subject. The citizenship programmes of study cover important topics. As
my former colleague the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, has mentioned, at key
stage 4 it is expected that pupils are taught about the role of
Parliament in holding government to account and the different electoral
systems used in and beyond the United Kingdom, as well as about other
parts of the political system. That is all well and good—and in
the light of the noble Lord, Lord Parekh’s comments, I declare
an interest as someone who writes textbooks on those
subjects—but it entails teaching students what we think is
important.</hs_para>

and processes by themselves do not always hold students’
attention, particularly when they have not chosen to study the subject.
As the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, said, the programmes need to be
constructed 
<?notus-xml column=967?>in such a way as to engage the interests of the student. That may entail
ensuring that the teaching is issue-driven, looking at issues that
engage students. There is a case for surveying young people to find out
what are salient issues, then explaining how policies in those areas
are developed and agreed and, fundamentally, how the students can make
their views on the subject known to Parliament and to policymakers.
When I speak in schools I raise issues and get students to vote on them
to demonstrate that Parliament discusses issues that are of concern to
them and on which they have
views.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000076">As
we have heard, citizenship education is crucial and we must ensure that
government remains committed to it. However, if it is to be taught, it
needs to be taught well. That entails devoting resources to it,
ensuring that schools have incentives to deliver it effectively, and
that it is delivered in such a way that it engages the interest of
students. I look forward to hearing my noble friend the Minister tell
us how the Government intend to deliver on these goals. This is a

coincides with the launch today of the independent Campaign for Youth
Social Action, to which other noble Lords have referred. I declare an
interest as president of what was formerly known as the Leicestershire

former Leicestershire Clubs for Young People has some 25 clubs that
offer a range of activities to around 4,000 young people. We have
proactive members who volunteer locally and nationally, and three very
special carers’ clubs which give their members, who often have
to cope with particular deprivation, a much-needed break from their
home responsibilities. Most of the clubs have between 20 and 40 young
people, but the recently opened centre in Hinckley will see anywhere
between 200 and 400 people. The challenge for the success of Young
Leicester will be dependent on identifying and obtaining funding needed

my noble friend’s question that we have been debating today asks

noble friend, many other noble Lords and I take part in the Lord
Speaker’s outreach programme, visiting schools to discuss the
work of Parliament and in particular the work within this House. Only
two weeks ago I had the pleasure of being with Danny Smith,
the principal of the Dukeries Academy in Ollerton, 
<?notus-xml column=968?>which I know my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth visited some years
ago. If one needed to be convinced about the advantages of the
community working together across all ages, it was to be found
there.</hs_para>

will give a short insight into the some of the facilities that it has.
It was built in the 1960s as a comprehensive school, but in 1985 it was
redesignated as a community college, with a broader reach within the
Dukeries complex. This complex, under the leadership of the principal,
rapidly became a federation of organisations providing education for
all, recreation, youth work, information and library services, with
care services for the young and the elderly. The theme is: a place for
all the family. It is a quite remarkable place and, in a way, they are
lucky to have the facilities to be able to do what I think the
citizenship programme is trying to do in its broadest
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000082">When
I was there, we had the usual presentation of the outreach programme
and questions afterwards. I always think that it is those questions
which make one realise how important the Lord Speaker’s outreach
programme is, because I was asked some very topical questions. On
Syria, I was asked whether we should give extra resources to arm those
fighting the Government. I was asked whether the voting age was it
right or whether it should be reduced to 14. I was asked about
Parliament itself and how it works. It was very clear that there was
little understanding of how Parliament works at all.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062780000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000083">However
it is important that we recognise, as my noble friends have said, the
influence that teaching staff have on their pupils. They inspire,
encourage and enthuse those young people, which in turn helps them to
help others. I pay great tribute to those teachers who have gone the
extra mile to do just that. I suspect that all of us will remember
somebody in our lives who made an impression on us. Making a difference
and giving service to the community, knowing one’s rights and
responsibilities, come from within the family or from our school days.
From my point of view, I am still glad to see the Duke of
Edinburgh’s Award scheme going from strength to strength and
that so many schools still have Armed Forces cadet groups as a focus of
school life. Many go on to join our armed services and in this Armed
Services Week we give thanks for those young people who have committed
their lives to serving this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000084">I
believe that citizenship should not be thought of as
“do-gooding” or, as a lot of young people say,
“That is for other people; it could not possibly be for
me”. Through school and these programmes we can help and inspire
young people to believe in themselves and to take a broader look than
perhaps they would do normally. They should not just come to the fact
that it is something that they should do, but something that they
actually enjoy doing. That is what will make volunteering in the future
a greater success. My question for the Minister is this: will he tell
us how the citizenship programme will fit in with community activities
already going on out there? I am sure that we need a link between the
two. Academic learning is one thing, but practical input on the ground
is what it should be. Let us hope that this campaign launched today
will have a successful future. I again thank my noble friend for giving
me the opportunity to speak in this
debate.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/7BEC58C1DAD8F633957F8BA162B5DD48F5EB965D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Cormack, for initiating this debate. I know from previous
experience that he speaks on education with considerable authority and,
once again, he has raised some important and challenging issues. I very
much agree with him that we could do more to mark the coming of age of
young people when they leave school. I remember that I took my exams
and left, and that was it. We all left on different days; we did not
all leave on the same day. We could certainly do more to make more of a
ceremony out of leaving school and going out into the

should say at the outset that I share the relief expressed today that
Michael Gove has belatedly been converted to the merits of citizenship
education. Not so long ago, it faced being sidelined to the margins of
the curriculum but, in another of his now famous U-turns, the latest
consultation has reinstated it as a compulsory element of key stages 3
and 4. That has been widely welcomed across the political
spectrum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T18:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>. While
talking about the political spectrum, I reassure the noble Lord, Lord
Storey, that a future Labour Government would, indeed, have a
curriculum that was applied to all
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000088">Since
the subject was made compulsory in 2002, it has become an established
part of the curriculum. I fear that we have slightly talked ourselves
into a rather pessimistic place. Like other noble Lords around the
Chamber I have visited many schools, and I have certainly seen
citizenship being taught in a very positive and optimistic way which
has even managed to enthuse young people about the House of Lords. We
have heard examples of that this afternoon. Young people are curious,
interested and want to learn. It is up to us to rise to that challenge
and to present the issues to them in a way that will be life changing
and life transforming when they go out into the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000089">Indeed,
a recent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T18:06:14"></hs_TimeCode>
University of Essex report which studied the impact on those exposed to
citizenship education found that it had a positive impact on their
civic engagement, democratic participation and political knowledge
compared with those who had not had that education. There is evidence
that citizenship education is compulsory and valued in all the
high-performing international comparators that are often quoted.
Therefore, I am very glad that Michael Gove has belatedly converted to
the cause. That puts behind us several years of uncertainty, and will,
I hope, allow the subject to flourish in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T18:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000090">How
can we raise the status and impact of the subject going forward? First,
it has to develop a reputation for quality and rigour. Every child
should study the subject at key stages 3 and 4 and be able to
demonstrate a range of skills and knowledge. However, the subject needs
to lose its reputation as a soft option for those who choose to sit it
at GCSE and A-level. There is nothing soft about learning about
political systems, law, rights and responsibilities. However, as the
noble Lord, Lord Norton, argued, the rigour that we are demanding
requires the training agency to ensure that teachers have the right
knowledge and resources to deliver an effective citizenship programme
in schools, and there are concerns that those resources are being cut.
Ofqual also has a responsibility to ensure that the 
<?notus-xml column=970?>qualification is on a par, and is seen to be on a par, with equivalent
subjects rather than being considered a soft option as it has been in
the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T18:08:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000091">Secondly,
for this subject in particular, the Government need to demonstrate that
they have engaged parents, teachers and young people in the development
of the programme of study, as we all have an interest in the outcome.
For example, the Government could do more to engage with the Youth
Select Committee, set up by the British Youth Council and supported by
the House of Commons, which is inquiring into whether the curriculum
prepares young people for life after school, particularly with regard
to political and cultural awareness, personal finance and life skills.
All the evidence shows that young people want to learn how to make
sense of the world and how to influence things that go on
around them. However, we have to face facts. At the same time, they
hold politicians in a fair degree of contempt, so it is in all our
interests to find common levels of understanding and create a little
more mutual respect. Therefore, perhaps the Minister could explain what
steps are being taken to listen to the views of young people before the
final programme of study is
agreed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000092">Thirdly,
we need to scrutinise the draft citizenship programme. We on these
Benches welcome the intention to include financial literacy and skills
in key stages 3 and 4. Although understanding individual financial
services, choices and risk might not seem an essential feature of
citizenship, they are crucial elements of being an active and
successful citizen. We also welcome the commitment to teaching young
people about the benefits and experience of volunteering. I agree with
the noble Lord, Lord Storey, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and
others that this should be set in the clear context of the wider social
and democratic involvement in schools and communities to make fully
rounded and active citizens. There should be new opportunities for
young people to participate in the National Citizen Service. Perhaps
the Minister could update us on what is being done to support this
initiative.</hs_para>

are also concerns that the draft citizenship programme focuses too much
on UK systems of government at the expense of a wider global
understanding. I agree with my noble friend Lord Parekh that our
multicultural heritage, combined with advanced media communications,
means that the next generation of young people will inevitably be
citizens of the world. Our young people need to be equipped with the
tools to respect other cultures, to value human rights issues and to
promote common international understanding. Perhaps the Minister can
enlighten us on whether the revised curriculum will embrace these
principles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T18:11:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062780000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-0003.htm#13062780000094">I
wanted to make a few other comments but I can see that my time is
running out. My final point is that the future of citizenship is much
more than what goes on in schools. I do not think that we should burden
the education system with all our society’s ills, but obviously
we have an important role to play. It is crucial that we stop the
flight of young people from our political institutions and engage with
them to design more robust and respected democratic systems for the
future. I hope that the new version of the curriculum will play its
part in doing that, and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has
to say in response.</hs_para>

important issue. I know he is committed to ensuring that young people
leave school as active and responsible citizens. I strongly agree with
my noble friend that young people need to be equipped with the
knowledge and skills to prepare them to play a full and active part in
society. This is why the Government intend to retain the statutory
status of citizenship in secondary schools as part of the review of the
national curriculum. The new draft citizenship programme of study
includes a requirement that all pupils should be given opportunities to
undertake voluntary work for the first time. I believe that that will
support one of our key aims, which is to ensure that our young people
are committed to volunteering and that they will take that with them
into adulthood. All good schools have an active programme of engaging
with voluntary organisations and charities, and we shall certainly be
encouraging all schools to do that. The Cabinet Office announced a new
campaign today, as the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, noted, to get young
people involved in social action. This is in addition to our youth

have revised the citizenship programmes of study to ensure that they
direct teaching towards the core knowledge of citizenship: namely,
teaching about the way our society is governed and its laws, including
those that protect human rights, rather than the more issues-based

programmes of study give teachers greater freedom to define what is
taught. However, they require teaching about laws, which my noble
friend Lord Phillips said is so important, about rights and
responsibilities and about the liberties enjoyed by citizens of the
United Kingdom. The new programmes of study are not just focused on the
UK; they provide opportunities for pupils to learn about other systems
and forms of government in other countries as well as our relations

Harrison:</Member></B> My Lords, Morocco is a country with which the UK
can do business. I visited it in January 2011 with the all-party
friendship group—a visit funded by our Moroccan
friends—and I hope that I developed a better understanding of it
than was evident elsewhere. It was of course at the time of the
incipient Arab spring, and I remember Wyre Davies, the BBC commentator,
saying that Morocco, along with the other countries in the Maghreb, was
going to be subject to great upheaval. For many years, Morocco has been
responding to the home-grown need to ensure that that does not
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:00:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

dispute that everyone knows about in terms of the western and southern
Sahara. I went to Laayoune, where I consulted with my
colleagues—not only the NGOs—and met the Saharis but,
most importantly, I met the UN peacekeepers at MINURSO. Speaking to
their head and deputy head, I was quite convinced that Morocco had not
played its cards right in ensuring an understanding about the November
2010 incident. This was where its own police had been mown down, but
not as many civilians had been slaughtered by the police as had been
claimed. The Moroccans have sometimes suffered from reporting in
London. There was film evidence of that incident and it should have
been conveyed

Minister, whom I am very pleased to see here today, what the Government

who does understand Morocco is the UK ambassador, Clive Alderton.
Speaking at the recent 800-year anniversary of England’s
diplomatic ties with Morocco, he talked about the importance of seeing
the bigger picture between our two countries. He, of course, worked
with and served Prince Charles before he became our ambassador. What
the two countries share is that we both have monarchies and are
maritime trading nations. Each country is perched on the north-western
edge of its continent and each boasts of being 
<?notus-xml column=270?>a regional hub: we with the United States, the European Union and the
Commonwealth; Morocco with Africa, the Maghreb, the Americas, the Gulf
and the European Union. Does the Minister envisage making an official
visit to Morocco? I think that she of all people would be the
appropriate person to visit on behalf of the United Kingdom, but
perhaps she could give a report of recent visits by the United Kingdom

also has a link with the European Union. It applied for membership as
far back as 1987, showing the forward-looking view that it has taken in
its relations with the European Union. It is now proposed that deeper
and more comprehensive ties with the EU should develop. Again, I ask
the Minister whether the UK will support that development and see an
ally in Morocco in terms of our working with the European Union over
the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:04:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

business in the area of tourism. We have some 50,000 Moroccans here in
the United Kingdom—some of them in the House of Lords—but
half a million tourists go there every year, and the intention is that
that should swell to 1 million by 2020. I know that an important role
is played by the British Council in Morocco in spreading the use of
English, which is so important for servicing tourists. Can the Minister
report on what budget we have to promote the British Council’s
work there? Tourism is a changing product: green tourism is an example,
as well as the wonderful big cities in Morocco.</hs_para>

countries might work together on the protection of historic monuments.
During my visit in early 2011 I got the sense that UK business was not
fully aware of the opportunities for business and trade. I am
particularly pleased to see the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, who can
perhaps correct me on that. However, the Moroccan economy is changing,
generating more added value: where it was fresh fruit, now we are
talking about food processing; where it was traditional dress that was
sold, now we are talking about ready- to-wear
clothing—pret-a-porter; and we are also talking about automotive
parts. Are we sensitive to these changes and new opportunities? We
recently had the first Morocco-British trade day. I believe it was a
success but can the Minister tell us of any tangible
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000010">The
UK is only the seventh trading partner of Morocco, way behind France
and Spain, according to the journalist Jonathan Fryer. Let us think
about some of those other opportunities coming along. These include the
new cities being created for Morocco, and Tangier with its free port on
the Mediterranean, which is going to be home to Renault and
Nissan’s new production facility, with 170,000 vehicles planned,
swelling to 400,000 in

we do business in the financial services sector? When I went there in

north Africa. A new agreement was reached between the Moroccan
Financial Board and City UK, which I

well as the phosphates and ammonia found in Algeria. If we could bring
together Morocco and Algeria, currently enemies, there would be
enormous business opportunities. Then there is renewable energy, where
the Moroccans are doing so much, and water management, telecoms,
aeronautics, and transport infrastructure. We drove down excellent
motorways; I understand that 150 kilometres a year are added to the

Sheikh:</Member></B> My Lords, at the outset I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Harrison, for arranging this debate. The United Kingdom and
Morocco enjoy a long and happy history—a heritage of which I
believe we should be proud. Earlier this month, the British Embassy in
Rabat celebrated the 800th anniversary of diplomatic relations between
our two countries, a point made earlier by the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison. In April this year the Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs
made his first official ministerial visit to London. An estimated half
a million British tourists travel to Morocco every year to take
advantage of its outstanding natural beauty and renowned hospitality.
This tourism helps maintain our relationship, and Morocco is
economically dependent on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000015">I believe
that the recent social revolutions across north Africa and the Middle
East, coupled with the economic turmoil across much of the western
world, present an opportunity to look again at our priorities. It is a
chance to refocus where we should be looking to build stronger bridges
for the future and dedicating more of our efforts.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:11:48"></hs_TimeCode> firmly believe
that Morocco should be one of the countries we should focus on, and
with good reason. Like some other countries in 
<?notus-xml column=272?>the Arab world, Morocco is engaging in fundamental democratic reforms.
While it remains essentially a kingdom, a new constitution was adopted
in July 2011 establishing a more democratic system of governance. A key
political change is that the majority party in Parliament, rather than
the King, now has the right to nominate the Prime Minister. Strong
human rights provisions were also included in the reforms, although I
appreciate they have had mixed
results.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000016">Last
September, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, Juan
Mendez, reported his findings following a visit to Morocco. He was
concerned at the continued use of cruel treatment by some security
forces on the ground and in prisons. However, he also noted that the
general situation regarding the practice of torture has improved and
that a culture of human rights, with a genuine political will, is
slowly emerging. Morocco has implemented a National Human Rights

UN convention against torture later this year. In recent years, further
rights have been granted to women and the King has also stated that
tackling unemployment and poverty are two of his main priorities.
Unemployment has shrunk significantly over the past decade and spending
on social programmes and subsidies have increased
substantially.</hs_para>

Foreign Secretary recently reaffirmed his support for the progress that
Morocco has been making towards implementing the new constitution,
particularly through the Arab partnership, with efforts to tackle
corruption and encourage political participation. I very much share
this sentiment and, on that note, I would be grateful if the Minister

Morocco through civil

relations with Morocco can be enhanced further by undertaking more
trade. As I have stated many times before in your Lordships’
House, one of the keys to building and advancing successful
relationships between countries is by having increased levels of trade.
Such trade allows for increased diversity and consistency of goods and
services, leading to the widening and opening up of markets. This in
turn nurtures cultural and technological exchange and helps bring
countries closer together, benefiting economies on both sides. Indeed,
2012 was a landmark year, as the bilateral trade between our two
countries passed £1 billion for the first time. Despite
suffering a setback, Morocco’s GDP growth rate in 2012 was 2.9%,
which is a respectable figure within the context of the global downturn
and higher than that of many western countries. It is also projected to
accelerate to an average of 4.8% over the next few years.</hs_para>

of economic achievements that have, unfortunately, gone unnoticed and
to which we should be paying much closer attention. Last year, it built
the largest port in the Mediterranean, Tanger-Med—again, this is
a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison<I>—</I>as a
strategic way of capitalising on its geographical position as a primary
gateway between Europe and Africa. It is also establishing itself as a
hub for international investors looking to get into Africa, with the
creation of Casablanca Finance City. Morocco also enjoys free trade
access to 55 different countries, representing more than 1 billion
consumers and 60% of the world’s GDP. Bearing all these points
in mind, it is no surprise that Ernst &amp; Young recently ranked
Morocco as the second most attractive African country for foreign
investors.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062757000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000021">I

Sharman:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, for introducing this debate and for giving me the opportunity
to make a few remarks about trade and business with Morocco. As your
Lordships will know, I was appointed the Prime Minister’s trade
envoy to Morocco at the end of last year, so in this debate it is
appropriate that I restrict my remarks to matters of trade. I will
leave the other aspects of the relationship to those who are much
better qualified to deal with them.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062757000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000023">From the point of view
of many parts of British business, the first thing they say when you
talk to them about Morocco is that it is too French and too risky, both
of which are fundamentally untrue. That is not the case; Morocco is
important to us as a market, as the previous speakers have said. It is
a market that we must be concerned with, and UKTI has reflected that.
It is one of only 14 markets in Africa where UKTI has a permanent
presence.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062757000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000024">In
my judgment, it is particularly important because if you accept the
proposition that Africa is likely to be the next great area for
generating global growth then, looked at from the perspective of Great
Britain Ltd, we have penetrated that area quite successfully in
anglophone Africa, largely through the southern states. However, the
phrase that I use is to say to people, “When you look at China,
you would not go into half of China”, and we have practically
ignored francophone West Africa. What Morocco gives us, particularly
with the structures in place there through Casablanca Finance City, is
the opportunity to use that as a hub and penetrate francophone West
Africa through it. Interestingly, I was visiting a vegetable-growing
operation down there a few weeks ago which, your Lordships might be
surprised to know, farms 8,000 acres of vegetables in Senegal but it is
done via
Morocco<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:20:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000025">I
hope I have made the point that it is strategically important for
business. I would like to talk a little bit about the Morocco/British
Business Council which has rather fallen into abeyance but I am working
on it. It has not met for some time and, when I was in Morocco in
March, I met Mostafa Terrab, the Chief Executive of OCP, the large
phosphates business. He 
<?notus-xml column=274?>and I will co-chair a new initiative in that area, probably with a
different title. It will be much more restrictive in its ambitions but
these will be readily achievable. I am working on that at the moment
and hope we can launch it in September or October this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000026">I
have decided to concentrate most of my efforts as trade envoy on a
limited number of industrial sectors. This is because one cannot do
everything and I would sooner try to do a number of things well than a
lot of things badly. The first sector I am concentrating on is
financial services, to which other noble Lords have already referred.
The CFC project in Casablanca is very interesting and impressive. Noble
Lords will not know that I was financial adviser to the London
Docklands Development Corporation when Canary Wharf came into being. I
was also the financial adviser to the Irish Government in the creation
of the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin. I would
describe CFC as a combination of the two. It has a very attractive
package of incentives on offer and a huge, fantastic site. When it gets
going it will be a key place in north Africa through which to access
the rest of francophone
Africa<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:22:12"></hs_TimeCode>. The
stock exchanges in London and Casablanca are talking to each other
about a project to work together. We are also looking to see if we can
get an insurance centre established there, linking in to the London
insurance
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:22:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which may sound a bit surprising, is higher education. I acknowledge
the work of the British Council in Morocco in this area and, in
particular, the work done by Martin Rose, its director there. There are
a large number of co-operative agreements between British universities
and Moroccan universities being developed. These have moved in recent
years away from the old focus on the humanities and more towards
science and technology. We are in the preliminary stages of discussions
on the establishment of a campus of a British university in Morocco and
also a British-based business school which will, I hope, be within
Casablanca Finance

been said earlier, the thirst for English language skills is prevalent
wherever you go in Morocco today. The thirst for English-based
secondary school education is there as well and there are ongoing
discussions about the establishment of a leading, independent British
secondary school in Morocco. This is important because it fuels the
relationship that then builds
trade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:24:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000029">The
third area I am looking at is energy, but only in the sense that
Morocco, like many other north African countries, does not have a lot
of hydrocarbons knocking around the place. They are not self-sufficient
in energy and are looking at importing liquefied natural gas. The areas
of renewables, particularly energy from waste such as tapping methane
from groundfill or anaerobic digesters based on vegetable and food
waste, are ones where Britain has the technology to participate, and we
will be having discussions on them. The second area of renewables,
which is at an early stage but has great potential, is wave
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:25:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about agribusiness. It is not that I do not think it is important but
it is taking care of itself quite well at the moment. However, we can
put focus on that. On tourism, developments need 
<?notus-xml column=275?>to look further than only tourism and should include event management,

particularly in relation to the agriculture side. I invite the Minister

the common agricultural policy. I shall later say a few words on the

one doubts that, like other countries in the Arab world, Morocco faces
huge challenges—massive illiteracy, at 44%, and fast-growing
youth and graduate unemployment. I pose the intriguing question: given
this background, why has there been no Arab spring or Arab uprising in
Morocco? Why is Morocco apparently largely exempt from the turbulence
of most of the other Arab countries? I observe that, broadly, the
monarchies have largely avoided such troubles. His Majesty King
Mohammed VI is a force for stability and has had the political wisdom
to ensure political evolution in the direction of a constitutional
monarchy and an intent to ensure that moderate Islamic forces are kept
within the tent. It helps, of course, that he is a direct descendant of
the
Prophet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:27:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000035">Externally,
Morocco is conscious of its role as a bridge between the north and the
south of the Mediterranean. One speaks of l’exception Marocaine,
which arises from its geography and history and a self-confident view
of its own role—the positive role it has played in Syria and the
moderating role it has played in Israel/Palestine. As to the Barcelona
process of 1995, the Union for the Mediterranean, Morocco has tried to
build a regional impetus but this has been hampered by the west Sahrawi
question. I have visited both the Laayoune and Tindouf and seen the
position at first hand. In my judgment, ultimately the Moroccan offer
of a substantial autonomy will be the end. That will allow a much
greater regional link between the north and south of the
Mediterranean<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:29:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000036">Morocco
is the pioneer of linking with western European organisations, NATO and
the Council of Europe—I am a member of the assembly—which
concentrates on strengthening democratic institutions 
<?notus-xml column=276?>and the rule of law. Of course, there are problems: the need to reform
the judiciary and fight corruption; money laundering; media freedom;
the position of women; and child labour. However, by and large Morocco
has played a very positive role. In 2009 the Council of Europe Assembly
created a new status of Partner for Democracy, and Morocco was the
first country to enjoy that status of all the neighbours of the Council
of Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000037">In
March I was in Rabat as part of a monitoring process, and this week the
Assembly will debate the two-year monitoring process of that new
status. The school report, which is being debated this week, is mainly
positive, describing what the rapporteur calls a “promising
start”. The Venice Commission has recognised the quality of the
new constitution. The king called on the winning party in the general
election to form the Government, and Morocco has acceded to many
Council of Europe conventions. There is indeed a new
dynamic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000038">Finally,
I would like to say a word about our bilateral cultural relations,
which have largely been covered by the noble Lord, Lord Sharman. We
have tried to identify areas of mutual interest. The tradition is of
course francophone, but Morocco recognises that English is the language
of employability and of research. Euromonitor found there to be a 12%
wage premium for anglophone Moroccans. The British Council does
remarkable work on the language side, with two language schools in
Morocco and a flourishing examination bureau. Programmes include youth
employability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000039">There
has been an emphasis on English teaching, both at school level and at
higher education level. In passing, let me say that I hope that the
Moroccan diaspora in the UK—including graduates, many of whom
wish to keep links with Morocco—may be used by our country for
English language teaching, both in schools and as assistants in
Moroccan universities. The emphasis has been on language, governance
and link-building. There are research agreements and, as the noble Lord
said, bilateral university agreements, and an excellent arts programme
in design, digital arts, music and
film.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000040">Overall,
there are very constructive links in this field. Of course, French
predominates because of the country’s history. Our overall aim
is not in any way to replace French—that would be impossible in
any event—but to respond to the Moroccan wish to diversify, and
to encourage and support the wish to diversify in a collaborative way.
Thus the wide education, commercial, scientific and cultural
opportunities offered by the globalised anglophone sphere will be made
available to Morocco. It is an ambitious programme for a very special
and friendly country. I congratulate my noble friend on procuring this
opportunity to discuss our bilateral
relations.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/27C7219F6C371CE16C0965182319F5F985FF3D3D" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

Chidgey:</Member></B> My Lords, of course we have to congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, on securing this debate at a very timely
moment, coming as it does in the year in which we celebrate 800 years
of diplomatic relations with Morocco. I have had the good fortune to
visit Morocco on a number of occasions, including as one of the 500,000
tourists that people refer to. I 
<?notus-xml column=277?>once crossed the Strait of Gibraltar into the historic free port of
Tangier and spent time in the ancient diplomatic quarter, which is
traditionally engaged in all sorts of goings-on that I shall just call
“trade” and “politics”. As a key point of
entry into Africa from Europe, it is a hugely important
route.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000042">I had
the pleasure of staying in the riads in Marrakesh, close to Jemaa
el-Fna, the huge square at the heart of the city. It is bursting with
all sorts of activities that you will not find anywhere else in the
world, even down to the guy selling second-hand sets of false teeth,
displayed in neat rows on a huge tray in the middle of the square. It
is an amazing sight. Of course, by contrast down on the coast there is
Essaouira, a perfect example of an 18th-century fortified town,
complete with the original cannons still in place on the ramparts. The
town is characterised by strong, persistent winds coming off the
Atlantic, making its miles of beaches the world capital for kite
surfing and wind surfing, as well as the site of an internationally
acclaimed music festival. The amount of different cultural activities
within Morocco is quite amazing. Given the opportunity, Morocco is a

themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000043">However,
we are celebrating the 800th anniversary of UK-Moroccan diplomatic
relationships and recalling the dispatch by King John of
England—we were not the UK at that stage—in 1213 of the
first diplomatic mission to make contact with the court of Sultan
Mohamed Ennassir. King John, we are told, sought support for our
conflicts in Europe—there is nothing much new there by the sound
of it. There are close and ancient ties between our two countries as
monarchies. Here there is an intriguing historical
aspect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000044">As we
in this House know only too well, just two years after his approach to
Sultan Mohamed Ennassir in Morocco, King John was forced by the Barons
of England to sign the Magna Carta, or the Great Charter of the
Liberties of England. As we know, Magna Carta made chequered progress
over the ensuing years, being sometimes rescinded, sometimes
reinstated, with bits deleted, added and altered. Nevertheless, it was
an important part of an extensive historical process that led to the
rule of constitutional law in the English-speaking world. It is
generally considered part of the uncodified constitution of England.

learning process for me. It has been very good to learn about all the
positive things that are happening in the relationship between our two
countries. I am especially glad that the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, is

know that in April the Foreign Secretary hosted a high-level lunch for
a Moroccan delegation. It is good that, at that level, we are making a
positive and very strong relationship with Morocco. I understand that 
<?notus-xml column=279?>we are also helping to train Moroccan journalists, strengthening

noble Lords have mentioned the European Union and the fact that it is
working with Morocco. I am glad that the United Kingdom is working as
part of the EU on development projects and business and educational
projects with Morocco. I think that negotiations have begun, or are
about to begin, on a free trade agreement between the EU and Morocco,
and I would certainly welcome some information from the Minister on
that. Given that Morocco is the gateway between Europe and north
Africa, it is essential, as noble Lords have said, that we have a very
strong relationship between the European Union and
Morocco.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000052">I
hope that the European Union will also be able to do something to
assist Morocco with the problem that it has, and we all have, in
relation to youth unemployment. Various noble Lords mentioned the Arab
spring, and there was a sort of Arab spring in Morocco. As the noble
Lord, Lord Chidgey, said, it fast-tracked constitutional change. We
must pay tribute to the political parties in Morocco for the fact that
it was a peaceful Arab spring and has led to positive developments. The
fact that there was an Arab spring probably arose largely because of
the frustration of young people and the fact that the country was not
meeting economic needs—and the fact that there are so many young
unemployed people in the rest of the Arab
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000053">Many
noble Lords have spoken about the desire for links between British
universities and those in Morocco, which is terrific. Clearly, the
British Council, as ever, is doing a very good job. The premium that
employers put on English in Morocco is tremendous and there is
obviously much work to be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000054">I had a
conversation with my honourable friend Ian Lucas MP, who visited
Morocco in March 2012. He was deeply impressed by the infrastructure
and the development of renewable energies. The noble Lord, Lord
Sharman, mentioned lots of renewable energies, but he did not mention
solar energy. There must be an awful lot of sunshine in Morocco and I

power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000055">One
challenge that Morocco faces is with human rights. In May, the Moroccan
Association of Human Rights stated that, since the adoption of a more
democratic constitution during the Arab spring, which is welcome,
arrests of political activists have increased. I know that Morocco is
attempting to improve its human rights record by ratifying UN
conventions on torture, discrimination against women and
children’s rights. It has also appointed its first Minister for
Human Rights. However, criticism of Islam, the monarchy or
Morocco’s presence in Western Sahara is still not tolerated, so
there is work to be done. I am sure that our Government are doing
whatever they can to support Morocco as it strives to improve its human
rights
record.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000056">That
leads me to the problem in Western Sahara with the Polisario. I know
that Christopher Ross, who was appointed in January 2009 as a UN
special envoy, 
<?notus-xml column=280?>recently described the present situation as “untenable”
and called for negotiations without preconditions and in good faith to
find a mutually acceptable and lasting solution that would lead to
self-determination for the Sahrawi people. It cannot be right that so
many people are still living in camps in Western Sahara. There has to
be a solution. It also has wider implications for the wider Maghreb,
because it affects Morocco’s relationships with Algeria and the
trade between those
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000057">The
position of women has also been mentioned. We are doing some work on
the empowerment of women because, as many noble Lords have said, women

end on a positive note. We have a shared aspiration with Morocco for a
secure, peaceful and prosperous north Africa in which Morocco has a
large part to play. One of those parts relates to the creative
industries, which have huge potential in Morocco. I was delighted to
read that there will be a Marrakesh film festival in November. I did
not know about it, and I think that it is really great that things such
as that are happening. I end on that positive note. I am very glad that
our Government are doing what they can to foster a better relationship,

Harrison, for calling this debate. Morocco is a nation with which we
have a strong and enduring relationship. Indeed, as many noble Lords
have mentioned, this year marked the 800th anniversary of the founding
of UK-Moroccan diplomatic relations. We have heard about the first
diplomat who was dispatched by King John to petition support from
Sultan Muhammad Ennassir against our then rivals for dominance in
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062757000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062757000060">That
first mission laid the foundation for the relationship that continues
to this day, exemplified  by the visit in 2011 of the Prince of
Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall to Morocco as personal guests of King
Mohammed VI. Those historical ties have allowed a frank and open
dialogue to flourish with the Moroccans—with both His Royal

was clearly demonstrated a little over two months ago, when my right
honourable friend the Foreign Secretary hosted a high-level Moroccan
government delegation on a visit to London to discuss a range of issues
from foreign and security policy through to human rights. The
delegation was headed by the King’s principal adviser and
included the Foreign Minister, Al-Othmani, in April this year. Some
noble Lords asked what further visits have taken place. In 2011, the
Foreign Secretary visited Morocco. In 2012, Minister Burt visited
Morocco. In 2013, as well as the

commitment to freedom of religion and belief within Morocco. He gave me
strong support for building a political coalition from different
nations across the world on this specific area. The seminar also

freedom of the press was raised by a number of noble Lords. We have
ambitious and far-reaching reform programmes and we have already seen
them happening in Morocco. We are working alongside those programmes as
part of the Arab Partnership initiative. Noble Lords will acknowledge
that this can sometimes be a difficult and sensitive issue, but
Morocco’s record on this is much improved. However, there remain
some challenges, particularly where the interests of the monarchy or
the security services are involved. A free, independent media are, as

“emerging culture” of human rights and the
political will to improve things further. That is

Morocco and includes mention of a systematic pattern of ill treatment.

popularity of the British Council’s LearnEnglish website, which
last year had more than 1 million hits. That bastion of

almost every rural dwelling in some parts of Morocco seems to have a

whether there is potential for expansion there as

Negotiations for a deep and comprehensive free trade area between the

currently taking place in Brussels. The main objective of those
negotiations is to bring Moroccan legislation closer to EU legislation
in trade-related areas and proceed to the gradual integration of
Morocco’s economy into the EU single market. Morocco is the
first European neighbourhood country to have begun this process with
the EU and we welcome its positive attitude to the negotiations so

noble friend Lord Sheikh asked about Morocco’s role in promoting
and contributing to regional stability. I think that I have previously
referred to the Friends of Syria conference which it hosted in December
2012; an increased level of contact that it has had with other
countries in the Maghreb when there has been instability there; and, of
course, it took over the chairmanship of the UN Counter-Terrorism
Committee in January 2013. The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, referred to
other contributions as well. Noble Lords also asked about support
programmes. I have referred to some of them already, such as the Arab
Partnership programmes which look at fostering political
parties’ place in civil society, more involvement of youth and
women, and building journalistic capacity to

the UK strongly supports the process of transformation, institutional
change, and constitutional reform that is already under way in Morocco.
Although there are areas, such as Western Sahara where we will continue
to press for progress, our relationship with Morocco is based on shared
values—demonstrating, 
<?notus-xml column=284?>once and for all, that values of democracy, rule of law, human rights,
freedom of expression and the right to a job and a vote transcend the
boundaries of religion. Morocco’s move towards a constitutional
democracy will lay the solid foundations needed for it to build greater
security and prosperity. The UK continues to stand ready to assist in
any way that it

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, it is now more than two years
since the then Secretary of State for Health my right honourable friend
Andrew Lansley, local government and the leaders of a number of
industries came together in March 2011 to agree the public health
responsibility deal. There is no doubt that as a country we face
significant public health challenges. Working age ill health is
estimated to cost the UK economy more than £100 billion a year.
England has among the highest levels of adult obesity in Europe. We
have more than 8,000 what might be described as premature deaths every
year from too much salt in our food. Alcohol misuse costs the NHS
£3.5 billion a year. Physical inactivity costs it
£1 billion a year and the costs to the wider economy
from sickness absence have been estimated at around
£5.5 billion.</hs_para>

voluntary action to ensure

legislation. There are those who are sceptical about this kind of
action. A recent paper in the <I>Lancet</I> by Professor Rob Moodie of
the University of Melbourne concluded that the only way to achieve the
UN’s goal of halving the mortality rate for diseases caused by
tobacco, alcohol and poor diet was through greater regulation. Likewise
<I>Which?</I> is sceptical. Its executive director, Richard Lloyd, last
year speaking about the responsibility deal,
said:</hs_parafo><hs_quotefo UID="13062764000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000003">“We
have the worst obesity rates in Europe and diet-related diseases, like
heart disease and stroke, are blighting the public’s health. Our
audit of progress made under the Government’s Responsibility
Deal has shown the current approach is overly reliant on vague
voluntary promises by the food industry. This has so far failed to
bring about change on anything like the scale
needed”.</hs_quotefo>

oppose the exploration of innovative techniques such as
‘nudging’, where it can be shown, following proper
evaluation, 
<?notus-xml column=285?>to be an effective way of delivering policy objectives. The Committee
were, however, unconvinced that the new Responsibility Deal will be
effective in resolving issues such as obesity and alcohol abuse and
expect the Department of Health to set out clearly how progress will be
monitored and tougher regulation applied if
necessary”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13062764000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000006">Clearly,
issues of physical activity, alcohol misuse and obesity have to be
tackled in a variety of ways but I know I am not alone in preferring to
see voluntary action initially rather than increased regulation unless
the former is shown to have failed. It is far too purist a line to say
that industry should not be involved in public health initiatives. In
the responsibility deal, different sectors made particular pledges for
action, regarding food and diet, alcohol, physical activity and health
at work. The essence of the deal was acceptance by signatories of the
role they play in improving people’s
health—encouraging them to adopt a healthier diet, fostering a
culture of responsible drinking, encouraging and assisting them to
become more physically active and actively supporting their workforce
to lead healthier lives. The organisations involved made a series of
collective pledges by sector, individual pledges by organisation, and
also what were called supporting pledges, regarding collaboration,
monitoring and evaluation, information and development of further
pledges.</hs_para>

aspects of the deal as important but, given the time available, I want
to focus on two limbs of the deal, relating to food and alcohol. The
initial collective pledges by the food industry involved, for example,
salt reduction, front-of-pack nutrition labelling, artificial trans
fats removal and calorie reduction. One of the recent fruits of the
responsibility deal has been the new voluntary UK traffic light scheme
for front-of-pack nutrition labelling, which was launched on 19 June
this year. This will introduce more consistent nutrition labelling
across the UK by providing, on the front of food and drink products,
clear information on energy and those nutrients of public health
concern that the majority of us should be aiming to limit in our diets.
Then of course there are the steps towards calorie reduction by the
food and soft drink manufacturers, and the significant actual and
planned reduction of salt in food, in supermarket products and
catering.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062764000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000008">For
the alcohol industry, including manufacturers and the on and
off-trades, the pledges involved: fostering a culture of responsible
drinking; a reduction in alcohol units to remove 1 billion units from
the market; a commitment to labels with clear unit content; awareness
of alcohol units in the on and off-trades; tackling alcohol sales to
those who are underage; action on advertising and marketing alcohol;
community action to tackle alcohol harm, and support for Drinkaware.
This partly depends on having clear, common understanding of the facts
but these are not always straightforward. There are many conflicting
statistics and it is not always easy to draw
conclusions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000009">There
are many different perspectives on current trends. It appears that
national alcohol consumption trends are going in the right direction.
Nationally, per capita consumption has fallen from 11.5 to 10 litres of
alcohol per person per year, and is now below the European national
average. More people drink within the guidelines. There is less
drinking at harmful levels 
<?notus-xml column=286?>and binge drinking is down. There is less alcohol-related violent crime,
and there has been a very significant drop in drink-driving fatalities
over the past 20 years. All these statements are derived from official
figures. However, hospital admissions are up, whether this is taken as
those where alcohol is the primary diagnosis or those which are simply
alcohol-related.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000010">There
are anomalies in respect of particular age groups and localities, even
where the national picture shows improvement. Areas such as the
north-west and the north-east have a disproportionate amount of binge
drinking and hospital admissions, due to alcohol-related causes.
Supporting Drinkaware, an independent organisation, is one of the key
pledges given by the drinks industry. Drinkaware works with young
adults to moderate drinking through the “Why let good times go
bad?” campaign. It also helps parents tackle alcohol issues with
their children. It has recently published an audit of effectiveness
which demonstrates the progress it is making, and that its work is
being increasingly recognised. Drinkaware says that binge drinking
remains a social norm in many areas. We are, it seems, fighting a huge
cultural battle so pledges are fine but translation into local action
is key. There is clearly a need to target appropriate schemes at
particular areas. The drinks industry tells me that it is working with
local partners including local authorities, police and the third sector
to do this.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062764000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000011">There is in fact an
impressive array of voluntary schemes. During the passage of the Police
Reform and Social Responsibility Bill in July 2011, and in the debate
initiated last year by the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, I talked of
the virtues of local voluntary actions designed to combat alcohol
abuse. These are through schemes such as Purple Flag, Best Bar None,
Pubwatch, business improvement districts and community alcohol
partnerships, with central government working with the
industry—both the on and off-trades and the
manufacturers—and the advantage of those schemes over those
imposed in a compulsory way, such as the early-morning restriction
orders and the late-night levy. There is of course Challenge 21 and
Challenge 25, a strategy that encourages anyone buying
alcohol who looks under 25 to carry acceptable ID. There is also PASS,
the nationally recognised Proof of Age Standards Scheme. It would be
very interesting to know what evaluation has been done for these
individual schemes, since each clearly has different objectives and
outcomes. I am pleased that licensing authorities will have discretion
to offer a discount from the late-night levy up to a maximum of 30% for
premises that are part of—or members of—best practice
schemes, subject to specific criteria.</hs_para>

development is the revised version of the Portman Group’s
<I>Code of Practice on the Naming, Packaging and Promotion of Alcoholic
Drinks</I>. The new version of the code now specifically states that
there should be no linkage to sexual activity, no images of under 25s,
and easier promotion of lower strength products. Furthermore, progress
on alcohol unit reduction is well under way towards the goal of 1
billion fewer units consumed. The strength of well known brands has
been reduced, and new lower-alcohol alternatives have been
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

key questions that the PIRU is being asked to consider are: does the
responsibility deal as a mechanism work? Can voluntary pledges achieve
the necessary change? Are the pledges themselves amenable to
evaluation? In fact, can any cause and effect ever be evaluated? Yet
the unit itself believes that the most useful questions at this stage
of the development of the responsibility deal are about what it is; its
objectives; how it is expected to work; how it can be assessed; and how
will we know whether it works—in particular, what further steps
are needed. I wonder what we can really expect from the PIRU study at

also wait with great interest to hear how the noble Earl responds to
this debate and to the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones. I, too, have a fair number of questions for him. Noble
Lords will recall that, when the public health responsibility deal was
launched by Andrew Lansley in 2011, he made much of its benefits
accruing through public health, commercial and voluntary organisations
working in partnership to agree practical actions to secure more
progress more quickly and with less cost than would have been the case
with legislation. He emphasised that the strength of the deal lay in
the diversity of organisations that it brings together. In the event,
those aspirations of bringing several groups together were not met, and
fairly early on we saw some of the major players depart from the
scene<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:13:46"></hs_TimeCode> would
concede—and I would not be churlish enough to fail to
say—that a number of developments have taken place since the
scheme was introduced. Like the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, I am
very pleased to see the recently announced front-of-pack nutrition
traffic lights labelling scheme coming in. That is good progress, but
it has taken us years to get to that position. When it was left to the
voluntary approach by industry, there were mainly two separate schemes,
and they were unable to bring them together to work. We now have people
coming together but, regrettably, it is anticipated that 20% will still
not comply, even with the voluntary scheme. What will happen in those
circumstances, given the consequences that we encounter when we come to
deal with health issues, which I shall address
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:14:12"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000020">It
is because of the response that we have had and because the health
industry generally, and some of the NGOs, were so unhappy about the way
in which they felt that the Government would be influenced by the
drinks industry that they wanted to pull away from participating in the
scheme overall. In reviewing where it should go in future, I believe
that it will be fundamental to assess whether it really has validity if
we cannot take the health industry with us. I should like to hear from
the Minister what he intends to do about that when we come to the end

Royal College of Surgeons and the BMA are the people who are dealing,
on a daily basis, with the three major preventable killer diseases that
confront us: smoking, alcohol and obesity. As recently as 5
March, their position has been supported by no less than Jeremy Hunt,
the Secretary of State for Health, who advises us, following a major
study, that Britain is now falling behind many western countries in
progress on managing preventable disease. The Secretary of State went
on to say that the UK needs a “call to action”, although
he did not define precisely what that call to action would be. We all
recognise that there is no simple silver bullet that will answer these
problems, but there is a multitude of approaches that could be taken. I
hope that today the noble Earl will give us an indication of where the
Government stand on their approach to those three major topics and on
trying to bring them together so that we can start to recover some of
the ground which, according to the Secretary of State, we are now

this context, I know that the Policy Innovation Research Unit of the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has undertaken its
scoping review. Will it be engaged to do further work and, if so, what
terms of reference will it be given and to what extent will there be
consultation among the wider health community, as well as the
commercial side, on this further work? I also notice that Drinkaware
has recently undertaken a review and audit of its work and that it has
identified some quite significant deficiencies in its operations.
Questions have been raised about the adequacy of the evidence base used
for its campaigning work. Questions have also been asked about its
independence. Again, it works too much in isolation and at too great a
distance from the NGOs and the health profession. I know that
consultations will be taking place over a

Government’s strategy on alcohol has been predicated primarily
on minimum unit pricing. Under my Government, the balance on alcohol
licensing moved towards being in favour of the industry and recent
legislation has shifted the fulcrum more to the centre, giving local
democracy and local interests against commercialism a better stand.
However, I was surprised to learn from the debate in the House of
Commons last week that the Government have been contemplating
abandoning the time-old tradition of requiring people applying for
alcohol licences to publish their applications in local newspapers.
There is strong opposition to this in the Commons and I hope that the
Government will not proceed with it, as it flies in the face of
localism and the chance to try to control what happens within your
locality. Again, I should be grateful for the noble Earl’s

little point that I have been campaigning on for years about including
the number of calories in the labelling of alcohol products. We have
been running this for about three years and we seem to be no further
forward. Is there any chance of an indication that some headway is
being

last point does not relate directly to the responsibility deal, because
much of the industry does not accept that it is responsible for the
harm that alcohol causes. Will the Government give some thought to the
concept that a new funding stream for the NHS could be drawn from the
private sector to help to meet the cost of the harms which arise from
alcohol and tobacco and particularly from the growth of obesity through
fats, sugars and salt? We know the problems that the NHS will face in
the future, although very little concern was expressed about its
funding by the Chancellor yesterday. However, as all parties know, with
the ageing population, changing lifestyles and the continuing growth in
the cost of technology and drugs, the health service will be in real
difficulties in the future. We need new funding streams and we might
explore whether the private sector, which has responsibility for some
of the harm, should be required to pay for it if it does not respond on
a voluntary basis.</hs_para>

for initiating this debate. There are more demands on the health
systems than there are resources to deal with them

growing problem is the increase in the number of people with diabetes.
Prevention, if possible, is vital. Screening for bowel cancer and other

I remember as a child attending a Church of Scotland service: the
minister was thumping the pulpit and shouting out the dangers of
alcohol. Are our messages today strong enough? Should we not have more
health education in schools, with clear messages about what alcohol can
do to the pupils’ bodies and minds? Alcohol can be a
contributory factor in the increase in sexually transmitted diseases,
when inhibitions go out of the window and people forget to take

Addington:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble friend
on bringing this subject before us today. Any initiative by people who
take responsibility for public health should be applauded. Whether this
is the right model or one for the future remains to be seen. However,
trying to get several sectors to address the problem must be applauded
for the simple reason that there is no one
answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:26:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000036">Behaviour,
social change and the way we take in information and use it would seem
to be the underlying message behind this. We have already heard that if
you drink too much you put on weight and it affects your body in
various ways; and that if you drink far too much at the wrong time you
behave badly. Given the history of Gin Lane, Hogarth and so on, that is
hardly news; it is nothing that we have not heard before.</hs_para>

we have been dealing with the backlash of the social trend towards
binge drinking.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:26:59"></hs_TimeCode> has
happened after the binge of taking pills to get oneself out of it. This
habit seems to have died out in certain parts of the country but not in
others, and people who have got into the habit of binge drinking seem
to be carrying on doing so. People are suffering from liver damage
earlier, getting stroppier earlier and losing control
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:27:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
that our lifestyle today is one which has easy access to high fat, high
salt and high sugar foods which can be consumed easily, and the fact
that we do not take much exercise, we seems to be creating a world
where it is quite easy to sit still for long periods of time, ingest
huge numbers of calories and alcohol and damage ourselves.</hs_para>

do we change that? There are two prongs to this which have worked in
the past, of which smoking is a good example. First, you point out to
people that it is damaging them; secondly, you take various supporting
actions, through government, to encourage them to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:28:14"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
voluntary action is equally important. Every bit of information I have
on this subject shows that we do not like being preached at. Talking to
people may help them to change their minds over time, or preaching to
people subtly and well may do so, but we are all politicians and we
know how often we get that right and how often we get it wrong. We have
got to strike a balance here.</hs_para>

agree with the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, about the number of times we
have heard about the labelling on food. I have had a number of bizarre
meetings, particularly at party conferences, where people have tried to
sell their form of labelling to
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:28:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000040">We
also resist certain types of activity. I remember during a conference
when the previous Government were in power—I think we were in
Blackpool but I cannot remember which year—going to a dinner
where people were trying to convince me that if we stopped selling what
we now call full-fat Coke and other soft drinks in vending machines,
children would die in huge numbers because they would cross the roads
at lunchtime and, lemming-like, be flattened by cars. You could not
make it up. You do not have to after a period of time. The rearguard
action by the industries is usually very impressive and creative, but
it is possibly one that missed. While we are talking about alcohol, 
<?notus-xml column=292?>by the third glass of wine I was prepared to say that they had missed on
this occasion. Let us not knock everything all the
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000041">To
address the issue of physical activity, the same ideas about what is
involved in convincing people that exercise is pleasant must surely
apply here. There is also the question of who we are addressing. I
shall concentrate my remarks here on people taking low-level, casual
exercise. Local government can make our parks and pavements, for
instance, pleasant places to walk or take moderate exercise, as
appropriate. People can encourage their children to have a game of
football using two jumpers on the ground for goalposts while they use
the swing. That is very appropriate. I look forward to hearing how we
can encourage
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000042">Organised
sports clubs can only be a limited aspect of this, because they are
often dependent upon this type of activity. We talk a lot about school
sport, but school sport can only do so much. A child must take part in
physical education and become reasonably fit before they can be trained
to take part in a sport and take it seriously. If a child who at the
age of five has never moved, who has been plonked in front of the TV
and who is carrying large amounts of fat around their waist and
backside, is encouraged to go straight into some form of physical
activity, the child will not do it. It will be painful and
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000043">If
parents do not have access to a pleasant environment, and are not
encouraged to give their child the normal amount of time in which to
run around, it will not happen. We must address this. If a child or an
adult then thinks that it is terribly difficult to undertake activity,
they will chose sedentary leisure activities, which often involve
watching something. They will take that hit of sugar and salt from fast
foods, as we probably call them now, or high-density foods. How do we
balance this? How do we encourage people to get
out?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000044">I
received a series of briefings from the Ramblers Association, saying
that people are 72% more likely to walk and to carry on walking if
their local area is pleasant, but they are 55% less likely to walk if
their local area is unpleasant. If you get that balance right and make
walking enjoyable, then people can get involved in it. What action and
assessment are we taking to encourage individuals and groups to make
sure that physical activity can be undertaken in a pleasant
environment? Unless this casual organisation is encouraged, unless it
takes into account the fact of this normal reaction, then it takes away
from both the introductory levels of more serious exercise and that
low-level maintenance which is so important to health. I could go on
for much longer, but the clock has beaten
me.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13062764000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000146">2.32

Coussins:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to make one general point
about the role of the private sector, and then some specific points
about the alcohol element of the responsibility deal. First, I declare
various interests. I am an independent adviser on corporate
responsibility for two drinks producers, Heineken and Brown-Forman, and
one food company, Mars. Details are in the register of interests. I
emphasise that my 
<?notus-xml column=293?>advice to them is strictly non-parliamentary, and that I had no
discussions with any of those companies about what I am going to say
this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000046">On
the general point, food and drink companies often get it in the neck
for engaging in the public health arena. They are criticised by cynics
who simply cannot believe that companies can possibly be sincere, and
think they are really doing no more than watching out for their own
commercial interests. The Government are also criticised for letting
the industry off the hook with voluntary
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000047">However,
I argue that this kind of partnership is no soft option for the
industry. As long as outcomes are rigorously monitored and achieve the
desired results, it can be extremely effective. The first reason for
this is the very high level of public scrutiny. The companies openly
sign up to detailed, challenging pledges, and they will look insincere
and incompetent if they do not fulfil them. Secondly, the pledges are
crafted in an inclusive way involving Government, health professionals
and the industry, so the outcomes are much more sustainable because
they are supported by industry from the beginning. Thirdly, of course
the responsibility deal is in the commercial interests of the industry.
There is a strong business case for companies to help minimise the
harms associated with their products. The consequences of
overconsumption damage brand image as well as body image. They give the
company a bad reputation and undermine shareholder value. It is a good
thing that the industry has recognised this. Its businesses would not
be sustainable
otherwise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000048">This
deal puts the UK streets ahead of our EU partners by showing not just
what can be achieved on a voluntary basis rather than through red tape
but also how quickly. The pledge on alcohol labelling, for example,
will see 80% of drinks labelled with a variety of health-related
information and is well on target to be achieved by the end of this
year. Mandatory labelling would almost certainly require EU legislation
and take years. Another pledge, as we heard, is to take 1
billion units of alcohol out of the market by 2015 by reformulating
existing brands to contain less alcohol and by innovating to bring new,
lower-strength brands on to the market, helping more people to drink
within the guidelines by providing a wider choice of lower-alcohol
products. This has become a real growth area, with dozens of new
products coming on to the market. Sales of lower-strength beer have
grown by 59%, according to HMRC
data.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000049">A third
pledge is to provide more support for local community schemes such as
Best Bar None and community alcohol partnerships. That is vital because
alcohol harms in the UK vary hugely across different regions. For
example, we know that nationally the vast majority of adults drink
within the government guidelines and that per capita consumption and
binge drinking have fallen. But we also know that alcohol-specific
mortality and liver disease in Blackpool is nearly three times the
national average, hospital admissions in Liverpool nearly 2.5 times the
national average and binge drinking in north Tyneside 1.5 times the
national average. One reason these community schemes work is because
they offer a win-win outcome. In Durham  
<?notus-xml column=294?>there has been a 75% increase in trade in pubs that support the Best Bar
None scheme because it obviously makes the pubs
safer and more attractive places to go. At the same
time, figures suggest an 87% decrease in violent crime. There are now
more than 50 community alcohol partnerships up and running and some
have seen significant reductions in antisocial
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000050">Producers
have also committed continued support to Drinkaware by not only paying
their dues but also using their brand marketing to promote the
charity’s campaigns. During the 2012 FA Cup, for example, more
than 50 million football fans saw Drinkaware branding through a beer
sponsorship that featured Drinkaware on the stadium perimeter. During
the semi-final matches, there was a 30% increase in direct traffic
driven to the Drinkaware home page. In fact, the number of individuals
who go to the Drinkaware website has grown massively, from 2.8 million
in 2011 to more than 6 million in the past 12 months. Thanks to the
funding it receives from the industry, Drinkaware has proved a
tremendous asset to the public health effort to promote sensible
drinking. Its progress was confirmed earlier this year, along with some
welcome pointers for future improvement, by an independent review panel
chaired by Sir Hugh Taylor, chairman of the Guy’s and St
Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. The industry has pledged to review
the codes on advertising and marketing and a revised Portman code came
into effect at the end of May this year with several even stricter
rules. A new, improved code on sponsorship is due to be launched in the
next few
weeks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000051">I end
on a specific question or two for the Minister. A deal, by definition,
involves more than one party. We know what the industry is doing. Have
the Government or the health service committed to specific pledges? For
example, will the Government take on one specific suggestion from me
and do more to support the industry in its efforts to change EU
legislation that currently prohibits winemakers from reducing the ABV
of wine by more than 2%? Think how much more quickly we could achieve
the pledge to take 1 billion alcohol units out of the market
if wine companies could legally do what many beer brands already are
doing and reduce the strength of their brands. I know that Defra has
done a great deal to assist but this issue was put on the EU table by
the industry at least three or four years ago and progress has been
painfully slow—mainly, I understand, because there is very
little support from other member states. Will the Minister agree to
speak to his Defra counterparts and fire them up again to do more to
encourage other member states to help change this legislation in the
interests of public
health?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:39:21"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

my opinion, the beauty of the responsibility deal is that it is a
partnership. There is a place for legislation, but if it can be
balanced with voluntary action, self-regulation and personal

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords,
I should declare that I am a patron of a charity that picks
up those with drink problems, the Blenheim Trust. We should
all thank the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for bringing this subject
to us today and introducing the voluntary partnership, which is part of
the nudge campaign to help people to make healthier choices. However,
our Science and Technology Committee expressed its major doubts about
the effectiveness of agreements with commercial organisations,
particularly where there are conflicts of interests. The
Labour Party shares those concerns. We are sceptical whether
a voluntary approach can address those barriers to a healthy
diet and lifestyle, which are threatening a public health
crisis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000059">The
responsibility deal covers alcohol, food, health at work and
physical activity. Success on each of those has been
questioned. Handing over significant responsibility is part of the
reason for that querying, especially where there is no
parallel government action. In the case of alcohol, we have seen no
reduction of the drink-drive level, zero funding
for Alcohol Concern and, despite Mr Cameron’s pledge,
no action on minimum
pricing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000060">As

food, the Government have made a welcome announcement on front-of-pack
labelling. We welcome that but, within days, it was undermined. Only
60% of foods will be covered, according to our figures, because
Coca-Cola, Cadbury, United Biscuits, Unilever and Heinz will not take
part. How can food labelling work if key players refuse to sign up? Of
course, there are things that the industry can do and has done.

is that the responsibility deal agenda is that of the

physical activity, the Government’s record is abysmal. There has
been a drop in sports participation, an end of free swimming for the
under-16s and over-60s, and reduced funding for the School Sport
Partnerships. Where is Mr Cameron’s promise on minimum unit
pricing? Has that disappeared because of lobbying by the drinks
industry? It started in Scotland, first against the policy and then by
a legal challenge; now in England it is at it again, with a campaign
entitled, “Why should responsible drinkers pay more?”,
even though it would cost moderate drinkers only 28p a week. Its
website urges people to tweet the message to
MPs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000066">The
Opposition support anything that the industry does to reduce the cost

Carlsberg and Strongbow. There is a long list, and there are some new
lower-strength drinks such as Carling Zest, Foster’s Radler,
Carlsberg Citrus and Guinness Mid-Strength. These are to be welcomed
and enjoyed—particularly, in my case, the Guinness Mid-Strength.
But we need smaller glasses in pubs and restaurants and smaller
containers, including 250 millilitre cans for beer. Is it
really acceptable that  a large wine glass with 14% wine
contains more than the daily safe drinking level for a woman? How
responsible is

The pledges are supposedly underwritten by the threat of legislation,

reducing alcohol-related harm? Could he tell noble Lords when David

wide agenda; essentially, it taps into the potential for businesses to
improve public health in areas where doing nothing is simply not an
option. However, the something to be done is not necessarily best done
by Government. Organisations signing up to the deal commit to take
voluntary action to improve public health; there is no legally binding
element to this. These actions are expressed as a series of pledges
covering food, alcohol, physical activity and health at work. The deal
has always had strong ministerial support. The Secretary of State
chairs a plenary group of senior representatives which oversees the
deal. Furthermore, each network is supported by a Minister, and both
the Secretary of State and his ministerial team continue to hold
meetings with both potential and existing responsibility deal
partners.</hs_para>

the two years since launch, the number of partners has tripled to over
500, with new partners joining every week. People are already
benefiting from the deal. For example, the World Health Organization
considers us to be a world leader on salt reduction; between 2001 and
2011, average daily salt intakes dropped from 9.6 grammes to 8.1
grammes. Through the responsibility deal all the major UK retailers,
together with a number of key manufacturers and caterers, have
committed to achieve further reductions. Every one gramme reduction in
people’s average daily salt intake will prevent over 4,000
premature deaths and save the NHS £288 million every

partners are also providing consumers with more information about their

street fast food and takeaway meals sold have calories clearly

meals sold on the high street. As regards alcohol, we now have
over  90 companies committed to putting labels on drinks by
December 2013, with clear alcohol units, lower-risk drinking guidelines

different public health interventions set out in the Nuffield ladder of
intervention. Actions further up the ladder include enabling choice,

approaches across our public health policy, depending on the level of
harm caused and the target population. For example, we take actions
higher up the ladder of intervention where children are at risk. The
responsibility deal is, I emphasise, just part of this. Moreover, not
all the actions taken within the deal are nudges. For example, the
removal of trans fats from a wide range of companies’ products
restricts choice and is not a

answer to the noble Lord, Lord Rea, pledges are not proposed by the

robust targets was another issue raised by the noble Lord, who also
asked whether targets were the same as pledges. The answer is no: 
<?notus-xml column=300?>some of the deal’s pledges, such as out-of-home calorie
labelling, alcohol labelling, alcohol unit reduction and salt
reduction, include milestones or targets in their wording. For other
pledges, mainly those relating to health at work and physical activity,

with the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, that there is a need to educate
young people on the risks of alcohol consumption. We are introducing an
education and prevention pledge for schools which will secure

expect to launch that later this year. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke,
asked what was being done on minimum unit pricing. The answer is that
no decision has yet been made. We have received extensive submissions
in response to the recent consultation and are considering all the
views and all the evidence before making a decision in due course.

Turnberg:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the biggest problems facing a
Government is how to get their policies implemented when, as always,
that depends on others 
<?notus-xml column=301?>putting them into action. The world is full of people with bright ideas
but rather fewer who can make sure that they are put into practice.
Such is the case with the good intentions of the noble Earl and his
colleagues to embed research in the NHS, which may be frustrated by
poor take-up by those on the ground who have to implement them. But
help is at hand. It is here in the AMRC’s report on a vision for
implementation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000086">Here
I express my interest as scientific adviser to the Association of
Medical Research Charities. I should mention, too, that the AMRC is an
umbrella body for more than 120 medical charities covering a wide
spectrum of diseases, including Cancer Research UK, the British Heart
Foundation, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and
diabetes, as well as the Wellcome Trust, and as such, speaks for a very
large number of patients and their carers. They are desperately keen to
see research into their diseases actively pursued to the extent that
they pump £1.2 billion into research every year. It is that
commitment to research that prompted the publication of this
vision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000087">Of
course, it did not come out of the blue; it came on the back of a
number of government initiatives to promote research in the NHS. We
have had many a fine word from Ministers, the Treasury and even the
Prime Minister about the value of medical research, and we now have the
duties spelt out in the mandate for NHS England and the CCGs to promote
research. It makes economic sense, too, as we know, that there are
excellent economic returns from investing in research—a fact
that new figures that are about to be published will no doubt
confirm.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062764000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000088">Public funding of
research is very successful in leveraging private capital input too.
The Government’s investment proposals announced today and
yesterday, including protection of the science budget and investment in
health research infrastructure, including regenerative medicine, are
very welcome. The scientific community is, of course, extremely pleased
by that. The National Institute for Health Research and its networks
and centres are poised to do great work. Couple all that with our very
strong background in basic biomedical research and the fact that we
have a National Health Service in which every patient is involved and
available to engage in clinical trials and you have a fantastic
opportunity to conduct research of benefit to patients. I do not have
to explain today how research has enormous potential to improve the
care not only of future patients but also of those who take part in
research themselves today.</hs_para>

these ambitions is not straightforward and there are several
uncomfortable barriers that can get in the way. They range from the
need to maintain adequate public funding—and we have had some of
that today—improving and rationalising the complex regulatory
network—here the new health research authority’s role
will be critical—and improving taxation policy to encourage more
private and venture capital investment. Perhaps one of the biggest
barriers is trying to change the culture within the NHS. The
AMRC’s <I>Vision</I><I> </I>document focuses on the people who
have to do the implementing—the patients, doctors, nurses and
other healthcare workers. Are they ready to take advantage of the
valuable basic work going on in

in practice
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000091">There is

despite that, a mystery shopper survey by NIHR revealed that barely 10%
of NHS trusts provide patients with any information and there were very
few notices about it anywhere. Another survey, by Breast Cancer
Campaign and Arthritis Research UK, found that very few patients ever
asked their doctors about research or clinical trials and many doctors
were unaware of existing sources of information they could give to
their patients. This survey also confirmed, as many had suspected, that
GPs were not all switched on to doing research or even supporting
others to do research. While 80% of GPs contacted felt that research
was important, only 20% thought that they should be involved
themselves. They quote a lack of time as a major disincentive, but
equally a lack of support and a lack of information about where to get
that support. This is all true, albeit to a lesser extent, of hospital
doctors. Perhaps equally disturbing is the observation that only a
third of GPs thought that research was of any value in helping them to
offer their patients more treatment options.</hs_parafo>

the coalface if we are to deliver on our potential but there are causes
for some optimism. The academic health science centres and networks
funded by the National Institute for Health Research are enormously
valuable in engaging with healthcare workers. Figures published today
show  that, in the past year, NIHR engaged a remarkable 630,000
patients in 1,592 studies, a considerable increase from the previous

good example is the Greater Manchester network that I visited. It has
managed to get every GP and pharmacist in Salford signed up to clinical
trials—to the extent that GSK has seen fit to invest heavily in
trials there. It has also managed to get the rate for R&amp;D approvals
for clinical trials down from 60 days in 2011 to 17 days in 2012. Many
other good examples of what can be achieved are described in this

widely across the

<I>Vision</I> document makes a large number of recommendations but I
shall mention just a few where the Government may be able to help.
First, can we encourage NHS England to appoint someone at board level
who can take responsibility for promoting research, and can we make
sure that the CCGs have the leadership

there is a clear need to spread more and better information about
research opportunities to patients and doctors, so can the noble Earl
encourage the NIHR to get relevant information out to NHS trusts and
GPs to ensure that both patients and staff know more about research,
including its benefits? He may find that he is pushing at an open door
there. Can he ensure that employment contracts for consultants include
sufficient time for research, and can he help to reduce discrimination
against those who engage in research by ensuring that those responsible
for giving out clinical excellence awards at the local and national
levels take this into account by including research activities in their
assessments?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000097">Can
the noble Earl reassure us that the responsibilities of Health

we are debating in the Care Bill will incorporate the specific need to
include research in the training programmes of all clinical trainees?
Training programmes should be flexible enough to allow time out for

Turnberg, mentioned, <I>Our vision for Research in the NHS</I> was
written after wide consultation among professionals on the one hand and
patients on the other, and it is built on three key concepts that
emerged from that consultation. The first is involving patients:
telling them about research being undertaken, how they can find out
more about that research and how they can participate if they wish and
it is relevant to their care. Secondly, there is involving staff so
that they understand the benefits of research, are motivated to engage
with it and know how to take part in it and use its findings. Lastly,
there is ensuring that the NHS is open to and about its research, and
develops among its staff a group of leaders who will champion research
and help embed good researchers and good research practice into the
NHS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062764000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000104">I have
just three questions for the Minister. First, there is the matter of
clinical trials. As I said, one key issue is the NHS being open to
research, but there is concern that it is losing its share of global
clinical trials. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, when I was doing more
research on the pharmaceutical industry, the UK was a favoured location
for clinical trials. Many multinational companies put their research
laboratories here in the UK because of that. The Science and Technology
Select Committee, of which I am a member, recently made a study of
regenerative medicine. In the process of taking evidence for that, we
learnt that despite the recognised quality of our research, it is no
longer the case that we are among the leading countries doing clinical
trials. One reason cited most frequently for this was the sheer
complexity of procedures, especially the number of regulatory bodies
involved. I noted in reading the report that this comes up yet
again:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062764000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000127">“40%

Clinical Trials Gateway has been set up to simplify procedures, but can
the Minister offer us any reassurance that the situation is likely to
improve, and in particular that the Health Research Authority might in

for?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062764000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000105">My
second question relates to co-operation between the NHS, universities
and medical schools. Yesterday  I attended the lecture given by
my noble friend Lord Heseltine to the Industry and Parliament Trust,
and I was amused when he talked about how, in the 1970s, the public
sector—the Civil Service—and private sector industry were
two separate worlds that worked in their own spaces and failed to
recognise the benefits of working together in such areas as
regeneration. In some senses, it seems that one hits the same problems
between the NHS and the world of research, particularly university and
medical school
research:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062764000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062764000128">“Our

fundamentally important because it highlights three vital issues with
regard to the future of research in our NHS: that we must develop a
culture, as we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, so that
every patient is given the opportunity to participate in research; that
all those who work in our healthcare system are made aware of those
opportunities and are given the opportunity to develop as researchers;
and finally, that the NHS, having promoted and facilitated all that
important research actually adopts its findings to improve clinical
outcomes and, indeed, to ensure that we use vital resources for
healthcare much more effectively.</hs_para>

Her Majesty’s Government need to be congratulated in this
regard, because for the past three years, we have seen a relentless
commitment to medical research in the legislation that has been brought
before this Parliament. In particular, for the first time, legislation
enshrines in statute the obligation of the Secretary of State to
promote research and provides for the new arm’s length bodies to
have a statutory obligation for research, which is vital. The reasons
for this are clear. In terms of health gain, there is no doubt that the
adoption of innovation into routine clinical practice will help us
improve clinical outcomes for large numbers of patients, while in terms
of the efficient use of resources, there is no question that some of
the currently available innovations will help us to ensure that the
funds available for routine healthcare can be used more
effectively.</hs_para>

we know, for instance, that the life sciences industry—another
area of government focus—is vital to future economic development
in  our country. As an industry, it is responsible for about
£50 billion of economic activity annually, with
160,000 employees in this country. We also know that it is a net
exporter, bringing in vital revenue to the country of some £7
billion per annum, and that from the point of view of investing in
research, be it public or charitable funds, every £1 invested
will provide 39p in economic return in perpetuity to our economy, so
that is vital too.</hs_para>

economic terms that the Government have started to look at the
opportunities here. They have also done so in terms of the structures
that might be provided to facilitate research, which is where this
important research provides vital insights. However, a large number of
bodies have been created recently to promote research in our NHS. We
have heard about the academic health science centres. There are, of
course, also academic health science networks, which will appear across
the NHS in England and bring together academia, industry and the
National Health Service. We have the clinical research networks, which
are there to promote research at the local level within the footprints
and geographies of the academic health science networks. We have the
local education and training boards, which will play a vital role in
the education of future academics and those who wish to participate in
research, both clinicians and other healthcare professionals. We also
have the centres for leadership in applied health research and care,
which will promote research into outcomes in the NHS. How are these
important structures to be co-ordinated at a local level to deliver the

national level, Health Education England, which will have an important
role in training academics and in setting a national priority in that
regard. We have the Health Research Authority, the Medical Research
Council and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, where
the Higher Education Funding Council’s funding for medical
schools rests. Again, those important national bodies will, with the
National Health Service Commissioning Board and NHS England, all have
an important role at national level to ensure that vital funds and
resources are properly co-ordinated. How are we in this Parliament to
know that all these new structures are working successfully and
delivering what is envisaged? What metrics have been defined at the
birth of these organisations with regard to their performance in

Earl of Selborne:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by congratulating the
noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, on giving us the opportunity to discuss this
most important report. I pay tribute in his absence to my noble friend
Lord Willis, who is chair of the AMRC. As everyone does, I strongly
endorse the case made so powerfully by the report to ensure that every
patient has the opportunity to take part in research. However, my plea
today is really about ensuring the realisation of the potential of the
vast amount of data held by the National Health
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000002">The
scope of the National Health Service’s database is one of its
greatest assets. The potential of these huge datasets, which could be
drawn on for research, is much greater than the present rate of
exploitation. That is not to say that there is not some excellent work
being done. I draw attention to the press report which came out when
the survey was published, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord
Turnberg. Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director of the British
Heart Foundation, stated
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062786000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000202">“It’s

“heart-patients”, read “and every other
patient”. We should take great lessons from the example of
10 years ago, when the Medical Research Council and the
Wellcome Trust established the UK Biobank to support the investigation
of risk factors for the major diseases of middle and old age. The
recruitment of more than half a million men and women aged between 40
and 69 was successfully achieved, with a great deal of support from the
public, and their health has been monitored long-term. When the House
of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee published
its report on genomic medicine four years ago, it quoted the evidence
of the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062786000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000203">“The

other words, there was recognition that there was a need to protect
patient privacy and to reassure the public that their concerns about
the data being abused or misused were being adequately and most
properly addressed. The procedures for ensuring the protection of
personal privacy were considered exemplary. Yet Professor Collins of
the UK Biobank told the Select Committee that if he were able to make
one recommendation, it would be to remove the bureaucratic obstacles to
using health records to improve the health of people in the United
Kingdom. The report came out just after the Information Commissioner at
the time, Richard Thomas, and Sir Mark Walport, now 
<?notus-xml column=308?>the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, had conducted a
data-sharing review in 2008. This review concluded
that,</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062786000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000204">“the

has changed over the last four years? First and foremost, the
technology has changed. The ability to collect, store, share and
integrate ever greater volumes of data has advanced exponentially.
However, our ability to unlock more of the vast database that is
available from the National Health Service has not matched these
advances in technology. We are still not using these data to their full
potential, to ensure that research findings are transferred to clinical
and therapeutic use. The huge datasets that could, with public support,
be drawn from the National Health Service and which could underpin new
and exciting opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of disease
are still waiting for full
exploitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000006">The
biobank has been an outstanding example of what can be achieved. When
the public are effectively engaged, there is overwhelming support for
their own data to be used to support the public good. It is therefore
essential to reassure the public that their data will be handled
safely. This requires effective systems and good communication among
practitioners, researchers and patients—and, indeed, among all
healthcare professionals. The UK Biobank has shown that this can be
done.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13062786000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000227">3.30

Aberdare:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to focus on only one
area of NHS research—namely, research relating to pancreatic
cancer, which is probably not to the great surprise of the Minister. In
doing so, I thank the charity Pancreatic Cancer UK for its briefing,
James Tobin at the House of Lords Library for his typically helpful
briefing pack and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, on
obtaining this

cancer accounts for 5% of cancer deaths in the UK but it currently
attracts only 1% of research spending. So perhaps it is little wonder
that outcomes in survival rates, for example, have shown little if any
improvement in 40 years, yet evidence from other cancers, such as
breast cancer, shows that increased research effort can lead to
significantly better
outcomes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000009">For
research to be effective in this way, a number of essential
infrastructure elements need to be in place, several of which are
rightly identified in the AMRC report. There need to be recognised
centres of research excellence covering areas such as pancreatic
cancer; an adequate body of appropriately qualified and skilled
researchers; an ability to attract new young researchers into the
specific field; and a strong pipeline of good research proposals.
Beyond that, research needs a critical mass, estimated to be at least
£10 million to £12 million a year, as opposed to the
current spending level of £5 million for pancreatic cancer
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000010">The
first part of the AMRC report focuses on patient involvement in
research and sets out three aims: every patient should be able to take
part in research; research should be patient-centred; and research
should be embedded in patient care. I ask the Minister: 
<?notus-xml column=309?>what can he and the Government do to ensure that
these three aims are achieved for pancreatic cancer
patients?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000011">Specifically,
pancreatic cancer patients are often unable to access clinical trials.
Lower levels of investment in pancreatic cancer research mean that
there are fewer clinical trials available. One study found
91 breast cancer clinical trials taking place against only
15 for pancreatic cancer. Less than 10% of pancreatic cancer patients
say that they have been involved in any discussion about clinical
trials, and less than 12% are enrolled in such trials, against about
one in six cancer patients overall. In any case, many pancreatic cancer
patients are diagnosed too late to be fit enough to participate in
trials. So how can the Government help to ensure that more pancreatic
cancer patients can access clinical trials? I hope the Minister will
have some
ideas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000012">The
third part of the report relates to conducting high quality research
and adopting new treatments. Apparently, much pancreatic cancer
research tends to be researcher-led—there is little in the way
of strategic direction from funders—unlike some other countries,
such as Australia, which have clearly defined research priorities and
achieve more impressive results. How can the Minister help to ensure
that government engages with relevant research bodies in a
collaborative effort to develop a strategic research agenda for
pancreatic
cancer?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000013">I ask
the Minister to look at a number of other measures, such as encouraging
existing cancer research centres to increase their focus on pancreatic
cancer; providing support to develop more skilled researchers,
specifically in pancreatic cancer, and to ensure that this field of
research is seen as offering a good career path, which is clearly one
of the challenges at the moment; helping to raise the
profile of pancreatic cancer within the research community, perhaps by
the appointment of a UK pancreatic cancer research champion; and
ensuring that the UK learns from experience in other countries and that
research findings are freely shared
internationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000014">Pancreatic
Cancer UK is doing its bit, for example with its own research
innovation fund and future research leaders fund. I hope the Minister
can tell us how government will add weight to efforts such as these so
that we can put in place an effective research programme which will
finally start to turn the tide of dismal pancreatic cancer outcomes and
bring some real hope to sufferers from this dreadful disease and to
their loved

this case, the irresistible force of their idea, their dream, will soon

doctor to follow the status quo, even though he or she knows that it
leads only to poor life quality followed by death. This is why all
cancer deaths are wasted lives. Science learns nothing from those
thousands of deaths—scientific knowledge does not advance by one
centimetre—because current law requires that the deceased
receive only the standard procedure, the endless repetition of a failed
experiment. The pre-eminence in law of the standard procedure is a
barrier to progress in curing

had better close with this. There is not time to take your Lordships
through the case law that I have here but I will summarise it like
this. Under present law, any deviation by a doctor from the standard
procedure is likely to result in a verdict of guilt for medical
negligence. Current law defines medical negligence as deviation from
standard procedure. However, as innovation is deviation, non-deviation
is non-innovation. That is why there is no cure for cancer. That is why

Rea:</Member></B> My Lords, I apologise for missing the deadline
yesterday and hence being squeezed into the gap. I wanted to say a few
words about the position of general practice in the health service. As
my noble  
<?notus-xml column=311?>friend pointed out, the AMRC report finds that fewer GPs than hospital
doctors are interested or involved in research, most of
them citing time as the reason. Setting aside
dedicated time for research is not easy in the average primary care
setting. It is also possible that fewer GPs are research-minded and
that, except for academic general practice, publishing peer-reviewed
research papers is less important in their career
advancement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000022">However,
research in general practice is alive and well. Every medical school
now has an academic department of primary care linked to the Royal
College of GPs, supporting research in primary care through the RCGP
innovation and research centre. The director of the centre suggested to
me that the academic status of general practice would be enhanced if
more research-minded and bright medical students or doctors could be
recruited into general practice. One way in which to do this would be
for the NIHR to proactively offer to fund PhD or MSc fellowships in
general practice. This would be attractive to research-minded medical
students or practitioners contemplating a career in general practice
but uncertain about its research possibilities. Does the noble Earl
have any influence over the funding decisions of NIHR? I suggest that
this might be promising

I congratulate the AMRC on its excellent report and the accompanying
survey of healthcare professionals’ views on the importance of
research to the NHS and to staff working for it. Under the Care Bill,
the need for Health Education England to ensure that research and
innovation are incorporated into education and training for healthcare
staff was a major theme, echoing the Joint Select Committee on the Bill
on this issue. All NHS staff need to be able to make use of research
throughout their careers and should be equipped with the tools to
understand and support research and to assess and use evidence to
inform their decisions when caring for patients or supporting clinical
staff.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000028">As
noble Lords have pointed out, the association’s survey showed
the challenges to be faced. The good news was that staff overwhelmingly
recognised the value and importance of research, but the barriers to
taking part in research, identified by the majority of staff surveyed,
including doctors and nurses, was deeply worrying. It is clear that
these barriers of lack of time, problems over funding and support and
the difficulties of navigating regulation have to be overcome,
particularly the need to develop stronger support among GPs to become
personally involved in research. After all, they are such an important
gateway to spreading the message to get patients interested and
involved in research. As my noble friend put it, there is still much to
do at the coal face. This is where the ARMC report is so valuable. It
offers an authoritative but very practical vision of how the goal of
having every clinician a researcher and every willing patient a
research participant can be progressed and achieved, as well as how the
leadership and support that the NHS staff need can be developed and
built into a service-wide research
culture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:43:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000029">The
case studies in the report are particularly informative, providing
examples of excellence and best practice in cancer, arthritis and other
key research areas of patient consultation and involvement, and of
building staff support and confidence about participating and using
research findings so that they can show their patients the benefits of
them taking

the context of this debate it is important also to reflect on the
progress being made on the UK life sciences and the innovation, health
and wealth strategies, the central aim of which is for innovation to
become the NHS’s core business. No one reading these reports and
the recent one-year reviews can be in any doubt of the dramatic pace
and scale of change in the medical and life sciences, such as the
breakthrough in genomic medicine, which is changing fundamentally the
way disease is diagnosed, prevented and treated, and the progress on
regenerative medicine, which are all breathtaking to a lay person such

are important developments on the service side, too, as part of the
high impact innovation programme, such as in wheelchair design. Can the
Minister update the House on progress on implementing the strategies? I
could not find any details on the website about further review reports

of the strategies, which charted good  progress but also some
continuing problems, including implementation of NICE technology

on the association’s vision, I would reinforce the need to keep
our foot on the pedal to ensure that we continue to be a world leader
in clinical research. We must ensure that CCGs in the absence of SHAs
and PCTs continue the focus on research and do not allow it to
diminish. The AMRC vision highlights the need for leadership and
guidance to CCGs to promote research; to encourage NHS managers so that
they understand the value of research and actively support it through
their management decisions and processes; and to ensure that all parts
of NHS support research, including primary care and all non-NHS
providers. I look forward to the Minister’s response updating
the House on the Government’s actions to ensure that real
progress is made on all these

is now more than seven years since the National Institute for Health
Research was established in April 2006. The NIHR has a wide-ranging
role that is central to our debate today. It provides the framework
through which the Department of Health can position, maintain and
manage the research, research staff and research infrastructure of the
NHS in England as a national research facility. Indeed, together, NIHR
people, facilities and systems represent the most integrated clinical
research system in the world—driving research from bench to
bedside for the benefit of patients and supporting economic
growth.</hs_para>

noble friend Lady Sharp referred to the importance of clinical trials,
and of course, that is centre stage for the NIHR. As a result of the
NIHR, large numbers of patients have the opportunity to take part in
research. In the past financial year, more than 630,000 participants
were recruited to trials and studies hosted by the NIHR Clinical
Research Network Portfolio, and more than 99% of NHS trusts were
involved in the recruitment. During the whole of 2013-14, the NIHR is
promoting the fact that, “It’s okay to ask” about
clinical research. We want everybody to get involved—patients,
medical professionals and the public to support the
campaign.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000036">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:48:10"></hs_TimeCode>
March 2013, the Government published the revised NHS constitution,
which contains a pledge to inform patients of research studies in which
they may be eligible to participate. The pledge aims to give people
better access to the potential benefits of participating in research
studies, including clinical trials. We have already improved the amount
of information available to patients, clinicians and the public about
clinical trials by establishing the UK Clinical Trials Gateway. I just
say to the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, who spoke very powerfully about
pancreatic cancer and the need to enlist more patients into trials for
that condition, that the launch of the gateway was promoted 
<?notus-xml column=314?>through leaflets and other printed materials, including postcards and
posters, and the gateway is also being actively promoted by INVOLVE,
which is the NIHR-funded patients and public involvement body. In the
course of just one month, May of this year, there were 11,570 visitors
to the gateway website. Although not all of them will be related to
pancreatic cancer, I hope that that gives an indication of the powerful
influence that we hope the gateway will have in alerting patients to
relevant
studies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000037">Crucial
to all this activity is the need to both protect and promote the
interests of patients and the public in health research. That is why we
established the Health Research Authority in 2011, and provisions in
the Care Bill will give it added stability and independence. To my
noble friend Lady Sharp I would say that the HRA has a programme of
work to enable the implementation of a unified approval process and to
support the authority in promoting consistent and proportionate
standards for compliance and inspection. The programme includes a
feasibility study with a number of pilots to test the effect of
rationalising and combining elements of NHS study-wide review with
elements of the research ethics committee review into a single HRA
assessment. The findings are expected to identify and show how to
release the potential to improve both study set-up times and the
quality and consistency of ethical

noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, very helpfully acknowledged that enactment of
the Health and Social Care Act is a milestone for research in the NHS.
It recognises the need to promote research and the use of research
evidence and created unprecedented powers and duties at all levels to
meet that need. The Government’s mandate to the NHS
Commissioning Board—now NHS England—sets an objective to
ensure that the new commissioning system promotes and supports
participation by NHS organisations and patients in research funded by
both non-commercial and commercial organisations, most importantly to
improve patient outcomes, but also to contribute to economic
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:51:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000039">The
noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, specifically asked how CCGs will be held to
account. The mandate asks for demonstration of progress against the

England welcomes the vision for research set out by the AMRC and shares
its aspirations to empower patients to take part in research; to engage
clinicians and other NHS staff; and to implement research findings to
lead to better outcomes for patients and the public. Although NHS
England is a new organisation, the NHS—as I do not need to tell
the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg—has a strong existing culture of
research, although we want to strengthen that culture. There is a wide
wealth of research activity already taking place and considerable
expertise within organisations. However, NHS England recognises there
is further work to do to ensure that all NHS commissioning staff
embrace a research culture, which was the theme of my noble friend Lord
Saatchi’s excellent contribution, that they 
<?notus-xml column=315?>have access to research evidence and use it to inform commissioning
decisions. It has recently recruited a team to lead the research agenda
and develop and implement its research strategy. It is anticipated that
a draft strategy will be in place by autumn this year, when extensive
consultation with key stakeholders and partners, including patients,
will be

noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, and my noble friend Lady Sharp rightly
referred to the vital role of clinical commissioning groups within the
new system. Through their formal declaration of compliance, all these
groups have confirmed that they understand and will comply with their
statutory responsibilities regarding promoting research. They have also
confirmed that they are committed to following the policy of ensuring
the NHS meets the treatment costs for patients taking part in research
funded by government and research charity partner organisations.
Alongside NHS England, Health Education England has responsibility for
promoting high quality education and training that is responsive to the
changing needs of patients and local communities. It will work with
stakeholders to influence training curricula as
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000042">HEE

engagement takes place with a wide range of partners. This will include
building relationships with academic health science networks and
academic health science centres to align education with research and
innovation. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, referred to the role of
LETBs, which are responsible for commissioning education and training
and securing quality and value from education and training providers.
Indeed, they will need to ensure that the education and training that
they commission is in line with national objectives, which include
building a flexible workforce that is receptive to research and
innovation. HEE and the LETBs are working with the NIHR to ensure
appropriate investment in education and training, to develop clinical

programmes for research training and career development. The purpose of
these is, self-evidently, to create the next generation of researchers
focused on people-based research. The programmes provide support for
the academic training paths of all healthcare professionals and other
key disciplines involved in health and social care research, including,
importantly, general practice. The NIHR is actively building research
in general practice—for example, through its School for Primary

noble friend Lord Selborne spoke very powerfully about data from the
NHS. One million people have some form of contact with the NHS every 36
hours. That produces, as he rightly said, a staggering amount of data,
which can be used to drive forward research into new treatments. The
NHS is in a unique position in that sense. We can draw on linked
datasets on a scale unprecedented elsewhere in the world. Provided that
we ensure confidentiality and privacy for individual patients, the
opportunities for research and innovation are vast. In April last year,
we established the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, which enables
access to anonymised patient records to support the development of
novel
treatments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:58:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I

Crawley:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an unashamed shout-out for
those local services that protect our citizens across the country and
that promote legitimate businesses at a time when economic growth is
not only desirable but
essential.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000049">Why
do these regulatory services need our advocacy? Their strong focus on
prevention can make them less visible than other public services. As
one environmental health officer told a recent UNISON survey, our
success is that nothing happens, meaning that nothing bad happens.
However, it takes a considerably robust infrastructure to maintain that
status quo. Those Peers 
<?notus-xml column=317?>who have glanced at the title of this debate and thought “Ooh,
that sounds dull,” will wish that they were here and will
probably say that they were here, to misquote Shakespeare, because this
is a story of disease and pestilence and contagion; it is a narrative
of small-time scams and mis-selling, of international-scale
fraud,  of injustice and of heartbreak for those caught up
in  it
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000050">I see
that the Minister is from the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills and I welcome him to our debate. While I have very cordial
relations with his department through my involvement in trading
standards, many of the points that I make this afternoon will also be
directed at his colleagues at the Department for Communities and Local
Government. However, as I was frequently told when I sat where he is
sitting now, at the Dispatch Box you speak for the whole Government, as
I am sure he is well
aware.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000051">Environmental
health might include food safety, health and safety at work,
environmental protection, public health nuisances, private sector
housing and, of course, licensing. Trading standards might include
business advice, fair trading, product safety, under-age sales, weights
and measures, food standards and farm animal health and welfare. These
services are under crippling pressure, as never before. Will the
Minister explain how these services will be fit for purpose into the
future, given the hit that they have taken under the austerity agenda
and given yesterday’s spending review announcement of a further
10% reduction in local government spending? I ask the question as
president of the Trading Standards Institute and as a firm believer in
our local public services being an anchor of our democracy.</hs_para>

for taking part in this debate. I am particularly happy to see the
noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, in her place, an esteemed vice-president
of the Trading Standards Institute, as I am to see my noble friend Lord
Harris of Haringey, who chairs the recently established National
Trading Standards
Board.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000053">There
are two key pillars for an effective regulatory system. The first is
that the system is underpinned by well constructed legal instruments.
The second is that the enforcement of such a system is well resourced.
I will deal with the resource issue first. A well resourced regulatory
system brings about significant benefits to society. A cut to trading
standards and environmental health is a cut to community health, a
barrier to preventing crime, a boost to fraudsters and a shot in the
arm for those who distort our economy and make it extremely difficult
for honest enterprises to survive. In a survey by UNISON of over 300
trading standards officers carried out in the last few years, over 95%
of respondents said that they now had fewer staff, three-quarters said
that they now undertake fewer inspections, 70% said that they had
stopped providing some services altogether, 70% said that they did less
preventive work and half said that they were less equipped to deal with
new forms of scams in our digital age. That is hardly the picture of a
healthy regulatory system. In addition, it is estimated that UK
consumers spend 59 million hours a year trying to resolve disputes with
traders, 
<?notus-xml column=318?>which costs our economy more than £3 billion a year. As the Audit
Commission and Audit Scotland said in their 2013
report:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062786000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000206">“The
long-term viability of councils’ trading standards services is
under threat and urgent action is needed to strengthen protection for
consumers”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13062786000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000054">As
well as the day-to-day running of the service, there are the
emergencies—those dreadful, nasty surprises such as the horse
meat scandal. The food industry was shaken to its core earlier this
year by the adulteration of meat products. Members of the public, as
well as Parliament, were calling for more resources, more sampling and
for the service to carry out more unannounced checks. How will the
Government avert a future adulteration of the food chain and how do
they intend to strengthen our enforcement procedures? Is the Minister
satisfied with the welcome but very modest budget set aside by BIS for
kick-starting the additional work that trading standards has taken on
in the new consumer landscape? I declare an interest as chair of the
Consumer Codes Approval Board. Do the Government believe that the
balance between local and national funding of trading standards is the
right one?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062786000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000055">While I have so far
concentrated on trading standards, the story of our environmental
health services—they, too, go back to Victorian times—is
very much the same. UNISON’s 2012 survey of 4,000 environmental
health officers found reports of increases in pest infestation,
landlords cutting corners, poorer housing conditions, overcrowding and
increases in disease. Using DCLG’s own departmental figures, we
can compare spending for 2012-13 with the actual spending in 2010-11.
We see the following very worrying changes. There are falls in spending
of 8% on food safety,  6% on private rented housing standards,
28% on pest control, 14% on health and safety and 47% on port
health—the officers at ports of entry monitoring possible
contamination of food and so on following events such as the Fukushima
nuclear incident in Japan. Moreover, 31% less was spent on animal
health and infectious disease control. How do we deal with the next
major incident of Legionnaires’ disease—or more
importantly prevent it—with these figures in our
heads?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062786000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000056">At the
start of my contribution, I suggested that two key pillars underpin our
work in regulatory services: adequate resources and effective legal
instruments. I wonder how the draft Consumer Rights Bill, much of which
I welcome, can put forward a proposal to insist legally that trading
standards officers give two days’ written notice before many
inspections can be carried out. What self-respecting fraudster is
likely to leave evidence on their premises when they know that there is
going to be a visit from the trading standards officer? I would be
interested in the Minister’s view.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062786000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000057">In conclusion, some
would say, perhaps indeed the Minister will, that the answer to saving
these invaluable services in a time of unprecedented austerity is
through reorganisation—maybe sharing organisational boundaries,
having a regional solution instead of a local one, better procurement
or outsourcing privately. While I am not opposed to many of these
measures—indeed, some are simply common sense, and I welcome
them —they are already being undertaken and they have
their problems as well as their solutions. There is a big 
<?notus-xml column=319?>question mark over the ability of reorganisation alone to make up the
shortfall in spending on these vital services. The accountability to
our citizens that local government gives our regulatory services has
long been a part of our democracy and I am sure that we would all want
that to continue despite the times we are living
through.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13062786000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000232">4.10

Seccombe:</Member></B> My Lords, I have the honour to be a
vice-president of the Trading Standards Institute, an organisation that
I much admire, and so it gives me great pleasure to thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Crawley, the president of the TSI, for securing this
important
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000059">The
work of local regulatory services may not be an area of government that
receives a great deal of attention when it is going well, but it is
vital to upholding the rights of consumers, providing protection to the
public and acting as a source of information to businesses and the
community. Indeed, it is perhaps a sign of encouragement that we rarely
see these services reach the national news for anything other than good
news.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000060">The
noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, has highlighted the reduction in budgets
in many services, but we have to remind ourselves of the climate under
which this Government are operating. A horrendous fiscal deficit
alongside an uncertain and shaky global economic climate has meant that
tough decisions have had to be made in a variety of areas where many of
us would not naturally wish to see less
spending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000061">However,
the Government have also been innovative in their approach. Spending
less money does not necessarily mean a worse service or declining
satisfaction. In many areas the Government have helped to identify new
and more efficient ways of delivering services. A scrupulous review of
all areas of government spending has allowed for innovation while
protecting many taxpayers from having to increase their contributions
to what, in many cases, was inefficient spending or unnecessary
programmes. This has been particularly true in local government, which
accounts for around £25 billion of the Exchequer’s
expenditure. Does the Minister agree that the Government’s
decision to freeze council tax has not only allowed households that are
feeling the pinch to get some relief but also encouraged local
authorities to look for new and innovative ways of delivering
services?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0001.htm#13062786000062">Often
without these budgetary pressures, similar organisations with similar
remits can grow side by side without co-operation or without people
taking the tough decisions that are needed. This is particularly true
when it comes to consumer rights, an area of government that is
obviously vital to protecting customers and business but in which many
people used to get confused between the plethora of organisations
involved, including the Office of Fair Trading and trading standards.
Can the Minister clarify whether this duplication and confusion have
now been clarified and, if so, whether this has improved the situation
for
consumers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000063">We
need a system that is without confusion, where problems can be
identified quickly and dealt with speedily. Unfortunately, we still
hear of small businesses 
<?notus-xml column=320?>suffering because their competitors can sell fake goods or goods that
have been acquired through undesirable means—at boot sales, for
example. Does the Minister agree that this is harmful to the British
economy and undermines the trust needed between consumers and
businesses?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000064">Finally,
it is important to acknowledge that it is wise and democratic to
empower local authorities to decide which services their residents need
and to what extent they should be financed. I welcome the principle
that councils should be given more control over their own budgets and
should be held to account. The Government’s decision to allow
local authorities to retain business rates to invest in their local
area is a welcome and long overdue move. Can my noble friend say how
much this change is expected to raise for local authorities? The
further we move away from a situation where councils can always blame
Whitehall and Westminster for decisions made locally, the better.
Accountability and transparency are both great tools for ensuring that
spending levels are maintained at a reasonable level and I welcome any
steps that the Government take to increase the use of these
tools.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062786000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000065">Many
of the services that the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, has raised do
exceptional work for their communities, but these services cannot exist
in a vacuum that ignores the wider fiscal situation, the need to modify
and evolve to meet changing circumstances or the need for more local
accountability. Like many areas of government, they have to adapt and
become fit for purpose for this day and
age.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/B548D1F3F8669AF5ED19EFC1CC381E29ADE791FE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by recording my
interest as the chair, for the past two months, of the National Trading
Standards Board. I also reiterate the thanks given to my noble friend
Lady Crawley for securing this debate, which I think will raise a
number of very important
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000068">The
timing is extremely fitting. There is an increasing recognition of the
harm that can be done to individuals by scammers and rogue traders or
by those who flout environmental health regulations. I welcome, for
example, the announcement this morning of the Sentencing
Council’s consultation, suggesting that sentences for financial
crimes should take into account the harm and impact on victims rather
than just the sums involved. The sum of £2,000 scammed by a
dodgy roofer from a pensioner could denude her life savings and shatter
her confidence. At present, the sentence might only be a community
order or, at most, six months. These guidelines would change the
maximum to two years, and I believe that that reflects what society
would
expect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:16:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

who, vulture-like, prey on their fellow-citizens—particularly
the most vulnerable—to be pursued vigorously and dealt with
accordingly. That is why the picture painted by my noble friend Lady
Crawley about the impact that recent budgetary decisions have had on
local trading standards and local environmental health is so serious.
Of course, the bleak economic environment referred to by the noble
Baroness, Lady Seccombe, creates the climate in which it is more likely
that scammers and fraudsters will 
<?notus-xml column=321?>emerge, and that is precisely why this is a time when it is particularly
difficult, but especially important, that action is taken.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062786000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000070">I
am<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:17:28"></hs_TimeCode> sure that the
Government are serious about ensuring that the consumer is protected,
but we have to acknowledge that the pressure on local budgets is not
helping. There is a danger that the Government—I assume
unintentionally—are about to make it all worse. There are
proposals in the consumer rights Bill impacting on the powers of
trading standards officers to enter and inspect. My noble friend Lady
Crawley has already referred to those in brief. Perhaps the Minister
can tell us what the problem is that these changes are designed to
solve. The Government seem to envisage that in future two days’
notice should be given to traders before a visit—I repeat: two
days’ notice. “Please Mr Rogue Trader, we want
to come and visit the day after tomorrow, and please could you leave
all your records of whom you’ve scammed in good order for us and
leave all your counterfeit goods out for us to seize”. Come on.
What precisely is intended to be the point of that? Perhaps the
Minister can enlighten us about the thinking that suggests that that is
a sensible way forward. No doubt there will be exemptions but I come
back to my question: what is the problem that the Government are trying
to solve?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062786000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000071">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:19:29"></hs_TimeCode>
any event, there is an advantage in unannounced visits. Certainly, some
years ago when I was director of the Association of Community Health
Councils, or when, as a new councillor 35 years ago, I visited care
homes and children’s establishments without warning, the
importance of such a facility was demonstrated to me. I remember the
muttered asides and the nervous looks that told you far more than
anything you would learn on an announced visit. That is why unannounced
visits are important and why I wonder what the logic is in changing
these things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:19:34"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Government’s proposals will throw up anomalies. Some
establishments will now end up being visited twice, instead of once,
by  the same officers. The Food Standards Authority requires,
under statute, that some food-related visits are unannounced. The
other, related, visits would be  the subject of 48
hours’ notice. Why is that and whom does it

will a private dwelling be defined, as powers of entry will not be

about the proposals to restrict trading standards services’
access to communications data under the Communications Data Bill? This
will severely compromise the ability to protect communities and
legitimate businesses and, indeed, to combat serious criminality.
Communications data is used to support a broad range of investigations,
often related to serious and organised crime and sometimes where
consumers have been defrauded out of huge sums of money, or huge as far
as they are concerned. This includes doorstep crime, unsafe and clocked
vehicles and the sale of counterfeit goods, often over the internet.
These rogue business often only display a single mobile phone 
<?notus-xml column=322?>number in a small ad or flyer, or hide their identity behind misleading
internet accounts. Access to communications data is often the only
effective way of pursuing an investigation into this type of

will cite only one example, although I have plenty more if people wish
to hear them. Cambridgeshire County Council has one case proceeding
through the courts with 17 defendants, three of whom have already
received prison sentences. The total amount of money involved is
£700,000, defrauded from over 100 victims. Picture again the
pensioner who has potentially lost their life savings. The
communications data on the landline phone numbers used on invoices by
these individuals and the billing details on mobile phones made a
substantial contribution to the evidence in that case. I presume that
the Minister would not want such people to go unapprehended. How can
taking those powers away from local trading standards departments
possibly be justified? The public wants these people dealt with and
surely so do the Government. Can the Minister explain the rationale? If
the argument is that the powers have been misused, perhaps he could
give us the evidence to show that that is the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000075">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:24:55"></hs_TimeCode>

Watson of Invergowrie:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my
noble friend Lady Crawley on securing the debate and on her opening
remarks, in which she sketched out clearly the potential dangers of
reduced funding in these areas. It was based on her own experience,

shall confine my remarks to environmental health services issues. In
varying forms these services are provided by each of the district,
metropolitan and unitary authorities in England, and what environmental
health officers do often goes unsung. I think it was my 
<?notus-xml column=323?>noble friend Lady Crawley who made the point that it is a success for
them when nothing untoward happens, but
increasingly that success is being
challenged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:25:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000080">It
is the job of environmental health officers to assess, correct and
prevent those factors adversely affecting the health of current and
future generations, whether in their homes, their schools or their
workplaces or out and about, at leisure or on the move. Day to day,
this important local service deals with housing, food safety,
environmental protection and workplace health and

scale of this responsibility is perhaps best illustrated by reference
to housing. There are some 9 million families in the private
rented sector and many of the properties are defective in some way, a
third of them failing to meet the Government’s decent homes
standards. Gas safety and improving poor fire precautions are
priorities, particularly in the increasing number of houses which are
in multiple occupation.</hs_para>

the role of environmental health officers has been to help to shape
healthier environments and to address the causes of health
inequalities. It is those inequalities that Sir Michael Marmot’s
2010 report identified as costing the national
economy—which  of course involves each and every one of
us—up to £70 billion each year. It seems an astronomical
sum but it highlights the importance of this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:26:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000083">A
year ago, the public sector trade union, UNISON, surveyed its members
who work as environmental health officers. Problems associated with
rogue landlords were seen as an issue by 42% of those surveyed who are
dealing with these matters on a day-to-day basis. This was added to by
comments that hitherto conscientious landlords were now more prone to
cut corners for cost reasons. It was clear that less active regulation
gave many landlords the confidence to act with impunity. Respondents
pointed out the impact of poor housing and exposure to pests such as
bed bugs on the health of families—in particular, its effect on
children. These sorts of trends can only add further impetus to the
ever-widening health inequalities within
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000084">Other
challenges facing environmental health officers concern their
involvement in workplace health and safety. Those responsibilities are
concerned principally with reducing the numbers of injuries and
fatalities from work-related activities in a wide range of premises,
yet too many employers claim that such legislation and its enforcement
constitute burdens. Can it ever be accepted that ensuring safety at
work is a
burden<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:28:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000085">The
Prime Minister likes to appease his Back-Benchers, it seems, by banging
on about slashing so-called EU red tape. He actually means slashing
employees’ rights at work—rights such as
four-weeks’ paid leave or limits on the hours that children and
young people can work, rights for mothers such as the right not to be
sacked for being pregnant or for taking time off for antenatal
appointments, equal treatment for workers employed through an agency,

environmental health officers in that is essential. However, as their
numbers are cut, so 
<?notus-xml column=324?>too are the number of visits they can make. This allows some employers
to make a risk assessment—not about their workers’ safety
but about the likelihood of being found out for failing to comply with
health and safety legislation. Environmental health officers not
visiting premises regularly will result in poorer knowledge of what is
happening in the business community and, inevitably, a rise in
workplace injuries and

UNISON survey also asked respondents to comment on how cuts made over
the past two years—as a result of the 2010 comprehensive
spending review—had impacted upon their ability to deliver
environmental health services. The responses showed a clear picture of
a diminishing workforce and, consequently, reduced services. This often
meant that staff had less capacity to undertake proactive work with
communities and business, and many environmental health officers felt
that that was a false economy, effectively storing up greater problems
in the long term.</hs_para>

services that the public cannot immediately see, there is a danger that
they will not realise how much they rely on them until those services
are gone. Environmental health is a service that is not important
unless or until there is a problem. The media and some politicians are
often disdainful of health and safety merely as a concept, but whenever
an event leads to serious injuries, or even perhaps deaths, those same
people are quick to ask, “Why was this allowed to
happen?”. Cause and effect needs to be appreciated, and the
relentless drive for cuts should not be allowed to mask the inherent
dangers that they involve.</hs_para>

English local authorities has been cut by about a third in real terms
since the 2010 comprehensive spending review, and the further 10% cut
announced by the Chancellor in yesterday’s review continues that
trend. Recent data gathered by the Chartered Institute of Environmental
Health highlighted another effect of the cuts. They suggest that as
many as 25% of the environmental health services provided by local
authorities are no longer headed by a qualified person. That, I
suggest, is a disgrace and should be a real cause for government
concern. I ask the Minister: is it?</hs_para>

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, I think we would all
agree that this has been a most valuable debate, and it is on a matter
close to my heart. I congratulate my noble friend Lady Crawley not just
on bringing this subject to the attention of the House but on bringing
the subject to life, and reminding us of the importance of regulatory
services.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062786000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000092">We
probably know that the Minister, in responding, will talk about the
valuable work of trading standards but we need the Government to walk
the walk, not 
<?notus-xml column=325?>just talk the talk. As we have heard today, nearly 30% of funding has
been lost from consumer protection and, as we heard yesterday, there
are more cuts to come. Some services have lost half their income, while
some are struggling with just one qualified member of staff. At the
same time, consumer disputes and calls to Citizens Advice are at an
all-time high of about 1 million a year. Consumer detriment
costs consumers about £6.5 billion, yet only £170 million
is spent dealing with it. While the Government will try to suggest that
responsibility for cutting trading standards rests with local councils,
what choice do those councils have in the face of mounting social care
bills and ring-fenced education budgets?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062786000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000093">Some suggest that the
answer, as we have heard, is for more innovation to make efficiencies.
That seems to be the Government’s answer to just about every
problem. However, there is compelling evidence from the National Audit
Office that the unique nature of risks from a business operating across
the UK, as opposed to risks originating from the building it occupies,
means that something more radical is needed to safeguard consumer
protection. We are therefore talking about not just funding but
intelligence, structures and powers. Nor can the Government’s
localist policies be used to shield or absolve them from their
accountability for consumer protection. It is a government remit and
there is a responsible Minister. The NAO estimates that nearly
£5 billion of consumer detriment occurs across local authority
boundaries, meaning that it can never be dealt with by a single local
authority. Every local authority must play its part, working together
to join up the dots of intelligence before mobilising a team to deal
with the mischief and bring the perpetrator to justice.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062786000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000094">The OFT estimated that
when it led on consumer enforcement it was exposed to £10
million of legal risk at any one time. How many local authority trading
standards, or indeed their council members, could possibly put their
hands up to that? When investigations largely benefit those outside the
area of an individual local authority, coupled with those
investigations carrying high levels of risk, it is easy to sympathise
with any local council for being wary of taking on the challenge. The
result is that we have a patchy framework, a coalition of the willing,
and too many consumers are missing out on the protection they need.
That is why we need some
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000095">A
stunning return on investment has been demonstrated by the new National
Trading Standards Board, which as we have heard is now chaired by my
noble friend Lord Harris of Haringey. Last year it dealt with
£145 million of consumer fraud, at a cost of only a tenth of
that. It is a shining example of how investment pays off, and of what
can be achieved by rebalancing local and national resources. We are not
calling for a nationalised service, but for the re-engineering of a
service with historic roots in local markets and shops, but which must
now protect consumers who function in a global economy. Consumers and
businesses have changed, and so must the services which police them.
The work of the National Trading Standards Board is a taster of what
could be achieved if consumer protection was properly resourced and
properly empowered.</hs_para>

very welcome draft Consumer Rights Bill, which others have mentioned. I
congratulate the Government on this. It represents a step forward for
consumer rights. However, as any trading officer will attest,
enforcement and the education of consumers about their rights will be
crucial. The Bill also contains some confusing messages, as already
outlined by my noble friends Lady Crawley and Lord Harris. If they are
right, the Government appear to be proposing to reduce the penalty for
obstructing an officer when carrying out his or her duty from a level 5
to a level 3 fine. That will incentivise obstructive behaviour, because
it will be cheaper to pay the fine for obstructing an officer than to
risk a proper
penalty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000097">The
other issue that was mentioned is the requirement for officers to serve
written notice to traders two days before they carry out inspections. I
have only to mention breast implants in France for us to remember that
two days notice allowed all the silicone to be removed. We have already
heard how unhelpful these issues would be to trading standards.
However, I congratulate the Government on there being a draft Bill, and
hope that they will rethink this. The issues mentioned would also add
to cost and bureaucracy, which I understood the objective was to
diminish rather than increase. More than that, they would undermine the
very objectives of the trading standards service, which is to protect
consumers. We would lose a third of the workforce, with powers diluted
and costs
increased.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000098">We
need to know whether the Government are genuine in putting
consumers’ interests above those of business. As the Minister
will have been briefed, he well knows that cutting £1 from
trading standards costs the economy £6. Exactly how does this
help the economy to move from “rescue to
recovery”, as the Chancellor articulated yesterday? What will
the Government do to ensure that citizens are not caught in a consumer
protection postcode lottery? Given that the amendment successfully made
to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill only requires letting
agents to join a redress scheme, leaving enforcement to trading
standards officers, what thought have the Government given to this
vital area of consumer detriment? In the wake of the horsemeat scandal,
the biggest consumer fraud of the century, how can the Minister justify
a dilution of officers’ powers to protect consumers in the
United
Kingdom?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/7B2766DC29D8DED79FC5CDCB67A4DFDBCB97D98A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

participated in this important and timely short debate—and I am
pleased to respond to it. I begin by commending trading standards,
environmental health and other local authority officers who, day to
day, protect us. Their hard work ensures that we get accurate measures
at the petrol pump and bar, and buy food that is fit for human

Government have taken major steps to reform the consumer landscape
since 2012. These reforms will improve consumer protection. There will
be clearer responsibilities and better co-ordination between consumer 
<?notus-xml column=327?>bodies and enforcers. Through the recalibration of the OFT and trading
standards enforcement responsibilities, we have taken measures to close
the enforcement gap without spending extra money. Consumers will
benefit from the strengthened protection available to them. That is why
in April 2012 we created a new National Trading Standards Board, while
similar arrangements are taking shape in Scotland. This is making sure
that local trading standards offices can work together and enforce the
law across the country—something that was not easy to do before.
I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Harris, on his recent
appointment as chair of the National Trading Standards Board. It has
had a tremendous first year and will go from strength to strength under
his
leadership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000102">Alongside
this, in April 2013 the Citizens Advice service became the publicly
funded voice of consumers, championing their needs and empowering them
to make the right choices for themselves. Consumers need someone they
can trust and who has a track record in providing knowledgeable, fair
and impartial advice. To ensure that the consumer bodies in the
reformed landscape work better together, we have established a consumer
protection partnership involving the OFT, the National Trading
Standards Board, the Trading Standards Institute, the Financial Conduct
Authority, Consumer Futures, the Citizens Advice service and consumer
bodies from Scotland and Northern Ireland. They will share intelligence
and assess and address consumer detriment, providing accountability for
the national consumer protection system.</hs_para>

Government are working to promote the efficiency and capacity of local
authority regulatory services, enabling them to play their role in
protecting consumers and promoting a level playing field for business.
We will have better targeted enforcement, balanced by businesses which
are better able to comply. There are over 400 local authorities across
the UK, delivering vital protections in trading standards and
environmental health as well as services on behalf of a range of
regulators. Local authority regulators are at the forefront of
interaction with business and have an important role to play in
supporting their local areas by protecting consumers and facilitating
local growth. While they are best placed to regulate local issues,
there are challenges in achieving consistency between
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000104">The
primary authority scheme enables businesses operating across local
authority boundaries in England and Wales to form a partnership with a
single local authority to co-ordinate advice, inspection and
enforcement by trading standards and environmental health services. It
provides advice, on a cost-recovery basis, that a business can rely on.
It saves time for officers, promotes information sharing and reduces
duplication. These benefits are why, to date, 759 businesses and 103
local authorities have entered primary authority

local government finance in a generation. We are shifting power from
Whitehall to town hall, by providing a direct financial incentive for

is a new dawn for local government, and regulatory services have a part
to play in creating healthy local communities. From now on, if councils
bring in more business and more jobs, they will be rewarded through
retaining a greater share of business tax. My noble friend Lady
Seccombe asked about the sums involved here. From April, local
authorities directly retain nearly £11 billion of business rates
instead of returning it to the Treasury, and they keep the growth of
that share of business rates. Councils will benefit by doing the right
thing by their communities. If they bring in jobs and businesses, they
will be rewarded.

last debate of the day, indeed of the week, but its subject is of the
utmost importance. When it is implemented, the Defamation Act 2013 will
transform an area of law that has been much criticised over many years.
It will introduce major improvements and confer great benefits on the
people of England and Wales, particularly those working in our ever
expanding media industries, one of the great success stories of our
country today.</hs_para>

Act. I am immensely grateful to

of defamation in Northern Ireland has never been detached from that in
England and Wales. In the 1950s, Westminster and the Stormont
Parliament introduced the same changes to it. Now, however, for the
first time in our history, Northern Ireland is to be severed from
England and Wales in this wide area of law. For an ardent Unionist like
me it is a highly disagreeable prospect, although I could be persuaded
to accept it if compelling reasons existed to justify Ulster’s
severance. I have not yet heard or read
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000120">As a
layman in search of enlightenment and truth I turned to a leading legal
expert in Northern Ireland, Mr Paul McDonnell, a partner in the
distinguished Belfast firm of solicitors, McKinty and Wright. In recent
months he has made a careful study of the legal implications of
Ulster’s severance. I asked him for an assessment to which I
could refer in this debate and this is what he sent me

refusal of the Northern Ireland Executive to extend to Northern Ireland
the remit of the Defamation Act, and the legal clarity and free speech
protection it brings, is quite simply unjustifiable. Why should the
citizens and journalists of Northern Ireland not be afforded the same
protection as those in the rest of United Kingdom, whether they are
expressing opinions online or holding government to account? Why, as
the rest of the United Kingdom embraces the digital revolution, should
Northern Ireland be confined by archaic and unfocused freedom of
expression laws, some of which were conceived when computing was in its
infancy?</hs_quote>

dual defamation system may also have consequences extending across the
Irish Sea. Publishers and broadcasters may be forced to sanitise their
once uniform national output lest they fall foul of the antiquated laws
still operating in Belfast. Investigations in the public interest which
concern well-funded organisations will effectively be subject to
censorship by the back door, as regional publications will be unable to
report on matters for fear of court action in this libel-friendly, free

in Northern Ireland, I take pride in our legal system. Failure to bring

do not always deliver clear, decisive opinions. There is nothing opaque
or unclear about Mr McDonnell’s expert opinion. I was struck by
Mr McDonnell’s phrase, “UK outpost”. It stirred
memories of that great film, “Passport to Pimlico”, in
which Pimlico—where I happen to live now—suddenly becomes
part of the Kingdom of Burgundy and subject to ancient Burgundian law.
By the end of the film the Burgundians are cut off from electricity,
food and water and become dependent on people tossing food parcels over
the wall they have put up to keep the rest of the world out. Chaos
ensues, in which it is the ordinary Burgundians who suffer before
common sense produces a resolution. There is a parallel here that is
worth pondering. If Northern Ireland is cut off from the new defamation
law, the consequences might not be so hilarious or short lived as those
faced briefly by the people of Pimlico in that old
film.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000122">Noble
Lords who do not give close attention to events in the new, more

Westminster’s law, was taken after full and careful
consideration of the implications. Noble Lords would be wrong to make
such an assumption. Responsibility for this area within the Northern

wholly against the public interest. It is profoundly ironic that I am

a journalist I can tell your Lordships that it is not so much what
happens in the courts but the prospect of what might happen which has
such a chilling effect on free speech and encourages the imposition of

talking to diverse journalists in the Province, it seems to me that
many of the Province’s politicians are notoriously thin skinned
about criticism. Journalists and writers complain of their easy resort
to the threat of defamation and keep Mr Paul Tweed, whom the noble
Lord, Lord Lester mentioned, busy issuing threats of
defamations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:18:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000142">Let
me give on example. On 6 August 2012 the <I>News Letter</I>, one of the
Province’s leading newspapers, reported that there was a row
between politicians in County Antrim about whether to support a
proposal to introduce plain cigarette packaging as it would adversely
affect their constituents who worked in the 
<?notus-xml column=335?>local tobacco factory. The paper said that Ian Paisley Jnr, the local
MP, was unavailable for comment because he was on holiday. As this was
in August, it was perfectly reasonable that he should have been on
holiday. Surely even the most hard-working politician is allowed to
take a bit of time off to have a rest. However, his lawyer, Paul Tweed,
wrote to the paper to say that Mr Paisley was not on holiday
at the time of publication and to suggest that he was on holiday and
unavailable to deal with the constituents’ concerns was
defamatory. The <I>News Letter</I> published a clarification, but was
there really a need to send a letter threatening
defamation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:19:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000143">This
is just one of many threatening letters that have been used to cow
journalists in the Province. If journalists and authors are going to
receive letters threatening defamation for such vexatious cases,
imagine the fear there must be in publishing anything more critical of
politicians. The new defences against libel available in the rest of
the UK from later this year will offer them protection and surely
encourage the advance of free speech in the Province. However, as the
noble Lord, Lord Lester, has mentioned, it is not just the people of
Northern Ireland who deserve to be protected by the libel reforms; the
rest of the people of the United Kingdom do as well. The possibility
that these libel tourists who flock to London will now flock to the
Belfast libel courts seems very dangerous, and will threaten authors
who thought that the cause of free speech had been so strongly enhanced
by the passing of the Act.</hs_para>

Terence Ewing, who has tried and failed to sue the <I>Times</I>
newspaper in London. His case was thrown out there, and then he tried
his luck in Belfast. Again, his case was thrown out—I gathered
that he is banned from suing there—but in the process, many
hours of journalists’ and lawyers’ time at Times
Newspapers was expended. Mr Ewing’s efforts are a warning. He
could be copied by other litigants who are no longer able to bring
action in English courts but will start to threaten journalists through
the Northern Irish courts.</hs_para>

from what I understand, it is his party, led by Peter Robinson, which
has rejected attempts so far to get this right. I gather that the First
Minister of Northern Ireland thinks that there is little appetite for
reform of the libel law among his electorate, but I ask him to think
again. The Province has been a beacon and democracy and peace across
the world. Only last week, we heard praise at the G8 summit at

Black of Brentwood:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as
executive director of the Telegraph Media Group and draw attention to
my other interests in the register. We are all indebted to my noble
friend Lord Lexden for securing this debate on an issue which is
crucial not just for the people of Northern Ireland, a part of our
country for which he is such a sturdy champion, but, as he said, for
citizens across the UK.</hs_para>

may appear to be a dry and technical legal issue but in reality it is a
challenge to UK law that will, unless resolved, have grave and
far-reaching consequences for the future of the creative economies and
jobs in Northern Ireland, for tens of thousands of ordinary citizens
there who use the internet, for journalists and, perhaps above all, for
the quality of government and governance in Northern Ireland. I am a
strong supporter of the Defamation Act 2013. It clarifies the law to
make it easier to understand and cheaper to use. It tackles the
chilling impact of the previous libel regime on free speech and updates
an antiquated area of law, making it fit for a digital age. It is a
liberalising, modernising piece of legislation in which this House in
particular should take great pride, because of the role of the noble
Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, in fighting to bring it
about.</hs_para>

inexplicable aspect of the Executive’s decision not to adopt
this modernising legislation is that it shows no understanding of the
profound changes happening in the media which, in all their guises,
have become global. Content is spread around the world at the click of
a mouse not just by media companies but by ordinary citizens who tweet,
blog or use social media to express and share opinions. It is not
possible to declare UDI from that. The structure of law needs to keep
pace with that profound social and technological change, or else the
law itself falls into disrepute. The Executive’s decision to
cling to legislation from a world which has disappeared makes King
Canute look perfectly reasonable.</hs_para>

their face against their future, investment and jobs suffer. Over 4,000
people work in publishing in Northern Ireland, while another 2,000 work
in broadcast. Some of those jobs may well be at risk if media companies
decide that it is now too dangerous to operate in a jurisdiction that
stifles freedom of expression and exposes them to financial risk, at a
time when the publishing industry is under severe commercial pressure.
Certainly, the foreign investment that the Province needs for its
creative industries to prosper will be deterred. I can see no
circumstances in which Google, Yahoo!, AOL, Twitter or others would
establish businesses in an area that tied them to an out-of-date,
repressive libel jurisdiction. This decision in effect rejects the
high-end jobs that the Province 
<?notus-xml column=337?>desperately needs. The Executive decision will therefore have real human
consequences for the people of Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000151">It
will pose a problem for UK publishers, too. If Northern Ireland clings
to the existing law, editors will have to either edit each edition for
Northern Ireland separately, in the process sanitising the news and
subjecting copy to different legal scrutiny—something I think
unlikely to happen—or withdraw their papers from sale, with the
profound consequences of that for media plurality. The UK’s
publishers will have to confront that issue if there is no change of
heart at Stormont. Alternatively, our Government might in the end be
forced to legislate in the way President Obama’s Administration
did to protect American companies from foreign rulings that impinge on
freedom of expression—something directed against London, to our
great shame, under the old libel regime but which will now be targeted
on Belfast. Belfast might have a short-lived moment in the sun as the
libel capital of the world but could find itself isolated
internationally as Governments move to protect businesses from the
courts in Northern Ireland. It could become a
pariah.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000152">I
referred earlier to the grave impact this decision could have on the
quality of democracy in the Province. For democracy to function it
needs the scrutiny and free flow of information to the electorate that
only a vibrant, pluralistic free press can provide. That is
particularly true in Northern Ireland where there is no scrutinising
second Chamber. The role of civic society, especially local and
regional newspapers, in providing such constitutional safeguards is
more vital there than anywhere else in the UK. Yet a libel regime that
is loaded in favour of claimants and punishes defendants with an
oppressive system of costs has a profoundly chilling impact on
investigative journalism. As the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of
Culross, said, it plays into the hands of those who seek to bully
journalists and editors, particularly on local newspapers, where the
realities of business mean that once lawyers are engaged for someone
under scrutiny it is prudent to either drop an investigation or produce
a sanitised report. That breeds poor government, bureaucratic cover-ups
and, at worst, corruption. It is not just the Province’s 50
regional and local papers—including some of the finest titles in
the UK, such as the <I>Belfast Telegraph</I> and <I>Irish
News</I>—that will feel the force of this. At risk are many
thousands of citizen journalists who blog or tweet about politicians.
They could find themselves facing extortionate legal bills that would
cripple them or indeed destroy their lives—something the
Defamation Act is meant to
prevent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000153">I do
not pretend to understand the reasoning behind what the noble Lord,
Lord Bew, has rightly described as an act of self-mutilation and which
my noble friend Lord Lexden so eloquently compared to the plight of the
people of Burgundy. It may have been done because many at Stormont fear
the scrutiny that will be enhanced by changes to the law. It may be
because a handful of lawyers and claims farmers—the Tweed
brigade—in Belfast are intent on trying to make it the
world’s libel capital, as if that is a title to be proud of. But
whatever the reasons, I know that the consequences will be very real
for the people of Northern Ireland that those at  
<?notus-xml column=338?>Stormont are supposed to represent. It will expose thousands of ordinary
people to the intense dangers of costly libel actions. It will blunt
the scrutiny role of local and national papers on which citizens depend
for information—a role that makes democracy work. It will mean
the law remains a toy with which only those with deep pockets can play.
It will stop investment with the consequent impact on jobs in the
Province’s creative economy. It is wrong in every conceivable
way. This is a very grave situation. Either the Northern Ireland
Assembly must act to reverse the decision or the UK Government must do
it for
them.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/199302775564255AA5602F89BA9FD51DE82126E3" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

for securing this debate. It is conventional to say so but in this case
I should like to go further and say that it reflects the noble
Lord’s deep love for Northern Ireland and his consistent concern
about its public life even when, at times, Northern Ireland does not

to acknowledge that I remain puzzled as to why the Northern Ireland
Assembly is taking this position at this point and I should like to
explain why I am still puzzled. If one looks at the unionist political
class, a defining feature of the rhetoric of unionism was the belief in
something called equality of citizenship. The current First Minister is
famous, above all, for one phrase in the aftermath of the Anglo-Irish
agreement of 1985, when he complained that he regarded Northern Ireland
as having been pushed on to the window ledge of the union. In this
case, it looks as if he himself is scrabbling out of the main room of
the house to get himself on to the window ledge of the
union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:30:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000157">Equality
of citizenship has always been at some level an important part of the
historic argument for unionism. That does not mean that in all cases
Northern Ireland must apply exactly the law as it is here, and there
may be significant reasons for difference. The important point is that
there should be—as there has been in other recent cases, to be
fair—an open public debate as to why that might be so. What is
specific about this case is that there has been virtually no public
debate, just a negative fiat and a refusal of legislative consent with
no real explanation. Of course, I am delighted to see that politicians
in the Assembly are trying to ensure a public
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:31:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000158">I
now refer to the republican and nationalist tradition in the Assembly,
which must have a voice in this respect. That tradition has always
chosen to identify itself with human rights. It is particularly keen on
the campaign for a Northern Ireland Bill of Human Rights. I would say
that such a campaign is compromised by the stand that has apparently
been taken. Let me explain why.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Lester, has already referred to the European
convention. In the Belfast agreement, strand 1, the sections dealing
with the establishment of democratic institutions in Northern Ireland,
sections 1 to 4, explain that there will be an Executive established.
Section 5 then provides safeguards. The first safeguard is the
principle of proportionality in terms of Ministers, committee chairs,

Indeed, when

turn to one other key aspect of the current decision as it affects
universities. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Lexden, will forgive me
for that, because I think that his affection for Northern Ireland was
first formed when he was an academic at Queen’s University
Belfast. The truth is that British provincial, what we might call
old-style redbrick universities, are finding it more and more difficult
in a competitive world to retain their remarkably strong position in
league tables. We do not seem at this point to have a problem with
keeping Oxford and Cambridge—or Imperial—right up at the
top, but there is considerable evidence that universities such as
Manchester, Glasgow and Sheffield are struggling in an intensely
competitive world to maintain their relatively high positions in those
league tables. Queen’s University Belfast is certainly not
exempt from that difficult
struggle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000162">To
me, it sends out a very negative signal for academics who might be
considering working at Queen’s University Belfast to discover
that they would be working in the only region of the United Kingdom
where, at this point, the amount of academic freedom is a matter of
indifference. One of the most important things in the new defamation
legislation is the increased defence of academic freedom, particularly
to allow academics to express controversial and difficult opinions in
peer-reviewed journals in both the sciences and humanities in a way in
which the chill factor previously undoubtedly militated against. It
seems to me symbolically that if you want to maintain a vital
university culture, this is a mistake for the Assembly. The sector is
of considerable importance to the economy of Northern Ireland and the
point has already been made by the noble Lord, Lord Black, that what
has been done here has implications for the economy of Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000163">If
the universities of Northern Ireland can maintain a strong position in
the international league tables, that must be good for the economy. If
they sag, and if there is a growing sense that they are not the best
places to work and certainly not the most free, and that the local
political class does not really care about that, then that is a
negative signal. I hope it will not be sent out. There is a great
phrase from Brian Lenihan, a former Foreign Minister of the Irish
Republic, about the value of mature recollection. I hope that in this
case mature reflection will come to the rescue of the Northern Ireland
Assembly and that there will be some
reconsideration.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/E0F1CDB04D4204013D4780B3CCF3C11AC5FF7831" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 June 2013">Thursday,

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, in his opening sentence, the
noble Lord, Lord Lexden, said that this is a short debate. Short it
certainly has been, and we know it will last no longer than an hour.
However, the contributions have been remarkably informative and, I must
say, remarkably comprehensive. I join those who are indebted to the
noble Lord, Lord Lexden, for giving your Lordships’ Committee
the opportunity to debate this important subject. I personally am
doubly indebted to him for his generosity in engaging with me as his
neighbour in Millbank House in the preparation for this debate, and for
encouraging my thoughts in particular
directions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000165">I
speak as one who was in an Executive position for a very happy but all
too short period of time, and who was part of the previous Government,
which helped to form the structure of the current devolved governance
in Northern Ireland. I say at the outset that I utterly respect
Northern Ireland’s right to exercise its democratic functions in
the way in which we designed it to. I consider this to be a transition
phase, and we all look forward to being able to move to a more normal
type of politics in Northern Ireland, rather than one which, to a
degree, freezes the divisions of that society and its constitutional
structure. However, I utterly respect the right of the Northern Ireland
Assembly to make its own decisions, as I do the right of the Scottish
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000166">However,
this is not a situation in which we are competing with a decision made
openly and properly by the Northern Ireland Assembly where we have had
an open debate. From my review of all the evidence of what has happened
since we debated the Bill in this House and it received Royal Assent,
it would appear that the very opposite has happened in Northern
Ireland. Early in his remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Lexden, had the
benefit of a quote by Paul McDonnell. I thought that
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:37:46"></hs_TimeCode> was utterly
comprehensive. It was a skilled piece of drafting by Mr McDonnell, and
he encapsulated almost all the arguments in a couple of short
sentences. It was very clear what his opinion was about the necessity
of the application of this Act to Northern Ireland, for all of the
reasons he set
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000167">The noble
Lord, Lord Bew, said that there was no debate going on in Northern
Ireland. With respect to him, I do not think that he meant that in the
way in which some may have interpreted it. In fact, a debate is going
on in Northern Ireland. There is a very public debate going on, with
contributions by legal figures, business people, civic society,
politicians and the media. There are two sides to this argument. The
overwhelming body of opinion is on one side of the argument, and that
is the side represented in this debate, but there is another side to
that
argument.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000168">The
only places where this debate is not going on are the Executive and the
Northern Ireland Assembly. That is where the debate should take place.
Those are the people who have substantial responsibility for the
governance of Northern Ireland. The arguments that are put forward
relate to the putting off of inward investment; the vulnerability of
ordinary citizens in the internet age; and the good business reasons
for a  
<?notus-xml column=341?>consistent regulatory framework in an environment where there has always
been a consistent regulatory framework, for the fear of libel
tourism.</hs_para>

these arguments have any substance, it is the responsibility of the
devolved politicians in Northern Ireland to engage with them, and to
ensure that the people of Northern Ireland have the best regulatory
framework in this area and that it serves their needs. It has always
been necessary in this area of law and in many others. The noble Lord,
Lord Lester of Herne Hill, with his characteristic clarity, set out the
dilemma facing the Government. I have some sympathy for the Minister if
she chooses to engage with the challenge of the questions that the
noble Lord
posed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Does she
accept that analysis of the conjunction effect of the European
Convention on Human Rights and the Belfast or Good Friday agreement?
Does she accept that the Government face this dilemma and
responsibility and, if so, what do they plan to do about it? That is
the principal
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:40:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:40:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord Colville of Culross, in his informative contribution, brought
evidence from his journalist colleagues in Northern Ireland of existing
practices that show a culture of threat and actual libel tourism. If
that is indeed right, there is every reason to believe that whether or
not there is a problem with the existing law in Northern Ireland, the
potential for it to develop and become a serious problem for these
islands is there. Do the Government share that interpretation and
recognise that risk and, if so, how do they intend to engage with
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000171">The noble
Lord, Lord Black of Brentwood, explained with some authority in detail
why investors will be put off. His argument was eloquently convincing
and is reflected in some of the public discourse in the Northern Irish

of all the Benches in your Lordships’ House to see Northern
Ireland flourish. This is a responsibility of the Government. We are
investing substantial amounts of money in Northern Ireland to ensure
that its economy moves from depending on the public sector to the
private sector. Do the Government share the view that investors will be
put off, and what do they intend to do about
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000172">The noble
Lord, Lord Bew, as he has consistently in our debates on defamation,
made a compelling case for the need for independent thinking and for
independent and challenging academic and scientific publications with
their important role as drivers of innovation and our economy. All
parties represented in this debate went into the 2010 election with a
commitment to reform the law of defamation. He said that denying the
reform to the people of Northern Ireland, as appears to be the case,
was done without the knowledge or consent of the executive Ministers of
Northern Ireland and without any explanation, never mind an adequate
one. From my perspective as someone who loves Northern Ireland and its
people, that is not good

Lords who have participated that the UK Government should step in at
this point. I recognise the concerns expressed about the possibility
that the law in Northern Ireland may become out of step with that in
England and Wales. I do not wish to speculate about the extent to which

that issue later. The memorandum of understanding between the UK
Government and the devolved Administrations recognises that the UK
Government retain authority to legislate on any issue, whether devolved

been right for us to have sought to impose the Defamation Act on
Northern Ireland without any concession to the sentiments of the
Northern Ireland Executive on the constitutional propriety of such a
move, or to its views on the substance of the proposed

research paper produced for the Northern Ireland Assembly on the

the limit of what it is proper for the Government to do. I join noble

Browne, said that this has been an extremely good debate and indeed it

will reply briefly to some specific points. My noble friend Lord Lexden
referred to the “antiquated” libel laws and pointed out
what he saw as the anomaly that the responsibility for this issue in
Northern Ireland is with the Minister for Finance and Personnel. Noble
Lords are very well aware of this, but it is important to point out for
the record that the arrangements in the Northern Ireland Executive are
complex and balanced. It is therefore possible that which department it
lies with is of less significance than those balanced and complex
relationships. The noble Lord, Lord Lexden, also pointed out that the
Executive have not taken this decision; this issue has not come to the
Executive.  
<?notus-xml column=344?>He also pointed out the potential importance of Mike Nesbitt’s
Private Member’s Bill on defamation. I am confident that this
debate will run in Northern Ireland.</hs_para>

to the comments from my noble friend Lord Lester, who intervened to
refer to the importance of the human rights implications. It is
obviously key that UK Ministers have regard to our international
obligations on human rights at all times. However, it is always a
matter of balancing one set of human rights against another. Those
human rights also bind and oblige the Northern Ireland Executive in the
way that they make their decisions. I refer, particularly, to the
reference by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, to the ECHR memorandum that
was prepared by the MoJ at the request of the Joint Committee on Human
Rights to assist its consideration of the Defamation Bill. That
memorandum focused on issues relating to the compatibility of the
provisions contained in the Bill, not on the compatibility of the
existing law.</hs_para>

the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, who speculated on why Northern
Ireland politicians were not keen to have free comment. The key point
that I want to draw out from what he said is the possibility of libel
tourism. We do not consider that likely. However, we acknowledge that,
once the Act is brought into force in England and Wales, there might be
attempts to exploit the differences in law between the two
jurisdictions. I am sure that the Northern Ireland Executive and
Assembly will take that into consideration as they look at this issue.
The noble Lord also pointed out that newspapers cross borders and spoke
of the complexities of the situation for the newspaper industry. That
was also referred to by my noble friend Lord
Black.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000187">The
noble Viscount talked about the liberalising and modernising Act and
making our law fit for the digital age. He talked about the importance
of global media and said that we cannot declare UDI on that. His core
point, which will perhaps be of particular interest to those in
Northern Ireland reading or possibly even listening to this debate, was
on the 6,000 people who work in the media—the publishing and
broadcasting industries—and the implications for them and,
indeed, for the blogging citizen journalists to whom he referred. I
very much hope that the prediction that UK newspapers might withdraw
from Northern Ireland will prove to be unfounded, but I understand the
logic of what he
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000188">The
noble Lord, Lord Bew, referred to the human rights at the heart of the
Belfast agreement. He made a very important point—a new one, not
emphasised by other noble Lords—about the impact on academics
and the fact that leading academics might not be encouraged to go to
Northern Ireland universities if they felt that they were not given the
freedom that they get
elsewhere.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062786000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-gc0002.htm#13062786000189">Finally,
the noble Lord, Lord Browne, asked whether I accepted the dilemma at
the core of the question whether the UK Government should intervene. I
say to noble Lords and, in particular, to the noble Lord, Lord Browne,
that I have observed the frequency with which UK Ministers are asked to
intervene in Northern  
<?notus-xml column=345?>Ireland for one side or another. I acknowledge the cause of concern on
this issue. However, I feel as I do every time people say that UK
Ministers should intervene. I acknowledge the frustration but, as the
noble Lord said, this is a period of transition. It is important that 
<?notus-xml column=346?>we support and encourage the Northern Ireland Executive and Northern

figures published today show the Work Programme has significantly
improved. 132,000 jobseekers have escaped long-term unemployment and
found lasting work—normally at least six months (three months or
more for the hardest to help). This compares to 9,000 for the period up
to the end of March 2012—a significant
improvement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000024">The
figures also highlight, more people are getting into work within a year
of joining the Work Programme. The UK Statistics Authority has said
that it does not regard the calculation by commentators that 3.5% of
people got into work in the first year of the scheme is the most
relevant figure on which to assess performance. It says that
performance is better measured by counting how many people referred to
the Work Programme get into sustained work in their first year on the
scheme. On this measure, while just 8.5% of those who started the Work
Programme in June 2011 completed at least six months of work in their
first year, this success rate has increased dramatically to 13.4% for
more recent recruits who joined in March
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000025">Compared
to many employment schemes under previous governments, the programme
targets the hardest to help into work, such as those claiming
Employment and Support Allowance. Some people have been out of work for
more than 10 or 15 years, so it will take time to help them back. But
the Work Programme is offering them more support than previous
employment schemes, and 6,000 of the harder to help have now found
lasting work. We expect providers to deliver improving results as they
share best
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000026">Although
many providers are now meeting their contracted levels for helping
Jobseeker’s Allowance claimants, some are lagging behind. The

form a core component of the Government’s strategy to bring
forward investment in affordable low-carbon electricity
generation—including renewables, Carbon Capture and Storage and
new nuclear. CfDs provide efficient and long-term support for low
carbon generation, reducing risks faced by generators by increasing
revenue certainty and through the backing of a long-term contract.
Generators are paid the difference between the market price and a
‘strike price’, but when the market price is high the
generator must pay back the difference, which reduces costs to
consumers when electricity prices are high. The Government is
announcing today alongside the Spending Review draft CfD strike prices
for renewables technologies, decisions on key CfD terms, and the Levy
Control Framework (LCF) profile to 2020/21. I am laying before

key part of the challenge our market faces is in ensuring secure
electricity supplies. In addition to the closure of ageing plant and
increasing demand, the UK is seeking to decarbonise its electricity
supply in order to meet our carbon reduction targets. These changes
create an investment challenge, for some forms of capacity such as gas
generation. The Government is taking clear action to address this by
legislating to introduce the Capacity Market. The Capacity Market will
give investors the certainty they need to put adequate reliable
capacity in place and by protecting consumers against the risk of
supply shortages. It does this by providing a predictable revenue
stream to providers of reliable capacity, including both generation and
non-generation measures such as Demand-Side-Response and storage. In
return, they must commit to provide capacity when needed or face
financial penalties.</hs_para>

insurance is a complex problem. Ministers have consistently said that

effectively limit the most that hundreds of thousands of UK households
should have to pay for flood insurance. We anticipate that up to
500,000 high risk households could benefit from Flood Re, and pay
significantly less for their insurance than they might otherwise.
Customers would be free to shop around to get the best overall deal
from an insurer of their choice. As well as limiting the potential for
price rises, with some customers seeing prices fall, Flood Re would
also constrain the excesses that could be imposed on households at high
flood
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000156">The
benefits of Flood Re would be targeted towards those who need it most,
helping those who are particularly hard-pressed with the cost of
living. Furthermore, the ABI has assured ministers that their proposal
can be introduced without impacting customer bills in general. An
internal industry levy would fund Flood Re, capturing the existing
cross-subsidy in the market. Flood Re would operate as a not-for-profit
reinsurance scheme managed by the insurance industry itself. There will
be no contingent liability for the Government or the taxpayer from the
Flood Re
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000157">Flood
Re would be a novel approach and there remain many details to work
through with the industry, including the relationship between Flood Re
and Parliament. Our broad intention is that Flood Re, rather than
Ministers, would be directly accountable to Parliament for its ongoing
operations. Ministers would of course remain accountable to Parliament
for overall policy on flood insurance. Whilst novel, these arrangements
are intended to strike a balance between the full requirements of
accountability to Parliament and the need for Flood Re to operate as an
integral part of the insurance market. I am writing with further
details on this point to the chairs of the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, Treasury, and Public Accounts Committees. Due to the statutory
nature of the levy, Flood Re is also likely to be classed as State aid
and so would need to be approved by the European
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000158">Whilst
it is our preference to work with the industry towards Flood Re there
are therefore still significant issues to be overcome, many outside of
the Government’s control. Households deserve to have confidence
that this issue will be addressed one way or another. Because of the
remaining uncertainties around Flood Re, the Government will also seek
powers in the Water Bill to regulate for affordable flood insurance.
This approach would be pursued if Flood Re would not or does not
deliver what we need, and insurers are otherwise unable to keep prices
at affordable levels. If introduced, the fallback regulatory approach
would place an obligation on each insurer to take their share of high
flood risk households, or face penalties. This Flood Insurance
Obligation would have the objective of sustaining the existing market
for high risk households at affordable
prices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000159">This
Government does not intervene in markets unnecessarily, and whichever
approach is finally pursued it would only operate for a limited time,
and would be withdrawn within twenty to twenty-five years. In the long
term we need to create a situation where everyone  
<?notus-xml column=41?>is fully aware of their level of flood risk, and households and
communities are rewarded through their future bills
for the steps they take to reduce flood
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000160">We are
seeking views on this as the way forward through a six week public

way of securing affordable insurance in the long-term is and will
always be to reduce the chance of flooding in the first place.
Investing in flood risk management remains at the top of the
Government’s priorities. The Government also provides a range of
further support for households to reduce their risk of flooding and
find affordable insurance, for instance by signing up to free flood
warnings, and help with fitting flood gates and other property-level
protection
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062756000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130627-wms0001.htm#13062756000162">I am

the past year the OJC has seen the volume of complaints it receives
increase by a third; receiving over 2,100 complaints and 550 written

Parliamentary approval, this Annual Report will be the last published
by the OJC prior to the introduction of the Judicial Discipline
(Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2013. The new Regulations

further improvements and efficiencies in the handling of judicial

November 2013. This maintains the policy which has long been in place
and which reflects the understanding that, in general, the experiences
which lead to imprisonment, and the impact of imprisonment, can be
somewhat different for men and women. The policy in respect of
women’s clothing was designed to avoid exposing women to a
particular vulnerability which was considered likely to arise if they
were required to wear prison clothing and which would result in the
experience of imprisonment impacting more severely on them. It is noted

report that a considerable amount of work has been undertaken at Hewell
since the inspection by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons in November 2012,
including the development and introduction of a comprehensive
improvement plan for the prison to be delivered over the next 3 years.
Since the inspection, the prison has also moved to a new management

demonstrate effective leadership and people management skills, embed
effective systems and processes and improve risk management through
effective planning and empowering their staff.</hs_para>

Security and Safety departments and a dedicated team of Prison Officers
