mine—and certainly one of the DWP’s—is to get
financial education literacy into the national curriculum. I hope that
view would be shared on both sides of the House. Clearly, people coming
out of the education system need at some point to understand what
interest rates are, for example—otherwise they will get ripped
off by unscrupulous lenders. The national curriculum is published in
its final form for first teaching in the autumn of September 2014. The
Department for Education and ourselves are consulting on including
financial education in it, and I believe that we are likely to get
that, so I can say an honest “yes” to my hon.

they want people to travel for work—as do we—through free

because it is important to understand the impact that this

He makes the important point that a couple with children in such
circumstances will face difficulties, and in some instances must make
choices about how they will pay for things that we or our children
perhaps take for granted. Government Members have simply failed to
recognise or respond to, or in many instances acknowledge, that

constantly about the people—nearly 1,000, including 195 young

losing out. The future jobs fund gave opportunities to many young
people and it was short-sighted of the Government to scrap it. It

pay them less, and the way to motivate people on high incomes is to pay
them more. In these challenging economic times, surely we should focus
on supporting those who need it most. New clause 8 asks the Government
to look at the issue again. We are asking them to undertake a proper
assessment of the impact of the cut, as well as an analysis of how much
the Treasury would gain if the additional rate were returned to 50% in
2014-15. That is not an unreasonable request. I hope that, on this

the bankers bonus tax on getting young people back to work, because I
do not think she had the numbers to hand. May I just indulge you with
some statistics, in order to help the Opposition, Mr Speaker? Last
year, the bankers’ bonus total was £5.2 billion. There
are 61,000 young people who have been out of work for more than a year.
Much of that £5.2 billion would have been paid to taxpayers who
are not UK-resident—they will work for a UK bank but not be
resident here—but let us assume that it is all paid to UK
residents. An increase in the rate from 45% to 50%, as the Opposition
are proposing, would yield £260 million a year—the
equivalent of £4,500 per young person out of work. Is the basis
of her argument that £4,500 is enough to employ a young person

tell the House that we believe young people and those who have been out

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:21:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bedford (Richard Fuller) about the future jobs fund and to hark
back to an impact analysis of the fund done for the Department for Work
and Pensions, which found that society gained £7,750 per
participant through wages, increased tax receipts and reduced benefit
payments. Participants were calculated to have gained £4,000 and
employers to have gained £6,850, with the cost to the Exchequer
calculated at £3,100 a job. The figures the hon. Gentleman cited
would cover the cost. Even better, two years after the start of their
time with the fund, those former jobseekers were much less likely to go
back to being on benefits. Is that not something we should be
re-exploring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:21:44"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

Jamieson:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has made her point extremely
succinctly and has put on the record why we feel that the future jobs
fund was not only important but a successful initiative. I say again to
Government Members who think that the proposal has no impact on the
lives of ordinary people that all those who went through the future
jobs fund programmes and who worked on them say that the fund was a
valuable way of getting young people back into work. People in my area
would certainly have liked it to continue.</hs_Para>

me come back to the points about the new clause. As I said, the
Government should be tackling tax avoidance—we will debate that
further later—but that does not mean that we should compensate
the wealthiest at the expense of those on middle and low incomes. I
would have hoped, in light of everything the Government proclaimed
around the time of the spending review about fairness and ensuring that
growth came back into the economy, that even at this stage they might
have dropped the plan for a millionaire’s tax cut. That is a
forlorn hope, however.</hs_Para>

decision to create that tax cut goes to the heart of the
coalition’s political vision and beliefs—and by that I
mean both sides of the coalition. We face a period of national upheaval
at a time when resources are stretched. The Government criticise the
Opposition when we take responsible decisions to think about the way
forward while failing to explain their positions. At a time when
resources are stretched, when people up and down the country are
working harder and harder than ever before for less in their pockets
and when public services are being cut so drastically, it is even more
crucial that our Government should be a uniting force rather than a
dividing one. In that context, I must ask again why on earth this is
the time for a tax cut for the richest.</hs_Para>

He is a powerful advocate for his constituents and those on the lowest
incomes. He is correct to identify the fact that, despite the rhetoric,
the Government have, across the piece, consistently attacked the living
standards of those in work and on low incomes. I need only refer again
to tax credits, particularly for those working part-time hours. The
Government seem to think it fairly straightforward for them simply to
get additional hours of work, but we know that in many industries, it
is not that easy; it is not possible to get the requisite number of
hours. Many people who were, to use the Government’s mantra,
doing the right thing—taking up employment, for however few
hours and however low the wages, rather than doing nothing or sitting
at home on benefits—found their working tax credits cuts. As my
hon. Friend correctly says, that was compounded by changes to housing
benefit, which mean that many of them are even worse
off.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307011000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0001.htm#1307011000340">Let
us look at the impact. I said that this Government will go down in
history as a Government who divided; of the richest who are receiving a
tax cut, 85% are estimated to be men, and about 70% of the revenue
raised from direct tax and benefit changes will come from women. Some
52% of those benefiting are based in London and the south-east. I do
not for a moment mean to suggest that there are not people there on
extremely low incomes; of course there are, and many of my hon. Friends
will no doubt wish to make that point. However, long-term unemployment,
including in the north and Scotland, is on the

Jamieson:</Member></B> Once again, my hon. Friend makes an important
point, particularly in relation to many middle-income earners. The
issue of the lowering of the threshold at which the higher rate of tax
is paid has perhaps not had as much air time as some other topics, or
other cuts that the Government are making, but the reality is that it
affects many who would not see themselves as particularly well off, who
have worked hard over the years and been promoted in a company or in
the public sector, and who are trying to do the right thing for their
family, and are feeling the squeeze.</hs_Para>

the point about who will suffer most as a result of the
Government’s policies, I emphasise that I know that in many
places in London and the south-east, employment is not at the level
that it is elsewhere, and incomes are being squeezed, but it is
interesting to note the geographic
spread.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307011000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#1307011000344">Perhaps
we should not be surprised to see the Tories operating in this way. I
recall, on first entering this place, attending a debate on cutting and
abolishing child trust funds. I was surprised that the Government
thought that was the correct thing to do at that stage. They were once
again attacking those who were trying to do the right thing and support
their children and families. Under their approach, it is women and
families— the very people they say they want to
protect—who consistently suffer. The rhetoric and the reality
are two very different things.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>We should
perhaps not have been surprised by the Government’s proposals.
It is an age-old Tory mantra that the poor—those on the lowest
incomes—are expected to work harder; otherwise, they will be
made poorer. At the same time, the rich will work harder only if we
make them richer. In this instance, there seems to be one rule for the
very richest and another for everyone else. This is arguably the same
old out-of-touch Tories—this time, sadly, aided and abetted by
the Liberal Democrats.</hs_Para>

always like to try to end on a positive note, however, and I come back
to the point that the new clause is a relatively mild-mannered
proposal. It seeks nothing more than that the Government should use
their good offices to gather the necessary information to make an
assessment of the impact of the changes and to produce a report. That
does not seem an unreasonable request. Indeed, when
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:36:35"></hs_TimeCode> Exchequer
Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for South West Hertfordshire

reports and no doubt regularly tabled amendments and new clauses to
that effect. He is nodding his head. I hope that he will remember those
days, and remember why it is so important to have such reports and
assessments. I hope that he will show that he is not only a listening
Minister but a Minister who is prepared to act, and that he will accept

that Government, they made a conscious decision not to replicate the
old-fashioned language of class warfare that we have heard so much of
today. They made a conscious decision that, if the Labour party was
ever to regain the trust of the British people and regain power after
18 years in opposition, it would have to reach out to the centre
ground. One of the principle ways in which they did that was to commit
themselves, before getting into government, to accepting the spending

the argument, which we have heard repeatedly today, that a right-wing,
vicious, unpleasant Tory Government are only helping millionaires. At
first sight that might seem quite an attractive argument for the Labour
party to adopt in opposition, but if it is so attractive, why did the

greatest election landslide in Labour’s history, not follow it?

good point was made in the many interventions we heard from the

dragging more people into the higher rate of tax at all? That is a fair
point, and it leads me to an argument I have made many times: if we
want to improve tax revenues and get more fairness in the tax system,
we should move as much as possible towards a flat rate of tax. We
have the longest tax code in history. If a Chancellor of the
Exchequer on Budget day takes with one hand and gives with the other,
and if has his little schemes to help investment or job creation, all
he is doing is creating perverse incentives. A much better way of
creating a modern, progressive and successful tax system would be to
have as flat a rate of tax as possible, as is being done increasingly
around the world. It is ridiculous that a deputy head teacher of a
primary school, for example, has to pay a higher rate of tax. I think
that shows some of the problems the country is in

do not want to repeat all the old arguments about who got us into this
mess, but perhaps I will be forgiven for saying that unfortunately we
have to pay our way, and the Government are therefore between a rock
and a hard place. It is absurd to be dragging more people into higher
rates of tax; what we should be trying to do, 
<?notus-xml column=628?>across the House, is to flatten the tax base and
make it much simpler, much more coherent and much more understandable,
so that people know that there is, to all intents and purposes, a
single rate of tax. It does not matter whether they earn
£30,000, £300,000 or even £3 million a
year—they will be paying 35% of it in income tax. If we had such
a modern tax system, it would generate a huge surge in productivity.

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> It is not a question of rewarding them. The
truth is that the more complicated the tax system, the more it is the
case that the only people who suffer are middle-income groups,
often people in employment on pay-as-you-earn. The rich—the
millionaires; let us talk about the group that the hon. Lady is always
going on about—will always, through their expert
accountants’ advice, seek to avoid paying tax, quite rightly, as
it is perfectly legal and proper, and largely they will be successful.
The people she is talking about—the millionaires—are
precisely the sort of people who have income streams that are very
mobile around the world. They are often foreign nationals. Does she
honestly think that if we go on piling more and more tax on to these
people they will just sit around doing nothing? Of course not; they
will seek to avoid paying tax.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:47:45"></hs_TimeCode> is a question
not of rewarding avoidance but of accepting the facts of life. She
might think it unfortunate—I do not—but we need these
risk-takers, entrepreneurs and wealth creators in this country.
Unfortunately we are in a highly competitive situation with other
countries, particularly Ireland and other low-tax countries. Unless we
attract these people here we will not create jobs and investment in the
private sector.</hs_Para>

Indirect taxation has always gone up under a Tory Government. Value
added tax went up from 12% to 15%, and then to 17.5%. It is now 20%.
This Government have also given a tax cut to the highest earners in
society. The problem with indirect taxation is that everybody has to
pay it. That is why the tax take always goes up. Such taxation is
regressive. It does not matter what people are earning; everybody has
to pay it. People who are very rich and have means do not have to worry

cutting tax for the very richest in society, a lot of the people I

we look at a breakdown of the figures, taking into account all the
changes to tax, tax credits and benefits that have been introduced
since 2010, we see that households in the UK will be an average of
£891 worse off this year, or £17 a week. A one-earner
couple with children will be a staggering £3,995.65 worse off
this year. For a multi-family household with children, it will be
£1,723.88. It is all very well quoting statistics—I do it
all the time, and everybody is guilty of it—but I am sure that
every family affected aspire to something better for their children.

the day, we can have any Government scheme we want to bring people out
of poverty, but there is only one way out, and that is work. The only
way out of the current difficulty is for people in work to pay their
taxes. If there are even more cuts to the public sector, there will be
even more people out of work and the welfare bill will go up, defeating
the object of the exercise. It will lead to a high welfare bill, which
will have to be paid for, and a low tax yield because of people being
out of

Welfare reform is a warm and nice thing to say, especially for those of
a right-wing bent who want to take out the scroungers and make them

that we will see homelessness on a wide scale. The Government may have

the squeeze on benefits motivate anybody to go to work? If someone has
arrears or debt and is seeing more of their pay go down the drain, why

to my point about putting a finger in the air and wondering which way
the wind will blow. It has been estimated that 267,000 people who earn
more than £150,000—including 13,000 people who earn more
than £1 million—will receive an average tax cut of
£100,000, according to figures from HMRC. In contrast, child
benefit will be frozen for a third year, and tax credits and other
working-age benefits will increase by just 1%, and these real-terms
cuts will affect a shocking 9.7 million households. Can we understand
that? My constituency has 56,000 electors, but 9.7 million households
will be affected by this measure and each person will have an
individual story and will have struggled.</hs_Para>

9.7 million in relation to benefits might conjure up an image of
worklessness, but 7.3 million of those households—75% of all
households claiming benefits—are in work. That is the crux of
the problem we face. We talk about welfare reform and so-called
scroungers, but the people suffering most are those we are trying to
encourage—those who work hard and play by the rules but who are
locked in an economic theory that has clearly failed. Some 2.4 million
families will pay on average £138 more in council tax in 2013 as
a result of cuts to council tax benefit. That is the ultimate failure
of Government—six in 10 working people are claiming benefits.
For all the talk of work paying, for many people work is not
paying.</hs_Para>

issue, and the coalition Government have made it such a cornerstone
policy, that it needs to be reviewed. We have heard so much about it

think of all the people in the 1980s who were motivated by the dream of
starting a business or buying their own homes. By the end, their
businesses went bust or they were forced into rented accommodation
because they could no longer afford the mortgage. For all that
Government’s lauding of their control of inflation, it was
through the roof and interest rates hit 15%. We have heard recently

from the new clause, Mr Deputy Speaker, and that you are itching to

that people do not trust each other any more. That is the saddest thing

about Conservatives or Labour, people just do not trust politicians,
journalists, lawyers or others. This is a much deeper problem than
anything else for our society.</hs_Para>

people hear about the tax cuts for the rich, I am sure they will think
of those bankers who may or may not have committed crimes, of the
journalists who may or may not have committed crimes, and of the
editors of national newspapers—people earning six-figure
salaries—and they will believe that those are the people who
will get rewarded. That may not be the case, but that is the
perception, and as we all know as politicians, the perception is
usually stronger than reality. What members of the public will think
about this Government and about this place is that they are run by an
elite who are more interested in helping out their friends in the City

Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Mr David Gauke):</Member></B> We
have heard a couple of rather lengthy speeches about a topic that is
fairly familiar to those of us who have dealt with Finance Bills in the
past. We discussed the reduction in the top rate of income tax at some
length during the early, middle and late stages of last year’s
Bill, and we have discussed it on a number of occasions during our
earlier debates on this Bill. It is striking, however, that the number
of Labour Back Benchers present during much of today’s debate so
far has been three or perhaps four. Although we have heard some
passionate and lengthy speeches, I am not sure that I need to make a
lengthy speech in response, but there are a few basic points that are
worth making.</hs_Para>

agree that the wealthiest should make the biggest contribution to
deficit reduction, and it will be clear to anyone who looks at our
record across the board that we have stuck to that principle. In the
2010 Budget, the higher rate of capital gains tax was increased. In the
2011 Budget, we tackled a major area of tax avoidance, namely disguised
remuneration. The Labour party opposed that measure in Committee, but
we tackled the problem none the less, and our action has resulted in
considerable extra revenue, particularly from high earners.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1307016000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#1307016000076">The 2012
Budget, which contained the measure that has provided the subject
matter of most of today’s debate—the cut in the 50p rate
of income tax—also introduced a new rate of stamp duty for
high-value homes, measures to clamp down on stamp duty land tax
avoidance, and a cap on reliefs used in the tax system, which raised an
amount considerably larger than the cost of the cut in the 50p rate.
The 2012 autumn statement provided for action to reduce the cost to the
Exchequer of pensions tax relief, and the 2013 Budget contained further
measures to tackle offshore tax evasion by, in particular, high
earners.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307016000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#1307016000077">We
clearly have a strong record in this respect. We have gained additional
revenue not only from capital gains tax and stamp duty, but—as
is shown by the distributional analysis—from the income tax paid
by the top 1% of earners. That was mentioned by a number of my hon.
Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir
Edward Leigh), who pointed out that we are receiving more from the
top 1% than the Labour party ever managed to.</hs_Para>

interesting to note that the proportion of income tax contributed by
the top 1% exceeded 25% in only one year during Labour’s time in
office, namely 2009-10, which was a slightly strange year because a
large amount of income was brought forward so that the tax could be
paid at a rate of 40% rather than 50%. In that year, 26.5% of income
tax was paid by the top 1%, but in the remaining years the proportion
was 25% or lower. We estimate that in 2013-14, with the new lower rate
of 45%, nearly 30%—to be precise, 29.8%—of income tax
receipts will come from the top 1%. The problem with the 50p rate was
that it was not very good at doing what a tax is supposed to
do—raising
revenue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:24:44"></hs_TimeCode>. That is

Gauke:</Member></B> My hon. Friend brings me to the point that I wanted
to move on to: the report that the Chancellor of the Exchequer
commissioned in Budget 2011 to evaluate the Exchequer impact of the
additional rate of income tax. The report was published alongside
Budget 2012. It concluded that the underlying yield from the increase
from 40% to 50% was much lower than originally forecast, owing to large
behavioural effects—it was possibly only £1 billion and
could in fact be negative. The 50% rate also risked damaging growth and
the UK economy if it had remained
permanent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307016000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#1307016000081"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Brooks Newmark" PimsId="4831" UID="1307016000687" xid="809" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#1307016000687"><B>Mr
Brooks Newmark</B> (Braintree) (Con):</Member> The hon. Member for
Islwyn (Chris Evans) focused on our policies. The inconvenient truth
for the Labour party is that it had the opportunity for 13 years to
test the 50p rate to destruction, but we quickly saw the evidence of
the Laffer curve, which shows that, as we lower tax rates, we can
collect more revenue. The Government should be congratulated on finding
alternative ways of trying to get the rich to pay their just deserts,
if the Labour party wants them to do that. In fact the Government have
collected more money from the rich by lowering the rate from 50p to 45p
and by looking at other ways to collect that
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307016000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#1307016000082"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Gauke" PimsId="4777" UID="1307016000688" xid="850" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#1307016000688">Mr
Gauke:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The point is
not whether we should seek to get a significant contribution from the
wealthiest; it is how we go about doing it. There is a real problem
with a very high rate of income tax directed at the most mobile people,
who have many more options in how they respond. Not surprisingly, the
evidence that the HMRC evaluation discovered is that there is a
significant behavioural response.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson) said,
“This is all tax avoidance and one should crack down on tax
avoidance.” I agree: one does need to address tax avoidance, and
we have more ambitious targets for HMRC than it has ever had before. We
have made a number of changes to the law to address avoidance. I could
go on at some length about the steps that we have taken, but the
behavioural effect is not only about tax avoidance, it is also about
behaviour that is entirely consistent with Parliament’s
intentions. One might find people making bigger pension contributions, 
<?notus-xml column=639?>for which the House has determined tax relief should be
available. One might find people retiring earlier or locating in other
jurisdictions. All those things have an impact.</hs_Para>

there is a significant behavioural effect in this area, which brings me
to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark)
made: the 50p rate is not an effective way of raising revenue, which is
why, in my opinion, the Labour party will not give a commitment to
bringing the 50p rate back. It knows it is bad economics and does not
raise revenue. It knows it sends a bad message about the UK as
a location in which to do business. That is why Labour had a 40p rate
for 4,722 of the 4,758 days that it was in office. There was a 50p top
rate for just 36 days at the very fag end of the last Government, when
they knew with a fair degree of confidence that they were going to lose

They do not care if they get less money; what they want to do is appeal
to a core vote which they hope will be enough to return them to power

Opposition, and events may well turn out to justify it. I want to take
a more charitable view, however—although perhaps it is, in fact,
a different form of scepticism or cynicism. My view is that they are
not really serious about the 50p rate at all; much though they talk
about it, they will not, in truth, pursue this policy because they know
it is so damaging and that it does not do anything to raise revenue.
That is why, despite repeated questions earlier,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:31:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

I hear Government Members muttering from a sedentary position about
what the Labour party is going to do. I outlined this earlier, but I
will state it again: we will, of course, set out our manifesto in due
course, in time for the general election—that is absolutely the
correct thing to do—but we will not make false promises. We will
not make promises that we will not be able to keep. Let me remind the
House of that quote from the Prime

Minister said that he wanted to be charitable and to understand why we
tabled the new clause, and I know from Finance Bill Committees that he
does at least reflect on things. He rarely gives in to temptation to
resist the advice he is given to reject all amendments and new clauses,
but he does at least give the appearance of reflecting. In this case, I
cannot understand why he will not accept a mild-mannered proposal that
simply seeks to have a review of the impact of this measure and to
bring forward further information for the interest of hon. Members
across the House. That is a reasonable and sensible thing to do, and I
know that the Minister, certainly in opposition, has regularly argued
for this type of review. We have heard nothing from him today to
explain why, suddenly<I>—[Interruption.]</I> Given the side
conversation that is going on, I am sure that the Minister never got
any of those reviews into the legislation at that time, but I say to
him that there is a first time for everything. He could, even at this

to go ahead and ensure that the House had further

calls for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, within six months of Royal
Assent to the Finance Act, to lay before Parliament proposals for an
income tax rate of 10% on a band of income above the personal
allowance. The range of income to be covered by that 10% rate should be
determined by the Exchequer yield from a mansion tax—a Liberal
Democrat proposal that I used to think the Liberal Democrats stood
four-square behind. Perhaps in a moment those Liberal Democrats who
remain in the Chamber—they are diminishing in number—will
tell us a little about where they stand on the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070133000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#13070133000006">We
feel that the full benefit of that 10% or 10p rate of income tax should
not be available to taxpayers paying the higher or additional
rates—the £50,000-and-above levels, or higher rate

mistake to abolish the 10p rate in 2007. I do not think that it creates
complexity in the tax system. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has long
been in favour of simplicity in the number of tax bands, but I believe
that there is a genuine debate to be had about progressivity in the
income tax system. The hon. Gentleman’s colleagues can see the
case for a 10p rate, and I believe that it would be a useful way of
introducing a transition from the tax-free personal allowance to the
20p basic rate of tax. A 10p rate would be an important staging post
along the way. A tax cut for those on lower and middle incomes would be

cut the highest rate of income tax from 50p to 45p. They can justify

increased taxes and cuts to their tax credits, and that is the

Conservative party, and perhaps they do exercise such influence. We all
know that the Conservatives are there to defend the wealth of the very
wealthiest in society—that is a given—but we want to see
whether the Liberal Democrats in the coalition have managed to bend
that ideology a little more towards the centre ground of

£36,000. Again, I suggest that the hon. Gentleman talks with the
Liberal Democrats, who have done some careful workings on this. He will
be interested to know that the Government have introduced about 90
clauses in the Bill that relate to ATED—annual tax on enveloped
dwellings—which is basically code for a mansions tax on
properties owned by companies. I recommend that he reads through the
90-odd clauses. Essentially, the Government are introducing a tax on
properties worth more than £2 million, with a new annual fee, to
be assessed in a very detailed way. He will see that there is a set of
bands for the value of the property, from £2 million
to £5 million and right up the scale. The Treasury has 
<?notus-xml column=650?>therefore been doing a lot of work on the issue, and I think that it
should be commended, because it is very worth while. When we debated
the matter in Committee, we asked what would happen if the annual tax
on enveloped dwellings applied not only to properties owned by
companies, but to all those worth more than £2
million. That information would allow us to work out properly what the
rates would
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070133000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#13070133000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Burrowes" PimsId="4754" UID="13070133000763" xid="839" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#13070133000763">Mr

up with an average of £36,000 a year as the annual levy. That is
an average, and there might be some cases where the hon. Gentleman

and I understand where he is going with that argument, but I am not an
estate agent and do not have a figure for the number of properties
worth more than £2 million. However, it is very interesting that
the Government have started counting the number of such properties. He
talks about how the £2 billion would be defrayed across that
number, which I am not sure is correct, but of course there would be a
banding exercise, with different bands for properties worth more
than £2 million, and we would see how far that goes.
That is precisely why we need the Treasury to share some of its
calculations with us. I am sure that it must be more than a

divided by 55,000 is £36,000. The hon. Gentleman says that there
would be different bands, but we would still end up with an average of
£36,000. He will also find that most of the properties worth
more than £2 million are worth only slightly more—between
£2 million and £3 million. He will not find huge numbers
of properties worth between £5 million and £10 million

to hold back key information on these facts and figures. We need to

Exchequer Secretary has done the work on the annual tax on enveloped

think that we might be about to reach some consensus on this, because
he is suggesting that the Treasury has done some work on it secretly,

under their form of mansion tax. The Treasury’s own documents

mean mass revaluations of council tax.” All those things have
been pushed to one side as the Government propose their brand new

indeed does the 10p starting rate, and the Minister’s arguments

and not just the technical efficiencies of marginal rates of tax. When
this Government took over from Labour in 2010, two thirds of the
deficit had been created by the banking community and a third by
pump-priming in response to the financial tsunami after a history of
sustained growth under the Labour Government. The new Government
decided to focus not on growth, but on cuts to get down the deficit,
which was a fundamental error that has led to a flatlining economy.
They then had to decide who should bear the brunt in order to pay down
the deficit—80% in cuts and 20% in taxes—and the answer
that the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats came up with was that
it should be the poorest who were hit
hardest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070133000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0002.htm#13070133000084">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>

the Labour party has said is that when we take over in 2015, should the
people of Britain give us their confidence, as I hope they will, we
will inherit—this is self-evidently true—the current
Government’s spending plans for 2015-16, so we will carry them
out. As we make progress, I hope that the focus will switch to growth
more than cuts, as it did after we inherited the Conservative
party’s spending plans when we took over in 1997. We ran with
those plans for a year and then we had consistent growth. The
economy grew by 40% from 1997 to 2008 before the financial tsunami
caused by sub-prime debt. I imagine that we will do the same in 2015.
We offer no apology that we will have fiscal discipline alongside a
focus on growth and that we will get people into jobs to pay down the
debt. We will also change the composition of cuts to the rich and poor

in this debate about the mansion tax. In 1997, we had the same old Tory
economics, which we are seeing again because history is repeating
itself. There was massive unemployment and that was being paid for by
cutting services for the poorest. There was a huge debt that the Labour

flat in Chelsea worth £2 million. He said,
“Isn’t that awful. Surely you wouldn’t do
that.” That is in sharp contrast to what Tory Members
say about the person in the two-bedroom council flat who will be
punished because their children grow up, get on their bike and get a
job, as Norman Tebbit said, and vacate their bedroom. They
say that there is nothing wrong with the forced evacuation of such
people from London to a one-bedroom flat in a lower cost area; but they
say that it is wrong that somebody who is living in a £2 million
two-bedroom flat should have to rebalance their asset portfolio to
generate revenues to pay the mansion tax. If someone has a £2
million Chelsea flat, it is possible for them to rent it out
at enormous rents, live somewhere else in the countryside
that is many times bigger, pay the mansion tax and make a handsome
profit. That is not a heart-rending problem compared with the bedroom
tax. However, it appears that Tory Members are more concerned about

the banks to run a tight ship and to have enough capital reserves to
cover their lending, because they do not want them to go bust again. On
the other hand, they are saying that they will subsidise the purchasing

Gilmore:</Member></B> When the debates took place on whether the 50p
tax should be changed, Government Members were keen to tell us that we
could make up a lot of what was lost, and perhaps make even more,
through various forms of property taxation. They obviously had in mind
changes in stamp duty, ways of dealing with companies that buy very
expensive houses and so on. We were told how much better a property tax
would be than a tax on income, and that we would get far more money
from it. However, when we follow that train of thought and suggest that
there is merit in considering a mansion tax, we are suddenly told,
“No, no, that would be terrible.” We are told either that
it would be terribly expensive, and people would not be able to afford
it, or that it would simply be the wrong thing to do. It seems that

number of those that would be affected, but I do know that at the

It has been argued that, faced with that tax, people will simply move
elsewhere and we will not attract people here. The one advantage of a

assert to implement something of that kind. The advantage of property
taxation is that it is more solid than income taxation, as we have
clearly seen. Worryingly, the biggest reason some people give for why
the 50p tax rate does not raise as much as they thought it would is
that people were able to move income forward and back. Income is quite

if some sort of income arrangement was possible. For a lot of us,
including people on PAYE, that would be difficult to do, but it is
easier for other people. I have advocated not running away from a tax
on property too easily. Not long ago we had that debate at some
length in Scotland after a proposal by the Scottish Government to move
to local income tax—again, they decided not to proceed with
that. Some of the problems with local income tax concern the mobility
of individuals’ incomes and the fact that some wealthy people
might be able to avoid paying that tax. Those of us in political
parties in Scotland that opposed moving to local income tax argued
strongly the advantages of a property tax. Interestingly, the SNP

descriptions about valuable houses and how property prices are rising.
Since property prices at the top end were rising so
much—driven partly by investment from abroad—it was
argued that that would be good for everyone because it would lever up
property prices for all. The argument is that high property prices are
always beneficial, but those who tried to buy homes up and down the
country long before the credit crunch know that high property prices
are a double-edged sword because many could not get on the property
ladder at all. In many parts of the country, not just in London, the

that the private rented sector had become a residual sector and was

period—probably 10 to 15 years—we have seen an explosion

another issue for young people, particularly those who might wish to
settle permanently. They cannot afford to buy a home because house
prices are too high or they cannot get a mortgage. In the meantime they
pay very high rents, which makes it difficult to save. I am not

tax—I think my colleagues on the Front Benches would
agree—is about residential property, not business property,
which is already taxed in various ways. Obviously, a whole raft of
taxes are appropriate for businesses, and that would be the best way to
deal with the issue, rather than a mansion tax. If a mansion tax is a
way of ensuring that we can appropriately tax wealth, we should
consider it very seriously, given that it is probably a better
basis for taxation than income, which people can move around—I
have yet to see a house be dragged offshore. That may not be
impossible, but in this country we generally do not put houses on
wheels and move them, unlike in the United States—at least, so

Prime Minister say that he would flex his muscles on all kinds of
issues, the most recent being the number of children that could be
cared for. The Deputy Prime Minister was keen to tell the country that
he had flexed his party’s muscles and prevented that change from
being introduced, but he has not flexed them on the mansion tax. Either
it is possible for the junior partner in the coalition to flex its
muscles successfully or it is not. There are other areas in which the

relation to the mansion tax we will doubtless hear a lot about
income-poor people—how will they be able to afford it? Would we
expect them to sell their homes or move elsewhere? We cannot have that
debate, however, without talking about the bedroom tax. A constituent
of mine is 59 and has recently been made redundant. She is looking for
work, but with a retirement age of 63 she will not easily find another
job. She has been living in her home for 18 years, but it has a
relatively small single second bedroom. The kitchen opens off the
living room, which militates against taking in a lodger—one of
the things people have been advised to do. Her current income is less
than £72 a week. From that, she is paying £14 towards her
rent as a result of the bedroom tax. That is a significant proportion
of her income.</hs_Para>

effort into it and she lived there with her husband until she was

moving, but there is a shortage of one-bedroom homes in the city. Two
weeks ago, 23 one-bedroom homes were advertised—the total from
all the social landlords in the city, the housing associations and the
council. Those homes attracted varying numbers of applications, but the
lowest was 45 and the highest was 370. Four had more than 200, and
another seven had between 100 and 200. My constituent’s
prospects of being rehoused are, therefore, not great. Our city also
has a large number of people waiting for this kind of housing who are
living in expensive private rented housing or temporary

tax would be oppressive on people who may live in a house that is
valued at more than £2 million, but have a very low
income, and they should not be expected to find that payment. As has
been suggested to my constituent and others, such people may
wish to consider taking in a lodger, releasing some of their
equity or downsizing. I suspect that downsizing with that type of
property would be easy. I would hope, therefore, that such arguments
would not be made against a mansion tax. I hope that the Government

listen to Government Members, and I hear the sound of the
creation of two Britains. We have the Britain of the elite who are
protected by the Government, who bring about tax cuts for the most
affluent in our society. Then we have the other Britain—people
who are playing by the rules but have seen their benefits squeezed,
their tax credits cut and their council tax benefits cut. When they go
shopping, their bills have increased because of the VAT increase. Nor
is this society encouraging work, because work does not pay.
Those people in work can be reliant on the benefits system, but the
policies of the coalition Government are skewed against them—the
vast majority of people in this country who are playing by the rules
and want something better from their

the Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans) was right to say that the Labour

is useful that we are matching the commitment to reintroduce the 10%

I am particularly supportive of the mansion tax. As we heard in an
earlier 
<?notus-xml column=669?>segment of the debate, one of the key issues is tax avoidance, and
Government Members made great play of the fact that the higher rate of
income tax introduced at the end of the last Labour Government was not
going to deliver much revenue because people would attempt to avoid it.
I can understand that argument, but I think they are wrong, because we
did not have a long enough period to see it work though, and not enough

down.</hs_Para>

thing that can be said of the mansion tax is that one can with

England at this stage, but I do think that it would be logical to apply
a mansion tax to the largest properties in the country, given the need
to generate a tax system that is fair and

that the deficit was generated by the last Labour Government’s
spending priorities over a long period, but that, of course, is
nonsense. The Labour Government had to step in to tackle a global
financial crisis which had largely begun in the United States as a
result of the sub-prime mortgage market. Had they not acted, some very
large banks in this country would have gone to the wall, and further
difficulties would have resulted from that. We have a significant

That is why the last Labour Government proposed a higher top rate of

which those at the top of the tax tree would pay their fair share, and
those on lower incomes would have a chance to put more money in their
pockets and into the economy. The richest members of society do not
have to spend all their incomes and assets on products in the economy,

not all, their incomes in that way. By spending money in the economy,
they secure demand in the economy, and that generates

addition, the mansion tax would not be precisely targeted at the very
wealthy. It would not take into account the number of properties owned.
Therefore, a person owning two properties valued at £1.9 million
each would not fall within its scope but a family owning a £2
million home would, even though their property wealth was much lower.
Any mansion tax would be complex to introduce and administratively

HMRC can therefore administer the tax manageably, relying on

Oppositions are often asked how they would pay for a measure, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:42:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Islwyn (Chris Evans) said that Labour has a policy to pay for this
proposal. However, under the mildest of questioning, the policy
appeared 
<?notus-xml column=672?>to unravel before our eyes. The target yield is
£2 billion. I repeat a number that I gave some weeks ago in
Committee: the Treasury believes that 55,000 properties are valued at
above that level. We undertook that research to cost the annual tax on
enveloped dwellings. That is the number. A very simple calculation
gives us an average of £36,000 a year. Rather than Labour
saying, “We accept that. That is how we will pay for this. That
is how we will get a yield of £2 billion,” it is sliding
away from the policy. It is not accepting that that is the consequence
of what it is advocating. If it thinks that £36,000 is too
steep—maybe it does not, maybe it does—it should
acknowledge that, but that is the average cost. I suspect that Labour
does think that it is too steep and that is why the £2 million
threshold is under threat. That is why, to raise £2 billion, any
Government would have to apply the mansion tax to lower down the
property ladder. That is why a tax that is designed for the few will
become a tax for the many. The tax is ill thought out. Either it will
result in very high sums being levied on small groups, or it will not
raise anything like the yield that the Labour party claims it will and
it will apply more generally.</hs_Para>

a mansion tax would create real fairness issues by hitting asset-rich
but potentially income-poor households. It would serve only to create
complexity and uncertainty. The personal allowance is the most
effective way to support those on low and middle incomes, because it
enables people to keep more of their money. It is a better policy than
reintroducing the 10p rate of income tax. The Government have made huge
strides to make a fairer society and a stronger economy. All
elements of the new clause are flawed. I urge the hon. Member for
Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) to withdraw the
motion.</hs_Para>

that could arise if the new 10p band were in place

mansions—that form of housing accommodation. However, I would be
prepared to see whether the Treasury study, which could be commissioned
under the new clause, could look at whether farmhouses would be ruled
out. We would be happy to look at such questions. We should, however,
be looking at personal estates of £2 million and more in that
built-mansion context. That is the nature of the proposition before us.
In clause 97 and beyond, definitions of property are set out in respect
of the annual tax on envelope dwellings. They provide a series of
exemptions and set out where the line should be drawn in terms of
farmhouses and so forth. I recommend those clauses to the hon.

Gauke:</Member></B> This Government are determined to crack down on tax
avoidance by the small minority of individuals and companies who are
unwilling to pay their fair share of tax. This Bill includes some
important anti-avoidance provisions, including the general anti-abuse
rule—the GAAR—a major new development in UK tax law and a
key part of this Government’s drive to tackle tax avoidance,
and, in particular, abusive tax avoidance schemes. The Government have
also made it clear that we will continue to legislate to close down
specific loopholes if there is a clear case for doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000012">Before
addressing the GAAR and the Opposition’s new clause 12, let me
discuss new clauses 4 and 5, and new schedules 1 and 2. At this
year’s Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced
that the Government proposed to introduce legislation in the Finance
Bill 2013 to prevent companies from entering into arrangements to
access, as part of a business transfer, various forms of unrealised
corporation tax losses from unconnected third parties—a practice
that, for the sake of brevity, I will refer to for the rest of the
evening as latent loss buying. Legislation on that matter was not
included in the Finance Bill published in March, in order to allow more
time for consultation with interested parties. Technical detail on the
circumstances and manner in which the proposed legislation would
operate was published on 20 March. That was followed on 28 March by the
publication of draft legislation for a period of technical
consultation. New clauses 4 and 5 and new schedules 1 and 2 introduce
those targeted latent loss buying rules to this Finance Bill, and take
on board comments received during the technical
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000013">Let
me set out a little background to these new clauses and schedules. The
UK’s loss relief system provides a measure of parity between
taxing profits and relieving losses over the life cycle of a business,
ensuring that 
<?notus-xml column=679?>businesses with different patterns of profit and loss pay a broadly
similar amount of tax. Relief is based on long-standing underlying
principles that: brought-forward trade losses should only be relievable
against future profits from the same trade, carried on by the same
legal entity; tax losses should not be transferable against profits of
unconnected parties; and the movement of losses between companies
should only be allowed where they are under common economic ownership
for the accounting period when the losses arise. Within those
principles, companies can gain relief for losses through being set off
against profits in a number of ways. However, loss relief and business
reorganisation rules are designed to prevent companies from passing the
benefit of a loss to an unconnected third party. Those tax rules are
designed to prevent companies from “selling” losses to
some unconnected company that has taxable
profits<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000014">However,
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is now seeing a marked
increase in companies entering into different arrangements to access
deductions not caught by those existing rules. Indeed, we are expecting
the new rules to bring in revenue of close to £1 billion over
the next five years. A particular pressure point arises where it is
possible to dictate or predict the amount and timing of reliefs,
allowances and deductions. Where those are sizeable, they can encourage
tax-motivated reorganisations through which unconnected entities may
get access to what are, in effect, unrealised
losses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000015">Where
the amount and timing can be dictated or predicted, ownership or part-
ownership changes can take place in advance of the crystallisation of
the amount, enabling the current loss-buying rules to be bypassed. Such
arrangements may take the form of selling all or some of the shares in
a company or the assets of a company, where either there are allowances
that could have been claimed but were not by the previous owner or
where it is known that a debit will be created in a future accounting
period. Arrangements can, however, be more complex and contrived, and
may also involve moving profits into a company to use up relevant
deductions.</hs_Para>

clauses and schedules therefore deliver on what the Chancellor
announced at the Budget. They bring the tax treatment of unrealised
amounts, involved in a transfer between unconnected parties, more
closely into line with the long-standing treatment of realised losses.
The proposed changes introduce three separate rules to combat latent
loss buying. The first rule expands the application of current rules in
chapter 16A of part 2 of the Capital Allowances Act 2001—I am
sure you have fond memories of that Act, Madam Deputy Speaker. The
other two rules are targeted anti-avoidance
rules—TAARs—to be included in a new part of the
Corporation Tax Act 2010. One seeks to counter tax-motivated
reorganisations between unconnected parties involving other forms of
relevant deductions, and the other seeks to counter arrangements that
aim to transfer profits to companies so that the relevant deductions
can be
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000017">A

me turn to what I suspect will take up most of the time for our debate
this evening—that is, new clause 12. As I have said already, the
GAAR is an important new tool, but it is not a panacea. New clause 12
focuses on much broader issues to do with the taxation of multinational
companies, which have already been extensively debated during the
course of the Bill and fall beyond the scope of the GAAR. Let me once
again explain why that is the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:10:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000019">New
clause 12 first asks for a review of ways to require companies to
publish a clear statement of their UK tax payments. That is not a
matter for the GAAR. I am aware that the GAAR does not do what people
want it to do by tackling a wider range of tax issues, particularly
those involving multinational companies. We have never pretended
otherwise.</hs_Para>

Gauke:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a very important point.
Elements of a business are highly portable. In 2007-08, for example,
the UK’s position on headquartered companies was very
uncompetitive because of our controlled foreign companies regime and a
number of businesses moved their headquarters out of the UK and went
elsewhere, which had an impact not just through lost corporation tax
revenue but more widely, as it meant that individuals paying income tax
and decision making were moved out of the UK. That was not in the
UK’s long-term interest, so we reversed the situation. Now we
have a much more competitive position, which means that companies are
moving back to the UK and that new businesses are moving here,

just tax related to the GAAR, but the whole of their UK corporation
tax. That goes way beyond the clear policy that we have set for the
GAAR and would risk giving an impression that the GAAR has an impact on
all corporation receipts, creating the sense of uncertainty about the

Gauke:</Member></B> I hope I can clear up the hon. Gentleman’s
confusion. The GAAR applies to corporation tax—I am not arguing
for a moment that it does not—but the point is that lumping in
the new clause, which is based on the GAAR, and moving from the GAAR
being quite carefully targeted at abusive tax avoidance to essentially
saying that everything needs to be published under the GAAR as part of
a general anti-avoidance or 
<?notus-xml column=683?>anti-abuse rule would rather confuse things. It is a pity to muddle the
two. There is an argument for greater transparency and for publishing
things, and there is an argument for a GAAR, but to bring the two
together as the Opposition have done—perhaps that is partly due
to parliamentary constraints and so on—sends out an unfortunate
message. The two should be kept apart. I hope that has made things
clearer for the hon.

that the Minister used is that the proposal might put us at a
competitive disadvantage. However, the Bill is clear: one of the
priority rules is the double taxation agreements that are already in
place, so nothing could be done that impacted on the amount of tax a
corporation paid in relation to its tax in the UK and elsewhere,

event. The Minister is trying hard to explain why he does not like the

international structure, but that is not the only element that
determines whether or not the UK tax system is competitive. The point I
am arguing is that our engagement and the leadership shown by the Prime
Minister and the Chancellor represent the right way to go about
changing how multinationals are taxed. I would consider, for example,
what came out of the Lough Erne summit and, more broadly, measures to
ensure that people pay the right amount of tax, as well as the dramatic
progress that has been made including, on tax evasion, the exchange of
information between Crown dependencies and overseas territories, and
indeed the creation of a new international norm based on the American
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA. That is a big step
forward, and we continue to take steps, leading the way in this
multinational effort to give tax authorities new tools to deal with tax
avoidance by providing more information about beneficial ownership. All
those are steps that can help us to deal with tax avoidance and tax
evasion. I hope they will be welcomed by all Members of the

this and other debates, on how practicable it would be for HMRC to
provide such a service. HMRC makes the point that it is not something
that it is well set up to 
<?notus-xml column=685?>do; its expertise is on how the UK tax system works. It is also worth
pointing out that DOTAS is based on hallmarks set by UK tax law. Trying
to extend it in the way suggested would be very difficult. That would
require a major change to a successful tool—the hon. Lady and I
have debated this point before—for tackling tax avoidance, and
would risk disrupting the effectiveness with which HMRC does its job.
My answer to her is one that I have given in the past: I do not believe
that this is something that HMRC could do effectively. It is not a good
priority for us. All sides want to do more to help developing countries
to develop their tax system, but it is better to focus on

a large number of specialists on the UK tax system, and the UK tax
system does not apply in other countries. Assessing whether a
particular arrangement constituted tax avoidance in Tanzania, to pluck
a country at random, would require a detailed understanding of the
Tanzanian tax system. If the hon. Lady is asking whether we could train
up somebody to learn an awful lot about the Tanzanian tax system, in
theory that could be done, but it would be a better use of HMRC
resources to help train the Tanzanian tax authority, so that it was in

should not simply be about the expression of warm words. They should
also be about working out what we can do at a practical level, and what
will and will not work. I take the view that extending DOTAS will not
be effective, but our response to the hon. Lady’s proposals
should not be, “Oh, they are all terrible.” It should be
to ask ourselves what would be effective. There is a lot that we can do
that is effective. This is about capacity building. It is about
ensuring that developing countries have the right information, and
about bringing them into the existing web of treaties so that they can
have access to more information. It is also about ensuring that
multinationals provide information that is useful to tax authorities in
order to ensure that the right amount of tax is collected and the tax
authorities’ efforts can be focused in the right place. That is
the agenda that we have been pursuing, with some success.</hs_Para>

McKinnell:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to speak here today on these
important issues. I shall focus particularly on those covered by
amendment 56 and by new clause 12. First, however, I shall
touch on new clauses 4 and 5, and on new schedules 1 and 2, which
relate to measures announced in Budget 2013. Together, they introduce
three separate rules to combat what the Minister describes as loss
buying. That activity goes against the accepted concept that losses
brought forward on or after a change in company ownership should be
allowable for corporation tax relief to the company and to the trade in
which they occurred.</hs_Para>

Government’s new clauses seek to strengthen the loss-buying
rules, first by expanding the application of chapter 16A of part 2 of
the Capital Allowances Act 2001 
<?notus-xml column=687?>so that it applies to “qualifying activities” and not just
trades, as is currently the case. The other two rules introduced by the
clauses are targeted anti-avoidance rules and will be included in a new
part of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. As a consequence of the new
clauses, companies will be prevented from entering into arrangements to
access, as part of a business transfer, various forms of unrealised
corporation tax losses from unconnected third parties. The Opposition
support the introduction of these anti-avoidance measures, but it would
be helpful if the Minister outlined, in response to this submission,
what additional annual yield the Exchequer is expected to receive as a
result of their
introduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000063">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:40:30"></hs_TimeCode>
speaking specifically to the Opposition’s new clause 12, I would
like to refer more generally to the Government’s general
anti-abuse rule, which will be introduced by clauses 203 to 212, and
take the opportunity to probe the Minister on its implementation,
because it was last discussed in Committee of the whole House back in
April. The Government have made much of the GAAR, their flagship policy
for tackling tax avoidance, but, as the Minister knows, several serious
concerns were raised about its likely impact, or lack thereof, during
our debate in April.</hs_Para>

defined as those that use “contrived or abnormal steps”
to obtain a tax advantage. Yet the GAAR guidance’s definition of
what those entirely subjective terms mean is inadequate. It states
merely that they will be interpreted and applied in their
“normal” sense. I do not know how Government Members
would apply those terms in their normal sense, but I am interested to
know whether Opposition Members would know how to apply those terms in
their normal sense, given that we will be voting on that

result of avoidance activity, and it is a mere drop in the ocean
compared with the overall annual tax gap of £32 billion

the Minister update the House on the likely membership of the GAAR

applications for it. Up to eight members are expected to be announced
at some point this month by HMRC and the panel’s chair, Patrick
Mears, who is currently a tax partner at Allen and Overy. Is the
Minister aware of the backgrounds of the people from whom the
applications have been received? It would be useful for the House to
have that information at this stage. It is clearly vital that a proper
balance is struck on the make-up of the panel given that it has such a
fundamental role in how the GAAR will work and how effective it will
be. If it is going to work, it must be credible and have public

applies to corporation tax, yet the Government are still having to
introduce targeted anti-abuse rules to deal with loss buying undertaken
to avoid or reduce corporation tax liability. It would be helpful if
the Minister outlined how the GAAR is intended to operate. What
corporation tax activity would be sufficiently egregious or abusive for
it to be covered by the GAAR without the Government having to introduce
separate targeted anti-abuse rules to deal with it? Does this mean that
they need to introduce a targeted rule to deal with every specific
loophole that is not covered by the GAAR because otherwise they run the

seeing their services cut and the cost of living rising while the value
of their wages does not, they are rightly angry when they see the
complex and extraordinary lengths to which multinational companies may
go in order to avoid paying their fair share of tax in the countries
where their profits are actually being generated. People, including
more than 1 million supporters of  
<?notus-xml column=690?>the IF campaign, are equally furious that aggressive tax avoidance
activity is reducing the ability of developing countries to tackle the
issue effectively and contributing to their failure to combat hunger

introduced to tackle loss buying and capital allowance avoidance
planning. Those are examples of what we can, following the logic of the

new clauses demonstrate, however, that the system is far too complex.
There are far too many different types of loss and of relief, which
create the scope for transactions to try to exploit them. I am not
entirely sure why we need trading losses, schedule A losses, D3 losses,
non-trade debits and capital losses—and probably a few more I
cannot remember off the top of my head. If we moved to a simpler
corporation tax system that had only revenue losses and capital losses,
we could perhaps tackle avoidance more easily, rather than having to
introduce separate anti-avoidance rules for each different kind of loss
to try and ensure that they all work. I encourage the Minister for the
umpteenth time to try to simplify our corporation tax system, because
it would help in tackling these
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000102">There
is an interesting question on the interaction of legislation
with the general anti-abuse rule—if each time we see some
aggressive abuse that we think the general anti-abuse rule should stop,
we end up producing a specific anti-abuse rule, what does that say

personally prefer specific, clear legislation that all taxpayers can
read, understand and abide by, rather than relying on some general
statement of principle, but there has to come a point when we say,
“We think that is abusive and falls foul of the general
anti-abuse rule, and that is 
<?notus-xml column=694?>enough for us to tackle it. We do not need to introduce some more
complexity to our tax code: instead, we will rely on the rule.”
It will be interesting to see, as the years pass, how confident the
Government are in that position. For us to be able to evaluate how
successful the general anti-abuse rule is, we will probably need to see
if the Treasury—or, at least, HMRC—can win some court
cases relying on that rule. It may be a few years before we have some

of some proposals by Graham Aaronson, a leading tax counsel, so it is
not fair to suggest that the whole industry is so wedded to egregious
tax abuse that they will find any arrangement acceptable. That would
make a complete mockery of the whole thing. I do not share that
concern, but we have to be careful in how we draft the general
anti-abuse rule. Effectively, it comes back to saying, “Although
Parliament may have passed legislation in these terms, what we really
meant was something slightly different.” Perhaps we did not
envisage a complex scheme that works its way into what we actually
said, rather than what we really
meant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000105">If
we tried to define a general anti-abuse rule too closely, we would be
straight back on the horns of the dilemma of what Parliament meant when
it passed a certain piece of legislation. I suspect that most people
would say that we actually mean what we write in the many hundreds of
pages of taxes that we pass each year. We have to allow the courts room
to interpret where arrangements are clearly not what we intended when
we passed them. The clue is in the word “general” in
“general anti-abuse rule”. If we make it too focused, it
will not work. We will see in a few years what

measure we could use is whether the tax gap comes down. Do we see fewer
of these abusive arrangements being entered into? Is that because of
the threat of a general anti-abuse rule? Perhaps we could also measure
it by the weight of the Finance Bill next year. If we do not need all
these anti-avoidance clauses, the Bill will be an inch thinner and the
Government will be happy that the general anti-abuse rule is working. I
expect I will serve on the Committee next year and I am not optimistic

thought was that the most single easily comparable statement would be
the corporation tax return, which obviously has a consistent format, as
everyone has to file it. She is right about the use of tax havens.
Where tax havens are used underneath a UK corporate, HMRC has the power
to get a group structure and to use the controlled foreign company
rules to look at what is happening in the tax havens. It is clearly
much harder for HMRC when those havens are sat above the UK, making it
much harder to get the information because there is no shareholder
ownership that obliges disclosure.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T21:18:04"></hs_TimeCode> is why we
need global work to get a clear and full corporate structure published.
It will be interesting to see how much progress is made on that. It
needs to be global, not just for the G20, because if one nation
somewhere in the world will not agree to publish its share, that might
be the one that blocks the attempt to disclose the
havens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000113"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T21:18:17"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Kerry McCarthy" PimsId="4810" UID="13070141000217" xid="812" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000217">Kerry

territories over which we have some influence have rules that comply
with global standards. We heard some encouraging noises from the
UK’s overseas territories when they agreed some issues with the
Prime Minister before the G8 summit. Quite a few have taken pretty good
steps in the direction of transparency by signing information exchange

me return to the proposal to require the publication of corporation tax
returns. The requirements applying to UK company accounts include a
requirement to publish a tax note that reconciles accounting profit
with the tax charge and lists the key factors involved. It was intended
to provide a summary of the tax return in some respects. If the tax
charge is materially different from, say, 24% of the accounting profit,
the reasons should be set out so that the user of the accounts can

probably read more sets of accounts than most Members of Parliament. I
am not sure that the tax note takes the user any further, because it is
so brief, because there are so many ways of merging entries, and
because of the impact of deferred tax. The note was designed to
deal with the absence of complete transparency in regard to corporate
tax affairs, but I think we could achieve that much more effectively by
requiring the publication of actual tax returns. That would not reveal
too many commercially sensitive data; indeed, I think that far more
information is required in a set of statutory accounts than would ever
be required in a corporation tax
return.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070141000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#13070141000117">We
would probably not be acting unilaterally, given the disclosures that
are required by many other stock exchanges around the world. The
disclosures required by, for example, the Securities and Exchange

required in the UK. I do not think that this simple step would put us
out of line with the rest of the world. Given requirements to disclose
the tax amounts, taxable profits, how they were arrived at, and the
details of overseas transactions with related parties, including
amounts and charges, I do not consider it particularly onerous for a
company to be required to declare “We have paid royalties of
£5 million to our US parent.” In fact, many sets of
accounts include such declarations. There are measures that we could

leaders in the world in dealing with tax avoiders, we are showing the
way, and we are going to ensure that this all happens, yet we should
not do more than anybody else. But the UK Crown dependencies and
overseas territories are not German, French or American, and they rely
on the British armed services to protect them in times of crisis or
against the threat of invasion or assault. They rely on the British
legal system and on the British royal family as part of their very
essence, as democracies. Therefore, our relationship with these
territories is a symbiotic one, in which we should expect absolute
transparency in all matters relating to taxation and to companies and
individuals from

to bingo, a lot of people disapprove of gambling, but it is just one
small part of the tax avoidance picture. It is the part of the issue
that I have highlighted, simply because it is fresh in my mind
following my visit. People may disapprove of gambling, but they
probably disapprove more of tax avoidance. We have heard many examples
of the type of companies that have been using the rules to avoid paying
tax in the UK. It is worth repeating that the estimate for the tax that
could be recouped by the GAAR is about £85 million, and that the
current tax gap between the money that HMRC estimates could be
collected and the actual amount collected is £4.5 billion. That
is a significant difference.</hs_Para>

hon. Members have mentioned the general anti-abuse rule—the
GAAR—which is expected to raise around £235 million over

impact starts to be recognised. It will act as a deterrent to those
tempted to engage in abusive avoidance schemes, and where those schemes
persist, the GAAR will give HMRC the means to tackle them and to secure
payment of the right amount of

have accepted the proposal from Graham Aaronson that a narrowly
targeted GAAR is the right approach to tackling the persistent problem
of abusive avoidance schemes.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T21:58:42"></hs_TimeCode> has to be
viewed in the context of the fact that the previous Government did not
bring in a general anti-abuse rule. We believe that a broader rule
would be likely to generate considerable uncertainty, which could
lessen the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business, and
generate significant cost for HMRC. We are not complacent, however, and
we will continue vigorously to tackle all forms of tax avoidance.
Indeed, the Bill will close 10 loopholes, and the Budget announced
further reviews of tax law that is being exploited for
avoidance.</hs_Para>

because a scheme is not caught by the GAAR will not mean that it is
okay. The GAAR will not set the boundary for tax avoidance. It
deliberately targets abusive avoidance schemes, but HMRC will continue
to tackle all forms of tax avoidance using the full range of tools
available. As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T21:59:25"></hs_TimeCode>
for the argument that we will not need targeted anti-avoidance rules in
future, we believe that it would be reckless to remove a central
protection against avoidance without being fully confident that doing
so would not create risks. Although we expect the proposed GAAR to be
effective in tackling and deterring abusive tax avoidance schemes, it
might take time for those who engage in persistent avoidance to
accept that their schemes do not work, so there will still be a need to
retain existing anti-avoidance provisions and amend other legislation
that provides unintended tax planning opportunities that are not within
the scope of the
GAAR.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="1307025000703" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0003.htm#1307025000703">10

give liquidity protection in the event of a crisis. By their nature,
the return on such assets is small, and without relief the bank levy

us recall the facts about the bank levy. In the last financial year,
2012-13, the bank levy did not bring in £2.5 billion, it did not
even bring in £2 billion—it 
<?notus-xml column=708?>brought in a pathetic £1.6 billion. We should not forget that
that does not include the cut in corporation tax that the Chief
Secretary and others collaborating in the coalition gave away to the
banks at that time. In other words, it raised a net £1.4
billion—a shortfall of over £1 billion on the
amount that the Government said that it was supposed to produce.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T22:08:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann), and others in the Chamber, could
certainly think of ways in which £1 billion of revenue could be
put to good use. That was the giveaway that the design of the bank levy
set in train for the banks. It raised not £2.5 billion but just
£1.4 billion in the last financial
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T22:09:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307025000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0004.htm#1307025000053">It
is worse than that, because in the previous financial year, 2011-12,
the bank levy raised just £1.8 billion. Deducting from that the
£100 million in corporation tax, it raised a net £1.7
billion. The levy has not brought in the money it should have. The
Government said that it would raise £2.5 billion, but in total
it has brought in £1.9 billion—nearly £2
billion—less than
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T22:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307025000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0004.htm#1307025000054">If

for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) listened to my remarks earlier, in
which I said that the purpose of the new clause was not to raise
additional revenue, but to protect the assumptions that were there from
the outset. It was always envisaged, going right back to the
consultation documents that the Government published before introducing
the levy, that the deduction had to be in line with the regulatory
requirement. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T22:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>
was a rumour that legal advice was being taken on whether liquid assets
could be deducted that went beyond that regulatory buffer which caused
us, in anticipation, to close off that possibility and to emphasise
that this definition was always what was intended and that there should
be no possibility of wriggling out of it. I hope he would acknowledge
that that is

new clause is not one of the measures that we are taking to increase
the yield of the levy. That is dealt with elsewhere. It will protect
the yield that was always assumed would be made by the levy.

Gentleman raises the question of the yield, he will recall our debates
in Committee of the whole House on the new clauses that I moved to
increase the rate of the bank levy, reflecting our commitment to raise
£2.5 billion from it. He will know that in the Budget earlier
this year, the Office for Budget Responsibility made its assessments on
the basis of the proposed increase in the levy that we have set out.
This year, rather than raising £2.5 billion, the OBR forecasts
that we will raise £2.7 billion. Next year and for
every subsequent year, the OBR estimates that the levy will raise
£2.9 billion. That means that we will recoup the
under-collection of the bank levy. It is a new levy and it is not
always possible to know exactly what such a levy will raise. It has
always been clear that the Government intend it to raise at least
£2.5 billion. The OBR’s central estimate is that we will
more than recoup the requirement that we set

Adjournment debates are normally confined to the Member, the Minister

strong presence of my Labour colleagues tonight, especially from South
Yorkshire, but also from Merseyside, which I welcome. All the points of
concern and criticism about Barnsley and Rotherham, and our position in
relation to the new European Union funding, apply equally across South
Yorkshire, the Sheffield city region and the Liverpool city region. In
our area, and for the rest of South Yorkshire and for Merseyside, we
face cutbacks in European funding that are much more severe even than
our worst fears—massively deeper than in any other area in the

campaigned for special transition region status for the purposes of the
new European funding programme, and have tried to persuade the Minister
of the case. My hon. Friend has anticipated some of the points that I
shall be making later, which lie at the heart of the problem. I want to

with the facts. As the Minister knows, I welcome the commitment
to the European regional development fund and the European social fund
as part of a European budget settlement that represents the 
<?notus-xml column=722?>first-ever real-terms cut overall. I welcome the inclusion of transition
region status for ERDF purposes, although the Government held out
against it until the final agreement. I welcome, in particular, the
Minister’s commitment in his statement on 27 June to a local
rather than a central programme, with decision-making powers in local
areas. I also welcome the decision to enable European funds to take
their place as part of the strategic plans of the local enterprise
partnerships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307025000635" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0004.htm#1307025000635">We
know how to use European funding in South Yorkshire, we know how to use
it well, and we have firm plans for its use in the future. The advanced
manufacturing park on the edge of Rotherham would not be there without
support from European funding, and the nuclear advanced manufacturing
research centre and the knowledge transfer centre in Rotherham would
not be there without £15 million from the ERDF. We have plans
for the future. We can put the money to good use, and that will include
support for the city deal and for 4,000 extra apprenticeships
throughout South Yorkshire.</hs_Para>

whereas our current seven-year programme of funding from the European
Union is worth is worth more than €400 million in South
Yorkshire alone, the new seven-year funding programme will provide
€203 million, not just for South Yorkshire but for
the five north Nottingham and north Derbyshire districts as part of the
Sheffield city region. As was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member
for St Helens North (Mr Watts), that is about €117 per head in
an area with a population of nearly 1.8 million and a GDP that is 84%
of the European average. It represents a cut of more than 50% in South

90%, and nine of them will receive more, not less, funding than the

a comparison between Shropshire and South Yorkshire, North-East

me illustrate the point about the deep flaws and unfairnesses of this

islands is an ex-objective 1 area, like South Yorkshire. It is a
current phasing status area, like South Yorkshire. It has a GDP of 84%,
like South Yorkshire. It will have transition region status, like South
Yorkshire, but unlike South Yorkshire its funding will not be
€117 per head. It will not even be €147 per head, as in
Merseyside. It will be €741 per head. Its economic status is
similar but it will have over six times more funding for every man,
woman and child in the highlands and islands. The Chief Secretary has
clearly been doing his job for his area. What has the Deputy Prime
Minister been doing for our area? This is Forgemasters mark II. There
has been no evidence of concern, and certainly no evidence of influence

things to the Minister. First, the relative rise in prosperity in South

the spend each year during the seven-year period has been broadly equal

unfortunately, it remains the case that only three regions in the UK
are poorer than Merseyside and only four regions, including Merseyside,
are poorer than South Yorkshire.

I come to last week’s announcement of the provisional

decisions when making these allocations. First, let us go back to the
overarching goal of the
funds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T22:53:01"></hs_TimeCode>. The aim
of the funds is to provide EU member states and regions with assistance
to overcome structural deficiencies and to enable them to strengthen
competitiveness and increase employment. For the next seven-year
period, the focus of the funds will be on enhancing economic growth,
with a focus on innovation and research, small and medium-sized
enterprises, the low-carbon economy, skills, employment and social
inclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T22:53:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307025000658" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0004.htm#1307025000658">During
the current programming period, there were two notable decisions which
impacted on us. First, the last Government decided to prioritise the
north when making allocations for the current seven-year period, which
expires this year. I have had many representations from those
representing the interests of the south, and some of the poorer areas
of the south, arguing passionately that the Government should not
repeat what happened in 2007 and should shift funding back to the
south. While I concede that the south is richer overall, we must not
forget that within many areas in the south there are significant
pockets of
deprivation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307025000659" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/debtext/130701-0004.htm#1307025000659"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T22:57:59"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
the area that includes Rotherham and Barnsley was categorised as a
“phasing-in region” for the current funding period, 2007
to 2013. For hon. Members less familiar with the technicalities, let me
explain that “phasing-in” is a designation given to a
region that is emerging from the poorest regional
category—“convergence” or “objective
1”—and into the mainstream
“competitiveness” category. Competitiveness regions
characterise most of the wealthiest countries of the EU. As such, it is
the current EU budget period—2007 to 2013—that is the
transitional period for South Yorkshire, and the EU funds have been on
a declining taper for the entire seven-year period, in order for
partners in that area to adjust to a lower level of EU receipts. The
highlands and islands, of course, were not on a phasing-out regime;
they were on a phasing-in regime. The precise objective of the
phasing-in status is to avoid a cliff edge for these regions.
Therefore, comparing the allocation that South Yorkshire received for
the whole of 2007 to 2013 with the allocation announced for 2014 to
2020 and concluding that there is a 66% reduction ignores the reality
of what phasing in actually

Irish presidency’s objective for council was to obtain political
agreement from member states on the four regulations that set out the
rules for the common agricultural policy (CAP) over the 2014-20
financial period. An agreement was reached on a revised mandate late on
Tuesday night. On the basis of that mandate, the presidency was then
able to reach an outline agreement with the European Parliament on
Wednesday 26
June.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000073">The
UK agreed to the mandate on the direct payments, rural development and
the horizontal regulations. Overall I do not think the CAP package
represents genuine reform. However, thanks to our efforts, working with
other like-minded member states, it is in a much better state than the
original proposals. By agreeing a deal on these regulations we have
provided certainty for farmers and delivery
bodies.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000074">On
the direct payments regulation, I argued strongly on the importance of
flexibility for member states to deliver the Commission’s
“greening” proposals, if they wish to, through national
certification schemes, allowing all the regions of the UK the
possibility to achieve a better balance between costs and environmental
benefits than if we were to apply the measures set out in the
Commission’s original proposal. On coupled support, the prospect
of return to tobacco subsidies has been successfully resisted. However,
it is disappointing that there is not a common set of rules for member
states and there will be an opportunity to increase the use of coupled
schemes. This is a backward step as EU agriculture has made good
progress in phasing out subsidy linked to production. In terms of
simplification there will be a mandatory active farmer test but we
successfully negotiated this should only be based on assessing against
a much shorter list of business types. In addition, the small farmer
measure will also be voluntary though the young farmer provisions ended
up as
mandatory.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000075">On
rural development, the agreed regulation will enable all regions of the
UK to deliver environmental benefits and rural economic growth through
their rural development programmes. A solution was found which removes
the threat of farmers being paid twice, once under each pillar of the
CAP, for carrying out the same environmental measures. Member states
will also have to spend at least 30% of their rural development budget
on environmental measures. This is important to help support farmers in
their crucial role in enhancing and protecting the natural
environment.</hs_Para>

the horizontal (finance and control) regulation, there was the
inclusion of some UK-inspired simplifications. This
includes on areas such as audit provisions, having a longer transition
period for mapping requirements under the greening measures, and a more
proportionate approach on penalties. The ability to use a monthly
average euro to sterling exchange rate may also help give more
certainty to farmers and paying agencies who decide to use this
option.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000077"></hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000078">Together
with Germany I abstained in the vote on the single common market
organisation (single CMO). In an attempt to secure agreement with the
European Parliament, changes were introduced which did not continue on
the trajectory of reform. Market intervention is unnecessary, costly,
and should only be used in times of genuine crisis as it has negative
effects on farmers’ abilities to respond to market signals and
consumer demand. While end dates have been set for production quotas
for sugar beet and planting rights for vines, these have been extended
beyond dates previously agreed. Nor were adequate safeguards introduced
for the sugar refinery sector. This is bad for businesses and
consumers, and will keep prices artificially high. In addition, I was
unhappy with the move to allow the European Parliament’s
involvement in decisions on reference prices and intervention prices
that was part of the final agreement. I believe this does not adhere to
the treaty on the functioning of the European Union principles on the
balance of responsibilities between the Council and the European
Parliament. It was right that the UK took a principled
stand.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000079">Throughout
the negotiations, I worked closely with all of the devolved
Administrations and, as a result, secured outcomes that successfully
address some of their key concerns. Most importantly, I achieved a
statement from the European Commission which acknowledges that all four
regulations can be implemented regionally, in line with the UK’s
devolution arrangements. I also obtained a smoother transition than in
the Commission’s original text from historical to area-based
direct payments, a switch that the devolved Administrations have yet to
make. Finally, I was able to ensure that the text included a provision
giving them flexibility to utilise their regional reserves to top-up
payments to new entrants to farming, an issue which was particularly
important to the Scottish

FAC and GAC both discussed the good progress that Serbia and Kosovo had
made in recent months, including in reaching and starting to implement
the historic April 2013 agreement between the two sides. On the basis
of this progress in meeting the conditions set out in December, the GAC
recommended that the June European Council: agree to open accession
negotiations with Serbia in January 2014 at the latest; agree a
negotiating framework should be drawn up, which will also address the
normalisation of relations between Belgrade and Pristina; and agree
that pre-screening work on the acquis is started, particularly focused
on justice and home affairs reform issues. The GAC also asked the
Commission and HR/VP to report further on implementation of the April
agreement by December to inform final decisions on the adoption of the
negotiating framework and the start of accession negotiations. The GAC
started procedures for member states to adopt the necessary texts to
open negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement with
Kosovo.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000116" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000116"><I>Turkey</I></hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070130000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/wmstext/130701m0001.htm#13070130000117">The

that action on youth unemployment or otherwise should not prejudge the
unresolved multi-annual financial framework (MFF) negotiations. We need
to establish what resources will be available before committing to

existing pensioners has been a priority for the Government since they
came to office—with the triple lock introduced to ensure that
the basic State Pension rises by at least 2.5% each year and a pledge
to protect pensioner benefits such as Winter Fuel Payments for the
duration of this Parliament. The Government estimate that under the
triple lock uprating policy, the average person reaching State Pension
age in 2013 could expect to receive an additional £12,000 in
basic State Pension over retirement, compared to previous policies of
uprating by prices. In addition from April 2013, the basic State
Pension represents a higher share of average earnings than at any time
since 1992.</hs_Para>

the Government estimate that there are almost 11 million people of
working age in the UK who face inadequate retirement incomes compared
to the level they are likely to expect based on earnings during their
working life. The Government believe that the single-tier reform

simple comparison of the illustrative level of the new single-tier
pension (£144) with the current level of the basic State Pension
(£110) fails to take account  of the complexity of the
current pension system. Today’s pensioners receive a complex
aggregation of basic State Pension, additional State Pension (Graduated
Retirement Benefit, SERPS and S2P), adds-on such as the Age Addition
and means-tested benefits. The additional State Pension can be anywhere
between zero and over £100 per week on top of the
basic pension. Whereas, the new State Pension will be capped at the
full single-tier amount; for illustrative purposes £144 (in
2012-13 earnings terms) was used as the full level in the White
Paper.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070131000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/petntext/130701p0001.htm#13070131000017">Moreover,
it is not the case that all people in the early years of single tier
will get the full amount. Only around 40% of people reaching State
Pension age in the first two years after reform are expected to get the
full single-tier amount directly from the state. Most people have been
contracted-out at some point, during which they paid lower National
Insurance contributions. Their employer will have received a rebate to
fund their workplace pension. A deduction will be applied to their
single-tier amount that is broadly equivalent to the workplace pension
that was
funded.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070131000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/petntext/130701p0001.htm#13070131000018">The
Government believe that these reforms are necessary to simplify the
state pension to provide a solid foundation for saving for those
currently of working age and  to support the roll out of
automatic enrolment. The Government have introduced a Bill to
Parliament to make the changes set out in the White Paper to reform the
state pension for future generations. The proposals will receive a
thorough examination as they pass their way through

the post nor the location in which individuals are serving are taken

of an individual for redundancy cannot be assumed to imply that the

and the location at which they will be serving on their exit date may
be different from that at which they were notified. For these reasons,
neither the geographical distribution nor the units within which

spending control, support fiscal consolidation and ensure the welfare
system remains affordable. If the Office for Budget Responsibility
projects that spending will breach the cap in any year of the forecast

that action is not appropriate. Although welfare policy is a matter for

pension is the foundation of state support for older people. This is
why triple lock was introduced, meaning that the basic state pension is
increased each year by the highest of the growth in average earnings,
inflation or 2.5%. The level of the full basic state pension is now
£6.85 per week higher than if it had only been uprated by
earnings since 2011-12. Because of the triple lock, the basic state
pension now represents a higher share of average earnings
than at any time since

traders could take the first step on the entrepreneurial ladder with
subsidised or free tables and support from market operators. 400
markets were held and 2,200 new traders took part in 2012. This has

walls, are not always suitable for standard insulation measures and
require specialist surveys to determine the correct course of action.
This makes it impractical for the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)

Webb:</Member></B> In calculating the estimate of £18 million,
the Department has used data from the ONS and 2009 Employers Pension
Provision Survey to estimate the proportion of contracted-in defined
benefit members that may have a civil partner. This proportion is then
applied to total contracted-in defined benefit pension liabilities to
estimate the liabilities accrued in respect of these
members.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070139000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/text/130701w0002.htm#13070139000236">The
additional cost of providing survivor benefits where none was
previously provided for same sex couples is estimated to be the
percentage difference in the value of an annuity purchased at age 65
with and without survivor benefits. This percentage is then applied to
the estimated liabilities accrued in respect of those members with a
civil partnership, to provide the estimated increase in liabilities
associated with paying additional survivor benefits. This also takes
into account that one-third of schemes (data from the 2009 Employers
Pension Provision Survey) already do provide full survivor benefits for
those members in a civil
partnership.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070139000024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/text/130701w0002.htm#13070139000024">Children:

March 2013. Based

we are advised against expecting to find a treatment that can be widely
applied to protect woodland or treat an infected wood or forest.

achieve stock recovery by requiring member states to develop and
implement eel management plans for river basins within their

‘escapement’ of silver (mature) eel to the sea compared
to ‘pristine’ conditions. (Pristine conditions are
defined as conditions before declines started and without any

with a wide range of interested parties to inform the Government's
policy on GM crops. Decisions on whether to approve the commercial
cultivation of GM crops are taken at EU level. The Government will only
agree to the planting of GM crops, or the marketing of GM food and feed
products, if a robust assessment indicates that it is safe for people
and the
environment.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070139000052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/text/130701w0003.htm#13070139000052">Horses:

large scale non-compliance across the EU with the partial sow stall

discussed at the January Agriculture Council of Ministers. The
Secretary of State, following up correspondence earlier in the year
wrote to Commissioner Borg in May, seeking a progress report on
infringement proceedings against non-compliant member states and urging
swift and full compliance as quickly as possible. The Commissioner has
since confirmed that infringement proceedings against non-compliant

Heath:</Member></B> DEFRA funded surveillance over the summer of 2012
identified that the virus had spread across all rural counties in
England and Wales. While many animals and farms in GB may have been
infected, clinical signs in adult sheep and beef cattle to date have
been non-existent. The signs in dairy cattle of a raised temperature,
reduced milk yield and in some cases diarrhoea are mild/moderate,
short-lived and similar to other endemic diseases due to their
non-specific nature. In an individual dairy cow, these mild clinical
signs may last up to five days and across the herd as a whole for
several weeks. The main impact is in pregnancy on the developing
foetus. The virus attacks the developing neurological system and limbs
of foetal lambs or calves resulting in malformations such as domed
heads, fixed bent limbs and jaw deformities. The affected newborns are
often born dead or die shortly after birth. Birthing may be difficult
due to the foetal limb presentation and care needs to be taken in
assisting the mother, seeking veterinary assistance as appropriate.
Post partum aftercare should be provided as with any other difficult
birth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070139000918" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/text/130701w0003.htm#13070139000918">In
considering if a disease should be made notifiable, there needs to be a
clear value benefiting disease control in the placing of additional
burden on farmers and Government. In terms of control measures,
preventing vector spread is very difficult and therefore not a
realistic control measure. A vaccine has very recently received
provisional marketing authorisation and will be available for use by
farmers this summer in advance of the next sheep breeding period. The
onus would lie with the farmer to report suspicion of disease and then
for Government to intervene. The impact of Schmallenberg virus has to
date been shown to be low at a national level, with farms infected
showing 2% to 5% of malformed lambs or calves affected and as such,
there is no rationale for intervening. Some early lambing flocks where
mating periods are synchronised have seen greater impacts. These will
now be able to be protected by vaccination. This is a disease with few
defined clinical signs in adult animals, making detection difficult. By
the time clinical signs are seen in offspring, it is too late to
control. It is also possible that notifiying presence of disease on a
farm may complicate trade, both with the UK, the EU and for third
country
partners.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070139000919" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/text/130701w0003.htm#13070139000919">We

over burdensome and not proportionate to the disease impact. The

more stringent controls to ensure any such trade is rooted in
sustainable fishing practices. While the UK opposes, and has banned,

discarding the carcass), the Government does not oppose fishing for

sharks are landed with their ‘fins naturally attached’
(thus removing the possibility of shark finning occurring) and

camps for internally displaced people (IDP) to see DFID's work. The
number of displaced persons is estimated at around 140,000 across 89
locations, although this does not take into account some isolated
villages. While aid is increasingly getting to where it is needed, it
is difficult for humanitarian agencies to gain access to all of the
affected areas. Restrictions on movement mean that it is difficult for
some communities, particularly Rohingya and Kaman, to get access to
areas where they earned a livelihood. On 15 May DFID announced a
£4.4 million package of humanitarian support which includes
nutrition, drinking water, sanitation, protection and camp

Poulter:</Member></B> The information requested is not collected in the
format requested. Information on the median time to treatment a patient
waited for an ambulance from North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust in
each month since 2011-12 is shown in the following table for category A
(Red 1/Red 2) calls only. Category A calls are divided into Red 1,
immediately life threatening, and Red 2, serious but less immediately
time critical. No data are collected for Category C calls. As we are
supplying the median, it is not statistically correct to combine
medians to get a quarterly or national position. Data on median time to
treatment is only collected at ambulance trust level and was first
collected in 2011-12.</hs_Para>

Screening Programme (NHS BCSP) showed that men were less likely than
women to complete a testing kit. That is why the Department funded the
Men's Health Forum (MHF) to undertake a three year study on the uptake
of bowel cancer screening in men. The project culminated in the report,

practitioner and other primary care staff and the importance of spouses

serving an indeterminate sentence of imprisonment for public protection

retribution and deterrence. Pursuant to section 30 of the Crime

indeterminate sentence prisoner on licence if he or she is satisfied
that exceptional circumstances exist which justifies early release on
compassionate grounds. Such circumstances are either that the prisoner
has a terminal illness and has less than three months to live or that
the prisoner is bedridden or severely incapacitated. Before exercising
this power, the Secretary of State must be satisfied that early release
does not undermine public

number of appeals received by the SSCS tribunal nationally has risen
significantly: from 339,200 in 2009-10 to 507,100 in 2012-13 (an
increase of 49%). In addition to local initiatives, such as identifying
additional hearing venues across HMCTS estate, and increasing the use
of Saturday sessions, HMCTS continues to respond strongly at a national
level to continue to increase the capacity of the SSCS tribunal and
reduce waiting times. Measures in place include ongoing recruitment of
additional judges and medically qualified members and the review and
continuous improvement of administrative processes both internally and
between HMCTS and DWP. All of this is having a positive effect. The

all parts of the Sierra Leonean Government. Commercially, there are a

sectors. Militarily, the transition from the UK-led International
Military Assistance Training Team to the International Security

training; UK contributions to the EU who provide funding for AMISOM
troop stipends; UK contributions to the UN who cover AMISOM's
logistical support needs; and a bilateral contribution of £16

December 2011, consumers ringing a trader about something they have
purchased must not be charged more than the ‘basic’ rate
for that call. Our consultation on the implementation of the directive,
which ran from August to November last year, invited comments from a
wide variety of organisations. We have engaged with stakeholders,
including UK companies, and consumer groups, to ensure that our
implementation of the basic rate requirement is as clear and fair as

Laws:</Member></B> There is a strong link at every key stage between
attainment and free school meal (FSM) entitlement: the evidence
overwhelmingly suggests that the attainment of pupils eligible for FSM
is generally lower than that of their peers. It is unacceptable that
children's achievement at school and success in life should be
constrained by economic
disadvantage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307026000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/text/130701w0006.htm#1307026000038">This
is why in April 2011 we introduced the pupil premium, which is
additional funding for schools in England to raise the attainment of
their disadvantaged pupils. These are either pupils who have been
registered for free school meals at any point in the past six years, or
children in care who have been looked after by a local authority
continuously for more than six months. The grant is worth £900
per pupil for 2013-14, and the total pupil premium will amount to
£2.5 billion in 2014-15. 
<?notus-xml column=530?>Schools in Peterborough local authority received £5,350,000 of
pupil premium funding in
2012-13.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307026000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130701/text/130701w0006.htm#1307026000039">The
Education Endowment Foundation also administers £125 million on
behalf of the Department to fund research into innovative approaches to
raising attainment. Since the pupil premium was introduced, the
attainment of disadvantaged pupils has improved. Results for 2012, the
first year to reflect the impact of a full year of pupil premium,
showed a larger than expected narrowing of attainment gaps nationally
for both key stage 2 and key stage 4.</hs_Para>
