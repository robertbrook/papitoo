Ian Kennedy, in his Bristol inquiry report in 2001, recommended the
concentration of medical and nursing expertise in a smaller number of
centres. Subsequent working groups and reports have endorsed that
recommendation, including the Royal College of Surgeons in 2007. The
public consultation on the Safe and Sustainable review received more
than 75,000 responses. This was the largest review of its kind,
conducted independently of Government by the NHS. In July 2012, the
then Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts, on behalf of local NHS
commissioners, decided that children’s heart surgery networks
should be formally structured around specialist surgical centres in
Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle and Southampton, as well as
Great Ormond Street and the Evelina children’s hospital in
London. The JCPCT recommended that services should no longer be

the JCPCT’s announcement, three local health overview and

April, and I would like to thank the IRP for producing such a
comprehensive review of such a challenging topic. It strongly agrees
with the case for change—specifically, that congenital cardiac
surgery and interventional cardiology should be provided only by
specialist teams large enough to sustain a comprehensive range of
interventions, round-the-clock care, specialist training and research.

the report also concludes that the outcome of the Safe and Sustainable
review was based on a flawed analysis of the impact of incomplete
proposals and leaves too many questions about sustainability and
implementation. This is clearly a serious criticism of the Safe and

proposals cannot go ahead in their current form, and I am suspending
the review today. NHS England will also seek to withdraw its appeal

Specifically, they include better co-ordination with the review of

clinical model and associated service standards for the whole pathway
of care, beyond surgery; services to be fully modelled, and their
affordability re-tested; NHS England to establish a systematic,
transparent, authoritative and continuous stream of data and
information about the performance of congenital heart services; NHS
England and the relevant professional associations to put in place the
means to continuously review the pattern of activity and optimise
outcomes for the more rare, innovative and complex procedures; NHS
England to reflect on the criticisms of the JCPCT’s assessment
of quality and to learn lessons to avoid similar situations in its
future commissioning of specialist services; and NHS England to use the
lessons from this review to create with its partners a more

England now must move forward on the basis of these clear
recommendations and the Leeds court judgment. I have therefore written
today to NHS England, and to the local overview and scrutiny committees
that originally referred the JCPCT’s decision to me, to explain
that the IRP’s report shows that the proposals of the Safe and
Sustainable review clearly cannot go ahead in their current form. It is
right to give all the parties some time to reflect on the best way
forward, now that the IRP report is in the public domain, so I have
asked NHS England to report back to me by the end of July on how it
intends to proceed. In the meantime, it is important to stress that I
believe that care for children with congenital heart conditions is safe
in the NHS, and that ensuring it continues to be will be the top
priority for all involved in this

know that many families have found the Safe and Sustainable review to
be a traumatic experience. People are rightly proud of the hospitals
and the staff that have saved, or tried their very best to save, the
lives of their children. However, there is overwhelming consensus that
we cannot stick with the model of care that we have now. To do so would
be a betrayal of the families who lost loved ones in Bristol and who
want nothing more than for the NHS to learn the lessons from their
personal tragedies. So it is right we continue with this process,
albeit in a different way. But it is also essential that the process
should be performed correctly so that any decisions, as difficult as
they might ultimately be, carry the confidence of the public. I commend

Burnham</B> (Leigh) (Lab):</Member> I thank the Secretary of State for
giving me early sight of his statement. He was right to begin by
reminding the House of the events 
<?notus-xml column=345?>that led to the Safe and Sustainable review. Terrible failings in the
care of very sick children at the Bristol royal infirmary in the 1980s
and 1990s led Sir Ian Kennedy to call for expertise to be concentrated
in fewer surgical sites—a call supported by more recent events,
including those at the John Radcliffe hospital in
2010<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T12:43:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Since
Bristol, Sir Ian’s important conclusion has had the full support
of the health professions and of those on both sides of this
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T12:43:40"></hs_TimeCode>. As we
digest what the Secretary of State has just said, two considerations
must remain at the forefront of our minds. First, that this issue must
continue to transcend party politics. Secondly, that the complexity it
presents should not derail our determination to deliver the safest
possible care for children in England.</hs_Para>

said, changes of this magnitude must be able to command public
confidence and consensus, but that has not emerged since the decision
on site selection by the Joint Committee. I fully support the reduction
in sites, but when the decision was published I expressed concern about
the distribution of the seven sites, which was skewed towards the
western half of England and left a large swath of the east, from
Newcastle to London, without a surgical centre. For a family in Hull or
Lincoln, already at their wits’ end with worry, the wrench of
leaving home to travel hundreds of miles, along with the cost of
accommodation and time off work, would add to high levels of stress and
anxiety. That is why the issue has aroused such strength of feeling,
particularly across Yorkshire, the Humber and the east
midlands—a concern well voiced and represented by Members
throughout the House.</hs_Para>

clinical safety must predominate, does the Secretary of State agree

access the least important factor. The IRP concluded, surely rightly,

main concern with what the Secretary of State has just announced is the
proposal to link the children’s review with the review of adult
heart services, and the implications that might have for the timetable.
The Secretary of State will know that there are around 30
centres across England carrying out adult heart surgery. The seven
selected children’s centres are not all co-located with adult
heart surgery and, indeed, a number of them are on specialist children
sites, so the link between children’s and adult heart surgery is
not clear. 
<?notus-xml column=346?>Is there not a real danger that by linking the review with adult heart
surgery, the Secretary of State is introducing more complexity and,
potentially, controversy, risking a loss of focus and more delay? By
broadening out in this way, is there not a danger that we will lose the
consensus that has already been gained over the future of
children’s heart surgery? I would be grateful if the right hon.
Gentleman would say more on those
points.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000214">This
decision will also have implications for the timetable of the
children’s review and it will not have escaped the
House’s notice that that Secretary of State has not announced a
clear timetable. Can he set out more precisely a timetable for the
decision making that will now follow? He says that the review will be
concluded by the autumn. What people will want to know is when the
decisions will be made and implemented. Can he say more about
that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000215">The

I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will agree that we cannot risk any

conclusion, it is, of course, essential that the public have confidence

is the fact that unnecessary delay will not bring the best results for

say that we need a process that is seen to be fair by all concerned,
but, equally, a point will come when decisions must be made. In the
end, I want to assure the Secretary of State that when he comes to face

this issue transcends party politics, it is one from which all of
us—on both sides of the House, throughout the NHS and indeed in
local authorities—have things to learn. I think that the biggest
issue for us all to consider is the sheer amount of time that it has
taken. The original concerns about what happened in Bristol were raised
in 1989. I am pleased to say that they have been dealt with, but there
are broader, system-wide lessons to be learnt. It took until 2001 for
Sir Ian Kennedy’s report to be completed, it took until 2008 for
the Safe and Sustainable review to begin, and now, in 2013, we are
having to suspend the process yet again. What has happened is not the
right outcome for children, and we must all learn the lessons from
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000220">The
right hon. Gentleman mentioned site selection. I consider that to be
one of the most crucial areas in which the process was flawed. Whether
we should involve 
<?notus-xml column=347?>adult heart services is a difficult question, but one of the key
recommendations in the IRP’s report is that they should be taken
into account. I think that we should pay attention to that
recommendation, because the panel thought about it very carefully. The
reason for its view was that the same surgeons often operate on
children and on adults. Adults also have congenital heart conditions
that require operations. The panel also says that if the best outcomes
are to be achieved for children, services must be concentrated in teams
that have four full-time surgeons, provide specialist training, and
conduct research. The knock-on impact of what is happening in adult
heart services is
relevant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000221">I
agree with the thrust of what the right hon. Gentleman said about
mortality data, but I know that he will also understand the difficulty
of publishing such data on a very small number of cases when it may not
be statistically significant. That was one of the great debates that we
had over the temporary suspension of services at Leeds. We must be
careful not to publish data that could lead the public to make the
wrong conclusions. In principle, however, transparency is the most
important thing for us to bring
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000222">I
entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman about the timetable. I
think that we must get on with this process: I do not want to delay it
any more than is necessary. I have talked extensively to NHS England
about how it should be approached. NHS England—along with all
the stakeholders involved—needs time in which to digest the
contents of the IRP report, which was published only today. I consider
that the minimum period that I need to allow it in which to come up
with the timetable is until the end of next month. I appreciate that
that is six weeks, but I think that it is a sensible period. I
certainly want to be able to publish an indicative timetable by then,
so that people can understand how the process will continue and how we
will learn the
lessons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000223">I

important, but they are not the only consideration, and, when it comes
to specialised services, they are extremely difficult to interpret

fair to say that there are other considerations in such a review, such
as clinical best practice and what outcomes will get the best results
for children. We need to be up front with the public that that will not
mean specialist children’s heart surgery being offered in every
major city in this country. There will be some difficult decisions at
the end of the process. The broader point about patient choice, when it
comes to considering mortality rates, is that it ties in very well with
the concept of peer review. The way we can get better outcomes for
children is by being able to compare what happens in different centres,

stance to a proactive strategy. We are calling for three

has already made the filters that are needed to screen out not just
child abuse but pornography and adult content generally. We are saying
that the filters should be the default, either on all computers and
devices connected to the internet or by requiring internet service
providers to install them by default. Then we can institute the second
part of an effective system: robust age
verification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T13:36:28"></hs_TimeCode>. A
person seeking to cross the filter would be asked to confirm their
name, age and address, all of which can be independently checked.

proposing is aimed at reproducing the conditions that we have already
established in the real world. The distinction between legal and
illegal content is far too simplistic. For cinemas we have the highly

age ratings—12, 15 or
18.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T13:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> Any cinema
found to be regularly flouting the age restrictions would lose its
local authority licence. Furthermore, material classified as R18 can be
seen only in certain cinemas, and some material deemed obscene is cut
entirely. Yet on the internet it is all freely accessible to every
12-year-old. Indeed—this relates to what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T13:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T13:49:41"></hs_TimeCode> a moment
ago—the NSPCC believes that one quarter of nine to 16-year olds
have seen sexual images online. We are not talking about young women
baring their breasts—that is like something from Enid Blyton
compared with the Frankenstein images now
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000318">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T13:40:19"></hs_TimeCode>
dangers are clear. On average, 29% of nine to 16-year-olds have contact
online with someone they have never met face to face. Of course there
is a real difference between child abuse online and extreme
pornography, but unfortunately in the real world people who become
addicted to pornography look for more and more extreme images, and that
sometimes tips into child abuse images. Addiction is the issue. Users
are found to have literally millions of images on their computer, and
child abuse sites are signposted on pornography sites. Both are shared
peer to peer.</hs_Para>

an effective age verification system would mean that paedophiles would
lose the anonymity behind which they currently hide, and the denial of
what they are really doing would be addressed by the third proposal in
the motion, which is to have splash warnings before entering filtered
sites. Work by Professor Richard Wortley at University College London
suggests that that might halve the numbers viewing child abuse
online.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000320" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0001.htm#13061269000320">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T13:41:36"></hs_TimeCode>
course, those measures would have a cost to industry. TalkTalk, which
has led the way in offering filters, has spent over £20 million.
Some in the industry tell us that they do not want to lose their
competitive edge, and some say that they do not want to act as censors.
That is why the Government should act by putting a clear timetable for
those reforms into law in order to speed up change, level the playing
field and support parents. We know that most parents want to do what is
right by their children, because 66% of people, and 78% of women, want
an automatic block, according to a YouGov poll conducted last year, but
the industry is not helping them enough. At the moment, some still
require people to download their own filters—a near-impossible
task for many of us—some see it as a marketing device, and
others want to give the option of filters only to new customers. At the
current rate of turnover, it would be 2019 before that approach had any
hope of reaching total coverage. It simply is not good enough.

If I heard the hon. Lady correctly, she said that we should not refer
to this as child pornography. She is quite right: it is child abuse,
child torture and child rape. The creation of these images is abuse
against a child, and that child is further violated every time the
image is circulated and viewed by others. That is why the creation,
distribution and viewing of child sexual abuse images is strictly

start by talking about the Internet Watch Foundation. Before the IWF

child sexual abuse content on the internet, which is absolutely
shocking. Since 2003, the IWF, working with industry, has reduced that
figure to less than 1%. We fully support and welcome the work done by
the internet industry in the UK, which uses a list provided by the IWF
to block images of child sexual abuse. Blocking has a real and tangible
benefit, as it stops people inadvertently viewing the images and stops
paedophiles arguing that they found the images
accidentally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000332">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T13:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>
IWF has a crucial role to play in the removal of these images from the
internet. At the summit that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State has called for next week, we will discuss what further measures
we can take. It is right and proper that we look at the role and

made huge progress on protecting children from inappropriate content

when they first access the internet. ISPs regularly contact existing
customers through e-mails and on their bills to tell them about
internet filters. On age verification, ISPs are bringing in closed-loop
e-mails so that when the filters are changed in a home, an e-mail is
sent to the account holder and, therefore, to the adult. I hear the

I might not have been active on this issue in the House, I have been in
my constituency. Last Friday, I went to Burgh primary school in
Musselburgh, where the children recently took part in a competition to
talk 
<?notus-xml column=373?>about and devise ways of keeping themselves safe when using the
internet. That is a great example of how we can empower children. I do
not want children to be frightened of using the internet. It is an
incredible resource that allows them to socialise, learn, have fun and
access entertainment. We must be clear that we do not want to put
children off. At Burgh primary school, I saw children being empowered
to keep themselves safe. They even taught me a few lessons about how I
could be safer. The head teacher and Mrs Gilbert, who leads the IT
group, have the children running the school website. That is a great
way to show children that the internet is a tool that could be useful
to them at any point in their life and, at the same time, to ensure
that they are aware of the
risks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:19:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000387" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000387">Ofcom
recently released figures showing that 91% of five to 15-year-olds have
access to the internet at home. On average, they access the internet
for about 90 minutes a day. A survey of 851 young children in 2012 by
the ChildLine website also provided some interesting information. It
was clear that what children really enjoyed was the fun, games,
information and opportunities for social networking that they could
access. What really concerned me, however—I hope the Minister or
a Front-Bench Member will respond to this point—was that the
survey showed that 69% of children are now accessing the internet
through mobile phones, making it far more difficult for parents to
supervise what they are saying and how they are interacting. I would be
interested to hear whether the Government have any proposals for how we
can deal with mobile phone companies and keep children safe, given that
that is the way they are increasingly accessing the internet.</hs_Para>

reflect on an experience that I had around the age of 16—this
was before the age of computers, certainly in the highlands of
Scotland. I was getting ready for bed one night and I suddenly caught
sight out of my bedroom window of a flashing light. I realised there
was a man in the kitchen that overlooked my bedroom who had been
watching me undress, and he was flicking the light to let me know that
he was doing that. This is the first time I have ever shared that
experience, because at the age of 16 I was too scared to tell anyone. I
thought I had done something wrong; I was scared to tell my parents. My
father had warned me that I should shut my bedroom curtains when
getting ready for bed, and I was scared that he might go down and
confront the man, or that my father—a very peace-loving
man—might be hurt. I just did not feel I could do that, and I
lived in fear for many months that the man was going to approach me or
tell people what he had seen. We must remember just how difficult it is
for young people to tell their stories—it has taken me until the
age of 53 to tell that story.</hs_Para>

we legislate further? As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:33:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bishop Auckland knows, I am not at all averse to calling for
legislation, but my sense is that, in this space, it is not helpful.
Let me explain why. To make protection work, we need three things.
First, we need committed politicians who are completely clear on the
ask for industry. Secondly, we need engaged companies. The hon. Member
for East Lothian (Fiona O'Donnell) referred to one problem with
legislation. Children now access the internet via mobile phone, but
when the Bailey review came out in 2010, there was only one mention of
access to the internet via smartphone. The technological world changes
faster than we can possibly imagine. It is a falsehood to say that
clunky politicians and—forgive me—civil servants can be
ahead of that change, as opposed to the companies that monetise that
change. We have to get the companies engaged. Thirdly, we need to
educate users—parents, grandparents and children—which is
why I welcome what has been done in the primary school curriculum to
improve e-safety and digital
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000415" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000415">Therefore,
it is depressing that the motion has been presented in a partisan way.
We have a hugely productive agenda in the House for the past two years
by working together. I believe that debates such as this one encourage
industry to adopt a wait-and-see strategy, and to say, “Well
look, the politicians cannot decide. Unless they make things illegal,
we’re not going to engage.” That has been the problem
with the internet all along. The industry has said,
“We’ll wait till you tell us what is illegal, and
that’s as much as we will do.” We must move beyond that
situation, which we will do by working
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000416">I
have one final point to make. The House will forgive me if I come
across as a politician—I do not want to be a politician on this
issue; I want to be a pragmatist. Our recommendations go so much
further than the Byron recommendations, which were commissioned by the
Government of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:35:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bishop Auckland. Those recommendations used toothless language, did
not require any form of legislation, and were not well implemented.
They were also based on a completely false ideology that default
filters would lull parents into a false sense of security. There is no
evidence of that, but the thought has permeated the debate for the past
four years. Hon. Members can tell me if they believe that these two of
the Byron recommendations are forward thinking or appropriate, or
whether they do more than what we have proposed. The first
recommendation is that search engines should make it easy to turn safe
search on, and the second is that parents should be given free parental
controls when they get a new internet connection. Our Government, with
huge cross-party support, have done far more than that and made far
more progress.</hs_Para>

report has been produced—it has not yet been circulated, but
will be in the next week in this country and throughout the

online protection of children in respect of the grey areas that need to

of the problem the group has identified is the shadow internet. It is
fine setting up solutions, but if that happens in separate countries,
people will break them if they want to—they have relatively easy
ways to do so. The debate so far has concentrated on websites and
search engines, but, in fact, even when it comes to child abuse, gaming
is as big a problem and a vastly growing one. Texting, smartphones and
social networking are equally significant, growing and changing
problems—the modality is
changing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000422" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000422">The
group makes six recommendations in the report on hate crime—they
are relevant to the debate. The first recommendation is to create clear
policies and include them within the terms of the service of the
internet company. That would be a significant change. The working group
has the key players and the decision makers—they are not the
sub-decision makers, but the actual decision makers. That
recommendation is achievable, and it would be
significant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000423" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000423">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:39:36"></hs_TimeCode>
second recommendation is for mechanisms to enforce those policies. How
do intermediaries, including national Governments, enforce them? For
international industries, the role of intermediaries, whether they are
specialist groups or national Governments, is a second key principle in
the approach that should be taken.</hs_Para>

third and vital recommendation, which resonates with this debate, is to
establish clear, user-friendly processes to allow users to
report abuse. Those processes are not currently there, but
they are achievable. If mechanisms are in place, progress
ought to be relatively straightforward—far more straightforward
in relation to child abuse than hate speech, where issues of illegality
are far more complex—where there is criminality. Clearly, 
<?notus-xml column=379?>there are technical solutions—I will not go so far as to suggest
the software that the CIA has recently, allegedly, used—if the
processes are in

fourth recommendation is to increase transparency about terms of
service enforcement decisions: case studies. For example, if an
individual is prosecuted because someone has reported something that
their child has stumbled across, the Government and other third parties
have a critical role in how it will be reported and made
public.</hs_Para>

fifth recommendation, which is probably specific to hate speech, is to
encourage counter-speech. It is the same concept as the splash

Loughton</B> (East Worthing and Shoreham) (Con):</Member> If I can
bring the hon. Gentleman back to the third recommendation, he makes a
good point about reporting and taking down material. The IWF does a
good job in that area. Apparently, last year 1.5 million adults came
across abusive content on the internet, but only 40,000 reports were
made to IWF, which has the powers to do something about it. There needs
to be much greater publicity on how to report to ensure that action can

in doing so, so that the democratic internet world can hit back

get access to the right people, I went to meet industry leaders in
their headquarters in California, and I made the point that their
brands were in danger. If the users and third parties, albeit national
Governments, can show successes in prosecutions, the industry will
throw far more resources at the issue. The industry does throw at lot
of resources at it. A third of all Facebook employees are dealing with
it, because the dangers to its brand are so fundamental, but at the
moment it is less of an issue for other companies. They do see the
dangers to their brand, however, which is why senior people from PayPal
now turn up to meetings.</hs_Para>

intervened on the Minister—it was not a hostile
intervention—on agreements in other countries. One danger is
that different countries will do different things. Of course, that is
not an excuse for any Government to hold back, but the French
Government are taking various legal actions against some of the key
internet giants, as are the Italians, and there is a danger that the
approach will become too bitty. May I suggest to the Minister that he
try to up the stakes and achieve European Union consensus from
Britain’s lead? If Britain is ahead of the rest of the European
Union, that is a good opportunity to set the standards that others can
push up to and take forward. That would be pragmatic and significant.
We attack the industry—I am happy to attack the industry in
various ways—but it does not 
<?notus-xml column=380?>want terrorists using its platforms to kill people and it does not want
paedophiles using their products to abuse children. That is obvious to

using a mobile device to seek the speech made by the Rev. Leslie
Hardman when he went into Belsen concentration camp in 1945. I was
immediately content blocked. These issues are not all straightforward,
but some outcomes are exceedingly obvious and straightforward. I put it
to the Minister that the industry and politicians have a mutual
interest. That is the industry’s vulnerability. Finding the
tools to expose those who refuse to participate properly and
effectively is the key to real progress. If the Minister united the
industry around that in Europe, he would make a phenomenal mark. My

Technology is developing faster than any Government can legislate, and
avoidance measures lead to anti-avoidance measures, which in turn go on
in a cycle. This throws up the risk of Members and individuals

organisations, whose judgments might be completely different from those
of individual families, but makes false promises, because of the

legal adult content providers using common avoidance techniques, such

Cairns:</Member></B> I am coming to that very point. Challenges remain,
but the last thing we want to do is create the impression that this is
a simple issue and that children and families can be protected at the
flick of a switch; it is much more complicated than that and deserves
an intelligent debate. We need to recognise the differences 
<?notus-xml column=382?>in these areas, rather than giving the impression, as some Members have,
that the flick of a switch will make the
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>. An
ISP filter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:52:47"></hs_TimeCode> would
be oblivious to the very risks from which we need to protect children.
Furthermore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:53:35"></hs_TimeCode>,
such filters would not protect against bullying, grooming or other
serious risks, but at the same time they would give parents a false
sense of security.</hs_Para>

of the most effective answers—there will be several answers, and
filters have a part to play, but they are not the only
solution—is for a parent to show a genuine interest in what is
being viewed online. I am pleased that the debate over the past year or
so has focused the minds of technology providers on making device-level
and even profile-level security features and
filters easier to use and understand. Google has
its SafeSearch, for example, while Windows 8 has
made significant steps: it can e-mail parents a list of
all the sites viewed by a householder so that they can check
themselves what the child has been looking at. Furthermore, now when
someone signs up to an ISP or sets up a new router, they are asked what
settings they want, not only for the household, but for each computer.
It needs to go even further, however, down to profile level, because
the same computer can be used by different people. It is important,
therefore, that we have the right profile filter settings to protect
the children using the computer. Clearly, technology companies need to
do more to communicate that message and help parents
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000446" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000446">My
comments so far have related to legal adult content, but we would all
agree that the far more serious issues surround illegal content,
particularly that involving the abuse of children—the area on
which most of the recent public debate has focused. It is extremely
important that we distinguish between legal and illegal content. This
should not be a party political issue and there are no easy solutions.

need to recognise, however, that the policing of such shops is
relatively straightforward and that in general children cannot access
or stumble across such material. Appropriate filters should stop the
“stumbling across” element, but that leaves us with the
policing. We need to publicise the work of the IWF and reassure people
who might report issues to it that they will not necessarily be
compromised. Much attention is focused on search engine companies, and
it is important that they play their part—they have a
responsibility here—but having researched their activities, I am
aware of some of the technology they use to identify illegal content.
They can claim to be playing a part, therefore, but search engines need
to be at the cutting edge of image analysis and coding—they need
to be one step ahead of the perpetrators of these terrible
offences.</hs_Para>

address. The IWF, which has been mentioned several times—I
welcome the extra money made available to it today—has made a
huge difference. Some 1% of the content it removes from the internet is
hosted in the UK; 54% is hosted in north America; 37% is hosted across
the rest of Europe and Russia; the figure for Asia is only 1%; and for
South America it is even smaller. Those are the issues. It is an

that neither the Minister nor anyone else can solve this problem on
their own, but the Government can take action to help protect children
online. My particular concern centres on the unmonitored use of the
internet by those whom we already know to have a history of sex
offending. The Government’s consultation on parental internet
control stated that it was looking into the best way of shielding
children from harmful and adult content, including sites that exposed
children to online sexual grooming. Most of the debate and consultation
in this area has focused on restricting access to adult, pornographic
and child abuse material, but in looking at the most serious
threat—of grooming and sexual abuse—we need to be serious
not just about the online content, but about online users and those
with whom children come into contact online.</hs_Para>

Ashleigh. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T14:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>After

acceptable for a known offender to have unmonitored online access in

protection and online safety will be significantly aided if that is a
notification requirement for registered sex offenders as a matter of
course, and if failure to do so is regarded with just as much
seriousness as an offender failing to register the fact that they were
living with young children. In 2011, the Government consulted on the
prescribed information that offenders are expected to disclose,
including increased notification requirements for foreign travel and
living arrangements, and even changes to ensure that an offender could

repeated that parents must take the lead in protecting their children

Ashleigh’s mum deserve to know that dangerous people who are
already known to the police and authorities are not left with the
unchecked freedom to groom further victims. We know who these people
are, but false, manipulative online identities mean that young people
such as Ashleigh do not know whom they are speaking to. Access to
inappropriate material for young children is very concerning, but I
expect that controlling it will be a constant battle, with technology
inevitably outpacing the law. My suggestion is to make a simple change,
which follows the accepted principles of existing requirements on
registered offenders, but it could make all the difference to a
family’s safety. I am glad that we are debating measures to
protect young people online. I would simply ask that, as well as
considering the broad safeguards that we seek to introduce, we also

that we trust the BBFC’s classifications. When the Video
Recordings Act 1984 was passed, more than 25 years ago, certain video
works—I will come to online content in a second—were made
exempt from classification because they were considered unlikely to be
harmful. However, the content of exempt works has changed beyond
recognition since 1984, which means that inappropriate and potentially
harmful content can be legally supplied to children. On 24 May 2013,
the Government announced that it planned to lower the exemptions
threshold in order to prevent children from accessing potentially
harmful material, so well done to the Government. This is a most
welcome decision, for which the BBFC—along with the home
entertainment industry, the recorded music industry, retailers and law
enforcement bodies—had argued for some time.</hs_Para>

enjoy from potentially harmful media content by ensuring that video

certain sexual content can no longer legally be freely supplied to
children. Instead, the BBFC will classify such content to keep it away
from vulnerable and impressionable children. The Government have said
that they hope to have the new regime in place by April 2014, and I

issue of online music videos, to which the Bailey report also referred,
must be seriously considered. My attention was recently drawn to an
online video made by a well known pop singer—I had not heard of
her before, but never mind—which showed explicit shots of a
young teenage girl, concerned about her body image, slitting her wrists
in the bath. It is the video to a well  
<?notus-xml column=386?>known song—I remember hearing it in my house. Although it has a
happy ending, I would argue that the graphic scenes in that
video—which I am sure parents would allow their children to
watch in a very relaxed way—are far too explicit and dangerous
for young teenage children to watch. We all know that many of the
children who follow these pop stars are very young and impressionable.

final point relates to user-generated content—UGC. Independent
research from June 2011 shows that while the public believe that the
internet brings greater choice, freedom and flexibility, the majority
of viewers still consider it important to be able to check the
suitability of the audio-visual content that they download, with 85% of
the public considering it important to have consistent BBFC
classifications available for video-on-demand content. The figure rises
to 90% for parents of children under

it is amateur user-generated content such as that seen on YouTube that
makes up the majority of video content online. This might feature
content that is potentially harmful to children—I accessed the
video to which I referred earlier through YouTube this

regulator NICAM have together developed a tool for ordinary people to
age-rate UGC across different countries and platforms. I hope that my

tool instantaneously produces an age rating that can be shown on

different national sensitivities and concerns over content. The tool is
simple. It contains six questions about the content of the UGC, on
behaviour, drugs, horror, language, sex and violence. Completing the
questionnaire takes less than a couple of minutes. It also includes a
facility for viewers to report content that, in their view, might be
illegal. In the UK, such a report would go direct to the Internet Watch
Foundation, about which much has been said this

tool is also flexible. For instance, the questionnaire may be completed
by those uploading content. Alternatively, it may be completed by those
viewing the content online. The ratings can be linked to online
filters. This new initiative will shortly be trialled by Mediaset in
Italy, and the BBFC and NICAM are looking for trial partners elsewhere,
including in the United Kingdom. This is an example of the kind of

can be really dangerous for young girls. I have heard Laura talk about
how young girls who have been shown gross images of pornography and
sexual violence by young boys are often frightened of sex. They think
that sex is something cruel, horrible and dangerous. We have to bring
back the connection between love and sex; it is being destroyed by what

is a huge danger of falling into the trap of the politician’s
syllogism: we must do something; this is something; therefore we must
do this. That is the danger we face. Is there a problem? Absolutely,
there is a huge problem with child pornography, which is nasty, cruel 
<?notus-xml column=390?>and illegal. We have to stop it. The IWF does an excellent job in trying
to do so. Is there a problem with young people having inappropriate
access? Yes. Is there a problem with online grooming? Yes. Is there a
problem with online cyber-bullying? Absolutely. Is there a problem with
the widespread sexualisation of young women in particular? Absolutely,
and I pay tribute to the Under-Secretary of State for Women and
Equalities, my hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo
Swinson) for her consistent work to combat it.</hs_Para>

too, that the Government are supporting CEOP so that when we find
people carrying out illegal activities, we take the correct legal

think there should be no default because I think we should encourage
parents to engage with the question before they make a decision. They
should be faced with a box that they have to tick, but they should 
<?notus-xml column=391?>be in charge. The Byron review was very clear that a false sense of

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> The problem here is that
we are not dealing with simply looking at a book or magazine and
deciding whether it is suitable for a child. We are dealing with
something that many people have said—this has been the focus of
much of the research—they find very difficult to operate. The
outcome is that many parents are not able to use those
filters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:25:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000505" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000505"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Huppert" PimsId="5589" UID="13061269002298" xid="1023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269002298">Dr
Huppert:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is right, which is exactly why we
need simpler filters. The work done by Talk Talk and others provides
precisely that. There should be simple clear filters with simple clear
questions so that parents can have a look and make a simple clear
decision. I do not want to force parents to abdicate that
responsibility because there are other consequences of these
filters.</hs_Para>

filtering system will have large errors. There will be errors that mean
it does not filter out some things that we might want it to filter out
because it cannot be sorted out perfectly. There is no way of
indentifying automatically what counts as pornography and what does
not; what is appropriate and what is inappropriate. That is simply
impossible to achieve, so stuff will get through that we are not
expecting to get through. There is also the problem of filtering some
useful things out. There are already many cases—when it comes to
advice for lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues, for
example—where mobile phone providers automatically filter out
the content, which can cause serious harm to young people trying to get
advice. Trying to get advice about abortion services is another
problem. There are a whole range of such issues that are automatically
filtered out by many mobile phone providers. If we are telling children
that we do not want to let them have appropriate information, that can
be

Loughton</B><B>:</B></Member> I should declare an interest as a
champion of the Internet Watch Foundation. I am slightly disappointed
at the rather defeatist attitude taken by the hon. Gentleman. The
solution is not a silver bullet. It is not any one of the individual
things that have been mentioned; it is a jigsaw. Empowering and giving
resilience and confidence to our children—and confidence,
resilience and expertise to their parents to be able to filter what
they believe to be right and wrong—is an important part of that
jigsaw. Filters have their flaws, but they are part of that jigsaw as
well. Will the hon. Gentleman admit that some of the things mentioned
during the debate are part of the solution and that we should not
dismiss them simply because they are not absolutely
perfect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:27:43"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000508" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000508"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Huppert" PimsId="5589" UID="13061269002300" xid="1023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269002300">Dr
Huppert:</Member></B> I agreed with almost everything the hon.
Gentleman said, until the end. Yes, I think we should empower parents
to make the correct decisions, and I believe we should educate children
so that they can think for themselves and be empowered. I absolutely
agree with all of that, but that is not what the motion says and it is
not what the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:27:59"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bishop Auckland emphasised. The hon. Gentleman and I
would agree that there are some important measures for 
<?notus-xml column=392?>empowerment: the problem is, if we provide an illusion of protection,
which gives people a false sense of security, that can make people less
safe. It can leave children more exposed than doing things that
actually work. It also downgrades the role of parents and
parenting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000509">Moreover,
we must accept that any filter can be bypassed. It is easy for those
who know what they are doing to carry out a quick Google search and
find out how to bypass any filter that they encounter, and there is no
way in which we could prevent that from happening. We must therefore
try to engage with people rather than introducing state control in the
form of legislation to force search engines to run in a particular way,
because that does not work. <I>[Interruption.] </I>The motion calls for
legislation. If the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland does not believe
that it should, that is her problem. Perhaps it suggests that motions
should be tabled rather earlier than a few hours before the deadline

changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000510" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000510">Yes,
we must do something, but what we do must work, must be proportionate,
and must make things better for the people about whom we are concerned.
That, rather than what was suggested by the hon. Member for Bishop
Auckland, is the way forward. I commend the Minister—it is good
to see him back in the Chamber—for his work on the issue, for
his commitment to trying to deal with the problems in a way that will
make a difference, and for the position that he has taken

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> While we are all patting
ourselves on the back and saying that there is widespread
agreement—and there clearly is widespread agreement—we
should also bear it in mind that there is a considerable campaign
against the taking of steps in this direction. It has not really been
represented in the House today, but it is clear from earlier debates,
and from communications that we have all received, that there is
another point of view which is very different. There are people who
want a degree of freedom in society that can actually be damaging, and
we must be prepared to have a proper debate about that as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000512" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000512">The
issue of freedom is very important in the history of events such as the
women’s movement, but there has often been a confusion between
freedom in a fairly abstract sense—for instance, the sexual
liberation of the 1960s—and the effect that some material can
have on, in particular, those who are vulnerable. Much of what appears
on the internet and elsewhere is damaging because of the way in which
it portrays women, the way in which it portrays relationships between
men and women, and the way in which it allows people to see a version
of human relations that is deeply
damaging.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000513" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000513">People
sometimes say that such material will not be harmful to many people,
but it probably will be. It is interesting that the same argument is
never advanced about advertising. People do not advertise because they
think that advertising does not work; they advertise because they think
that advertisements influence us, and indeed we are all clearly
influenced by them. We have all found ourselves going into a shop and
buying something that we may not have meant to buy because we saw or
heard an advertisement for it, and thought “That sounds like a
good idea.” I am not suggesting that someone who stumbles across
pornography, online 
<?notus-xml column=393?>or anywhere else, is bound to turn into a violent person, but there will
be some people whose attitudes, particularly their attitudes to what is
acceptable between men and women, will be affected by

<?notus-xml column=394?>improve the situation and to give greater protection. I have no doubt
that there will be some very clever people who can find ways around all
sorts of things—we know that that happens—but to say that
we should not put such measures in place for that reason would be
wholly wrong.</hs_Para>

me address some of what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:36:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) said. He seemed, perhaps surprisingly, to be
setting the state against the parent in a way that is not helpful. Of
course parents should be making decisions for their children, but there
are many circumstances in which we have to rely on others in schools
and in the wider world to protect our children. That is not an
abdication of parental responsibility, because parents cannot be with
their child all the time. They will not be able to supervise every
social contact they have. As a parent, I would certainly prefer to be
confident that I could let my children out into a world that I could
regard as reasonably safe—whether that was the physical or
virtual world—than to be unable to do so. Perhaps that is not
what the hon. Gentleman was suggesting, but that was how it came across
to me. Suggesting that such an approach somehow does not leave things
to the parents and that it wants the state to step in is a wholly wrong
way of considering the matter.

Huppert:</Member></B> The concern is that the filters will be easy to
bypass and that a huge proportion of young people will be able to get
past them. If parents are led to believe that such things mean that
their children will not be able to access inappropriate material when
they are up in their room on their computer, that will lead parents to
make the wrong decisions about how best to look after their children.
It is not that parents do not know how to do that—as we know
from when parents were asked about the subject by Ofcom, this is a
question of supervision, which is far more effective than a misleading
sense of security.</hs_Para>

Gilmore:</Member></B> One of the practical problems with that approach
is the notion that someone is, in any sense, going to be there
supervising their children through all this—we all do our best.
We attempt to instil the values and behaviours that we want in our
children, but it would be wrong to suggest that that will always work,
even for those of us who think, or hope, we are or have been very good
parents. Children grow older and they are out in that wider
world—in friends’ homes or out in all sorts of other
social contexts. I want my children to be protected from being able to
buy alcohol when they are too young to buy it. I do not want to have to
accompany them everywhere to make sure they do not do that; I want to
be sure that they are, within reason, protected. However, I know that
that can be got round as well, because I know that children are very
good at getting fake IDs. That does not mean that we should just
abandon the attempt to control these
things.</hs_Para>

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member>
Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to be speaking
in this important debate. Throughout it, we have heard a lot about
committees, working parties and foundations, but I want to bring the
debate back to what is at the heart of this issue—children and
families. I say to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:41:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Devizes (Claire Perry) that I bow to no one in my respect for
the enthusiasm with which she has embraced this
issue since she became a Member of Parliament in 2010,
but she must be slightly careful about sounding as if
politics began when she became a Member of
Parliament then. It is also appropriate to give some credit
to all the individual activists, and to organisations such as the
Mothers’ Union and the Everyday Sexism Project, for campaigning
on these issues for very many years before 2010.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061269000528" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000528">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:41:58"></hs_TimeCode>
number of Government Members have made the distinction between legal
and illegal internet images, as if the legal ones are in some sense
benign. Let me remind the House that it would not be legal to show
those images to under-18s in a cinema, so why should we be complacent
about under-18s accessing them online? Over and over again,
I have heard Members of this House say, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:42:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) did, “Parents should look after their
children. It is all about the parents.” One of the problems with
this particular issue is that the technology and the drive of the
industry has completely outrun parents’ understanding. When I
was a child, if a young person wanted to see pornography, they had to
go to a newsagent and purchase a top-shelf magazine. No newsagent would
have sold such a magazine to a child as young as 11, yet the average
age of boys accessing hardcore porn online has dropped to eight. That
is what we are talking about. We would not allow eight-year-olds to go
into a cinema to see hardcore porn, so why are Government Members so
complacent, or unwilling to take decisive action, about eight-year-olds
accessing this online—on their computer, on their phone or
wherever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:43:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000529" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000529">People
who say, “The parents should sit by them” are not living
in the world that parents do. I have sat next to my son when he was a
much smaller child and we have been innocently googling
“Disney” or “Pokémon” only to find
that these pornographic pop-ups appear on the screen. If the child is
there on their own, all they have to do is click through to see
thoroughly horrific images—that is the reality.</hs_Para>

is all about ease of access, the way in which the technology has come
on in leaps and bounds and the harms of online porn. In the few minutes
available to me, I want to touch on that.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:44:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for East Lothian (Fiona O'Donnell) spoke from her own
experience about it. We are dealing with an increasingly sexualised and
pornified culture. Even if our own children are not accessing porn, the
extent to which young people are doing so is affecting girls’
self-image and boys’ sexual demands.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:44:04"></hs_TimeCode>Girls now think
it perfectly normal to sext pictures of their naked bodies to boys;
otherwise they are not accepted—not part of the gang. We in this
country have more plastic surgery than people anywhere else in Europe.
Accessing online porn is associated with domestic violence and, as we
have heard, murder and brutality. There are real harms attached to the
increasing access by very young children of online porn, and I wish
some Government Members had taken the matter more seriously.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=396?><hs_Para UID="13061269000531" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000531">As for the
role of the industry, I am very glad that everyone is sitting round the
table with the industry, and I am glad that the industry is being nice,
but this House must remember that pornography is the biggest driver of
traffic to the internet. Porn is the most frequent search term on
Google. We cannot allow an industry that makes millions out of porn,
month on month, to dictate the pace of change.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061269000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000532">What needs to
happen? No one is saying that there is one technological fix; not a
single speaker has said that. First, we need to help parents to talk to
their children. Through Sure Start and other initiatives, we need to
encourage young parents to understand how to talk to their children
about these matters, and to understand the dangers. Most young children
do not understand that if they text or put on Facebook a picture of
their naked body, it never disappears. We need to help parents to talk
to their children, but we also need statutory sex and relationships
education. No one will take the Government seriously on the matter of
access by children to online porn while they continue to set their face
against statutory sex and relationship education.</hs_Para>

need a willingness to legislate. I am very glad that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:46:09"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the hon. Member
for Wantage (Mr Vaizey), sits around the table with the
industry, and that many members of the Government have personal
connections with Google and so forth, but women and families watching
this debate do not want the industry to dictate the pace of change.
They want a Government who are prepared to stand up to the industry and
to legislate, because only with a realistic threat of legislation will
the industry meet these needs and concerns, and address the unhappiness
and misery that children’s access to online porn is causing in
our
society.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13061269001965" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269001965">3.46

Elan Jones</B> (Clwyd South) (Lab):</Member> My constituency is not

knowledge, and I was reminded of that point yet again yesterday when I
failed to add a printer to my computer; instead, I went on to another.
That is not the issue. For me, this is not a general, abstract debate
on what is, and what is not, censorship. It is about how things that
would not in a million years be legal offline seem to be legal online.
That is a matter of great concern. Offline, we would not allow young
children access to the sort of images that they can access online, and

before Select Committees. It takes an age to find them, and then they
always respond by saying that they are based in California or New York

that we protect CEOP’s budget. The Home Affairs Committee
expressed concern that CEOP was being put into the National Crime

to rationalise the policing landscape, but it is important to maintain
CEOP’s budget and focus. I understand that its budget will be
cut by 10% over the next four years. Perhaps the Minister can reassure
me that that is not the case and that CEOP, even though it is in the
NCA—the Committee thinks that is fine for the moment, but we
will revisit the subject—will still retain its focus.

I recently visited Europol and Interpol. I urge the Policing Minister
to visit those organisations, because I gather that no Home Office

fantastic work internationally. I know that the Cabinet Office has
funded a project in Interpol specifically dealing with online child
exploitation. I think that we can take credit for the work we are doing
internationally. To return to my first point, the internet is a
marvellous invention and a power for good, but as we have seen, and as
we have heard today, it can be used in a different, darker way to
exploit children. I hope that internet service providers and others
involved in this whole area will understand their responsibilities and

dramatic rise in the use of communications technology and the
development of new forms of social interaction online have hugely
complicated child protection in Britain. Social media have greatly
increased the ability of gangs and individuals to target vulnerable
children. Children naively share a great deal of information online and
are often unaware of the risks in doing so, or of the security measures
that are there to protect them. Abusers have always been able to
identify vulnerable children, but social media and mobile phones now
make it easy for them to make contact with
them.</hs_Para>

the House to support our proposal to have safe search as the default
option on computers and search engines. Filters already exist to screen
out harmful material, but 54% of parents whose children use the
internet at home have no parental controls installed on their devices.
Making filters the factory setting removes this risk, and parents have
the option to opt out of the system if they see
fit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000557" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000557">Social<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:01:34"></hs_TimeCode>
media have increasingly exposed ever-younger children to sexualised

seen sexual images in the past 12 months, online or offline. A number
of services have linked exposure to overtly sexual content via the
internet with children displaying inappropriately sexual behaviour.
Such behaviour has been highlighted as contributing to greater
vulnerability of increasingly young children. I do not believe in
censoring the internet, but it is important that children are protected
from inappropriate
content.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000558" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000558">In
the past,
increased<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:02:09"></hs_TimeCode> sexual
behaviour among children has led to a perception that they are somehow
complicit in their abuse. Regrettably, this has frequently been an
obstacle to proper safeguarding measures being taken. Equally
horrifyingly, the child’s sexual awareness has been successfully
used in courts to enable abusers to get a lesser sentence. Work is
being done to tackle this attitude among authorities and police forces,
but it is imperative that proper training is provided to staff to
ensure that they take all cases seriously and recognise the need to
protect children, regardless of the child’s own attitude or
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269000559" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0002.htm#13061269000559"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:02:43"></hs_TimeCode>Technology
is, by its nature, evolving. Agencies face an extremely complex task in
keeping up with developments and ensuring that procedures are adequate
and that staff are well trained to meet existing and developing
challenges. The complexity of these challenges has demonstrated the
need for better co-ordinated operations. Agencies must ensure that
there is a free flow of information between them because in the past it
has proved too easy for vulnerable children to fall through the gaps
due to poor communication. Levels of co-ordination vary widely
throughout the country, and that should not be allowed.</hs_Para>

child protection must always be the primary focus, prosecution must not
be allowed to become an ancillary concern. I recognise that
prosecutions in these cases can be extremely difficult, but without a
proper deterrent the risk of child abuse will continue to rise. We must
ensure that the law is fit for purpose. New forms of abuse and
grooming, especially online, might not always

reality is that children take their mobile phones to schools and freely

women to go through a process of various pornographic acts that are
regarded as the norm in a relationship. There is a danger that boys are

The facile comments made by various Members about filters not being

of protection cannot protect us completely. Obviously they cannot, but
when children are given phones by their parents they should be locked

true of the male community in particular—while endless pressure

on the effect that is having on young people. Access and exposure to
pornography affects children and young people’s sexual beliefs,
leading to unrealistic attitudes about sex and beliefs that women are

pornography, and children’s and young people’s engagement
in risky

hope the House will see that a huge amount has been done. We part
company from the motion over the thought that not much has been done.
This is a very difficult area and we are doing a lot, and to suggest
that nothing much is happening is simply wrong. I hope, therefore, that
having listened to this very serious debate, the Opposition will
withdraw their motion, but if they decide not to do so, I urge the
House to reject the motion and endorse the effective action taken by
the Government on this important matter.</hs_Para>

victims in the fight against cross-border crime or whether they are
going to back the Eurosceptics on their own Back Benches who oppose
things simply because they have the word “Europe” in the
title. It is about whether the Prime Minister and Home Secretary are
prepared to show leadership in the national interest, as Downing street
claimed it would do in last week’s briefing, or whether they
will cave in again. It is about what the Government believe is or is
not important in the fight against crime.</hs_Para>

are still in the dark about the Government’s view on European

stop at the channel; criminals do not stop at our borders. There are an

involved in things such as drugs, human trafficking, online child
exploitation and theft. We know, too, that as people trade and travel
more than ever, cross-border crime is likely to keep
increasing—whether we are inside the European Union or outside
it. The police need to be able to keep up. That means they have to be
able to deal with European police forces and they have to have a legal

opt-out, which means losing things such as the European arrest warrant
or important data co-operation, would present a serious problem. Let me
set this out in today’s debate. We know, for example, of the

the warrant should be improved and reformed and there are other areas
of European co-operation that we should seek to improve. For example,
we should ensure that the European arrest warrant is not used for too
many minor crimes. We should also work with other European countries to
ensure that when people become victims or suspects of crime abroad,
they can be assured of proper legal support and justice. But it is
still better to stay in and argue for reform than to pull out of the

simply because it has the word “European” in its title.
The Government are looking at each measure on its merits and nothing
else. When the case is made that a measure is in our national interest,
we will participate in it. As I have said previously, we will consider
how each measure contributes to public safety and security; whether
practical co-operation is underpinned by it; and whether there would be
a detrimental impact on such co-operation if we pursued it by other
mechanisms before making a final decision. The European arrest warrant
is no different in that

honoured. Truth to tell, the opt-out in article 10 to protocol 36 was
negotiated as an insurance policy to give us the time and ability to
look at all the measures. We must remember that police and criminal
justice issues were not part of the European Union until the Maastricht
treaty—which was agreed by the previous Conservative
Government—introduced them, and even then there was no
competency for the European Court of Justice.

change, and 
<?notus-xml column=428?>if we could have negotiated the option to look at each individual policy

and the transition we managed to achieve is exclusive to this
country.</hs_Para>

Heaton-Harris</B> (Daventry) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to speak
in this welcome debate. We all know that the ability to invoke the
block opt-out was negotiated as part of the Lisbon treaty—on
which we did not have a vote—by the previous Labour Government.
According to the refreshed Government list deposited in Parliament last
month, 127 EU laws currently fall under the block opt-out. They are
gradually being eaten away, so we will have fewer to debate by next
May. They include the European arrest warrant, which has been mentioned
and to which I will come in a moment, and legislation defining various
criminal offences and rules for associated penalties. There are many
measures—with 127 laws, that is to be expected—which is
why is important to have this sort of debate on the Floor of the House
to enable the House to inform the Home Secretary and others on the
Front Bench of its thinking. I therefore welcome the
Opposition’s giving us the time to talk about this issue
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:48:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001256" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0003.htm#13061269001256">Under
the arrangements introduced by the Lisbon treaty, the UK has to opt out
of all of these EU laws en masse—it cannot opt out selectively.
If the UK wants to opt out, it must notify the EU of its wish to do so
by 31 May 2014 at the very latest, so we have plenty of time
for this debate. If the UK does not opt out, under the EU treaties it
will become bound by these laws indefinitely—there is no
subsequent opportunity to opt out. Furthermore, from December 2014, the
European Court of Justice will for the first time gain full
jurisdiction over these laws under a change introduced by the Lisbon
treaty, meaning that the European Commission could take the UK to the
Court for what it believed to be a breach of one of these laws.
Consequent rulings from the Court would be binding. In addition, the
Court 
<?notus-xml column=431?>could rule on questions about the interpretation of these laws referred
to it by UK courts—rulings that would then be applied by British
judges.</hs_Para>

is that an issue? It was raised by the House of Lords European Union
Committee, and one particular case illustrates the great concern about
the Court’s judicial activism: the Metock case in 2008. Four
nationals of a non-EU state applied for asylum in Ireland, but their
applications were rejected. In the meantime, however, the men had
married women from other EU states, exercising free movement rights in
Ireland, and they reapplied. The Irish Government refused each
application, their regulations stating that the rights under the free
movement directive did not apply to family members, unless they were
already a lawful resident in another member state and seeking to enter
Ireland with an EU national or to join an EU citizen in Ireland.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>The Grand
Chamber of the European Court ruled that national legislation could not
require the third country national spouse of an EEC citizen to have
been a permanently lawful resident in another member state and
therefore that they could benefit from the free movement directive. In
other words, this highly controversial ruling rewrote EU law and Irish
immigration law, so there is a reason to be concerned about the
possibility of the Court’s being involved in such
decisions.</hs_Para>

the UK invokes the opt-out, the European treaties allow our country to
apply to opt back into particular EU laws covered by it. For most of
these laws, a UK application to rejoin would be first considered by the
European Commission, but if the Commission did not approve UK
readmission, the Council of Ministers could decide, by qualified
majority voting among member states bound by the relevant law, to admit
the UK. For the remaining laws, which are considered part of the
Schengen body of law, a UK application to rejoin is decided by
unanimity in the Council, without formal Commission involvement. Opting
back in is irreversible. If the UK is readmitted by the EU
institutions, it could not opt out of the relevant laws again and the
Court would have full jurisdiction over the laws concerned.

useful do not seem to be so in practice. For example, the Government
have said that the UK has not sent any requests to other member states
to freeze suspected criminal assets or evidence under framework
decision 2003/577/JHA since it was adopted more than a decade ago.
There are several laws under the block opt-out that the UK has so far
declined to implement fully, sometimes on grounds of cost. They include
Prüm decisions, as we heard earlier, which involve the police
sharing information such as fingerprints and DNA—perhaps the
precursor to a European Prism programme or something like that. In
other cases, such as the European arrest warrant, the laws on
cross-border co-operation do not have sufficient safeguards for the
rights of British citizens. In too many cases, British people have been
arrested in the UK under the European arrest warrant and extradited to
other EU countries, where they have ended up suffering serious
injustices owing to foreseeable problems with the domestic criminal
justice systems in those
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

number of problems with the European arrest warrant, which have been
highlighted by many other countries. The stats are quite simple. Nearly
1,000 requests for a European arrest warrant are issued each month. In
2009, the Serious Organised Crime Agency here in the UK received 4,004
requests for a European arrest warrant to be issued. To put that in
context, between 2003 and 2009, the UK extradited 63 people to the
United States, whereas in 2009-10, the UK extradited 699 individuals to
the EU. Perhaps there is a problem with what the warrants are being
issued for, which 
<?notus-xml column=433?>causes a great deal of concern out there in civil society. The
fundamental problem for people such as me is the extension of powers to
the European Court of Justice. Given our experience of this matter
nationally and internationally, we should be wary about that
extension.</hs_Para>

me try to bust some of the myths about this issue. There is a myth that
if we do not opt in, we will lose all co-operation with EU partners on
crime and policing. By opting out en bloc, we avoid sacrificing UK
democratic control over 127 crime and policing measures to the European
Commission and European Court of Justice. We can opt back into those
measures that serve the UK national interest. This is an opportunity to
re-cast our relationship, so that it is based on practical law
enforcement co-operation but is not part of the EU Commission’s
drive towards a single EU criminal code, enforced by a European public
prosecutor and the European Court of Justice. I can remember debates in
the European Parliament nearly a decade ago in which a single European
criminal code and a European public prosecutor were talked about very
seriously.</hs_Para>

myth is that the UK needs to give the European Commission and European
Court of Justice the last word on UK crime and policing policy to
strengthen public safety. One of the UK’s closest security
relationship is with the United States, yet we do not give the FBI or
the US Supreme Court supranational control over our policy making, so
why should do the same we in this case? Another myth is that we could
lose vital areas of co-operation such as data sharing on criminal
records. That is rubbish. We have always co-operated on those
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:59:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

am slightly concerned by the Opposition’s tendency to say that
we would be unable to extradite to European countries if we opted out
of these measures, or that each extradition case would take 10 years. I
believe that we could consider opting back into the European arrest
warrant, but only after it had been reformed so that it no longer
sacrificed UK citizens to face incompetent justice systems, as in the
Colin Dines case; corrupt police, as in the Andrew Symeou case; or
appalling prisons, as in a number of cases. We should seek to reform
the European arrest warrant, and then have a sensible debate about
whether we should opt back into it once it had been reformed. A number

Hillier</B> (Hackney South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I had
the privilege of serving in Her Majesty’s Government for three
years as a Minister in the Home Office, negotiating justice and home
affairs issues to ensure that our country was a safer place. I had the
great privilege of working with the Home Secretary’s two
immediate predecessors, both of whom were excellent Home Secretaries
who had the interests of the public very much at heart. I therefore
have enormous respect for the position of Home Secretary, and I extend
that respect to any incumbent in the role because I know the challenges
they face. I believed this Home Secretary when, on taking on the job,
she said that she took her role of protecting the public very
seriously. I therefore have to ask why she is playing such games with
the safety of the British public in her approach to the opt-out on
justice and home affairs
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:03:42"></hs_TimeCode>. Is this
an example of dog-whistle politics as she burnishes her credentials in
preparation for taking over from the Prime Minister in due course? If
so, she is not doing very well today, given that not many of her

to her speech.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:04:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris) talked about the rights of British
citizens in relation to these EU measures. I want to talk about the
rights of British victims, which should be at the heart of what any
Home Secretary does. If we were to opt out of all the justice and home
affairs measures, we could in theory opt back into certain mechanisms.
However, it is important to make it clear that that is not an automatic
right. Because so many EU member states rightly support the European
arrest warrant, there is a strong likelihood that they would agree to a
UK opt-in on that particular issue.</hs_Para>

us be clear about what the Government are saying to us. They are not

Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and many other Conservatives on both
the Back and the Front Benches are telling us that they will negotiate,
or renegotiate, an entry into the European arrest warrant on more
favourable terms, or stay out of it. At least, that is what the hints
we have heard suggest—nothing very concrete, but that is what
has come through in numerous debates in this House.</hs_Para>

change here and there in how the arrest warrant works, but that is much
better done by all 27 nations working together in justice and home
affairs Councils and negotiating together to make any amendments. That
is better than the UK going it alone, but the UK going it alone is the
sort of dog whistle approach that this Government adopt, ensuring that

Hillier:</Member></B> Absolutely. In my three years of negotiations, I
was certainly struck by how positive other EU member states were in
comparison with our Eurosceptic parliamentarians about the benefits of
being members of Europe. We need to be really clear that there is no
guarantee that we will be able to amend and then opt back in later.
Even if that were to happen, there is no timetable for it, and we could
be left uncovered for a period of time. We would have to negotiate 26
separate treaties with our EU colleagues. I cannot see them being very
positive about that. Even when we were in government, I was told many
times by my European colleagues that the UK was trying to have its cake
and eat it. Through detailed and hard-working negotiation across
government, however, we made sure that we got the best deal we could
for the British public. My personal view is that we need to opt in; we
need to amend, if necessary, on a cross-EU 27-member-state

Julian Huppert</B> (Cambridge) (LD):</Member> I find myself in a very
unusual and difficult position: I agree with the right hon. Member for
Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson). I do not know
whether he or I should be more alarmed by that, because we do not often
agree when we discuss
things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0003.htm#13061269001292">I
believe that the European police and judicial co-operation legislation
structure has been good for Britain over the last 15 years, and I
should like us to continue to be involved with it as much as possible.
I think it a shame that we have the oddities of the Lisbon treaty. The
right hon. Gentleman talked about the problems involved in negotiation.
It would be much better not to have the block opt-out, but we are where
we are. It is a shame that we were not left with something easier to
work
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0003.htm#13061269001293">What
do the public think? Seventy-seven per cent. of them think that the UK
should work “very closely” or “fairly
closely” with the EU on counter-terrorism, policing and border
security, while only 9% think that we should not. I am sure that the
Members—most of them on the Government Benches—who always
argue that we should listen to the public’s views on Europe
would agree that we should listen to them in this instance, and hence
stay firmly involved. Some of those on the Eurosceptic fringe have
concerns, but I disagree with them. I believe that working with Europe
helps us to extradite foreign criminals and bring back those who are
suspected or convicted of crimes, and enables us to share information,
intelligence and best practice. However, the deadline is
approaching.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0003.htm#13061269001294">My
current position is that it seems much cleaner, much easier and much
simpler not to opt out at all. If we did not opt out, we would not have
to go through the negotiation, there would not be the risk of not being
able to get back in, and we would not face the potential costs of doing
so. The Home Secretary rightly observed that some of the measures were
useful, some were less so and some were defunct. That is true, but we
can cope with the defunct ones. We do not have to worry too much about
them. I was disappointed that the shadow Home Secretary did not take
that line, although the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West
and Hessle did. However, I realise that the Home Secretary cannot
simply do as I suggest because of her problems within her own party. It
is therefore appropriate for us to look at the details, and to focus on
the most important
aspects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0003.htm#13061269001295">We
must listen to the experts, such as the Association of Chief Police
Officers. A senior former police and security chief has said that
pulling out of many of these measures risks putting national security,
public safety, and the UK’s reputation and international

interesting to see some—although not all—Conservatives
who pride themselves on being tough on crime taking a very “soft
on crime” approach in this instance. It is a great pleasure for
me to be able to take the “tough on crime” line quite
clearly and distinctly, because this does matter. The European arrest
warrant has been used in many cases, some of already been mentioned.
For instance, Hussain Osman, one of the individuals involved in the
attempted bombings in July 2005, was brought back from Italy
under the arrest warrant.</hs_Para>

arrest warrant could certainly be improved. It is not perfect and I
agree with many of the criticisms levelled at it. It is clear that we
need a proportionality test and I think we should go ahead with the
Eurobail approach to allow foreign criminals to be extradited to their
home countries on bail while awaiting trial. That would mean that
British citizens awaiting trial overseas could spend that time here and
that foreign citizens awaiting trial could go back to their home
countries before coming back. Those sound like sensible improvements
and I think that we should have them. If we stay inside those systems,
we can improve them and have a European arrest warrant that is much
better.</hs_Para>

such as Europol and Eurojust are key. For me, the absolute red lines
are the European arrest warrant, Europol and Eurojust. That is one
reason I prefer the Government amendment as a way towards my vision,
because the motion completely omits Eurojust from the list. Although
they both offer a way forward, I slightly prefer the one that sets out
the procedures rather than just a list.</hs_Para>

would be harder to negotiate on some of these matters externally, given
the tenor of the interactions between the Government and other European
countries, and it is important to work with people on a more friendly
basis from within the circle rather than from outside it.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:15:47"></hs_TimeCode>Eurojust is not
often talked about, but it offers us huge benefits. Some 29 joint
investigation teams involving Eurojust have made a huge difference to
the safety of our country. How would we do that work if we were to opt
out?</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) asked for
some clear positions. I hope that I have been as clear as
possible—and certainly clearer than some—that we must be
in the European arrest warrant, Europol and Eurojust and that the
European arrest warrant must be improved to make it more workable to
support British citizens and others. So many other things are
important: customs co-operation, the European criminal records
information system, financial penalties, Schengen II, the European
police training college—the list goes on and on. I agree with
those who have mentioned dealing with child pornography, the subject of
our earlier debate, and football disorder. We should be taking a
lead.</hs_Para>

must consider the debate without some of the hyperbole that has drifted
in. This is not a question of whether we should be in or out of the
EU—that is a completely different discussion, which we will
have—but of whether we want our country to be safe and secure
and to be able to co-operate to achieve that.

Committee on Home Affairs, will consider the list of opt-ins and
opt-outs when the Home Secretary eventually sends it to the Committee,
to the Select Committee on Justice and to the European Scrutiny
Committee. I agree with a lot of what he said. International
co-operation in the EU is vital and Europol and Eurojust are important.
I have just returned from a visit to Europol and was very impressed by
the work done by Rob Wainwright and his team. I am glad that the Home
Secretary is giving the House another opportunity to debate the issue
in July before she decides whether to sign the important regulation
that will allow us to be part of framing the next steps for
Europol.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette
Cooper), for giving us the chance to discuss this measure in her
precious Opposition time—and to do so in prime time, rather than
at the end of the day, which is when we normally discuss European
issues. I repeat what all other right hon. and hon. Members have said

country and who is going out and of ensuring that those who have
committed crimes and need to be returned to their country are returned

co-operation also means that if there are problems with certain
measures, we should consider them. There are problems with the European
arrest warrant, although not with the principle or vision behind the
scheme. We certainly need it, for the reasons given by the shadow Home
Secretary. The difficulties are that some EU countries are issuing
European arrest warrants for fairly trivial offences and at the moment
each extradition under the European arrest warrant costs
£18,000. The total cost to the British public in 2012 of
actioning these warrants was £27 million, and figures from the
Council of Europe showed that other European countries made 6,760
extradition requests to Britain in 2011—that is more than 130 a
week, representing a 48% rise year on year.</hs_Para>

the same 12 months when the 48% year-on-year rise took place, the
United Kingdom made just 205 requests for suspects wanted
for crimes here and only 99 were handed over. Poland generates four in
every 10 arrest warrants sent to Britain, and there has been an example
of someone being extradited back to Poland and charged with stealing a
wheelbarrow. I do not know whether that justifies £18,000 of
taxpayers’ money, but it seems like a lot of judicial time and
expense for something fairly trivial. So I am glad that the motion
talks about not only supporting the European arrest warrant, but
reforming it, because asking individual countries such as Poland to
think carefully about what they are doing is extremely

absolutely right about that and it explains why part of the process is
to talk to these countries and bilaterally engage, not on how they
could improve their system, because that would be too patronising, but
by explaining the effect their system is having on our country. That is
why I welcomed your recent historic visit to Romania, Mr
Speaker, when you were the first Speaker of the House of Commons to
address the Romanian Parliament in session. The importance of your
visit and of the discussions that my right hon. Friend has mentioned is
that we can try to persuade other EU countries of the need to
co-operate. With Romania, that came through Operation Golf; it came
through smashing those gangs that had ensured that so many young
Romanian women and men had been trafficked. If we do not have this

help the coalition. It would have been helpful if the Home Secretary
had revealed, as we have done, the key measures that she supports. This
distasteful horse-trading to see if there is some compromise, or a
handful of measures that the Government can agree on, is a very funny
way to handle the issue of crime and security. If the Government
accepted our motion, they would be agreeing to the European arrest
warrant, but of course they cannot, because the last Conservative
manifesto was against it. That is why the Home Secretary is having to
duck and dive. The Government would be supporting joint investigation
teams; agreeing to joint action on internet child pornography, which
worries so many of us; and agreeing to joint action on drugs, people
trafficking and football security—all things that we should be

support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0003.htm#13061269001318">Nearly

Government Members say that it does not matter if the European arrest

innocent to far greater risk. The classic case is that of Peter Hamkin,
a Liverpool bartender wrongly arrested in 2003 for murdering an Italian
woman because of a botched DNA match. He never set foot in Italy. New
EU regulations risk a flood of such cases. Brussels wants foreign
police to have access to the details of 38 million motorists on the UK
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency database, as well as DNA and
fingerprint records. Even the Commission concedes in its impact

Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, the hon. Member for
Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire), was absolutely right when he
said not long ago that we should not be naive about the process of
renegotiation if we want to opt out and then opt back in. As he said,

view is that thus far this has been a pretty shabby process. When we
tried to enable the House to debate the European arrest warrant during
the progress of the Crime and Courts Bill, Government Ministers and
Back Benchers talked out the debate so that we never managed to discuss
the matter at all. All the relevant Committees in this House and in the
House of Lords have complained that they have been given negligible
information by the Government. We have been given no clarity of any
kind as to what measures they might be considering opting
into—not even a clear idea on their final resolution of whether
they intend to opt out in general—and we had no clarity
today.</hs_Para>

the fact that last year the Europe Minister, who is in his place,
charming chap that he is, said that we would have a vote in both
Houses. However, he did not say whether they would be binding
votes—just that they would be votes before the Government made
their final decision. He did not say whether the votes would be on a

they would be on amendable motions. He did not say what would happen if

when he worked at No. 10 under Mrs Thatcher is now in charge of these
negotiations as the Minister for Government Policy. The other tug of
war is between Conservative Members, some of them on the ultra-right
and some on the moderate right. Some might be referred to historically
as the H-block—the Heaton-Harris and Hannan end of the
Conservative party. It reminds me of the Old Testament—two women
claim that a baby is theirs and it is only when Solomon says that the
baby should be cut in half that one of them owns up. I am worried that
the Government’s policy-making process means that they are
simply playing a numbers game in which they spin different things to

all about British citizens being extradited, but the vast majority of

the decision that the previous Administration left us to make is
whether to exercise the opt-out by 31 May 2014. The
Opposition motion and a number of the contributions this evening have
given the impression that this is a rushed decision. Before coming to a
final view on such an important matter, the Government must be
satisfied that they have worked through all the options, understood the
implications of them, provided Parliament with as much information as
is practical and given Members the chance to debate the issues in an
informed way. That is the proper way for a Government to conduct
business and that is precisely what we are committed to

I remind Members that some 130 measures are subject to this decision,
not just the handful named in the Opposition motion. While the
Opposition may view those measures as the most important ones that are
subject to the decision—although in the light of the
contributions this evening, I am not so sure about that—I do not
agree that we should single out individual measures when making the
large opt-out decision. Instead, we should look at the measures in the
round. That is to say, we should consider all 130 or so of them. We
must take a decision based purely on what is in the national
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001371" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0004.htm#13061269001371">My

we should opt out of all pre-Lisbon policing and criminal justice

am not clear what benefit is to be gained by holding a vote on a motion
that only partially deals with this matter. Surely it is better to

decision on exercising the UK’s opt-out will be taken in the
national interest. After contributions from hon. Members, including the
hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier), let me say
clearly that this is not about playing games or not acting
responsibly—something the Home Secretary made crystal clear in
her contribution this afternoon. Consideration will be given to how a
measure contributes to public safety and security, whether practical
co-operation is underpinned by the measure, and whether there would be
a detrimental effect on such co-operation if pursued by other
mechanisms. That is the correct and measured approach the Government
will take.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:56:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris) highlighted the impact of
European Court of Justice jurisdiction. Much of the third-pillar
legislation was made to the lowest common denominator in order to
secure unanimity, and it was not negotiated with European Court of
Justice jurisdiction in mind. Much of the drafting reflects that and is
not of a high standard. Indeed, some of it is ambiguous and could lend
itself to expansive interpretation by the Court—a point
effectively made by my hon. Friend. He also referred to the Metock case
that highlights the issues involved and why this matter must be
considered so carefully.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) highlighted
evidence from the Association of Chief Police Officers which said that
55 of the measures in the basket have no practical effect, and that is
why the evidence presented must be weighed carefully.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:57:40"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)
highlighted the balance of competences review, but that is a separate
matter concerning modifications to treaties. The issue currently before
the House concerns the utilisation of a measure in an existing
treaty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061269001376" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0004.htm#13061269001376">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Steve McCabe) seemed to imply
that there was no room for practical co-operation, but there absolutely
is. Much of our co-operation to fight crime and terrorism does not
depend on EU-level instruments. Indeed, our operational partners
co-operate closely on a daily basis and that will not change. We have
been clear throughout this process that where there is a case for
practical co-operation with other European partners, the Government
will support it.</hs_Para>

hon. Members, including the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee,
highlighted Europol. Obviously, the Commission has published a new

context of the new measure and existing measures that fall within the
basket. We also expect the publication of new instruments in relation
to Eurojust.</hs_Para>

of the assessment in October 2008 and February 2012, 1.36
million new claimants were assessed and of those 794,000 were declared
fit for work. Of those, 311,900 appealed their decision and 116,400
were successful. That means that nearly one in 10 of all ESA
assessments have been overturned. Although the proportion of decisions
overturned has started to fall, the overall number remains very high.
And those figures do not include all the incapacity benefit claimants
currently being migrated to ESA—a process that started last year
and is due to be completed in
2014.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:14:36"></hs_TimeCode> The cost

year I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the recommendations for new
descriptors for mental, intellectual and cognitive conditions that were
drawn up by a number of charities. In December last year I secured
another debate, in which I highlighted the fact that people are
regularly called back for reassessments just months after their
previous claim has been granted. Today I want to focus on the provision
of audio recording equipment in assessments. I sent the Minister an
advance copy of my speech, because this is a serious issue that
deserves an attempt to reach a constructive solution. I will spare him
the need to spend time telling me that it was my Government who started
the employment and support allowance. I know that. It is
people’s experience of the system that has shown many of us that
it needs substantial reform.</hs_Para>

assessments carried out by Atos have been much criticised. Assertions
have been made about some of the questions asked and the attitude of
assessors. For example, I recently met a constituent—by no
stretch of the imagination is she a disability activist—who told
me that the assessor made a comment about her handbag, saying,
“Well I couldn’t afford that, even on my salary.”
My constituent tells me it was a present, but she felt the comment was
irrelevant and carried the implication that she did not need the
benefit. Such assertions are regularly denied by Atos and not accepted
by the Department for Work and Pensions. We even have differences of
opinion on the Select Committee on Work and Pensions, with some members
feeling that campaigning organisations exaggerate such
claims.</hs_Para>

recording of assessments would allow such disputes to be settled once
and for all. Importantly, they would provide new evidence in the event
of appeals, but should also improve the quality of assessments, thereby
reducing the number of appeals and helping to get things right first

highest possible standard—for example, taking more time, asking
open as opposed to closed questions, and probing for possible follow-up

to some claimants not turning up for their assessment, or eventually
deciding that they did not want a recording, the figure for those whose
assessments were recorded dropped to 46%. That figure is still
substantial, however, and the demand for audio recordings is reflected
in one of Atos’s key conclusions, which
stated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:21:10"></hs_TimeCode>:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13061288000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0004.htm#13061288000550">“Our

questions and freedom of information requests have yielded another
metric to defend the Government’s position—namely, that
only 1% of the claimants in the pilot requested a copy of their
recording. However, that cannot be regarded as an accurate reflection 
<?notus-xml column=458?>of demand, for two reasons. First, assessors in the pilot used hand-held
devices and the recordings had to be transferred to computers and burnt
to CDs after the assessments. That meant that claimants could not pick
up their recording on the day but had to go to the added effort of
making a request in writing. In effect, that required claimants to opt
into the pilot and then opt in again to get their recording. We also do
not know what the claimants thought the pilot was about. Often, when we
phone helplines, we are told on a recorded message that the call will
be recorded for staff training purposes. It is possible that the
claimants in the pilot were not clear about its purpose.</hs_Para>

claimants were told that recordings would be of use to them only in the
event of an appeal. Given that the report was completed just days after
the pilot concluded, most of those involved would not yet have received
a decision on their claim, let alone come to a view on whether they
would appeal. Demand for copies might well have been higher had this
metric been measured after a longer
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:22:52"></hs_TimeCode>. I
therefore ask the Minister to accept that the number of claimants in
the pilot who requested a copy of their recording is not an accurate
reflection of demand, and that the number of people acquiescing to
their assessment being recorded is a more appropriate metric to
use<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:23:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061288000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/debtext/130612-0004.htm#13061288000020">Turning

the assessors did in this pilot was to take a small number of reports,

I would contend that the key performance indicator for the work

involved taking larger samples of both recorded and unrecorded
assessments and examining the proportion of successful appeals for
both. If they were the same, it would have been fair to conclude the
recordings make no difference; but if there were a smaller proportion
of successful appeals from those that were recorded, it would be

need to be clear, too, whether the current roll-out is actually just
another pilot still to be evaluated. If it is to be evaluated, it would
be useful to know what is going to be evaluated. This has a relevance
beyond the employment and support allowance because the DWP now says
that it will make a decision about audio recording of personal
independence payment assessments after the evaluation of the ESA
experience. That is despite the fact that one of the companies
tendering for that PIP assessment, Capita, originally offered to audio

answer some of the issues. If people are anxious about these
assessments, their confidence would certainly be improved in this way.
If, as some suggest, the assertions made by claimants are exaggerated,
that would be established, too, and we would all be happier. We need to
know—it is a bit unclear—whether we are going to re-run
another pilot, whether what is going on is a pilot and, if so, how it

I want to raise three sets of questions. First, will the Minister
accept on the basis of how the pilot was carried out that requests for
copies of audio recordings should not be cited as a reflection of
demand, and does he accept that the number of people who want to have
their assessment recorded is a more appropriate measurement to use?
Secondly, will the Minister tell me exactly what steps are being taken,
and how quickly, to inform claimants that their assessments can be
recorded? If people do not know that that service is available, they
will hardly ask for it. Will the Minister also tell me how many audio
recording devices Atos now has access to, and whether there will be a
wider, permanent roll-out or merely a further pilot? Finally, will the
Minister accept Professor Harrington’s call for more work to be
done, so that there can be a proper
evaluation?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_12_PT_1/237A8DC8115BD4B01D368DAF4DDE969AC92AA8E3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 June 2013">Wednesday

has been an increase in demand for its use, we must be sure that we
understand the evidence base, including that relating to the value to
claimants. Making knee-jerk policy is not an option. The evidence needs
to be balanced against potential costs, and that is the process in

me put our commitment into more context. Those who want an audio
recording can request one, but a claimant has no legal right to an
audio-recorded assessment, and neither the DWP nor Atos
Healthcare has a legal obligation to provide an audio-recording service

provide the best possible service for claimants, but the unavailability
of audio recording facilities does not mean that the WCA process can be

independent review of the WCA recommended that the Atos Healthcare
pilot audio recording of assessments should be used to determine
whether such an approach is helpful for claimants and improves the
quality of assessments. In making that recommendation, Professor
Harrington rightly noted the need to balance potential drawbacks such
as the increased burdens on tribunals and the sharing of sensitive
personal data, with potential improvements in both assessor and
claimant

that recommendation, the audio pilot took place in the Newcastle
assessment centre during spring 2011. The pilot involved 500 claimants
being offered the chance to volunteer to have their assessment
recorded. The results of the pilot showed that less than half of those
offered ended up having an audio recorded assessment and only a

point, but I am sorry that he has chosen simply to repeat the 1% figure

key areas that Professor Harrington wanted to understand when he called
for the original
pilot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:36:43"></hs_TimeCode>. As a
result the Department decided not to introduce audio recording of
face-to-face assessments universally on the basis that a facility for
all assessments would be extremely costly, with no apparent substantial
benefit or improvement in the quality of
assessments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:36:58"></hs_TimeCode>. We
ensured that when claimants asked for an audio recording, we were in a

me say a little about current demand. Since the introduction of a
limited audio recording facility in September 2011, fewer than 4,000
claimants have requested a recorded assessment. To date, Atos has
conducted more than 2,000 audio-recorded assessments. During that
period almost 1.5 million face-to-face assessments for both ESA and
incapacity benefit reassessments have been completed. Therefore, the
proportion of recorded assessments is less than 0.2% of all assessments
carried out during the period. We need to continue to monitor that
take-up, but universal recording for such low numbers does not seem
prudent and might not provide value for

Qureshi</B> (Bolton South East) (Lab):</Member> It is a privilege to
open this debate and to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hood. The
issues of human rights, equality and justice and the plight of the
persecuted people of Burma are potent for Members of both Houses and
have caused considerable concern to a number of my constituents in
Bolton South East who have family and relatives living in Burma.
Indeed, a number of them formed a small campaign group called the Burma
Action group, which has organised two peaceful vigils in Bolton town
centre. I thank both that group for its hard work in raising awareness
of human rights abuses in Burma and the London-based charity, Burma
Campaign, for its excellent work.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:31:22"></hs_TimeCode>I acknowledge
and pay tribute to Members who have worked hard to raise the awareness
of some of the issues, especially

Foreign Secretary once said that the Government of Burma must be judged
by their actions and not their words, yet over the past 18 months the
UK Government have reversed a decade-long policy of prioritising human
rights in Burma and supported the lifting of all European sanctions on
the country despite the fact that none of the human rights benchmarks
of the European Union has been met. Even <I>The</I> <I>Daily Telegraph
</I>described that decision as “deeply embarrassing”.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:32:15"></hs_TimeCode>Undoubtedly,
there have been some changes in Burma over the past two years, but
still more need to be encouraged. However, the policy must be carefully
calibrated, taking into account the wide disparity between words and
action. Burma<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:32:28"></hs_TimeCode>
still has one of the worst human rights records in the world. Since
Thein Sein became president, human rights abuses, which violate
international law, have increased.

June 2011, the Burmese army in Kachin state broke a 17-year ceasefire
with the Kachin Independence Organisation, and for the past two years
it has pursued a brutal war against the Kachin people, targeting
civilians and violating international law. The United Nations special
rapporteur has documented widespread abuses, which constitute war
crimes and crimes against humanity. Rape and gang rape, torture,
executions, arson, mortar bombing of civilian villages, beatings and
the use of child soldiers are commonplace. The UN Human Rights Council
resolution on Burma, passed in March 2013, highlighted serious human
rights abuses that violate international law, including arbitrary
detention, forced displacement, land confiscations, rape and other
forms of sexual violence, torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading
treatment, as well as other violations of international humanitarian
law. None the less, the Government of Burma still deny that human
rights 
<?notus-xml column=72?>abuses have taken

asked about the abuses in a recent interview, Lieutenant General Myint

one of the most disturbing elements of the conflict in Kachin has been
the widespread use of rape by the Burmese army. It is reported that
more than half of the women raped or gang raped by soldiers were also
tortured, mutilated and killed. Perhaps the Minister could explain why,
in the G8 summit, the Prime Minister decided to leave Burma out of the
preventing sexual violence initiative? I would have thought that
highlighting the increased use of rape by the Burmese army was of more
importance than promoting an inaccurate positive image of Burma, which
is what we have seen in recent
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:35:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I urge
the Minister to press the Burmese Government to enter proper political
dialogue on Kachin state to ensure that they address the root causes of
the violence instead of constantly delaying such
talks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:35:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000010">In

publicised Muslim people, who are historically located in the coastal
Rakhine state, dating their ethnic lineage in the region over
centuries. When the military junta under General Ne Win, an ethnic
Burmese, came to power in 1962, it implemented  a policy of
“Burmanisation”, which was based on a nationalist
ideology of racial purity. It was a crude attempt to bolster the
majority Burmese ethnic identity and to strip the Rohingya of any
legitimacy. The Rohingya were declared foreigners in their own native
land and labelled illegal Bengali immigrants. By stripping them of
citizenship and denying them citizenship, the Government
institutionalised discriminatory practices in Rakhine state.</hs_Para>

Rohingya have no rights to own land or property and are unable to
travel outside their villages, repair their decaying places of worship,
receive education, or even marry and have children without rarely
granted Government permission. Although I am sure that hon. Members
will recall the events of last summer, I will none the less run through
them quickly. In June 2012, deadly violence erupted between the
Buddhist Rakhine community and the Rohingya Muslims. Human Rights
Watch, a respected and independent international body, reported that
state security forces failed to intervene to stop the violence or
protect civilians, and in some cases they directly participated. Rather
than defuse the situation, President Thein Sein was highly provocative.
He called for the “illegal” Rohingya to be sent to a
third country. Since most Rohingya, even those whose families have
resided in Burma for generations, lack formal legal status, his
language implied that the great majority of Burma’s Rohingya did
not belong in the country. His comments were eagerly seized on by those
who favour the expulsion of all Rohingya from
Burma.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000013">In
a recent Human Rights Watch report, a copy of which I have with me, it
is documented that the violence that resumed in October was a
co-ordinated campaign of ethnic cleansing, which sought to remove or
relocate the state’s Muslim population. The October attacks were
organised and carried out by local Rakhine political party officials,
Buddhist monks and ordinary Rakhines, often directly supported by state
security
forces<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

says that Rohingya men, women and children were killed; some of them
were secretly buried in mass graves, and their villages and
neighbourhoods were razed. In the months since the violence, the
Burmese Government have done little to investigate the killings and
abuses or to hold people to account for such
crimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000015">Along
with complicity in crimes against humanity, the Burmese Government have
contributed to the severe humanitarian crisis facing the displaced
Rohingya and other Muslim communities. More than 125,000 people are now
living in internally displaced persons camps in urgent need of
humanitarian assistance, yet the Government have consistently
obstructed the delivery of aid to them. The camps are overcrowded and
lack adequate food, shelter, water and sanitation, as well as medical
care.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> Unless
there is a dramatic improvement in conditions in the camps, including

are faced with considerable evidence of crimes against humanity; ethnic
cleansing; mass graves;  and the obstruction of humanitarian
aid to displaced communities. Those claims should not be taken lightly.
There has been a tendency to describe the violence in Rakhine state as
communal and a reflection of deep-seated hatred between communities on
the ground.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>, the
findings in the Human Rights Watch report tell a very different
story—of extensive state involvement, and planned killings and
destruction of property, as well as the forced displacement of a
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000017">Only<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:40:18"></hs_TimeCode>

premature in its haste to lift economic sanctions on Burma.

Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:40:45"></hs_TimeCode> have no

responsible for organising the violence? It is easy to call on the
Burmese Government to investigate themselves when we are fully aware
that they will not do so. The Burmese Government-organised Rakhine
commission, which was set up to investigate the violence, did not even
consider any issues relating to who was

needs to be an international investigation into the violence. I urge
the Minister to support the establishment of a UN commission of inquiry
to examine the allegations of ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity. After all, we worked with the rest of the international
community to set up the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former
Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, precisely because there had been ethnic
cleansing and crimes against humanity in those countries. I do not see
why there should not be a similar inquiry in Burma; even if there is
not a tribunal, at least in the first place there should be an
independent inquiry led by the UN, which can investigate and deal with
all the issues that have arisen. Obviously it must be an impartial
international investigation. 
<?notus-xml column=74?>Then we will know the truth, and we will be able to hold to account the
people responsible. Of course, such an investigation may also provide
useful information and act as the basis for future

pressure to repeal the discriminatory 1982 citizenship law. All the
Rohingya people want is reinstatement of their citizenship in their own
land, and the dignity, human rights and opportunities that come with
it. Human rights must be the single most defining test for the Burmese

Qureshi:</Member></B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman on that
point. That is why we are asking other Governments to put pressure on
the Burmese Government. There have been suggestions that we are almost
in haste to have negotiations and win contracts with the Burmese, to
increase financial gains or financial stability. That is all very well,
but the human rights issue is paramount, and the Burmese Government
must be told that what they are doing is wrong.</hs_Para>

I was saying, the issue is not just that different communities are not
getting on with each other, as it has been described. Those who have
studied the history of Burma, particularly what has been going on since
the 1960s, know that there is a deliberate, calculated policy
effectively to get rid of people in Burma who are not ethnically
Burmese Buddhist. In Kachin state, which I have talked about, most of
the people who are persecuted are, in fact, Christians; they are
treated badly. The Rohingya people are Muslims. In another state, the
Karen people are treated just as badly because they happen to be
neither Christian, Burmese Buddhist nor Muslim. It seems that there is
a pattern. There is not just one group the Burmese Government are
against; there is a very sinister and deep underlying issue. The motive
behind most of these actions is to get rid of other communities and
other religions in Burma, not only to leave the Burmese Buddhist
community as the main community but perhaps to keep Burma almost
ethnically pure Burmese and
Buddhist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:46:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000025">That
is why the state has been completely complicit, as has the army. Yes,
Burma held elections last year, which we thought would bring progress,
but everybody knows that all that happened was that most of the 
<?notus-xml column=75?>generals took off their uniforms and got into civilian clothes, and the
majority of the people who are involved in
Parliament are military people. There is still very much a military
dictatorship in every form.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:47:02"></hs_TimeCode>The situation
should not be seen as conflict between communities who are not getting
on; a much worse and far more sinister agenda is being pursued by those

the past, other Governments have gone into various parts of the world

minute suggesting a military intervention, but there should be robust
sanctions and a robust programme against what the Burmese Government
are doing. They should be held to account.</hs_Para>

summit that is taking place, rape will be looked at in different
countries. Burma has been omitted from those countries, yet Burma is
the place where most rapes are taking place. As the Minister may be
aware, many years ago an international case held that rape is, in fact,
a form of genocide, because the idea of carrying out rape—not to
get graphic—is effectively to ensure that the women of the
population being attacked are impregnated by members of other ethnic
groups, and therefore rape is effectively about trying to get rid of
that particular generation. There is a high level of rape in Burma, and
it is an indicator of what I described earlier, which was not
scaremongering or exaggeration; it seems to be part of a ploy to make
Burma a Buddhist Burmese country. Surely that cannot be right, when
there have been communities made up of different ethnic or religious
groups living in Burma for hundreds of years.</hs_Para>

am also here because, like the hon. Lady, I have been approached by
constituents concerned about the human rights situation in
Burma—not exclusively the matters on the Order Paper today. As
the hon. Lady rightly said, conflicts in various parts of Burma involve
all the minority groups in the country, including minority religious
groups such as Christian and Muslim groups as well as animist groups
and those from other marginal religions, and they seem to involve just
about any group that does not have some claim to what might be

reality is also that Burma is the poorest country in south-east Asia;
it is a by-word for poverty and under-investment and, as the hon. Lady
passionately pointed out, for discrimination as well. I support exactly
what the hon. Lady said—that discrimination is not casual and
not accidental; it is clearly orchestrated and state-sanctioned, or at
least the state allows things to proceed with complete impunity.
Reports of destruction of mosques and homes, and attacks on
individuals, with the police and security forces standing by and simply
allowing it to happen, illustrate that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T09:53:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000033">I
do not want us to be blind to our own history, either. There is a
tendency for us—perhaps particularly in England, but certainly
in western countries—to imagine that we have lived for the past
1,000 years in countries with secure human rights, where these things
could never have happened, and we seek to export that to other people.
I remind hon. Members that 200 years ago I would not have been

give credit to the work that successive Governments have done,
particularly in the past three years, in making this country the
biggest aid donor to Burma at the moment. That gives us a significant
role and voice in respect of Burma’s future and how it should
develop. A contribution of some £1 million was made last year
towards improving governance and civic society in Burma, 
<?notus-xml column=77?>and humanitarian help was in the order of £2 million or £3
million. That means that it must be right for us to engage strongly, as
a country, as well as through EU and UN institutions, with the Burmese

part of a bigger pattern, as she also said. It is to be welcomed that
the military forces have signed some kind of ceasefire in 12 out of
the  14 different conflicts that had been going on in Burma,

alternative ethnicities as having legitimacy inside the

think—perhaps the Minister will comment on this—that
there is a certain amount of game-playing by the military authorities

their own citizens, to go through at least the appearance of sharing
power and drawing in the Opposition, but, as the hon. Lady said, the

macho posturing that we have seen in conflicts inside Burma comes in
the category of flexing muscles and demonstrating the role and

notice, again from the papers prepared for the debate, that the UK was
proud to boast that its military officials were the first foreign

I can see the value of getting alongside the military forces in Burma
and of demonstrating to Burmese military officials and leaders our
forces’ values and their role in civic society, but I would be
concerned if we were showing them how to be better at suppressing

nationalism, as it develops its state, which it very much needs to do.

start by simply saying that if a country denies people within its

them law, basic services and human rights. The right to life, the right
to family life and the right to practise one’s religion are not
dependent on citizenship,

me echo the words of the hon. Lady by saying that it is puzzling why
Burma is not on the preventing sexual violence initiative list. I have
seen some of the parliamentary answers on the issue. As somebody who
was giving parliamentary answers himself until last September, I know
how they are written and what lies behind them. There really is no good
reason why we should not be saying that we want to put Burma on the
list. It is an excellent initiative, which is capable of doing a lot of
good. We should take real credit for initiating and promoting it, but
there is a strange reluctance to apply it in this case.</hs_Para>

underlining that military sanctions remain in place, and rightly so.
However, I would like to hear from the Minister whether consideration
has been given to making the withdrawal of sanctions conditional on
further positive developments. Sanctions have been lifted, but they
could be reimposed, and the Burmese authorities need to be clear that
that is a consideration.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi) on
securing this important debate. As she knows, I recently visited
Rakhine state, courtesy of Refugees International and Burma Campaign
UK. I had the opportunity to visit Rohingya, Kaman and Rakhine camps. I
went because I wanted to see first hand the humanitarian challenges
faced by those communities, and particularly by the Rohingya Muslims,
whose situation I, like other hon.
Members,<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:06:07"></hs_TimeCode> want to
highlight. Many constituents have come to me to raise concerns about
what is happening in Burma and about the treatment of the Rohingya
community, not to mention the many other minorities that form 40% of
the Burmese population.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=79?><hs_Para UID="13061243000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000050"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:06:24"></hs_TimeCode>Since
inter-communal violence erupted a year ago almost this month, Rohingya
Muslims in Rakhine state have been forced into segregated settlements
and camps, and many have been cut off from life-saving aid. The
humanitarian situation in Rakhine state is dire. Tens of thousands of
people are still living in makeshift camps, where they lack food,
water, sanitation, adequate shelter and access to health
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:06:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000051">The
violence has caused not only massive internal displacement, but loss of
life, livelihoods and property. Many have seen their homes and villages
burned to the ground. I witnessed places where there was row after row
of cut-down trees and nothing else. Such places used to be
people’s homes, where Rohingya lived side by side with Rakhine
neighbours. Muslim and Buddhist communities that had previously been
able to live together, albeit not necessarily in full harmony, remain
deeply divided, and the violence is spreading around the country. It is
directed particularly against the 9% of Burma’s population that
is Muslim. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:07:42"></hs_TimeCode>As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:07:44"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell) said, Christian minorities are
also likely to be affected.</hs_Para>

my visit, I met displaced Rohingya who were forced to flee to remote
areas of the countryside completely unsuitable for displacement camps.
I also saw informal camps, which were not registered, or allowed to be
registered, by the UN, and which therefore had no access to
humanitarian assistance. They had to rely on the good will of local
people and Muslim charities, whose access to the camps is also
extremely limited. Those camps need to be registered, but the UK
Government and other Governments have been unable to get state
authorities and the national Government to agree to register them. By
any standards, these camps should be a high priority for registration
and should be recognised as being desperately in need of help. They are
adjacent to the registered camps.</hs_Para>

camp I visited, in Pauk Taw township, was accessible only by means of a
two-hour boat journey. Non-governmental organisations had to bring
drinking water in on boats, and primary health care was provided just
one morning a week. The shores adjacent to the camp were covered in
faeces, and dead rats floated in the water just metres from children
who were bathing to keep cool in the scorching heat. Their home is a
camp on a beach; I was there for only two hours, and that was long
enough for me and the delegation I went with. I recommend that the
Minister and his ministerial colleagues from the Department for
International Development visit that camp. It is only when we see the
desperate situation those children and families face that we can truly
understand the plight of Burma’s internally displaced
people.</hs_Para>

of the shelters I saw were made of tarpaulins and rice bags, which
cannot withstand even moderate rains. One Rohingya man told me that
displaced people—particularly those living near the
coast—were growing increasingly frightened of the rains. With
the start of the rainy season there are serious concerns that flooding
will exacerbate the humanitarian situation and increase the risk of
waterborne diseases.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061243000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000055"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:10:22"></hs_TimeCode>I
visited a hospital that was set up with state assistance. A couple of
charities were allowed to provide some additional funding, but the only
people able to help there were untrained nurses. Doctors were not
allowed in, even though international NGOs had offered to 
<?notus-xml column=80?>provide doctors. The only other place where people can get emergency
care is the local Rakhine hospital, where there is a unit of 12 to 14
segregated beds for the whole population of 140,000 people. What I saw
was shocking. A man was waiting for an operation. I did not see any
sign of anaesthetics, and the hygiene was appalling, yet doctors could
go in there if they were allowed access by the state and national
Governments.</hs_Para>

need the British Government, and particularly the Foreign Office, to
apply pressure on the state government and national Government to
provide unfettered humanitarian access. There is no shortage of good
will from international NGOs and foreign Governments or of willingness
from UN agencies to provide help. The World Health Organisation needs
to step up and apply pressure for access, so that emergency care can be
brought to people. I heard stories of many people—particularly
women—dying unnecessarily because of the lack of health care.
That experience—observing hospitals turning people away in
life-and-death situations because of their ethnicity and the fact that
they are not recognised—echoed, to me, apartheid. I do not use
that term lightly. Being forced into camps and not allowed out is the
equivalent of being a prisoner in one’s own
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:12:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000057">Will
the Minister reassure the House that he is working with his colleagues
in the Department for International Development to help to improve the
conditions I have talked about? Given that there are flood-prone areas,
the need for shelter should be dealt with urgently. It is likely that
the existing crisis will turn into a catastrophe if we do not act
immediately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:13:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000058">The
Burmese Government recently evacuated 120,000 people in Rakhine state,
ahead of cyclone Mahasen. However, the lack of safe evacuation sites
remains a key concern during the monsoon season. The Foreign Office has
significant influence over the Burmese authorities, so in making
representations, what pressure is it using, with DFID colleagues, for
people to have the security to return voluntarily and safely to the
places they came from, or places nearby? At the moment there is little
hope that they will be able to return. Many people said to me that they
had pretty good relationships with their neighbours. It was not those
neighbours who caused the violence, but Buddhist extremists, who came
and stirred up tension and conflict. Now, people are too frightened to
go back, as are the Rakhine refugees who were caught in the violence.
These are ordinary civilians, who were getting on with their lives.
Both sides need security so that they can return. However, there is
concern that the state government’s agenda is not to allow that,
but to keep people in the camps. That is not
sustainable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:14:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000059">The
movement of the Muslim community in Rakhine state has been heavily
restricted, as I have said. The story is one of segregation and
desperation—a humanitarian catastrophe that cannot be
dissociated from the fact that the Rohingya population do not have the
right to Burmese citizenship, or, therefore, any further consequential
rights, including access to humanitarian assistance, freedom of
movement, or connecting with their Rakhine neighbours to trade with
them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061243000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000060">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:15:24"></hs_TimeCode>
of the things that I experienced was trying to get to one of the few
Rohingya villages that are left in the part of Rakhine I visited. Half
way through the journey the Rakhine driver had to stop. He was too
frightened to go beyond the point where he saw the military. He 
<?notus-xml column=81?>would not go further, and we had to find a Rohingya driver to take us
further. On the way back we had to do the same thing. Likewise, we had
an interpreter who was supposed to go to Pauk Taw with us. However, we
were refused passage in the boat, because we were going to visit
Rohingya Muslims in the camp, which was two hours away by boat, so we
came close to not having access. The Rohingya interpreter was not
allowed to go in with us to interpret, and we had to find another one.
Rakhine interpreters were not prepared to go with us. One person agreed
in the end, subject to anonymity. That gives an idea of the scale of
the problem, and it is why we need to act fast. We need to ensure that
what little good will remains between people—it is being
annihilated by the understandable fear in the different
communities—does not become overwhelmed, with little room left
for reconciliation and reintegration with
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000061">I
mentioned that the Muslim community’s movement is restricted.
The critical point is that its members cannot do anything: they cannot
do business, or trade, and supplies to those that still trade are
blocked. They are therefore increasingly vulnerable, and the only route
by which they can get food, shelter and help is through international
agencies. The displaced Rohingya and Kaman told me they would never be
allowed to return home because, in their words, the local authorities
were trying to create Muslim-free zones. As the recent Human Rights
Watch report highlighted, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that
what happened was well orchestrated and backed by the state government.
At best the national Government turned a blind eye, and at worst they
were complicit.</hs_Para>

recurring theme that came up in my discussions with internally
displaced people was the threat to their security and safety, which
often prevented them from returning to their place of origin, even if
they were allowed to. Will the UK Government use their position and
influence to exert pressure on the Burmese national Government and
state government in Rakhine, to ensure that security forces on the
ground provide adequate protection to all ethnic communities, and
particularly the Rohingya community? There are concerns—and this
has been documented—that police who were present during the
violence tended to stand by. There seems to be much more confidence in
the security forces, and that must be encouraging. However, it would be
helpful to know what the Minister thinks the UK Government can do to
encourage the authorities both to help people to return home, and to
resettle them with the protection they need to avoid further similar
events: I am thinking of what happened in the key events of June and
October last year, and March this year, in Meiktila.</hs_Para>

I visited camps, where malnutrition rates are dangerously near
emergency levels and where people are forced to live in segregated
areas cut off from their livelihoods and are struggling to survive, I
did not expect citizenship and identity to top the list of
issues  
<?notus-xml column=82?>that people wanted to talk about. However, every group of Rohingya men
and women, including children, to whom I spoke told me that their
priority was recognition of their Rohingya identity and the restoration
of their Burmese citizenship rights, which were taken away from them in
the 1980s. Many Rohingyas were keen to insist that ethnic Rohingya
Muslims had been in Burma for centuries, yet the national and state
Governments deny them their Burmese citizenship and their ethnic
Rohingya identity, instead claiming that they are “Kala,”
a racist derogatory term, or Bengali migrants from
Bangladesh.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061243000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061243000065">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:20:57"></hs_TimeCode>

my visit, the authorities were conducting a “verification

believe the Burmese Government have engaged in a campaign of ethnic
cleansing against the Rohingya that continues today through the denial
of aid and the use of restrictions. There have been violent mass
arrests, aid to displaced Muslims has been blocked and there have been
months of meetings and public statements promoting ethnic cleansing,
all of which builds up to a co-ordinated plan. A number of mass graves
have been found. The news last night carried stories of displaced

contribution will focus on three main issues: the Kachin state, land
grab and humanitarian issues. I apologise for the speed. Kachin is
predominantly a Christian state. I was pleased that Mr Speaker granted
my urgent question in January. On the day of that debate, a child of 15
and a pastor were killed. I got a helpful response from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T10:35:21"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, the hon.
Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt), saying that they
were in the wrong place at the wrong time. What we see as crimes go
unrecognised in that state. The police stand by. Some 100,000 people
have been displaced in Kachin. Although a ceasefire has been announced,
it appeared to be on the very day that General Thein was in America.
Christian Solidarity Worldwide reports that abuses are still taking
place, even after the ceasefire.</hs_Para>

issue is land grab. People who have been living on the land and using
it to feed themselves have been displaced. The Asian Legal Resource
Centre, in a submission to the United Nations Human Rights Council in
June, warned that Burma is in danger of a land-grabbing epidemic.
Forests have been cleared, dams and pipelines are being built and the
people are just being ignored. The Burmese Parliament has a land
investigation committee, but it has seen only about 500 complaints, and
many ethnic minorities do not even know that it exists.</hs_Para>

the humanitarian aspects, all Members have rightly mentioned the
reports from Human Rights Watch, Christian Solidarity Worldwide and
even the Kachin Women’s Association. There is a global movement
against human trafficking. Women are being trafficked into China and
back again. They cannot do anything with their lives once they have
been humiliated in that way. Attacks are consistently systematic. The
reports are clear, and they all say the same things: people are being
threatened. Local aid groups say that workers are also being threatened
by local administrations. A child died after drinking from a stream
poisoned by
pesticides.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061245000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061245000028">Daw
Suu Kyi has gone the extra mile to ensure that her country moves on.
Although EU sanctions were lifted, with some criticism in some
quarters, I ask the Minister to raise a number of issues in exchange.
First, will he raise the human rights issues set out in the reports and
ensure that he speaks to the Burmese Government or his counterpart and
that the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights finds a
place in Burma, as agreed by the Burmese Government? Will he ensure,
more importantly, that aid given to

term, a constitutional solution is needed, as is a second Panglong
conference. We must use our resources and expertise to ensure that the

choose their own religion, whatever it happens to be. We have a long
history with Burma, and we should be able to walk hand in hand as Burma
finds a new constitutional settlement that respects human rights and
the rule of law. As one worker said, we need to move away from the
ceasefire process to a peace process. We can help Burma step out from
behind the faded politics of the past. That can be achieved only
through dialogue, respect for each group and the rule of law and, most
importantly,

should start by welcoming the major changes made in Burma over recent
years. The country had been so long isolated from the rest of the

we have seen elsewhere in the world, however, such rapid change can

has been progress in Burma in the last two years. Hundreds of political
prisoners have been released, most notably Aung San Suu Kyi, who now
sits in the Burmese Parliament building alliances and working to
strengthen the process of reform. There has been a general relaxation
of the crippling censorship and onerous infringements of freedom of
expression that once characterised Burma. Civil society organisations,
non-governmental organisations, unions and individuals  are
freer to organise and to act. The international
community—Governments, NGOs and others—deserve praise for
their significant pressure on successive Burmese Governments, which has
led to the improvements of the 
<?notus-xml column=91?>past two years. However, that does not mean that there are not
significant issues that need to be addressed, as we have heard this
morning, and that progress is not still a long and difficult road
ahead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061245000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061245000055">It

Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development
are significantly engaged at senior ministerial level with Burma. The
Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Devon, was

pressing concern. The UN is building temporary shelters for 24,000
people, but 40,000 more remain vulnerable to flooding, a point that
hon. Members rightly made. We must continue to do more. Significant
work has been done and continues to be done, but I want to ensure that

Friend the Member for Hazel Grove referred to the relationship between
the UK and Burmese militaries. At the request of Aung San Suu Kyi
during her meeting with the Prime Minister last year, we have an
accredited defence attaché in Burma. She specifically
recommended that appointment as a key channel for engagement with the
Burmese military. As my right hon. Friend said, the Chief of the
Defence Staff visited Burma from 2 to 4 June as the next stage of our
engagement. I assure my right hon. Friend and other hon. Members that
the focus of that engagement will  be on adherence to the core
principles of democratic accountability and human rights. There must be
accountability for those who took part and organised last year’s
violence. The process of justice must be in accordance with the rule of

hon. Member for Bolton South East made an essential point related to
the recent report from Human Rights Watch—the UN special
rapporteur raised similar concerns in his report in February. I
reiterate the point that she rightly articulated: the report contains
disturbing and specific allegations, backed up by evidence. We will
follow up those allegations directly with the Burmese Government. If
serious crimes have been committed, those who perpetrated them must be
held to account for their specific actions. That should be done through
a clear and transparent investigative and prosecution process that
meets international standards. Further investigative work must fully
establish the facts that will be required for an informed assessment of
whether ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity have been
committed. The Government are looking carefully and seriously at the
contents of those

are raped every year. Two women a week are killed  by a partner
or ex-partner. Sexual harassment in our schools, communities and
workplaces is routine. In Brighton and Hove, which is home to my

objects in some of our daily newspapers for many years, despite the
United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against

discrimination against women and girls.</hs_Para>

“tragic” one-off incidents, rather than as part of a well
understood pattern of behaviour; how rape cases in some papers are
routinely placed next to pictures of half-naked women; how cases of
forced marriage or “honour”-based violence are explained
in terms of culture or religion, or almost anything except violence
against women and girls; how news reporting upholds myths about sexual

committed against them, or eroticising such violence; how images and

choose to buy the publication or if they should come across it
unawares. The groups recommend that sexual material, such as images of
nudity and/or language of a strong sexual nature that are not justified
by the context, is not printed in newspapers or magazines that are not
age-restricted. Those principles already exist for broadcast media, and

Government’s international obligations on equality. People with
expertise in equality should be an integral and permanent part of
drawing up and overseeing implementation of the code. That would help
to deliver media that better reflect their audience. Half of us are
women, yet there is still a notable absence of women presenters and
journalists. It is the case that 72% of “Question Time”

that are sexually explicit or objectifying, reporting that trivialises
violence against women and girls, or accumulated imagery that restricts
the diversity of representation of women. The Government fully

is also worth reminding the House that the media play an invaluable
role in our cultural and democratic life. The Government are utterly
committed to supporting a vibrant and diverse media industry. The press
has a crucial role to play in our society: shining a light in dark
places, holding the powerful to account and supporting vibrant local
and regional communities. Freedom of expression is a vital part of our
society. As well as maintaining that freedom, we as a Government are
committed to maintaining media that command the respect of the public
through high standards and are 
<?notus-xml column=101?>capable of appropriately protecting the rights of individuals.
While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T11:23:06"></hs_TimeCode> on the one
hand we must promote vibrant, diverse and free media, we must also
maintain and protect the rights of ordinary people.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T11:23:02"></hs_TimeCode> focus of
Government regulation has therefore always been on supporting those

hon. Lady spent some time on press regulation in her speech. It is
important to point out that newspapers are, of course, already bound by
the law of the land, including the Obscene Publications Acts and the
Indecent Displays Act 1989. The Press Distribution Forum has published
guidance on the display of adult material. The majority of newspapers
already sign up to the editors’ code of practice,

the hon. Lady pointed out, the Leveson  inquiry considered the
issues in detail. Although the Leveson report concluded that the
editors’ code of practice is generally recognised to be sound,
its central recommendations were about how the code could be more
effectively enforced. Although it sets out a range of requirements
around the treatment of individuals who become the subject of the news,
it does not veer into the regulation of press content. That is because
content regulation is not something that we have applied to the press
in this country, and on the whole, Leveson was clear that the
distinction should continue. Leveson recommended a reformed system of
self-regulation, including independence of appointments and funding, an
arbitration service, a fast complaints-handling mechanism, and the
power to demand apologies and levy fines. He urged the press industry
to work towards establishing a new, independent self-regulator to
address those issues and suggested that press self-regulation should be
independently verified through a process of
recognition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061245000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061245000115">As

Government have considered the recommendation, and it is now reflected

considered it appropriate to apply a threshold to the consideration of
group complaints by the regulator, to ensure that the future regulator
was not inundated with complaints whose motive was to forward the
campaigning agenda of a group or organisation, and to make sure that
complaints did not impact on the freedom of the press to express an
opinion, which is a very important principle. To summarise: the
underlying principle of press regulation has always been that provided
something remains within the law and so long as it does not
inappropriately interfere with the rights of individuals, it is for
adults to choose for themselves what they want to read. The Government

want to discuss the limitations set by the Financial Services
Authority, now called the Financial Conduct Authority or the FCA, in
respect of its June 2012 review of the mis-selling of financial
products to companies by UK banks in 2005 and 2006, which I shall refer
to hereafter as “the FSA review”.</hs_Para>

guilty of such practices. The fund was set up to provide recompense to
small and medium-sized enterprises—SMEs—that were
mis-sold certain financial instruments. I seek the Government’s
support in challenging the FCA’s definition of an SME as
contained in the limitations of the FCA review, so that all businesses
and not just the smaller ones may be permitted support and assistance
from the FCA in claiming compensation for being mis-sold financial
products<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:01:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000007">I
also wish to challenge the limitation placed on the types of financial
products that were part of the FSA review. In 2007, the FSA implemented
new conduct of business rules, which derived from the EU’s 2007
markets in financial instruments directive. Under those rules,
customers are afforded different levels of protection according to the
category into which they fit.</hs_Para>

categories are retail, which includes private individuals and smaller
businesses not regulated by the FSA; professional, which includes
larger firms, some of which are regulated by the FSA; and eligible
counterparties, which includes financial institutions such as
investment banks and
stockbrokers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000009">Before
2007, the boundaries between retail and professional customers were
significantly lower than they are now. Today, as a direct result of the
2007 rule changes, the banks are prohibited from selling many products
they used to sell to their customers. Recognising, however, that we had
insufficient legislation and protection for our businesses against the
banks’ mis-selling of financial products back in 2005-06, I
question why the FSA review protected only some and not all of those
affected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000010">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:02:39"></hs_TimeCode>
suggest that both the limitations set by the FSA fly in the face of
logic and reason and wrongly exclude a number of organisations from
deserved recompense. I therefore ask the Minister to require that the
FCA increase the scope of the compensation fund. We should afford
protection to all affected companies, regardless of their size and of
which financial products they were mis-sold. Quite simply, if they were
mis-sold anything, they should be entitled to the protection of the FSA
review, and compensated accordingly by the
FCA.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000011">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:03:19"></hs_TimeCode>

For my particular constituent, whose case I will cover in detail, the
effects of the banks’ negligent malpractices were
unquantifiable. It is almost impossible to predict how the company
might have grown, how many more people it might have employed and how
its development might have impacted on the local economy of
Herefordshire had it not lost in excess of £2.25 million over
just a few months, which it spent five years paying off. Because it had
more than 50 employees at the relevant time and was doing well in
turnover during the relevant period, it did not get access to the
justice to which others were entitled from the compensation
fund.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000026">Despite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:11:00"></hs_TimeCode>

allpay Ltd. Entrepreneur-led and owned, the company rapidly evolved
from a groundbreaking idea in the 1990s—the owner re-mortgaged
his house to get the business off the ground—and has now become
one of Herefordshire’s biggest success stories. It was the first
company to use magnetic swipe cards to collect payments for
Departments, local authorities and registered social landlords cheaply,
efficiently and safely. It now offers several bill payment solutions,
and processes nearly £5 billion of central and local
authority and RSL payments every year. The business deserves
recognition and reward for its services to the public sector, its
innovation and its creation of hundreds of jobs in the most rural

2005-06, allpay was the victim of mis-selling by its bank, HSBC.
Originally, allpay asked HSBC to advise it on the very type of product
that was covered by the FSA review, but it was ultimately mis-sold
something significantly more complex: three multi-callable range
accrual interest rate swaps—products that, although speculative
in nature, were sold as hedging by the bank.

company had banked with HSBC for many years and felt that it could
trust the bank to recognise its needs and understand which products
were suitable. It was required to sign HSBC’s private customer
terms and conditions, which confirmed that it did not rely on advice

customer. The word “sophisticated” was not

is no evidence that allpay was made aware of the risks, yet HSBC
continued to present more complex products for sale. The beauty of the
bank’s sales pitch was to offer differing products—some
suitable, but with a price attached, and some unsuitable, with a slight
additional return and a purchase price of zero. The bank relied on an
unsophisticated customer not to spot the unlimited risk associated with
the free products should there be an adverse rate movement.</hs_Para>

terms of the agreement, allpay initially received from HSBC the
difference between the interest rate that was first set and LIBOR on a
notional sum, provided that LIBOR remained below 5.5%. We are all aware
of the LIBOR manipulation scandal, and it is impossible to suggest that
my constituent’s company was not one of its indirect
victims.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000033">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:14:34"></hs_TimeCode>
agreement was for five years. HSBC, not allpay, had an option to
terminate the agreements at the end of each quarter; allpay had no
documented exit route. It did not realise that at the time, because in
no way was it ever a sophisticated investor with any degree of
sophisticated financial knowledge about its entering into something
akin to betting on a horse—in essence, gambling on LIBOR rates
staying at a certain level. At the time, my constituent’s
company entirely misunderstood the risks. 
<?notus-xml column=108?>Furthermore, even when it explicitly asked HSBC, allpay never received
an explanation about the level of compensation that the company would

go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:15:14"></hs_TimeCode> back to the
FSA’s investigation of bank behaviour, there were several
findings. It found poor disclosure of exit costs, and my constituent
told me that allpay had no contractual right to exit and that no exit
costs were stated. It found that there was a failure to ascertain
customers’ understanding of risk, and I know that HSBC failed to
explain the risks to allpay. It found that non-advised sales strayed
into advice, and allpay told me that it asked for advice on hedging
products but was ultimately sold something more risky. It found that
rewards and incentives were a driver of such practices, and in this
case the rewards for the employees who carried out the sale were
significant. Therefore, despite ticking all the boxes looked into by
the FSA review, my constituent still has no form of
redress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000035">Ultimately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:16:02"></hs_TimeCode>,
the horse did not win: my constituent’s company lost more than
£2.25 million and overnight, with a change in the LIBOR rate,
found itself haemorrhaging almost £5,000 a
day—£35,000 a week or £455,000 a quarter—in
interest. That was completely unsustainable, and would be for most
businesses for any period. Worse still, those figures were the least
amounts payable: if interest rates moved further from the agreed price,
they could easily double, treble or
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000036">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:16:37"></hs_TimeCode>
constituent’s company was left in a very difficult
position—completely over a barrel—facing certain
insolvency and the probable loss of hundreds of jobs. The managing
director attempted everything that he could: he threatened, begged,
cajoled and applied to exit out of an agreement that had no exit
clause. It cost the company dearly, not just in the interest payments
made, but in additional costs of £1.5 million to cover the
bank’s lost income. Ironically, HSBC provided the loan for the
exit payment that it agreed to
take.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000037">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:17:14"></hs_TimeCode>
constituent’s company was advised to sue the bank for
negligence, but by that time it did not have the resources to take on
HSBC in expensive and lengthy High Court litigation. It asked the FSA
to consider allpay in its review, but the request was refused due to
its size at the relevant time and the type of product it was
mis-sold.</hs_Para>

to its correspondence only when I stepped in to offer my support.
HSBC’s in-house lawyer finally engaged with my
constituent’s company and entered into some dialogue, eventually
inviting my constituent from Hereford to its offices in Canary Wharf on
a “without prejudice” basis to discuss a settlement. The
meeting was a waste of time: it lasted no more than 30 minutes, and it
appears that HSBC dragged my constituent to London essentially to be
told to get lost. The bank made it clear that it will discuss the
matter further only if it is compelled to do so by the FCA, and if the
case is brought within the
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000039">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:18:19"></hs_TimeCode>

mis-sold a fixed-rate tailored business loan and was excluded from the

did not take into account the categories into which companies fitted
and what definition they met, nor the fact that companies, through no
fault of their own but entirely due to a banking institution, were
mis-sold a financial product and suffered significant financial loss.
There is no logical explanation for the exclusion from redress of

mis-sold.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000041">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:19:48"></hs_TimeCode>

doubled to £2 billion, but the banks might just learn
a lesson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:19:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope

was sold a hedging product but is not eligible for the FCA review. I am
sure that my hon. Friend will understand if I do not go into the

want to take this opportunity to address the key points that my hon.
Friend has raised. First, he challenged the definition of an SME as
used by the FCA in its review. He has argued instead that all
businesses, not just the smaller ones, should be given support and
assistance from the FCA in claiming
compensation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:21:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000046">The
FCA used the criteria for non-sophisticated customers, as set out in
the UK Companies Act 2006, in its objective test. That is because those
criteria are used for classifying companies that are subject to the
small companies regime, and that have lighter reporting requirements.
They are therefore the companies that are 
<?notus-xml column=110?>less likely to have staff or advisers with appropriate knowledge and
skills to advise directors on the purchasing of financial
instruments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:22:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000047">Moreover,
I understand that the FCA review also changed the sophistication test
in January to ensure that certain customers who were classified as
sophisticated under the Companies Act test are instead classified as
non-sophisticated and therefore brought into the scope of the review. I
am sure that my hon. Friend will welcome that move, particularly as his
constituency in Herefordshire, like mine in Bromsgrove, has many
farmers. Had the change not happened, many farmers who typically have
larger work forces and balance sheets than other SMEs could have been
excluded<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:23:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0001.htm#13061259000048">The
Government have been clear that where a business lacks the necessary
skills and knowledge to understand fully the risks of such products, it
should receive the appropriate redress. However, we do not agree that
all businesses should have access to the FCA review. Instead, there
needs to be a defined cut-off point where more sophisticated businesses
are able to take responsibility for understanding the products or
services they are entering into. There will be organisations that took
one of these product with a full understanding of the risks involved if
interest rates changed, and it is not for the Government to perform due
diligence for such large, sophisticated organisations. Any such action
would weaken incentives for businesses to act sensibly when purchasing
financial instruments, and would potentially open the
floodgates—a word my hon. Friend also used—to any
businesses that have lost out from a financial
transaction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:24:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I
am therefore confident that the FCA has found the right balance to

hon. Friend also mentioned the limitation placed on the type of
financial products that are part of the FCA review. Given the
widespread sale of the particular products included in the review to
small businesses, it is reasonable that the FCA has established the

full review of what products were sold to which businesses and by whom,

across the board, and not just for specific groups of companies? It
strikes me that it does not matter how many employees a company has or
how big its balance sheet is, it should be behaving responsibly. In the
case of larger companies, more jobs are put at risk if financial
mis-selling takes place, and we rely on the FCA to be a regulator. I

situation? If a company has gone into administration because of the
mis-selling of an interest rate hedging product, it is by definition
excluded. If it is in administration, only the insolvency practitioner
can represent the interests of that company, but the insolvency
practitioner is often appointed by the bank and is extremely loath to

I turn to the investigation that is currently being conducted by SO15

Algiers and In Amenas, the officer was accompanied by a BP

was prevented from gaining access to the In Amenas site not once but
twice, despite the British Prime Minister having sought assurances on
access from the Algerian Prime Minister. Even the media were 
<?notus-xml column=115?>allowed access. SO15 was not allowed access, but the media were. On the

can the families have confidence that that investigation will offer any
real answers when the crime scene has been compromised and vital
forensic information from the site and the bodies have been lost? Why
does there appear to be little or no co-operation from the Algerian
authorities on allowing British investigators access to the site? Can
the Minister explain the efficacy of BP’s involvement with the
investigating team given that BP has not conducted its own
investigation, unlike its partner Statoil? Is it not appropriate that,
rather than joining the investigation, BP be considered as a body to be
investigated? Will the Minister comment on the appropriateness of the
investigating officers speaking at conferences on the situation when

I respond to her points, I put on record that my thoughts and

atrocity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0002.htm#13061259000088">No
one will forget the horror of those days in January, when six British

The hon. Lady is absolutely right: no words, however well meaning and
however often they are repeated, can relieve the suffering of the loved

hon. Lady raised very serious, significant, substantive and important
issues, and I will try to address them in my remarks. I hope she and
other hon. Members will be patient. What happened at In Amenas was
abhorrent, and it was the terrorists who were responsible for the
tragic deaths of so many. We know that the terrorist threat in the
Sahel comes from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which aspires to
introduce Islamic law across the Sahel and north Africa and to attack
western interests 
<?notus-xml column=116?>wherever it can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:59:21"></hs_TimeCode>.
The hon. Lady is right to say that we should not assume a
straightforward link to events in Mali given the complexity of the
attack, but we do not know now, and we may never know, what motivated
the individuals at In Amenas. What we do know is that their
actions—the cold-blooded murder of innocent workers—can
never be justified. That is why the world stood united in its
condemnation, and why the actions of the extremists have only confirmed
our implacable opposition to terrorism and our resolve to fight it
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

well in the destabilisation of the Malian force, were trying to help
Colonel Gaddafi before his regime in Libya fell. Many of them are not
from Algeria but from neighbouring countries in the Sahel. Does he

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:00:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman is partially right, in that the perpetrators of that
terrorist atrocity were not all from inside Algeria, but he will also
be aware that the borders in that part of Africa are extremely porous.

for West Lancashire about the safety of the British nationals involved,
the repatriation of those killed and the evacuation of the wounded and
freed hostages was the top priority of the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, and of the international community as it related to people of
other nationalities. Staff in London and Algiers worked around the
clock to support the Algerians in resolving the crisis, and our embassy
in Algeria was strengthened by 18 consular experts, six experts from
the Red Cross and specialists from the Metropolitan police. We gave
direct assistance to the British nationals involved in Algeria, and our
ambassador was the first to reach In Amenas. Our response involved
playing a leading role among the countries affected, including sharing
information with them and supporting in the identification of victims.
We have continued to take a lead since then, for instance by
co-ordinating work on the return of
possessions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0002.htm#13061259000094">As
hon. Members will remember, In Amenas is two days’ drive from
Algiers; it is in the middle of the Sahara desert and is one of the
most remote places in the world. Information was therefore difficult to
come by, not least since we were not informed in advance of Algerian
operations. None the less, I understand and regret that the
unpredictable nature of events and a lack of detail caused distress for
those waiting for
news.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0002.htm#13061259000095">The
attack was on a significant scale. From the outset, the Prime Minister
led the United Kingdom response, chairing Cobra on a number of
occasions.  He continued to do so in the month after the
attack, 
<?notus-xml column=117?>making a ground-breaking visit to Algeria, closely followed by the
Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon.

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:03:41"></hs_TimeCode>immediately

accept that we may not always get contact right in crises where
information is limited. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office always
seeks to learn from such incidents, and my hon. Friend the Member for
North East Bedfordshire will be doing so. He has discussed the police

future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0002.htm#13061259000098">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for West Lancashire specifically made the point that what
happened was unclear. It is still unclear. Some of the details are
still not known. I know how hard that must be for the families, but it
would not be appropriate for me to comment on behalf of the Algerian
authorities or BP. Instead, we very much hope that the investigation,
on which the Algerian authorities are leading, and the coroner’s
inquest in the UK, will answer some of the hon. Lady’s
questions, and those of her constituents and others.</hs_Para>

to discuss the detail of the In Amenas attack with the Algerian
authorities at every available opportunity, including at ministerial
level, as we did when the Prime Minister and the Minister for the
middle east visited in the weeks following the attack. We will support
their investigations in any way that we can. We continue to seek
assurances from the Algerian authorities that they will share details
and access to the site in the aftermath of the attack. None the less,
it must be said that Algeria is a sovereign country and, just as we
would expect to do here, the Algerians must be allowed to conduct their
investigations in accordance with their own
laws.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0002.htm#13061259000100">The
coroner’s investigation will take place early in 2014. The
Government are supporting that process. A small team of Metropolitan
Police Service officers travelled to Algeria on 18 January to lead on
the identification and repatriation of those who died, and they
continue to gather information. They last travelled to Algeria in May.
Her Majesty’s coroner for West Sussex will hold a preliminary
hearing on 1 July, which will set out the scope of her
investigation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061259000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/halltext/130612h0002.htm#13061259000101">It
is important to understand that this is a complex inquiry into deaths
that occurred at a site staffed by multinational personnel. Nationals
from nine other countries lost their lives, and individuals from a
total of 29 countries were involved, so much of the information that
might assist the coroner is not automatically available in the UK. The
police are therefore liaising with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
the Algerian authorities 
<?notus-xml column=118?>and other international authorities and partners to progress enquiries
and get that information on the coroner’s behalf. Regrettably,
that will take time, but I am sure that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:07:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

Foreign and Commonwealth Office closely monitors and keeps under

had any specific information relating directly to In Amenas, it would
have been passed to the company immediately. Protecting our citizens is
a priority. We try to establish

this consultation, the Government today publish their response. The
vast majority of the responses to the consultation were in favour,

The Government will therefore introduce legislation in the autumn to
increase the interest rate that credit unions can charge from 2% to 3%
per calendar
month.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13061246000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/wmstext/130612m0001.htm#13061246000021">Allowing
the maximum rate of interest to increase will enable credit unions to
become more stable over the long term, and reduce the losses that they
currently make on small, short-term loans. This means that low-income
consumers will have greater access to reliable, affordable credit. Even
with a 1% increase in the monthly rate of interest, credit union loans
will still be substantially cheaper than the alternatives for many
consumers with no mainstream options. It is important to note that this
increase in the interest rate is permissive; it does not require credit
unions to increase the interest rate they charge but simply permits
them to do so if they judge that the benefits outweigh the
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13061246000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/wmstext/130612m0001.htm#13061246000022">Many
credit unions are strongly embedded in their local communities and are
committed to assisting those on low incomes. Research shows that credit
unions often appeal to low-income consumers as bodies which are local,
accessible and convenient, and which are community-based. Giving credit
unions more flexibility in their lending will enable them to recruit
new members, and further establish their role in helping the
financially
excluded.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13061246000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/wmstext/130612m0001.htm#13061246000023">I

pedestrian casualties have fallen considerably and are now at their

fatalities, down 42% on the 2005-09 average and 1,569 serious injuries,
down 15%. However, we know that one death is one too many, which is why

communicate road safety messages to a greater extent in PSHE lessons,
assemblies, tutor times and the wider curriculum by enhancing the
quality of resources provided to schools. We are making these
resources, which include lesson plans, posters and booklets, easier to
access and use in the classroom and are making them available to other

Business Strategy in 2006 following the Review of Links with Large

by HMRC is the most efficient way of ensuring that these high-value,
high-risk and complex taxpayers pay the tax that is due. Since 2006,
HMRC's approach has increasingly been adopted by other countries and
its benefits have been recognised by the international Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development. This has enabled HMRC to recover
£34 billion additional compliance revenue between 2006 and March

Green</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 13 May 2013]:</I> A committed
partnership approach is key to reducing football violence and disorder.
The Home Office works with police, the football authorities, other
Government Departments and fans' groups to ensure there are appropriate
legislative tools available to minimise the threat of disorder, to plan
for safe and secure matches, and to encourage self-policing by
supporters. I chaired a meeting with police, football authorities and
safety authorities on 1 May to ensure the continuing commitment of all
responsible agencies to working together to reduce violence and
disorder at football
matches.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061286000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/text/130612w0001.htm#13061286000161">The
large majority of football supporters are law abiding individuals.
Although levels of football disorder have been significantly reduced
and orchestrated football violence marginalised over the last decade,
the risk of spontaneous alcohol-fuelled incidents, especially at
high-risk 
<?notus-xml column=332?>and high-tension matches remains. A range of football-specific
legislation complements public order legislation which enables police
to respond to incidents of violence and disorder. Police football
intelligence officers share information with one another, clubs and
other authorities involved in the security and safety planning, to
minimise the risk of violence or
disorder.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061286000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/text/130612w0001.htm#13061286000162">Football
banning orders are the highly effective cornerstone of our preventative
strategy, prohibiting those subject to an order from attending matches
for between three and 10 years and addressing the individual offenders'
behaviour with additional conditions if necessary. There are currently
2,426 individuals subject to orders imposed in England and Wales.
Football intelligence officers know their local individuals subject to
a banning order, and take enforcement action against anyone in breach
of the conditions of their order. To prevent the spread of
football-related violence outside the United Kingdom, the Football
Banning Orders Authority requires banned individuals surrender their
passport to nominated police stations before relevant overseas
international and club matches. The Home Office continues to make
funding available to support local police operations gathering evidence
and seeking football banning orders against persons who have been
involved in football-related violence or disorder
matches.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13061286000023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130612/text/130612w0001.htm#13061286000023">Human

aware of the benefits of sharing spectrum as a most effective way to
ensure efficient use of spectrum. Careful consideration is given to
whether the spectrum should be released for new use or for sharing as

teachers leave a school. They can be used by maintained schools as well
as in cases where schools become academies. These agreements are
voluntary and neither employer nor employees have to enter into them.
While compromise agreements usually include a confidentiality clause,
they cannot be used to suppress information such as that relating to
pupil safety or to prevent someone from making a protected disclosure
under whistleblowing arrangements. This position is made clear in the
Employment Rights Act 1996.</hs_Para>

significant reductions in HFC use. A phase-down would allow flexibility
for end users to take account of factors such as indirect emissions
from energy use when deciding what type of alternative to use. Users

and are accountable for their own processes, conduct and decisions.
They are also responsible for ensuring that their data management
standards comply with Government and EU guidance. SNCBs' quality
assurance of their evidence and advice is provided primarily by
specialist staff, often working in partnership with external experts or
bodies. Overview of the quality of the evidence, and the way it is
used, is the responsibility of their executive directors, supported by
senior staff and external non-executive groups. For Natural England,
responsibility lies with the Executive Director of Science and

those contained in the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders
Act 2012. Additionally, the forecast assumes that, apart from policy
changes factored into the projections, fees remain fixed at current
