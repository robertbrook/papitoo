appalling. A lot of hope is being pinned on the possibility of change
in Iran. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said yesterday,
it is rather too early to tell, but it has been reported that the new
President talked at yesterday’s press conference about a more
inclusive constitution. I am sure that we will wait to see what

that I received on 14 May is that it was signed by a collection of
leaders from virtually all the faiths represented in the United

can speak to spiritual leaders. I have no doubt at all that those in
the United Kingdom continue to urge religious tolerance throughout the

Geneva brings together sufficient groups and powers to agree a
sustainable settlement of the conflict in Syria, but it is also
important to have the ability to start from common ground. That is what
was agreed at Geneva last year—that a transitional Government
should be created, with full Executive powers, formed from regime and
opposition by mutual consent. We have seen no evidence that Iran agrees
with that agreement, which we made with Russia and others. In the
absence of such agreement, it is hard to believe that Iran would play a

the International Atomic Energy Agency’s transparency
requirements, some of which I mentioned in detail when answering the
urgent question in the House yesterday. That includes
addressing the issue of the heavy water reactor at Arak and meeting the
requirements for information across a wide range of matters that the
IAEA has set out. The other thing is to respond constructively to the
offer from the E3 plus 3 that has been on the table since February, and
which would allow us to make a very significant start to defusing the
tensions over the nuclear issue and resolving it. The new

1% of the World Service budget, having not passed on any of the
reductions in departmental budgets for the past two years. That is much
smaller than spending reductions across the rest of the public sector
in the UK, and I believe that a well-run organisation can take a 0.75%
change in its budget. Of course by transferring the funding of the
World Service to the licence fee in future, we will remove this problem

Following the Foreign Secretary’s reply to my question earlier
on British arms to Syria, may I seek your advice on how what is clearly
a cross-party concern to have a vote on a substantive motion in the
House prior to any action being authorised can be facilitated,
certainly before the recess, which is barely a month away? Would it not
be a disappointment if the House had to be brought back from the
recess? Could an Opposition motion be tabled which could get
cross-party support, including among the leading signatories, and be
debated in Opposition time? Would that be in
order?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0001.htm#13061895000192"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13061895001519" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0001.htm#13061895001519">Mr
Speaker:</Member></B> There are a number of parliamentary opportunities
potentially open to the right hon. Gentleman and others. First, there
is the vehicle of the debates that take place under the auspices of the
Backbench Business Committee. That would be one opportunity. Secondly,
it is open to the Opposition to use an Opposition day and to proceed
with the matter in that way, either with an exclusively
Opposition-signed motion or a motion signed more widely. I must say I
have the sense that the Government are hinting that they would not
dream of executing a policy decision of the kind that is being
considered without first seeking a debate in the House and a vote on a
substantive motion. That would obviously be the democratic course. I
think it is the democratic course on a substantive motion that the
Government have in mind. I am not sure that there was any other idea
ever in their mind, but I feel sure that if it was in their mind, it

damaging direct subsidies that do not offer good value for money or
deliver the public goods we want. The UK has worked extremely hard to
engage with like-minded member states throughout the ongoing
negotiations to ensure that the CAP continues on the path of reform,
but we know that other member states and elements in the European
Parliament are determined to turn the clock back and reverse some of

will touch on a few of the priority areas that will be the focus of our
negotiating efforts over the next week. First, market intervention
remains a prime concern. As we all know, the CAP has made great
progress over the years in reducing reliance on expensive and
trade-distorting measures that interfere with the market and helped to
create the butter mountains and wine lakes of the past. I was therefore
very disappointed when in March the European Parliament voted through
amendments that would move EU agriculture away from market orientation.
Those proposals would increase budget pressures for old-style market
support. That is not an acceptable use of taxpayers’ money. It
hits consumers twice; they pay for their food once through their taxes
and again at the
tills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0001.htm#13061895000208">The
EU sugar regime,
for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T12:49:59"></hs_TimeCode> example,
constricts supply in the market and adds costs for British food and
drink producers and ultimately for the consumer. The combined effect of
EU beet quotas and high tariffs on cane imports means that the current
EU regime has driven up the wholesale price of sugar by 35% and added
1% to the food bills of hard-pressed families. Members
states had previously agreed to end the restrictive sugar beet
production quotas by 2015, but there has been incredible pressure to
unpick that agreement. In our compromise in March, we agreed a partial
extension of sugar beet quotas to 2017. I am disappointed that Members
of the European Parliament voted to extend the quotas further to 2020.
That is unacceptable. The situation is compounded by the lack of a
level playing field for sugar cane imports, something we are working to
change. We need to remain fully committed to moving the CAP in the
right direction towards greater market orientation. Nothing must be
left to chance. Butter mountains and wine lakes must remain a thing of
the

I want us to ensure that we can continue payments on some of the older
schemes, where we have accrued benefit, which I do not want us to lose.
I am absolutely clear that where we use the pillar two payments in the
most effective way, we will be doing so to enhance the position of
those who work the land and confer on it public goods. For instance,
one of my priorities will be to see what we can do in upland areas,
where people farm in less favourable conditions and where it might make

appreciate that it might be considered a simplistic one—is that
we target the funding better towards the places where it will
have the most effect. We have a highly efficient and
effective agriculture industry and we do not need to target funding at
all sectors. We need to ensure that it reaches the places where it will
have the greatest effect. As I have said, this is where we part company
with the National Farmers Union, which would like us to maintain the
maximum funding within pillar one. We believe, however, that pillar two
is the most effective vehicle for benefiting environmental interests,

lot will depend on the design of the schemes and on how we implement
them at national level. We have been pushing the argument in Europe
that, in relation to the devolved Administrations, we want as much
flexibility and local determination as possible in the design of
operation. We want to give Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales the
opportunity to use their own discretion on behalf of their
own farming businesses, as they will know the best way of

been arguing strongly for increased flexibility at national and
regional level for those countries that have devolved Administrations.
The obvious examples are the United Kingdom and Belgium, both of which
feel strongly about this matter. We need the option to define some of
the terms and regulations that will be put in place, so that they match
our forms of agriculture. There is already divergence within this
country over the application of the CAP. For example, there are still
historic payments in Scotland. In my personal view, there will
eventually be a need for internal convergence on that issue, but it is
for the Scots to decide on the rate

of the detailed contributions today will rightly be focused on farming

Minister, it is worth reiterating that Labour strongly believes that
farming goes hand-in-hand with sound, sustainable farming practices. In
addition to delivering food security and affordability, this CAP reform
should not shy away from its broader sustainability remit. Profitable
farm businesses are based on sustainable farming practices such as
protecting and enhancing soil quality and the water environment;
conserving special and priority species and habitats, landscape
features and archaeological sites; minimising the carbon footprint of
farming; promoting access to the countryside, high animal welfare
standards and links to the wider rural economy and communities, and
much more. That, by the way, is why pillar two and rural development
cannot be overlooked while we strive to ensure the productivity and
competitiveness of
farming.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0001.htm#13061895000272">Collectively<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T13:17:20"></hs_TimeCode>,

the consumer; to protect what we, visitors and tourists love
aesthetically in our landscape and countryside, which boosts the wider
rural economy; to conserve our habitats, wildlife and biodiversity; to
enhance the wider public goods in management of our ecosystem and
biodiversity; and, in all that, to adapt to the challenges of climate
change. On top of that, farmers have been asked to work with the
Government as the CAP moves towards a more market-oriented system, with
less reliance on payments for production and more transparent use of
public money for public
goods.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0001.htm#13061895000273">The

undoubtedly backwards steps towards more old-style market support? Will
he say whether the farming unions’ argument is correct that,
because of the differential application of the transfer of funds
between pillars one and two among nations, their members will
unavoidably be placed at a competitive disadvantage? If so, will the
Minister share with the House his analysis of how that is likely to
affect profitability and competitiveness in each sector, as well as UK

spring has had a huge impact on the

that backdrop of depressed farming incomes, and the implications for
food security, I would like to press the Minister on certain issues,
particularly the greening of the common agricultural policy. As a
number of hon. Members have said, UK farmers already green to a much
greater extent and at some cost to themselves. In particular, I draw
the attention of the Minister and the House to the position of tenant
farmers across this country—not just those in the uplands of
northern England—who seem to have a unique position in the
European Union. The Committee’s report “Farming in the
uplands” stated that the Committee is conscious that the
position of tenant farmers is unique to UK agriculture, and that the
impact of any reform on that group should not be overlooked by either
the Commission or DEFRA. We concluded that tenants—and indeed
commoners, many of whom I represent—might be disadvantaged in
accessing agri-environment schemes.</hs_Para>

concerns of tenant farmers about some other reform proposals are wider

that farmers might be disadvantaged by the proposed entitlement scheme,
that only those who made a valid claim on at least one hectare of land
in 2011 under the existing single payment scheme will be eligible for
direct payments under the new regime, and that some landlords may use
that to capitalise inappropriately on changes brought under existing
tenancies in order to bank land ahead of any new regime. On the other
side, the CLA has said that it is not aware of such things, but I hope
the Minister will keep the matter under review.</hs_Para>

farmers have also raised concerns about the active farmer proposals on
which the Minister might like to update the House. Wildlife trusts, and
others, have said that the proposals are potentially unworkable and
catastrophic for the management of the land. The costs of administering
some of the present schemes for tenant farmers are prohibitively high,
with lawyers being retained and up to 30% of the agreement used just to
administer the scheme. This debate is therefore a useful opportunity to
review the position of tenant farmers under the CAP.</hs_Para>

restore the balance between Scotland and England, particularly for the
border regions of Northumbria, Yorkshire and County Durham, which are
affected by the imbalance. Decoupled direct support plays a pivotal
role, but we should not put further pressure on farmers in England, and
there should be no further modulation. Any increase in voluntary

nature, but the proposals do not constitute the greening of the CAP as
a whole. Only 13% of the funding under pillar one goes to specific
greening measures. In many cases, good farmers are doing those things
anyway. The real objection is that money is being used for subsidies

must use all the levers at our disposal, including those in the EU, to

Only last weekend there were some suggestions that farmers in Northern
Ireland would be left at a financial disadvantage as a result of the
ongoing Government negotiations. I seek assurances from the Minister
that the business resilience and capacity of farms in Northern Ireland
will be protected in whatever outcomes emerge from the CAP. I have
spoken to the Minister’s opposite number in the Republic of
Ireland, who is heading up the negotiations, and he has said that
farming in Ireland, both north and south, is similar. We are looking
for similar outcomes.</hs_Para>

not apply for them back in 2005?</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Coventry South (Mr Cunningham), who is no longer in his

everybody that 25 years ago CAP expenditure amounted to 75% of EU
funding, whereas it now amounts to just over 40%. In that time, the
amount spent by the average UK family on food has decreased from 25% of
disposable income to about 15%, although sadly that trend is moving in
the opposite direction because of the increases in commodity prices.
Back in the 1980s, the CAP depended on market support and intervention
through export subsidies and import tariffs, which were really
trade-distorting implements and very unfair on developing countries.
Things moved on, however, and in 1993 the MacSharry proposals
introduced direct payments that were not so trade distorting, and in
2003, the Fischler proposals decoupled support, which was another step
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T13:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000329">Why
do we still need a CAP? It was first introduced to ensure that people
working in agriculture and the countryside had incomes comparable to
those in more urban and industrial occupations. Sadly, it has been
unsuccessful in doing that, and incomes in the countryside are still
less than in towns. Many farming businesses in this country would be

need resilience in our farming communities and businesses. As has been
pointed out, farming businesses across the country have experienced
poor conditions in the past two years. The Chairman of the Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs Committee pointed out that for two years now the
UK has been a net importer of cereals, whereas we used to be
a net exporter. We need resilience in our farming businesses,
therefore, if they are to survive from one difficult period to another
period in which they can rebuild their resources and capital. We will
experience great difficulties with food security over the coming years.
With the world population now reaching 7 billion and probably reaching
9 billion by 2050, the demand for food will increase, and it is thought
that northern Europe, particularly its maritime areas, might be well
placed after climate change to maintain its agricultural production. We
should be looking to the CAP to ensure that.</hs_Para>

ask the Minister to address a number of issues that have already been
raised. The first is co-financing of voluntary modulation. The UK
farming community is concerned about voluntary modulation, because it
would put it at a competitive disadvantage against other countries that
compete with us on food production. Co-financing, if possible, could
mitigate some of the problems perceived by British agriculture.
Secondly, the greening proposals should be as simple and easy to follow
as possible. The last thing we want are complex proposals leading to
penalties being applied to individual farmers or DEFRA. I was on the
EFRA Committee when the single farm payment was first introduced. The
Rural Payments Agency made a terrible mess of delivering those payments
and, as a result, a lot of DEFRA money had to be returned to the EU,
rather than being spent on supporting our agricultural sector, so
simplicity is important.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T13:55:13"></hs_TimeCode>Some large-scale
arable and horticultural businesses would be willing to forgo the
greening element—30% of the single farm

businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T13:55:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000334"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13061895001586" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895001586">Several

this debate will have to be curtailed. The key principles set out in
2011 were high sounding and were certainly things that we would
support—for instance, better targeted income support, greening
measures, support for young farmers, measures to stimulate the rural
economy and simpler, more efficient CAP funding. We certainly want to
see those things, but it is the transition that worries me most.
Because of how we did things in Wales under the last set of
changes—we kept a stronger historical element than in
England—we have a bigger change to make. I pay tribute to Alun
Davies, the Welsh Government Minister, who has had a considerable
conversation with farmers in Wales. The Welsh Government have stated
that they would like a much longer transition period—ideally 10
years rather than five, but if that is 
<?notus-xml column=783?>not possible, at least seven—to ensure that farmers do not go out
of business because of sudden, cliff-edge changes.</hs_Para>

important, because when a farmer goes out of business, it is not just a
catastrophe for that farmer and his or her family and a change in their
way of life; it also has a detrimental effect on the rural economy,
food production and our food security. Moreover, it is incredibly
difficult to re-start. We all know from when we have talked about
things such as foot and mouth how difficult it is to re-stock, but to
re-start altogether—to go into farming, build up expertise again
and build up generations of breeding to get the best animals
possible—is extremely difficult these days and takes a long
time, so we do not want a sudden, mass exodus. We want a cushioned
transition to ensure that we do not have casualties.</hs_Para>

Union of Wales is absolutely right to say that the current
Euroscepticism is extremely worrying. Just as we do not want to see
farmers thrown out of business because of an ill-thought-out
transition, we do not want them to have trouble when they go to the
bank, under the shadow of our possible departure from the EU and a
sudden drop in their income. We do not want farmers to have to fight
for funds to invest in our food production. We do not want them
suddenly finding themselves unable to encourage their sons and
daughters into farming because no one can see a future in it or because
they are so worried about the changes in income that might ensue if we
pulled out of the EU. I therefore hope that Government Members will be
able to influence some of their colleagues who are making these
unhelpful noises and will ensure that Britain is at the heart of the
negotiations in Europe so that we get a good deal for Britain, a smooth
transition and the best possible help for our farmers in

Hopkins</B> (Luton North) (Lab):</Member> I wrote my first paper on the
CAP some 33 years ago. I suggested at that time that either it should
be abolished or Britain should withdraw from it. I have not changed my
view, even though the CAP is very different from how it was then,
although it is still essentially ill designed and inefficient, and a
bit of a bureaucratic monster. I was supported at that time by the
Consumers Association. Having a purely urban constituency, I
represent consumers rather than farmers, although I absolutely support
farmers, too.</hs_Para>

is very different in all the member states, and in some cases the
difference is quite extreme. It would be better if member states
managed their own agriculture and did not rely on a supranational
regime imposed by the EU. It would be better for those countries and
everyone else if that happened. If we must have transfers between
member states, we should run the scheme as a fiscal transfer, so that
the rich pay in and the poor draw out, but not try to manipulate
agriculture in the way that happens at the moment.</hs_Para>

agree. Some of these points do not necessarily apply to the whole of
the CAP, but they seem to fit in with the case for returning
agriculture to member states. Much of 
<?notus-xml column=784?>what we have heard in today’s debate seems implicitly, if not
explicitly, to support that case as well. Each member state ought to
decide what it produces, how much of each product it should produce,
whether subsidies are appropriate, what should be subsidised and,
indeed, what that member state should import. Those things should be
left to those countries.</hs_Para>

we very wisely intensified our agriculture as a result of being an
island and being threatened in the second world war. We developed an
efficient agriculture sector that is still with us today, even though

had the pleasure of visiting Lithuania with other members of the
European Scrutiny Committee. I found to my surprise that 30% of
Lithuania’s agricultural land is not being used for production.
That was not the case before Lithuania joined the EU and the CAP.
Strangely, for a small country that used to be mainly an agricultural
nation, Lithuania has now become a net importer of food, which is all
due to the distorting effects, apparently, of the CAP. Even in the
poorer countries, things are not going well under the CAP regime.
Surely Lithuania would be able to produce agricultural products very
cheaply and sell to countries that want to import them, but it is not
doing that and is now a net importer of food, which is
nonsense.</hs_Para>

redistribute wealth and income between European nations—there is
a case for doing that—it should be above board and done by means
of fiscal transfers. A key factor of any renegotiation of our

did an admirable job of setting out the structural flaws of the CAP,
but he was a bit less forthcoming in presenting an alternative to it
for the 60% of farmers who would not have a viable farm business were
it not for the support they receive from the CAP. It is important to
remember that the CAP is not only about market support; it is also
about land stewardship, food security and sustaining resilient rural
communities. I think we are all agreed that the CAP is a profoundly
flawed system, but we have to be pragmatic about where we are in the
negotiations and how we defend our rural communities and get the best
possible deal for our farmers.</hs_Para>

rattle through some of the issues in what is a short time frame, but I
will be unable to say everything that I had hoped to say. I am pleased
that there will be more flexibility for greening measures. I also think
that the proposed definition of “eligible pasture”, which
would include non-herbaceous grazing—in other words,
heather—will be of significant benefit to 
<?notus-xml column=785?>upland farmers. However, I would still like more flexibility, so that

welcome step is the definition of an “active farmer”,
which should help to tackle the long-standing problem of
“slipper farmers”, whereby some people have received
large sums of public money with little accountability or public
benefit. I hope that will also form part of the final agreement. The
flip side of the “slipper farmer” problem is that not
nearly enough support was given to new entrants in the previous CAP. It
is important that new entrants have a level playing field in
entitlements with established farmers. Under the proposals, they should
be eligible for an initial grant of entitlements in the first year of
the new scheme, so long as they can show that they have been actively
farming. New entrants should also be able to receive support from the
national reserve.</hs_Para>

the proposed cap on basic payments to individuals has been
controversial in some quarters, but I personally think it is a
progressive measure. A small number of large farm businesses receive
levels of direct payments that are totally unjustifiable. We have to be
transparent and accountable in how we use public money. It is only
right that the redistributed surplus should be made available for more
beneficial forms of rural development. I am pleased that the Commission
proposes to increase CAP transparency by publishing the details of CAP
beneficiaries and the money they have
received.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000360" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000360">Another
controversial issue has been the use of coupled support, which I wanted
to say more about. I know that progress has been made, particularly on
the different views that exist across the UK about what is needed in
certain circumstances. All I would say is that the beef sector is
critical to the economy of north-east Scotland. It anchors hundreds of
jobs in the rural economy and gives a welcome boost to exports, which
is important. I have raised the issue of the compliance regime many
times with Ministers over the last couple of years. I am glad that
there is a more proportionate set of proposals on the table, which
means that farmers will not be penalised for small oversights or
administrative errors.</hs_Para>

big issue is the overall budget. In the context of austerity, we all
understand that the overall pot is smaller, but the UK has negotiated
itself the lowest share of the CAP budget of any EU member state. On
average, member states get €72 a hectare, whereas the figure for
the UK has fallen to €20. I do not think farmers want to be
subsidised, but they do want to be on a level playing field and they
want to be recompensed for their efforts to comply with European
regulation.</hs_Para>

went into the CAP reform negotiations with a very strong case for a
bigger share of the CAP budget for Scotland, but that is not what has
come out. Compared with farmers in neighbouring countries—and,
indeed, farmers in other countries and parts of the UK—Scottish
farmers continue to get a very raw deal, even though many are
stewarding land in environmentally responsible ways, providing a basis
for a much bigger 
<?notus-xml column=786?>food and drink export industry. I do not think it is right for farmers
in Scotland to get significantly lower payments than their counterparts
in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Nor do I think it right that
those farming comparable land in Ireland receive €70 a hectare,
in Finland €158 a hectare and in the Czech Republic €83 a
hectare.</hs_Para>

fairness in the system, and we just do not have it. Under pillar one,
Scotland’s rate is so low that it means that the whole UK
external convergence mechanism will benefit the UK by about €60
million. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that can come to
Scotland. I hope that while we have a CAP system, we will continue to
fight for the best deal for our farmers. I hope that Ministers will do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13061895001345" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895001345">2.10

‘Interparliamentary co-operation as such does not, however,
ensure democratic legitimacy for EU decisions. That requires a
parliamentary assembly representatively composed in which votes can be

accompanied with a commensurate involvement of the European Parliament
in the integrated frameworks for a genuine EMU’; further notes
that the proposals for the Financial Transaction Tax have been

that recent European Treaties and protocols have emphasised the role of

would have affected the entire financial system, reducing returns to
pension funds and savers, increasing companies’ and
Governments’ financing costs and reducing European
competitiveness at a time when the EU, frankly, needed competitiveness
and growth. It might have been conceived as a way of raising revenue

measure—certainly not at a time when the EU was trying to grow
and attract business. He said the UK would have no part in it, and
partly as a result, the proposal was dropped. Sadly, however, it was
not dead, and this January, under a procedure known as “enhanced
co-operation”, 11 member states chose to resurrect it. We
believe that member states should be free to set their own tax
policies, and if they choose to co-ordinate their tax policies, that,
too, is their right. Although we believed and continue to believe that
the proposed FTT is a bad idea, it is of course open to member states

proposal under the enhanced co-operation procedure is substantially
modelled on the 2011 version. It contains a feature known as the
“establishment rule”, under which a UK financial
institution would be deemed to be established in the FTT area for the
purpose of the tax by virtue of the mere fact that its trading
counterparty is headquartered in a country participating in the tax. So
in practice, a UK pension fund purchasing a UK Government bond from a
UK branch of a German bank would be obliged to pay the tax, and it
would pay the tax not to the Exchequer in this country, as would have
been the case if we had signed up to the FTT, but to an overseas
authority. Likewise, a UK company with significant Treasury operations
would potentially be in scope of the FTT when its counterparty happened

enhanced co-operation procedure is available to member states provided
it is legal and compliant with the treaty, and our view is that it is
certainly not. In particular, the extra-territorial
effects—exactly what my hon. Friend is concerned
about—are contrary to article 327 of the treaty on the
functioning of the European Union, as it fails to respect the
competences, rights and obligations of the non-participating member
states. Furthermore, the decision to proceed with the FTT has
extra-territorial effects for which there is simply no justification in
customary international law. The Select Committee has been prominent in
its scrutiny of that, and no doubt its Chair will have something to say

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000384" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000384">We
should consider the economic effects of the tax as well as the legal

economy of the United Kingdom, where 2 million people are employed in
financial and related professional services. That sector has created a
trade surplus for the country at a time when I think all nations should
be trying to increase their trade, and its activities are highly
integrated with those in other EU countries. Our best estimate is that
30% of over-the-counter derivatives trading in London involves a
counterparty in a proposed FTT zone country; similarly, about
30% of investors in UK gilts are located overseas, which

the costs faced by savers and companies. We have no objection to

unsatisfactory aspects of the FTT proposal is that it has been
frustrating trying to obtain an accurate view of its impact from the
Commission. Not enough analysis 
<?notus-xml column=793?>has been conducted. We know that the original estimate of the impact was
a reduction in EU GDP of 1.76% and a loss of half a million
jobs across the EU. Mysteriously, those figures have changed, but we

economic and monetary union. Late last year, the European Commission
published its blueprint for a deeper EMU, and the President of the
European Commission provided a report called “Towards a Genuine
Economic and Monetary Union”. Those reports put forward ideas
for possible steps to a more integrated euro area. They are of
particular concern to the European Scrutiny Committee, chaired by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:33:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stone (Mr Cash), and I am sure he will want to speak

far these are not formal proposals but contributions to a wider debate
in Europe about what may be needed to bring long-term stability to the
euro area. I am sure that further documents will be referred to the
Committee and we will have the opportunity to debate them in this
House, but I want to emphasise very clearly that the UK will not be
part of these arrangements, and although leaders at the December 2012
European Council agreed on a more limited work programme than that set
out in these reports, they do raise important questions that need to be
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000413">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:33:51"></hs_TimeCode>
European Council December 2012 conclusions were very clear that any new
steps towards strengthening economic governance would need to be
accompanied by further steps towards stronger legitimacy and
accountability. The European Parliament has a role at the EU level as
further integration of policy making and greater pooling of competences
take place among the euro-area countries, but this does not mean the
European Parliament has primacy over national Parliaments, whose role
is absolutely essential and inviolate.</hs_Para>

completely different from the EU vision that the van Rompuy report sets
out, which proposes a step change with the European Parliament having
primacy over national institutions. Does my right hon. Friend agree
that we need to face up to this, and decide whether or not we want to
be part of that
vision?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000416"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Clark" PimsId="4758" UID="13061895001620" xid="900" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895001620">Greg
Clark:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right, and that is why I was keen
to have this debate and make sure the Committee’s concerns on
this matter can be aired at an early stage. As I said a few moments
ago, the proposals so far do not cohere into proposals that will come
forward to be scrutinised, but this debate offers an opportunity for 
<?notus-xml column=794?>this House to send a clear message, as my hon. Friend may be able to do
later, during this process of working-up ideas as to what this
House’s clear expectations are with regard to the role of
national Parliaments. That is very
important.</hs_Para>

William Cash</B> (Stone) (Con):</Member> I hear what my right hon.
Friend says, but in the light of the assumption, based on what the
Chancellor has said, about the remorseless logic of allowing the core
member states to go ahead with proposals for monetary
union—which are implicit in the 52 pages of the blueprint
alone—does he accept that our policy is allowing this to happen,
and although we may not, it appears, be directly involved, we will
certainly be affected by
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:36:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000418"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Clark" PimsId="4758" UID="13061895001622" xid="900" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895001622">Greg

the euro area that require resolution should be resolved by its
members, and it is in the interests of the international economy that
that should be so. My hon. Friend is right to point out, however, that
our interests are engaged in this, and we will make use of our powers
and rights in the EU to insist that those interests are protected. An
early example of that is in the single supervisory mechanism, where
through repeated interventions and insistence by the Chancellor and me
at ECOFIN meetings, the Prime Minister was ultimately able to secure
agreement by way of a text in the regulation of that mechanism
explicitly stating that there should be no discrimination against any
country or currency as a result of these arrangements.</hs_Para>

matters will come up from time to time, and protecting our interests

having a bank account with the neighbours, and now the neighbours who
have put the money in are panicking about the other neighbours who are
taking the money out. We see in these documents that EMU is going to
progress with much tighter fiscal and banking controls. Is the Minister
going to want to keep all British banks out of the extra controls, as
we would then no longer be in charge of them, or does he think that the
euro activities of our banks must be part of this new centralised

mechanism is a good example, as I have said. We have our arrangements
for the supervision of our banks, which are centred around the Bank of

problem in particular with the President of the EU’s report
“Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union”,
which talks 
<?notus-xml column=795?>about contracts written by the EU—by the Commission—that
will be binding on the countries that sign them, and that

safeguarding the primacy of this House. Mr Deputy Speaker, I see from

I discuss the amendment, let me briefly deal with the latter set of
issues that the Minister raised—the general issues of national
parliamentary sovereignty, the remit of EU policy, enhanced
co-operation and so on. Clearly, the European Scrutiny Committee is
right to monitor the relationship between EU decisions and the need for
public engagement and accountability. Most Labour Members, however,
take a more positive view of the role that Britain should be playing in
Europe, because the European Union should be a force for good that
increases the chances of greater prosperity, peace and the values we
hold being asserted with greater impact across the world. We are
comfortable, though, with a degree of flexibility and variance across
member states; “enhanced co-operation” could be used to
our advantage here in the UK for the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:49:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

member states should have some latitude rather than follow a blind
adherence to anything and everything emanating from Brussels. There is
a danger that sometimes those who regard themselves as good
Europeans—pro-Europeans—end up defending the
poor decisions that the Commission and the European
Parliament can sometimes come out with. There is nothing wrong at all
with national Parliaments disagreeing with the European institutions;
it is a healthy sign of an internal dialectic, a constructive challenge
and a reality check for those who are more distant from public opinion.
We should acknowledge that both the European Commission and the
European Parliament need to be reformed to improve their accountability

Leslie:</Member></B> The Minister was talking about the European
variant of the FTT, but of course he was forced then to admit that we
have already got a partial FTT of sorts—the stamp duty that is
in place. I will discuss that in a moment, but it was very instructive
that he was vehemently against the extra-territoriality aspects of the
European version. Of course the EU version does need to change, and I
am not saying in any way that it is perfect. His argument is,
“They should stop extra-territoriality aspects in their
financial transaction tax”, but our stamp duty contains many of
those characteristics, and individuals—those trading UK shares
and UK equities—are liable wherever that trade takes place in
the world. So the Government clearly have not thought through their
position on these
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:47:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000442"><B><Member ContinuationText="Greg Clark" PimsId="4758" UID="13061895001634" xid="900" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895001634">Greg
Clark:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will know that stamp duty
follows the issuance principle—in other words, the tax follows
where the instrument is originated. The proposed FTT contains that and
a residence principle, so it captures a far wider range of
transactions, as well as this cascade point which stacks up and racks
up the impact. So it is a very different FTT from, and a very much
inferior FTT to, the stamp

the same from the Government—no solutions, just reasons for not
doing anything differently. It should not need to be
restated—although it clearly does for Government
Members—that the global financial crisis and the collapse of
many organisations in the financial services sector required an
enormous bail-out from the public purse. That collapse in revenues led
to an extra £300 billion on the national debt. As the Government
have failed to turn things around, we can see that many of the

have a systemic impact on our economy and UK financial services needs
to be regulated from within the Bank of England and by our regulatory
structures. I hope that there will be a match between our arrangements
and the European arrangements. That has been part of my anxiety about
the Government’s design of the Prudential Regulation Authority

persistently high because of rock-bottom growth, leading economies,
including those of Britain and the United States, need alternative
revenue measures from continuing financial market speculation to
relieve pressures on lower and middle-income households and the public
services they use.</hs_Para>

particular that including London and its financial centre in this would
be the best way forward. The Americans already have a very small
security exchange commission fee on individual transactions. In terms
of the American principle, the foot is already in the door. I was in
Washington DC in February to talk not only to Members of Congress, but
to others involved in the issue. Far from the impression that those on

is true that Jack Lew, the American Treasury Secretary, has concerns
about some of the extraterritorial aspects, but let us work on a
solution and find a design that might fit, if that is an issue of
principle. However we do that, we should not turn our minds away from
it. Similarly, the cascade risk issues could be dealt with. There are
issues relating to the impact on the repo market and the funding that
many companies depend on there, but again, there are exemptions and
ways of dealing with that problem and others, such as at what point a
levy would be applied, whether the sale and buy-back of a security
would be treated as one transaction, whether the charge would be waived
on overnight repos and closing repos, and closing any loopholes that
might fall open in the treatment of longer-term maturities. There are
ways of dealing with these issues, but any Treasury worth its salt
would be engaging on the issue, weighing up the pros and cons, dealing
with them and making sure that we had a design of a financial

Secretary for his extremely diligent approach to the debate. He has
dealt with all the arguments on the financial transaction tax and I
leave those on the record. It is extraordinary that the Opposition
should promote the idea, but there is no need for me to go into that
this afternoon. I am primarily concerned about the other aspect of the
debate and the report, which is the question of primacy. Without
primacy, there is no democracy in the House, and without going back to
the financial transaction tax, that is a subset of the question of
primacy, which is why the Scrutiny Committee insisted on having this
debate. I do not think my right hon. Friend will mind me saying that
there was a little uncertainty about having it, and I am indebted to
him for the clarity with which he has understood this vitally important
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000495" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000495"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:10:57"></hs_TimeCode>Our
democracy and legitimacy as a Parliament in this House is the basis on
which we decide questions of taxation and spending. As my right hon.
Friend the Prime Minister said, in the Bloomberg fourth principle,
national Parliaments are at the root of our democracy. Therefore, it is
absolutely fundamental that we stand by that. I veer away slightly from
the trajectory of my right hon. Friend—which he takes for
perfectly sensible reasons, but which I disagree with none the
less—that somehow the blueprint, which is described as
“launching a European debate” is somehow just a piece of
blue- sky thinking. It is not. It is absolutely fundamental to the one
question that lies at the heart of the Bloomberg speech, in the light
of what is said in the Commission document and in the Van Rompuy
conclusions, both of which put the prime emphasis on the European
Parliament, to all intents and purposes at the expense of national
Parliaments. They use the word “commensurate”, but it is
not commensurate. We cannot have two Governments dealing with the same
subject matter. We cannot have two Parliaments dealing with the same
subject matter. It is 
<?notus-xml column=805?>impossible, which is why we have to assert the primacy of this House,

becoming longer. I am extremely glad that we are having a proposal for
a referendum Bill, which will enable us to decide these questions, if
it comes off. I also believe that there is an understanding among
possibly 240 Government Members that there is a serious problem in
relation to the EU. There are some who take a different view, but it is
a tangential question for them. For us it is fundamental. The biggest
demonstration of the problem is this fundamental relationship, which
turns on primacy. That is what the Scrutiny Committee focused on, and

interesting altercation the other day with Olli Rehn in a committee
meeting that we had in Brussels. The hon. Gentleman made it crystal
clear with regard to this idea of the centralisation, with the
contracts that he referred to in an intervention, when he was rather
abruptly caught short, The reality is that he understands that it is an
infringement of our democratic relationship with the electorate. It is
about the person in the polling booth voting and making a decision
about the kind of Government that they want, and the kind of economy
that they want. He and I may have a difference of view about whether
there should be adjustments to the public purse. I would argue that if
there is a black hole out there in the EU and the black hole prevents
growth in the EU and we trade 50% with it, we cannot pay for the public

represents—this launching of the European debate, which we must
carry forward to ensure that we retain primacy in this House over the
issue of taxation and spending. The shadow Minister nods, so now he
concedes that it is not a matter of self-indulgence, but a matter of
significance. That is why the debate has to take place.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:16:38"></hs_TimeCode> am afraid to
say that the black hole, and the direction in which it is

buy derivatives to insure against the risk of poor performance by their
portfolio, but those funds are 
<?notus-xml column=807?>much more likely to hold their derivatives until they reach maturity,
which means that they would have to pay only a tiny amount under an FTT
because their trades are far fewer—the very opposite of the type
of short-term, superfast trading that grew in the run-up to the crisis.
Most of the burden of paying the FTT would fall on superfast traders
and speculative exchanges, which are very far removed from the real

want to introduce another note into the debate before sitting down. Our
Government, along with many other participants in the United Nations
framework convention on climate change, have stated that there will be
a green climate fund. That fund will have to raise $100 billion each
year by 2020—that is the minimum that the UK and our European
negotiating partners think will be necessary to help developing
countries increase their own economies, reduce poverty and offset the
impact of dangerous climate change. The FTT would be an extraordinarily
adept mechanism for raising those funds, which are vital to real growth
in our economy. If we look at the UK economy, we will find that only 6%
relates to the green economy, yet that 6% provided 30% of our economic
growth in 2011. I would like to see the funds from the FTT predicated
to use in the green climate
fund.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/91430067D057238A577C2C50D95E1E859DFDD354" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="18 June 2013">Tuesday

will deal first with the financial transaction tax, because it is a
rotten idea. The fact that we have stamp duty, a tax that has been
around for centuries and is not paid on rapid transactions—it is
paid only on long-term holdings—or by market makers, or for
contracts for difference, or on American depositary receipts, is not an
argument for saying that a financial transaction tax can work in the
sophisticated financial system that the world operates
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895000512" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0002.htm#13061895000512">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:28:37"></hs_TimeCode>

would ultimately fall on. In the wonderful world that he was creating,
there was a tax that could be designed—not, of course, the one

tax—that would never seem to fall to anybody. It could take
£10 billion out of the economy without anyone really having to

that is not the real world, because the transactions that take place in
the City represent an underlying reality, be it the debt issued by the
Government, mortgages sold on by banks, or pension funds being invested
around the globe. Individuals would end up paying that tax because the
costs of their doing business with banks would increase. We know that
clearly from the mortgage market, complicated as it may be, because the
ability to package mortgages and sell them reduces the cost of capital
to banks and reduces the cost to people of buying their own homes. What
the Opposition

EU along the lines of a single state with a single Government based in
Brussels. Of the papers we are considering today, there is one from the
European Commission showing that it wants within 18 months to have a
eurozone seat on the International Monetary Fund’s board, that
it wants within five years to co-ordinate eurozone tax and employment
policies, and that it wants a political union with adequate pooling of
sovereignty with central budgets as its own fiscal capacity and a means
of imposing budgetary and economic decisions on its members.

us is that, as the European Union obtains more powers for the eurozone,
our association with it will become very different from the present

because we are outside it. Alternatively, we could get dragged into the
arrangements because, as our experience of the European Union shows,
our opt-outs will ultimately expire. We have seen that happening with
the social chapter, and we will see it again next year with the

Portugal and Spain will be weaker economically and more impoverished

for what reason? What contribution will that make to the stability of a
new economy? It means that the powerful countries in the north will
become more powerful over the rest. I believe that when they are
finished with the weaker countries, they will come for the rest of the
17 and start to control their budgets. If they had their way and if we
were not outside the euro, they would be telling us that we could not
do what we are doing to try to deal with our economy—not that it

European Council: Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary
Union, European Union Documents No. 15390/12, a draft Council Decision
authorising enhanced co-operation in the area of financial transaction

these documents and concluded that they raise questions relating to
parliamentary sovereignty and primacy as well as fiscal and monetary
issues; notes that the European Commission Communication states that
‘Interparliamentary co-operation as such does not, however,
ensure democratic legitimacy for EU decisions. That requires a
parliamentary assembly representatively composed in which votes can be
taken. The European Parliament, and only it, is that assembly for the
EU and hence for the euro’, and that the report from the
President of the European Council concludes that ‘further
integration of policy making and a greater pooling of competences at
the European level should first and foremost be accompanied with a
commensurate involvement of the European Parliament in the 
<?notus-xml column=817?>integrated frameworks for a genuine EMU’; further notes that the
proposals for the Financial Transaction Tax have been challenged by the
Government in the European Court of Justice; notes that recent European
Treaties and protocols have emphasised the role of national parliaments
throughout the European Union as the foundation of democratic
legitimacy and accountability; and believes that this role is the pivot

Lidington:</Member></B> On 12 March, the European Commission published
a set of recommendations and a communication concerning the 2014
European parliamentary elections whose contents also touched on other
areas of European political life. The proposals do not carry legal
weight; they are non-binding suggestions to member states and national
and European political parties. The Government always welcome
contributions to the ongoing debate about democracy in the EU, but I
believe that these specific proposals mistakenly assume that there is a
single European political identity—a single European
demos—and ignore the fact that the fundamental source of
democratic legitimacy within the EU is derived from national
Parliaments accountable to their national electorates. I believe that
we need to work to strengthen the links between national democracies,
their Parliaments and EU institutions.</hs_Para>

consider it unlikely that these recommendations will become formal
legislative proposals from the Commission, but if they were to take

treaty articles are articles 22(2) and 223(1) of the treaty on the
functioning of the European Union. As you will recall, Madam Deputy
Speaker, under the European Union Act 2011, any measure introduced by
the Commission and agreed by the Council and Parliament under article
223(1) would also require an Act of Parliament for the United Kingdom

want briefly to set out the recommendations in more detail, addressing
those that concern the conduct of European elections, before turning to
the Commission recommendation that European political parties make
known their candidate for the post of Commission President. The first
and second recommendations put forward by the Commission are intended
to promote connections between European political parties and national
political parties. The proposals suggest that national political
parties should explain their connection with European political parties
and make clear that connection in their electoral documents. Political
parties in this country are perfectly free to advertise their European
affiliation if they so choose. Ballot papers in the United Kingdom will
continue to be produced in accordance with UK law, as will party
political literature. If a United Kingdom party wishes prominently to
display its European political affiliation, it is free to do so, but
there should be no question of compulsion.</hs_Para>

4—the suggestion that member states ought to agree a common
voting day for elections to the European Parliament—has
attracted some attention in the media. At the moment, elections to the
European Parliament take place over a four-day period, which in 2014 is
set to fall between 22 and 25 May, as I mentioned earlier. I fear that
a number of right hon. and hon. Members might have read reports that
the EU intends to force the UK to hold elections on a Sunday. It is my
happy duty to inform the House that this is not the case. The UK will
continue to hold elections on a Thursday, as is our tradition, and I am
sure that other member states will rest equally assured that they will
be able to continue to hold elections on their day of choice. To
mandate that a member state change its election day would achieve the
very opposite of the declared aim of the proposals—namely, an
increase in voter turnout—and would be detrimental to electoral
diversity across the

Field</B> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</Member> Much as I
think it would be quite wrong for anything to be mandated—the
decision should be made locally—the so-called tradition of
Thursday elections in the UK goes back only about 100 years.
Perhaps it would be more sensible to consider a weekend
election, for all the convenience factors that would come with that,
but also because, in the case of these elections, it might allow us to
hold elections on two weekend days some three or
four weeks apart, rather than having to change our day for local
elections, as we have, from the traditional first Thursday in May to 22
May, which is what is now envisaged for those elections and the

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:04:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman puts his finger on one of the key problems with shifting away
from our practice of voting on a Thursday—namely, that to pick
any day over the weekend from Friday to Sunday would inevitably begin
to trespass on the religious practices of faith groups in various parts
of the United Kingdom. We would need to look at how the timing of a
polling day might have an impact on people from such groups, and not
just in respect of the voting day because a large number of
constituencies and local authorities still count votes the day
following polling day, so that has to be taken into consideration,

equally uninterested in the European parliamentary election. I agree
with my right hon. Friend on what he says about maintaining our
Thursday elections. Has he assessed how much the ridiculous situation
of paying for security and the guarding of ballot boxes from Thursday
to Sunday costs us? Plenty of other countries around the world, such as
Canada, have results coming in for elections held on the same day, but
the results from eastern Canada are known before the people in western
Canada have finished voting. Why can we not just go back to counting on

whether the Cabinet Office has the figures for which my hon. Friend
asks. I think that the agreement reached some years ago within the
EU—that voting should take place over a number of
days—was designed to accommodate both the fact that different
countries had the habit of voting on different days of the week and the
wish not to declare votes early in case the votes in one country
affected how votes were cast in another country. I have to say that I
rather agree with my hon. Friend, as the prospect of that happening is,
in practice, pretty slim. I doubt whether he will be influenced in his
campaigning by the outcome of elections in Greece or Malta. The

the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), let me explain
our view on article 17(7). The European Council retains complete
freedom to nominate whom it wishes. It is required to take into account
the elections to the European Parliament, but there is nothing in
article 17(7) or elsewhere in the treaty on European union that
suggests the European Council is in any way mandated to limit its
election to a particular pool of candidates. Indeed, it may be that no
one political family commands a majority in the European Parliament, or
it may be that different combinations of European political parties
within the European Parliament prefer one candidate rather than
another, and it may not be 
<?notus-xml column=824?>possible, simply by looking at which of the larger European groupings
ends up in the lead after the elections next year, to determine what
the preference even of the Parliament itself might be as to the
preferred
candidate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:18:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001132"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jacob Rees-Mogg" PimsId="5628" UID="13061895002247" xid="1186" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895002247">Jacob

that there are plenty of people in and around the European Commission,
and indeed the European Parliament, who believe—perfectly
honourably—that the way forward is to move towards a system in
which it is the European Parliament, rather than the Heads of
Government assembled in the European Council, that has the key role in
nominating the President of the Commission and thereafter holding the
Commission to account. These are people who believe that it is right
and possible to create a European demos, and see that step as a way so
to do. What I am saying to my hon. Friend is that I see, and the
Government see, nothing in the treaty that requires the European
Council to limit its freedom of action in the way that some are

Lidington:</Member></B> It is important to distinguish a couple of
points. First, nothing in these Commission documents is a legally
binding proposal. I repeat: these have the status of
recommendations, nothing more. The recommendation we are now debating
is addressed to European political parties and national political
parties, and it deals with how the Commission thinks they might better
arrange their affairs. It is entirely up to both the European and the
national political parties to decide whether they pay any attention to
the Commission’s recommendations or
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001137"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:21:35"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
there are provisions in the treaty on the functioning of the European
Union to govern the conduct of European parliamentary elections. Those
are embodied in a statute based on the relevant articles of the TFEU.
For that statute to be amended, or for other changes to be brought
forward, unanimity would be required under article 223, as I said
earlier. The question of party political spending, including by
candidates within the United Kingdom, is governed by the relevant
United Kingdom statutes, including, most obviously, the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. At the moment, there is a
clear legal distinction between certain measures that are set at
European level and require the 
<?notus-xml column=825?>unanimous agreement of every member state, and the rules on party
fundraising, party financing and election expenditure, which remain a
matter for member states and are not touched in any way, even by these
Commission
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001138"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:23:03"></hs_TimeCode>I
wish to conclude on the following point. I said at the start of my
remarks that the Government believed there is a genuine problem of lack
of democratic legitimacy within the European Union, but that these
proposals suggested by the Commission do not provide the answer to that
crisis. The Government’s preference would be to see a greater
role for national Parliaments in holding European decisions to account.
Although I will not expatiate on the detail, the ideas that my right
hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I have proposed in recent weeks
on the greater use of the yellow card mechanism or creating a red card
mechanism, giving national Parliaments the right to block legislation
that need not be agreed at European level, are intended as a
contribution to a vigorous debate, which we have now launched, within
Europe, not just within the UK. The absence of democratic legitimacy
and adequate democratic accountability within the EU is a major
political question that needs serious debate and consideration right
across the European Union, but it is not answered by the proposals
before us this
evening.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/CC501F6B5A9B067F22A1C1AC639B785A96598640" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="18 June 2013">Tuesday

I welcome the opportunity that the European Scrutiny
Committee has given the House to scrutinise these documents from the
European Commission, one a communication and the other a
recommendation, which make suggestions about the conduct and
organisation of European elections by member states. The stated
objective of the European Commission is to increase the democratic
legitimacy of the EU and boost turnout in European
elections. Fortunately, European communications and recommendations, as
their names suggest, do not have legal force and, as the Minister
stressed, the documents are not binding on member states. That is the
only good thing about them.</hs_Para>

this case, and in others, the European Commission seems to have
disregarded a very important principle that applies to European

and obvious to me and Members across the House that it should be the
decision of democratic political parties in the UK to decide how to
approach European elections and how to campaign for them, and that it
is up to Ministers in our Government and to this Parliament to decide
on which day we should hold those elections. One of the most concerning
elements of the proposals is the one to hold the European elections on
the same day across the European Union. The Commission argues that
member states should agree on</hs_Para>

argument is problematic in two different ways. First, as has already
been stated, we have a tradition in the UK of voting on a Thursday
that, I understand, goes back to the 1930s. It is now fixed in law that
local and general elections must take place on a Thursday. The date of
European elections is not fixed in law but, according to section 4 of
the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002, European elections
should be held on a date fixed by the Secretary of State for Justice.
Nevertheless, here as well, the convention is that European elections
take place on a Thursday, in line with other elections, as I
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>described.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001151">There
are different traditions in different member states of the European
Union. We, the Danes and the Dutch usually vote on a Thursday, the
Irish vote on a Friday, and some other member states tend to vote on a
Saturday or a Sunday. I strongly believe that it should continue to be
a decision made by member states’ Governments as to which day of
the week elections 
<?notus-xml column=827?>should be held. Here in the UK it is essential that there is uniformity
across the different sets of elections, so general, local and European
elections should all take place on a
Thursday<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001152">There
is already a problem with low turnout in European elections. I would
like to see a higher turnout in those elections. The Commission states
that it wants to boost turnout and increase democratic legitimacy. I
fear that its proposal to hold elections on the same day throughout the
EU would do exactly the opposite of the stated objective. It might
further decrease voter turnout and would therefore do nothing to
improve democratic
legitimacy<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001153">Secondly,
the idea that polling stations should close at the same time is also
problematic because of the differences in time zones across the EU.
Polls that close at 10 pm in the UK would close earlier in Greece, for
example. As early as 1960, the European Parliament adopted proposals
for a “uniform procedure” for its member states’
elections, to be used by all member states, but in reality,
five decades later, there is no uniformity in virtually any aspect of
European elections. In most member states, including the UK, voters
choose from a party list, whereas in other member states the single
transferable vote is used. Voting ages vary as well, so there is no
uniformity in these aspects of European elections. Artificially
imposing the same election day would be problematic and, as I said,
counter-productive<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001154">The

others want to campaign in the European parliamentary elections. It is
up to the respective national parties to decide how best to campaign in

Horwood</B> (Cheltenham) (LD):</Member> Being asked to support a motion
that takes note of a non-binding set of documents means that this is
possibly the least controversial European debate that we have ever had
in the House, and I am entirely happy to support the motion. I agree
with quite a lot of what has been said by Members on both sides of the
House. If the Commission’s proposals are trying to encourage
engagement and involvement in European politics, they are missing the
mark. That will never be transformed by prescribing the minutiae of
voting days or even by talking about precisely how and when who
suggests what candidate for posts in the
Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have a responsibility as politicians to address these issues, and
perhaps to stop discussing endlessly the minutiae of treaties and
referendums and such matters—banging on about Europe, as the
Prime Minister once memorably put it—but focus on jobs, crime,
the environment and all the important things that Europe has an impact
on in our constituents’ lives, but that are rarely talked about
in that context.</hs_Para>

for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds) and others that there are
huge practical problems with having a single voting day, and even more
with having single voting times. We should be looking for more
flexibility in voting as a possible contribution to higher turnouts,
not lower, which these proposals seem to suggest. People lead busy
lives, voting often is not their No. 1 priority on a particular day;
that might be getting to and from work, getting the children to school
or doing a million other things. I am sure we have all been in the
situation of trying to persuade that one last voter to go out and vote,
but finding that it is not quite as important to them as it is to us.
Of course it is very important, and we are right to try to persuade
people to turn out, but we need to make it easier, not more
difficult.</hs_Para>

spoke extremely well. I agree with everything she said, even though
there might be a smidgen of difference between our views on the

must absolutely not have parties at European Union level. Even at
national level, party elites are sometimes too far removed from their
activists and their voters. Having party groupings at international
level acting as parties would make the gap between the voters at the
grass roots and those who govern us even greater. That would be
completely unacceptable.</hs_Para>

problem involves finding political parties to bond with. The
Conservatives have understandably had problems finding a home. If I
were in their position, I would be happy to stand separately, but I
know that that would create a problem of securing positions on
committees and so on. So far as Labour is concerned, we could be linked
with Pasok in Greece, yet Pasok is now cemented together with New
Democracy and inflicting appalling austerity on the working people of
that country. I do not want to be seen to be supporting Pasok in what
it is now doing. It should be standing up for working people and
against austerity. Indeed, that is what we should all be doing.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:47:27"></hs_TimeCode>We can have
links and, occasionally, loose friendships with other parties when
seeking convenient political groupings, but forming single political
parties across Europe would be another step on the way to creating a

the Member for Wolverhampton North East also mentioned this point. I
have opposed such proposals before, and called in this Chamber for a
return to first past the post and single Member constituencies. I hold
to that position today. People would take the view that Europe was much
more democratic if Members of the European

Over recent years we have seen power leached away from local government
towards central Government. Local government is far less powerful than
it was when I was a councillor 40 years ago. We had an enormous degree
of independence that is no longer given to local government.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:51:53"></hs_TimeCode> we allow too
much of what we govern to go to the EU, democracy
will leach away from our national Parliament. This is about powers. I

have heard a remarkable outbreak of consensus, which is important and
is why the European Scrutiny Committee wanted the document debated. One
of the things we learn from the processes of the European Union,
particularly those of the Commission, is that things start at an early
stage with a little document that has no legal force and is there for a
general, genteel discussion. Nobody says very much about it, so the
Commission assumes that there cannot be very much opposition to what is
being proposed and that it is perfectly reasonable and
achieving consensus. Then the document gets hardened up into a proposal
and then into a directive or a regulation, and before we know where we
are we are opposing a fully fledged, fully formed idea, which is, of
course, much harder to do than when things are at an early stage, when
the Commission can back down without significant loss of face and there
has been no momentum in favour of the
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:53:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:53:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001197">I
would caution us, none the less, against being too complacent about
what the Commission may do next, because it has a treaty base—it
is set out in the ESC report—for some of its proposals. The

importance of a treaty base is that it gives the Commission the ability

the European Commission is trying to do—its own paper sets this

sovereign will of this

changed. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:55:50"></hs_TimeCode> am

would suggest that democratic legitimacy within Europe as it is
currently constructed, based on the 1972 Act, lies with the Council of
Ministers, because those Ministers are responsible to their sovereign
Parliaments and have to report to them on what they have done. The
paper from the Commission does not take that into account. Indeed, it
tries to establish a new basis for the democratic legitimacy of the
European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:56:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001202">If
that view won widespread acceptance across member states, the question
would arise as to whether our initial acceptance of powers for the

it discriminates against parties that are very focused on their

get if it coalesced with other parties across the continent. There
would be FIP in France, DIP in Germany, HIP in Holland and GIP in

am arguing that there is a fundamental flaw in the European
Commission’s paper. That flaw is the idea that the European
Parliament can be or is the body of democratic legitimacy for the

through the proposal on political parties, to promote its own view.

the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris) asked how funding from
European political parties and other EU sources might influence
domestic election campaigns in the United Kingdom. I want to place on
the record that participation in elections in this country, including
European elections, is regulated by UK electoral law, and that includes
the use of funding in campaigns. United Kingdom law prohibits the use
of funding from sources outside the UK, including European political
party funding. A prohibition on the use of EU funding by
national political parties is included in the draft new European
political party proposals—those are other EU documents that the

can give some reassurance to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:02:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) about articles
10(4) and 17(7) of the treaty on the European union. The full text of
those articles contains a number of statements about how the European
Union should organise its business, but there is no provision for the
Commission to bring forward legislation and put it to the Council or
Parliament. I would contrast that with the provisions in article 223(1)
of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, to which I
referred earlier. That provides for changes to the law to be initiated
by the Commission, and to be subject to the unanimous agreement of all
member states. The enabling power for new legislation is not included
in the text of articles 10 and 17, and that is why I said that the only
way it would be possible to impose a mandate on the European Council to
limit its nominations for President of the European Commission to lead
candidates nominated by European political parties, or even to the lead
candidate of the leading party after a European election, would be

same way that almost any Executive decision in this country is
challengeable under judicial review. Our view is that the duty on the
European Council is no more and no less than that provided in article
17(7), which is to have regard to the outcome of the European
Parliament elections and engage in the appropriate consultations. If
the intention of the authors of the TEU had been a mandate, it would be
spelled out in the wording of the treaty. My hon. Friend is right that
there is an ambition on the part of a number of people in the
Commission and the European Parliament not to seek treaty
change—not at the moment, at least—but to bring about a
working assumption that national Governments assembled in the European
Council should limit themselves in the way they wish. As I have said,
we strongly resist that
assumption.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001214">I
conclude on this point. We have a set of recommendations that are not
legally binding, and there is currently no suggestion of legislative
proposals from the Commission to give effect to its recommendations.
Any such legislative proposals would need the unanimous agreement of
every member state, under whichever treaty article they are brought
forward. I believe—this was the view on both sides of the
House—that the recommendations are fundamentally misplaced.
There is a serious problem across the EU, with public disaffection with
the EU and how its decisions are taken rising to record levels. We have
seen that reflected in part in the rise of populist parties—some
democratic, some undemocratic and neo-fascist—in many different
EU countries. For that real problem to be addressed, the EU needs to
show in its priorities that it is focused on those things that really
matter to the prosperity and security of the peoples of Europe. The
arrangements by which the EU takes decisions needs to be reformed in a
way that gives greater influence and authority to national Parliaments,
to which Heads of Government and Ministers in the Council are
ultimately
accountable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001215"><I>Question

the fact of this debate was published, I have been struck by how many

“You cannot give out the locality-specific information that we
are giving to you, because it could be traced back to us and compromise
NGO operatives and associates in particular regions.” Their
nervousness about being named and about their briefings being traced
speaks volumes about the situation and their bravery and good

NGOs do not take the side of particular political interests; theirs is
purely a humanitarian effort, and like the Government—I know
that we will hear from the Minister later—they welcome and
encourage any positive steps, whether in the relationship between Sudan
and South Sudan or towards improving conditions in the two countries.
They are also clear about the risks and about the trespasses against
human rights and humanitarian standards that take place all too
frequently and are seemingly met with indifference. In Darfur, for
instance, the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur has
recently seemed to be saying, “Well, because there has been
statistical easement in some features of the humanitarian crisis in
Darfur, we should treat that as though the crisis is ending,”
but clearly it is not ending. Even when there are statistical
easements, factors and circumstances change, whether it is factors of
conflict or seasonal factors or other trepidations that interfere with
the situation, and as a result, people find themselves in an ever
graver plight, so we cannot act like this is done and dusted on the
basis of comprehensive peace agreements that are given only faltering
acknowledgment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001229"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>I
hope that the Minister will explain not only how engaged the British
Government are with the political interests in both countries, but how
much support they are giving to, and how engaged they are with,
the various NGOs. I hope that he will also indicate how well
the UK engagement effort works with that of the EU, 
<?notus-xml column=839?>given that the EU is the single biggest donor in the area,
and respond to questions about the UN’s role. Given the

we appear to be maintaining lines of engagement and agreeing aid
packages, as part of multilateral rounds, with the Government in
Sudan—because we want to help the people of Darfur—in
ways that do not chime with our attitude to the behaviour of the former
Libyan regime or the current Syrian regime or our attitude in other
similar circumstances?
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:25:19"></hs_TimeCode> understand why
the Government make their commitment alongside others, for instance, in
the context of the Doha conference earlier this year. I know, however,
that this House has heard from Darfurians who basically say that this
is rewarding ethnic cleansing and doing nothing for victims. They fear
that some of those moneys could end up being used by that same
Government to further their violence against their own civilians. I am
not saying that that is absolutely so or that there are no guarantees
or measures to prevent or proof against that risk, but it is a risk
that is genuinely felt. We have heard it genuinely expressed here
within the precincts of this House, so I hope that the Minister will,
as well as responding to questions from hon. Members, address those

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:26:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Foyle (Mark Durkan) on securing the debate and also on the good
points that he made. I heard another Member saying that this was a
political debate; it is a political debate, but I say as a Conservative
Member that I agreed with everything the hon. Gentleman said. He is
quite right: it is two years since we last debated Sudan, when we held
a Westminster Hall debate in the spring of 2011. At that time, the
comprehensive peace agreement was being implemented. We were seeing the
end of a 22-year civil war that had killed 2 million people, with 4
million people having left their homes. 
<?notus-xml column=841?>January 2011 saw a successful referendum in South Sudan, with 98.8% of
the population voting in favour of independence.</hs_Para>

were expressed in our debate—over the future of Abyei, for
example, where the referendum had been cancelled and postponed. There
were concerns over South Kordofan and the Blue Nile state, as public
consultations on the future of those two states were meant to take
place, but had not happened. Then, too, the ongoing conflict in Darfur
was at the forefront of our minds. On the whole, however, hope and
optimism for the future were expressed in that debate. There was a
belief that the independence of South Sudan would mean a new beginning
for both north and South Sudan at that time.</hs_Para>

this point, I should mention my entry in the Register of
Members’ Financial Interests, which records my visit. This was a
few weeks before South Sudan gained independence, and while we were
there, we met Government Ministers, people from the National Congress
party, embassy staff, Department for International Development staff,
local businesses and representatives of the local Coptic church. When
we met those people, we noted a huge amount of hope for the future. It
was believed that 9 July 2011 would mean a new beginning for both Sudan
and South Sudan.</hs_Para>

thing we picked up while we were there, and which particularly relevant
to this Parliament, was the high regard many people had for the United

in Sudan were, despite all the problems, either educated in the UK or
held British passports. There was an immense well of good will towards
the UK and a huge desire among all the people we spoke to to increase
links, trade and investment with us. There was a big will for Britain
to get more involved in

is now, of course, two years since South Sudan got its independence,
but I am afraid to say that many of the hopes we had two years ago have
been dashed. Both Sudan and South Sudan are considered to be fragile
states. Both countries face terrible humanitarian and development
challenges, and the indicators are some of the worst in the world. It
is 10 years since the start of the conflict in Darfur, and there is
still no end in sight. Concerns remain about the Khartoum Government

cease
violence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001246">When

tweet from the Minister that drew my attention to the first item. It
concerned the shelling of a United Nations base which killed an
Ethiopian peacekeeper and injured two more. It took place in Kadugli,
in South Kordofan, and is thought to have been the work of fighters
from the Sudan People’s Liberation
Movement-North—SPLM-N—supported by South Sudan. The UN
does not have a mission in South Kordofan, but it has one in Abyei, and
the base was being used as a supply depot for that.</hs_Para>

suggested that the rebels were targeting a football ground, as a
football tournament was due to begin there today, but, as always in
Sudan, it is not clear who was responsible. The UN Security Council and
the Secretary General have condemned the attack and called on Sudan to
bring the perpetrators to justice, but we do not know who those
perpetrators are. It is assumed that they are members of SPLM-N, but we

second news item was about an oil pipeline that had been attacked in
Abyei. In this case, the Sudan Government blame the South Sudan-backed
rebels, but both the rebels and South Sudan deny responsibility. The

South Sudanese oil, which is due to begin in six weeks’ time. We
heard from the hon. Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) that an

the shutting down of oil production, and that the hardship will be felt

in particular, a final resolution, through a referendum, of the future

Mosley:</Member></B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. I think
that the importance of oil in the relationship between Sudan and South
Sudan is clear to all of us. Approximately 75% of the oil reserves are
in South Sudan, and approximately 25% are in north Sudan. The South
Sudanese Government are particularly dependent on oil revenues for
their taxation income—I have heard that as much as 98% of South
Sudan’s income derives from oil—but any measures that
impede the flow of oil affect not just South Sudan but Sudan. They
affect the oilfields on the northern side of the border. We must
recognise that oil has a huge part to play, and ensure that any
agreements that are reached to deliver permanent peace deliver a
solution to the oil problems as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001252">The

Apparently, South Sudanese Government forces were blocking aid for

for MPs to stand up in this Chamber to sing their praises and tell

South Sudan the NGOs deliberately said, “No, we don’t
want you to say what we’re doing. We don’t want you to
say where we are doing it.” They face so many problems that they
are afraid that if they highlight their situation, they may face
repercussions. They have told us that they already face restrictions on
visas, and the cost of permits is going through the roof. They are
finding that it is becoming more restrictive to operate in both Sudan

Lazarowicz</B> (Edinburgh North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> First,
I congratulate the hon. Members responsible for securing today’s
debate and ensuring that these issues were debated in this Chamber. I
hope to take only a few minutes, because other hon. Members are experts
on this area and I am most certainly not. However, I wish to put on the
record my concerns and, as these have also been expressed to me by many
constituents, it is good to have the opportunity to do so.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061895001267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001267">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:42:19"></hs_TimeCode>
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:42:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Foyle (Mark Durkan) pointed out, Sudan and South Sudan is very much
an area of the world where because some progress appears to have been
made, the problem appears to have been solved—we know it has not
been—and the world’s attention has 
<?notus-xml column=845?>focused elsewhere; the world moves on and we pay attention to other
crises. Although positive steps have clearly been taken in the
establishment of South Sudan, the problem has not gone away. Nobody
expected that South Sudan’s independence would suddenly solve
the problems overnight, but all of us would probably not have expected
such a deterioration in the situation since independence. Plenty of
fighting is going on. We recognise that a full-scale war is
not—we hope—on the agenda, but the deterioration of the
situation is such that all sorts of crises will develop or get worse.
Perhaps this has been a classic example of how it is always easy to
start wars in different parts of the world but very hard to end them
and solve the underlying
difficulties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001268">Hon.
Members have given examples of the problems. One is clearly the failure
to ensure that the peace agreement reached in Ethiopia was implemented.
As my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:43:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) pointed out, another
is that the income levels of people in South Sudan have dropped,
whereas those in the rest of Africa are increasing. That reflects the
failure to resolve the issues concerning oil, which, as he pointed out,
affect both South Sudan and Sudan. South Sudan could be one of the
richest countries in Africa if the oil was being allowed to flow. So a
resolution of that problem is important for all sides.</hs_Para>

about the fighting, not just on both sides of, and across, the border
between Sudan and South Sudan but within South Sudan, as well about the
conflict and, to put it bluntly, repression continuing in Darfur. There
are the issues with refugees and displaced persons to which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:44:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:44:32"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for City of Chester (Stephen Mosley) referred, as well as
problems with the lack of free media and with the ability of NGOs to
operate, which occur on both sides of the border. There are also issues
with weaknesses in civil governance and, in many respects, worse than
weaknesses as regards freedom in both countries. Food shortages are
increasingly a problem in many parts of both countries. The ongoing
problem persists in Darfur and we have not solved it 10
years on—in many ways, we have not moved forward. We continue to
see repression and fighting. The responsibility does not lie in only
one place, but clearly we know where the main responsibility
lies.</hs_Para>

want to highlight, in keeping with the theme of the debate, what the UK
can do to try to move matters in a more positive direction and I want
to ask the Minister a number of questions about how the UK will
continue to play a role. Many Members have mentioned the United
Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur. Clearly, its weaknesses are
extreme and its mandate needs to be strengthened. We need more than
that and I would be interested to know the UK Government’s view
on how it can be taken forward.</hs_Para>

weaknesses of UNAMID also reflect the weaknesses in capacity of the UN
and the African Union in the area. Much is made of the AU and of its
weaknesses, but we should not forget that we increasingly expect it to
play a major role in a number of different areas of conflict in Africa.
It is involved in Mali, the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Somalia. Crises are developing in other areas. The situation is
increasingly worrying in sub-Saharan Africa and, as the Minister will
be aware, in the Central African Republic.</hs_Para>

brings together the development, humanitarian and diplomatic functions
of the UK Government in relation to both states. Would it not be a good

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> Absolutely. That brings me to my final point:
although it is important to deal with the immediate, pressing crisis,
we need to try to consider ways of establishing security for the long
term. One important way of providing security as well as peace
settlements that stand the test of time is to ensure that there is food
security. That tackles some of the immediate crises affecting the
community and, by removing some of them, relieves some of the pressure
on Government.</hs_Para>

are very important areas in Africa and when South Sudan seceded from
Sudan in 2011, the hopes of the world were there. Everybody thought it

the Member for City of Chester said, one cannot get about in South
Sudan. One has to fly from one place to another, which is fine for us
westerners going in, but impossible for the local population. There are
about 15 km of made-up road in the whole country, which makes nonsense
of local people trying to get
anywhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:49:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001278">So
many people have been sent back from Khartoum even though they have
lived there for generations. Because their origins are in South Sudan,
they have been told that they are South Sudanese and they must return
to their own country. However, the people who came from Khartoum and
the surrounding areas spoke only Arabic. They may be well
qualified—for example, as doctors or engineers. They had a
wealth of western-style qualifications, but when they got back to South
Sudan—they had never been there, neither had their parents or,
in some cases, their grandparents, but they were classified as South
Sudanese—they could not converse with the 
<?notus-xml column=847?>local people, who speak English as well as their own local language. So
there was no way that those people, who were well qualified, could get
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:50:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061895001279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#13061895001279">Those
arriving in South Sudan had no homes to go to. They were put
into camps, where there were no latrines. In the camp that we visited,
there was open defecation, which is appalling, given that the area that
we went to is often flooded. All the open defecation would then flood
through the camp. The worry for the mothers of the children—some
of the children had travelled with them and some had been born in the
camp since they arrived—was that as there were no latrines, they
had to go out quite a long way from the camp to be able to go to the
toilet, which meant that they were frightened for their
safety.</hs_Para>

the UN and all the international agencies have a responsibility, when
building camps, to provide latrines where children and women in

Sudan. It must happen there and everywhere that camps are built;
otherwise there will be rape and violence against women, girls and
children, which is totally

was no education going on for the people who had come back, so they
could not even learn the local languages. They had no jobs to go to.
Some of the people we met had been in the camp for nine months and had
not even seen a doctor. One girl I spoke to had some form of chest
infection. She was coughing badly, but she had had no access to any
medical professional of any sort since she had been there. She had
caught the chest infection or whatever it was on the march back,
because the people had had to walk much of the way back to South Sudan.
I keep saying “back” but of course it is not their home:

seemed to me that these people were being totally disadvantaged because
the Sudanese Government had said, “We want everybody

of hard work and are working on the report’s recommendations. I
do not have the report with me so I cannot go into the detail of each
individual recommendation, but the coalition Government are working
hard to alleviate the problems in South Sudan, and DFID is doing a lot
of work in the Blue Nile area and South Kordofan. DFID is doing a huge
amount of work with women and girls to make their lives much better.
DFID is keen to promote the well-being and safety of women and girls,
which have not been priorities for the Sudanese and South Sudanese
Governments. The previous Secretary of State for International
Development sent a huge number of textbooks to the schools, but when we
returned from South Sudan we met its Education Minister, who said that
it was great to get the textbooks, but it does not have the buildings
or teachers to put them to use. Not just the children but the adults
coming from the north into South Sudan need education so that they can
get jobs and be economically active. Often they are skilled people,
having lived a western lifestyle, but they cannot function if they
cannot speak the language. As we all know, the older one gets, the
longer it takes to learn a language, although being immersed in it
makes it much easier.</hs_Para>

strongly believe that South Sudan could still be a success if the
fighting stopped. I do not believe that the UN is doing as good a job
as it could. It could work much harder to reduce the conflict and to
work with the people in the area to make sure that they are safe and
feel safe. It is important that the oil flow continues, because with
the oil will come prosperity. Both the north and the south can be
prosperous. They need that income to be able to build South Sudan,
which is a beautiful country and needs investment for people to
survive. It needs roads, schools, and hospitals and medical care. There
are very few, and what there are are very poor. The north of the
country, as it was when it was united, has starved South Sudan of
resources. In Khartoum and in the north it is great, but in the south
no one has anything. Our Government are working hard to help and
mediation work is going on, but we need to ensure that the south can
build and renew itself and become a proper functioning country. Until
then, and until the violence and war end, it will never succeed.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:59:14"></hs_TimeCode>It could

address the issue might be to take an oil pipeline through Kenya, but

their already intense pressure on the country’s minority
Christians. That cannot be allowed to happen. Sudan’s Minister
for guidance and endowments, Al-Fatih Taj El-sir, announced in April
that no new licences for building churches would be issued—I
hope that we never have to appoint a Minister for guidance and
endowments in this place, because it would be a sad day if we came to
that. The Minister explained the decision by claiming that no new
churches had been established since South Sudan’s secession in
July 2011. That was due, in his opinion, to a lack of worshippers and a
growth in the number of abandoned church buildings. The reason was that
most of those people were being repatriated to South Sudan. He said
that there was no need for any new churches. He also said that freedom
to worship is guaranteed in Sudan, but quite clearly it is
not.</hs_Para>

Abyei, where the continuing lack of a referendum is inciting violence

Government of Sudan continue indiscriminately to target civilians with
aerial bombardments. Such attacks are a clear violation of the UN
Security Council’s resolution 1591, dated March 2005, which
demands an end to such violence. What is the UN is going to do

citizens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:20:36"></hs_TimeCode>? Hon.
Members have mentioned the atrocious attacks on civilians in the
village of Jebel Marra, where there are already 500 orphans. The murder
of a woman there on 16 June this year meant that two more children have
been left without a mother. The Government of Sudan continue to
obstruct aid agencies from operating freely within the region, and many
of those agencies are struggling to cope with the 1.4 million people
living in displaced persons camps with very little
amenity—indeed, in many instances, with nothing. New arrivals
are arriving practically every day to be faced with the opportunity to
live under a tarpaulin shelter and scratch a living from the
land.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618115000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#130618115000036"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:21:37"></hs_TimeCode>That

quite a lot—indeed, I think he said it is doing a good
job—but if it has been paid $765 million by this Government and
country since 2007, we would expect it to do a good job. The United
Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur budget has cost an estimated
$9.3 billion since 2007; one would have expected the problem to have
been solved a long time ago. We are looking at a waste of resources,
and I ask the Government to conduct an immediate inquiry into that
expenditure to try to try to paint a picture of where the money is
going, so that we can understand how it is being spent. For the life of
me, I cannot understand how $9 billion has left a country in such an
intolerable
mess<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:22:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618115000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#130618115000037"><B><Member ContinuationText="Martin Horwood" PimsId="4795" UID="130618115000186" xid="820" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#130618115000186">Martin

In any country that has emerged from conflict—I speak with some
personal experience—when conflict ends, stability starts to take

accused of being cowardly, but if there is stability, capital and
activity will start to flow. The Government must explain how they
intend to encourage UK business activity to flow into that country

foundation. What support will they give to British businesses that seek

hon. Member for North Antrim spoke with great authority and presented
the dilemma of what an international policy can achieve. The previous
Government pursued an international policy, which the coalition
Government continued with real commitment. Frankly, 
<?notus-xml column=856?>it is not working. It is now more than 10 years since the Sudanese
Government launched military action against armed groups in Darfur,
leading to the deaths of more than 300,000 Darfuris and the
displacement of 3 million

even further than that.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:31:47"></hs_TimeCode> various
examples cited in the debate show that the fundamental causes of the
conflict remain. One can only feel for the people of Sudan and we must
stand with them in sympathy and solidarity. The central fact is this:
the appalling crisis that happened before is happening again. I
listened to all the contributions to the debate, and I am sure the
Minister did too. We need to work collectively to make progress and
support the Government in holding international institutions to
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618115000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#130618115000047"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>We

Recent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:34:19"></hs_TimeCode> figures
from the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs state
that, just since January, more than 300,000 people have been displaced
by inter-tribal fighting or conflict between armed movements in South
Kordofan and Blue Nile. According to figures from the
Government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission for
government-controlled areas and from the Sudan Relief and
Rehabilitation Agency for SPLM-N areas in South Kordofan and Blue Nile,
more than 1 million people remain displaced or are severely affected by
fighting. There are more displaced people this year so far than there

addressing the conflict in these two areas is fundamental to finding a

which have continued. We have also seen tribal clashes over land, which
means that this is not a simple matter of the South Sudanese forces

that, but that does not take away from the suffering that is occurring.
More than 300,000 people have been displaced this year—more than

the excellent work of the NGOs. If I may build on the sad point he made

absolutely right to highlight the lack of infrastructure in South
Sudan, and the importance of roads for economic development and
economic growth. She further emphasised the point that other hon.
Members made about the importance of oil revenues and keeping the oil
flowing to build up infrastructure and capacity. She also highlighted,
with great articulation, the practical problems of flooding, lack of
jobs and language difficulties, not to mention the significant economic

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:47:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Strangford (Jim Shannon), who focused his remarks on problems with
religious freedom and the persecution of Christians. We are very
concerned 
<?notus-xml column=860?>about the increase in the number of reports in recent months of
intimidation and threats to Christians and to church
premises—from other groups and, significantly, from parts of the
Sudanese security services—as well as of the deportations of
individual Christians of foreign origin. Our officials in Khartoum
have, together with the EU, met members of the Sudanese Government to
raise our significant concerns. In particular, we have urged them to
investigate the attack on Christian individuals and properties. It is
also worth emphasising that the UK embassy is providing assistance in a
consular capacity to foreign Christians who have been affected by these
problems.</hs_Para>

if I may, I would like to put on record even though I am a Minister in
the Foreign Office, some of the very significant and important work
being done by the Department for International Development, both in
Sudan and South Sudan. The work focuses on responding to the underlying
causes of conflict and its impact on the poorest and most vulnerable in
Sudan—displaced people, particularly girls and women, the urban
poor and the disadvantaged young. DFID will work to tackle the impact
of unequal allocation of finance and unequal access to basic
services.</hs_Para>

of the figures are quite extraordinary, so let me quickly trot some of
them out. About 800,000 people have been given access to clean drinking
water; 20,000 young people have been helped to obtain education and
training; 80,000 people have access to financial services; 10,000
square kilometres of land have been returned to productive
use—the hon. Member for Strangford alluded to that—and
250,000 women and girls have improved access to security and justice.
The list goes on, and it relates only to northern Sudan. In the
southern part, our aid has enabled 2 million children to go through
primary school, provided 750,000 people with malaria prevention and
treatment, provided food security for 250,000 people, and given 470,000
people access to clean water and sanitation. Significant outcomes have
been achieved, thanks to UK taxpayers’
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618115000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#130618115000068">As
always, my hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) made
a very articulate speech. One of the key issues that he rightly raised
was the influence that China can have in encouraging better behaviour
on the part of the Sudanese Government, and we agree that it can play
an important role in encouraging the Governments of Sudan and South
Sudan to resolve their problems and build stability. We have regular
discussions with China about Sudan in Beijing and at the Security
Council in New York, as well as through our respective embassies in the
two countries. I welcome China’s clear statement last week that
Sudan should not shut down oil production, but should implement all
agreements on their merits.</hs_Para>

suggest that there had been “silence” in the House, but I
assure him that there has not been silence in Government Departments,
in the United Nations, or elsewhere in international multilateral
organisations in regard to the significant challenges faced by both
countries. He rightly mentioned the importance of business, and I can
give him a categorical assurance that DFID is working to improve the
business environment in northern Sudan. He may be interested to learn
that in the autumn an international investment conference will take
place in Juba, in South Sudan, with 
<?notus-xml column=861?>the aim of stimulating inward investment and sustainable job creation in
the area. He also rightly referred to the tension and the difficult
balance that sometimes exists between the regime in northern Sudan and
the wish to support the long-suffering
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618115000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#130618115000070">The

the United Nations missions. I was in New York 20 days ago, discussing
that very issue with key UN officials. We have supported a UN review of
the military and the civilian elements of the mission over the past
year. That has led to some reductions in the size of the mission,
intended to improve the focus on its core mandate, and we will continue
to work with the relevant UN department to improve the mission’s
performance on the ground. The hon. Gentleman spoke of the importance
of security support for South Sudan, and I can tell him that we are
working with the international community to assist the reform of
security services there. The cross-departmental conflict pool is
funding a major project to improve the leadership and accountability of
the southern Sudanese armed
forces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618115000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0003.htm#130618115000071">A
major challenge clearly faces the two countries in the context of their
bilateral relationships and their relationships with the regional and
broader international communities. There is a huge amount of work to be
done before Sudan and South Sudan can finally put this regrettable
chapter of their history behind them. I urge the two Governments, with
the support of the international community, to focus on ensuring that
any influence that they have over armed groups in each other’s
territories is used to positive rather than negative effect. We must
all co-operate, co-ordinate and provide assistance to ensure that the
nine-point plan that was detailed at the United Nations General
Assembly last September is implemented in full as quickly as possible,

and it does not seem to be delivering what it should. That may in part
be because we have not held it to account or followed through on the
financial commitment or on the parliamentary scrutiny to the extent
that we have elsewhere. Perhaps we need to shake up our own

me explain my case in more detail. The origins of section 444(6) of the
Education Act 1996 can be traced to section 39(3) of the Education Act
1944—the Butler Act—that remarkable creation of the
second world war. So any proposed change to that section would be a
change to the Butler Act provision which has endured for 79 years. The
reason for such a change may come from the consultation that the
Government launched last November—“Improving educational
outcomes for children of travelling families”—on whether
to repeal the current legislation that protects travelling parents from
being found guilty of school attendance offences in certain
circumstances.</hs_Para>

specifics of the showmen are worth noting. They are not an ethnic group
as the Romany Gypsies or, arguably, the Irish Travellers are, but a
cultural one, united by the fairground industry. They are a community
that put on in excess of 200 fairs weekly, many held in winter, too,
both here and abroad. They can trace their ancestry back to charters
and privileges granted as early as a fair held near the constituency of
my hon. Friend the Minister in King’s Lynn in 1204. Adjacent to
her constituency, the Norfolk fair, held every February since Tudor
times, marks the opening of the travelling season. The community will
mostly spend the next eight months on the
road.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618115000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/debtext/130618-0004.htm#130618115000099">The

which remote education can take place successfully. Currently, children
with travelling parents are registered with one school in the UK and
they keep their place when on the move. The school sets work, which is
completed on the road and sent back via a laptop with a mobile internet
connection, and the children rejoin the school on their return. This is
considered effective and efficient by both the parents and the schools
involved. Over recent years there has been a consistent rise in the
number of pupils taking GCSEs within the showmen community. These are

those pupils recorded as absent due to travelling who come from a Roma,
Irish Traveller or Gypsy background, only 8.2% achieve five GCSEs at

many local authorities choosing not to run Traveller education services
in the same way as they did previously. For some, that has meant the
disappearance of peripatetic teachers who would visit fairgrounds.

for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:26:18"></hs_TimeCode> raising this
matter and for his contribution to the discussion. He has highlighted
some important concerns. As a follow-up to today’s debate, I
suggest that he has a discussion with officials about some of the more
technical issues. I know that he has come up with various proposals,
including giving exemption to members of the Showmen’s Guild.
There would be issues with that, however, because not all showman
proprietors are necessarily members of the guild. There would also be
concerns about having exemptions for a particular group, and the
loopholes that that could create.</hs_Para>

this and whether we could make better use of modern technology. It
would be helpful to explore those questions with the officials from the
Department who are considering this matter. As I have said, I am not

thanking Mr Speaker, not only for allocating the time for the debate,

discuss later in my speech and for which I am very grateful; it has
made a huge difference. I am also very grateful to colleagues from all
political parties for coming along this morning. We have a good

valuable indeed.</hs_Para>

I am speaking on a topic that I am really passionate about: the
scandal—scandal is a strong word to use, but it is a
scandal—of long-term unpaid internships. Nobody in this House
would disagree that internships can be a valuable way for young people
to get their foot on the career ladder, be it in the world of politics,
journalism, public relations, the law, or fashion, or in any other kind
of occupation. That is more important than ever, given the current
economic climate, and given that more than 1 million young people are
unemployed. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T09:31:34"></hs_TimeCode>We
are not just talking about people who may have had a difficult
upbringing and struggled at school; university graduates and even
postgraduates are really struggling to find work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061867000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061867000008">Internships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T09:31:36"></hs_TimeCode>
offer a chance for a young person to demonstrate to an employer their
ability and suitability over a set period, usually at least three
months. Young people apply for an internship hoping that—if they
do well and like the company, and the company likes them—there
could be a permanent job for them at the end of the period. However, my
big problem with many of the internships currently on offer is that
they are unpaid.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061867000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061867000009">Recently
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T09:32:05"></hs_TimeCode>I have seen
figures that estimate that 92% of arts internships and 76% of
internships in the public relations industry are unpaid. Some might say
that is perfectly reasonable, given that there are no guarantees that
the intern will be suitable for the role in the long term. However, the
big problem is that the overwhelming majority of these roles are in
London, which is the most expensive city in the country for people to
live in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T09:32:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The
<I>London </I><I>Evening Standard</I> recently found that the average
rent in London was poised to break the £1,000-a-month barrier,
so three months working for free could cost an intern more than
£3,000, just for accommodation, and that is without other living
costs such as food and transport. Very few young people will have that
kind of money saved up to enable them just to get by while they 
<?notus-xml column=162?>are doing an unpaid internship. Only those who already live with family
in London or can call on the bank of mum and dad will be able to take
up unpaid internships; that discriminates against a huge proportion of
young people on the basis of geography and wealth.</hs_Para>

someone from a less well-off household anywhere outside London who may
have worked hard and scraped the money together, through loans, to get
a degree. They have real talent to offer and they are more than capable
of doing an internship in the industry that interests them—say,
fashion—but how on earth can they possibly afford to work for
free in our capital city? I spoke to one young woman recently who had
an internship—I think it was with Karl Lagerfeld—and she
worked for 12 hours a day, sewing sequins on couture gowns that
retailed for £5,000. I asked her what her terms and conditions
were. She did not receive a penny in payment. She said, “We very
often get pizza and occasionally we get shouted at,” so it was
not a very good environment at all.</hs_Para>

lessons to be learned from the history of the Bar? Initially, to get a

system was abolished and bursaries began to be introduced. Now there is
a requirement to ensure that a pupil—who has to work as a pupil

the hon. Gentleman has shown a real commitment. He makes an interesting
point about the law. I think that most of us would feel that the law
might be one of those professions that had not made as much social
progress as others. However, it is not just among barristers that there
has been progress: some of the big law firms in London are now very
conscious of the need to bring  in a wider pool of talent to
ensure that they are getting the very best people. As for
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T09:35:47"></hs_TimeCode>barristers’

Lady on bringing this matter to the House for consideration by us all,
and on the way she is introducing the debate. Does she feel that there
is perhaps a need to change the mindset of big business and others who
employ interns, to ensure that they give interns  a minimum
wage? Although internships are a good opportunity for young people to
gain experience, for many of them, unpaid working is a real financial
burden on them and their families. Is there a need for a sea change

that this issue is about behaviour change and changing the mindset. In

are making progress on this agenda. There are many companies now that,
for good business reasons, want to access a wide pool of talent. Also,
they feel that it is morally wrong to exploit young people
through unpaid internships. If we look at some of the big
consultancies, such as Ernst and Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and
Deloitte, and some of the big insurance companies, including AXA and
Aviva, or some big construction companies, such as CH2M HILL, they are
all now paying their interns. I congratulate them; they are leading the
way. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T09:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>Some of
this behaviour change is about naming and shaming the people who are

get behaviour change, led by good companies and firms, and good

is about young people’s journey all the way through, from

Sometimes in our education system, we might do well on academic

skills—team building and relationship building—impress
employers most and end up getting the job. My hon. Friend makes an
important point. That is why we need more mentors, role models and

out by telling me, “We think these things are acceptable”

Through a combination of attrition, tenacity, determination and,
sometimes, the fact that people just want us to shut up, we do start to
change attitudes. Most people actually want to do the right thing; the
issue is how we encourage them. It is a bit like the national minimum
wage. When the Labour Government brought it in, everybody said that it
would cost 1 million jobs and that people would not be able to sustain
their businesses. The people who did not pay the national minimum wage
undercut the good companies that did, and we have exactly the same
thing with interns: good companies are doing the right thing by bearing
the cost, while other companies, which are doing the wrong thing by not
paying young people for their work, are getting a financial competitive
advantage. We went on a journey with the national minimum wage; we are
now on another journey, and I hope many more people will join

is difficult enough, but it must be virtually impossible for someone
with caring responsibilities to get a foot on the ladder. At a time
when so many young people are unemployed, we should be giving them
stepping-stones to success, rather than putting further barriers in
their way. It is a hackneyed phrase, but we need a level playing field
so that people are not discriminated against on the grounds of wealth,
class, background or caring responsibilities; they have as much right
to do well as those in different circumstances. The fact that someone
has privilege or wealth should not give them an unfair advantage, and
many of us on both sides of the House came into politics because we
believed in a different kind of society. This issue is an opportunity

Field:</Member></B> The right hon. Lady rightly said that many
companies increasingly want to do the right thing, although it is
perhaps fair to say that it is easier for a company employing 250
people to do the right thing. My slight concern—I do not wish to
indulge in special pleading—is that, in the creative industries,
such as fashion, which the right hon. Lady mentioned, and some of the
smaller media industries, it is almost part of 
<?notus-xml column=169?>the economic model to have a whole lot of interns coming into play. I am
in no way trying to defend that behaviour, but if we are to move
forward, particularly with legislation and regulation along the lines
the right hon. Lady would propose, we need to make the case more
strongly to such companies than, perhaps, to City-type firms, which
very much buy into this  agenda. Has she any thoughts about how
we can make that point to companies and, essentially, tell them,

Friend agree that we could learn from the voluntary sector, which I
came from, where a clear distinction is made between business-critical
work and value-added work in understanding what it is appropriate to
ask a young person to do as part of a work experience placement, for
example, and what it is appropriate to pay somebody for. Indeed, young
people should at least be given the national minimum wage, and
employers in the public and private sectors not doing that should be
held to
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T09:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Blears:</Member></B> I could not agree more. That is one of the issues
that goes to the heart of the matter. Is a company employing somebody
who should be doing a job with set hours, set responsibilities and set
tasks? If so, that person is a worker, and entitled to the national
minimum wage under the law. Someone who is a volunteer is to a great
extent entitled to come and go as they please. They give their labour
because they believe in a cause. They may get excellent work
experience, and many voluntary sector organisations do the right thing.
We need a bit more clarity—and this is something I want to ask
the Minister about—on the distinction between a worker and a
volunteer. However, companies, and some voluntary organisations,
although not the majority, have designed an unsustainable business
model. The situation is the same as with the national minimum wage:
people had a business model that depended on paying people £1 or
£1.50 to do a job. A business that cannot run without exploiting
people is not being run in the right way. People need to change the
model they work on. If good companies can do it and make a profit,
everyone else should take up that
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:00:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061867000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061867000061"><Member ContinuationText="Nic Dakin" PimsId="5672" UID="13061867000167" xid="1143" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061867000167"><B>Nic

Blears:</Member></B> Absolutely. I have been trying to think hard about
the distinction, because I am an advocate of work experience. There are
many people in my constituency who perhaps have not worked since
leaving school. Perhaps their parents did not work, and in some cases
their grandparents did not. They know nothing about the world of work,
so work experience, for which they must get up and have discipline,
behave themselves and work in a grown-up fashion, is essential to their
personal progress. The issue is when a work experience placement
becomes a long-term job. That is the point at which exploitation
begins<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:01:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

after someone has worked in a position  for eight weeks, they
automatically become entitled to the national
minimum wage. We could consider such  a period. We need to get
the distinction right. In my constituency I run something called Kids
without Connections. Fifty local employers give four weeks’ work
experience to youngsters who have never done any work. They get a
record of achievement and a reference. They all come to Parliament. It
is the first time they have ever been to London. We make a difference
to some of those young people. Half of them have been taken on in
full-time jobs. That would never have happened without a work
experience placement, so that employers could see what they could do. I
am a total fan of work experience, but in some cases it crosses the
line and becomes exploitation, through clever titling of an unpaid

increasingly worried about the transmission belt—people working
in a Minister’s office, becoming a special adviser, getting a
safe seat and within three weeks of the election becoming a Cabinet

Everyone said “Are you having a go at me, Hazel?” I said,
“Certainly not.” Eventually I looked round the table and
said, “I think, ladies and gentlemen, you’ve made my
point.” That situation was the very reason that when I came back
to Parliament I set up the Speaker’s parliamentary placement
scheme, for people from working-class backgrounds. In a democracy there
is a need for people who can bring different life experiences to the
table. No commercial company would want every one of its directors to
be from the same background. Increasingly, the business case for

found amazing, which was that seven out of 10 people get their next job
from someone they know; only one or two get it from the jobcentre.
Whether someone wants to be a plasterer or a joiner, it is about having
wider connections and knowing some people. We are trying to give people
the incentive and ability to make connections. It is far less likely
that someone from a poorer background will know a lawyer or doctor or

businesses in London, from the Royal Opera House to the National
Portrait Gallery and others, used the future jobs fund to establish a
paid internship—they called the interns apprentices, although
they were not full apprentices—sharing the learning between
those different companies. They brought those young people in from the

jobs fair for others like them, to look at how they could get into

characteristic optimism and belief in the future, which is what the
debate is all about—a belief that young people’s talent
and skills can make a difference. Often, particularly in the creative
industries, people take a different slant on life because they have not
come from a traditional background; and then the best music and drama
happen. The role of the arts is to challenge people’s
perceptions; so why not have young people in there, who are the best at
challenging many of us whose views have become perhaps a little
established? My hon.

statistics but a few bits of evidence, now that we have heard about the
principles of the debate. A couple of surveys have been carried out
recently. One was for the European Youth Forum, and it painted a pretty
depressing picture, in which just over half of all the interns surveyed
had been paid at all; 41% of those who received some money found that
their remuneration was insufficient to cover day-to-day living
expenses; and in total a quarter were able to make ends meet. Nearly
two thirds relied on financial support from their
parents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:09:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061867000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061867000078">In
another poll conducted by Survation for Unions21, 84% of people over 35
said that a young person in their family could not afford to do an
unpaid internship in London. That is a massive exclusion barrier.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>The culture of
unpaid internships is now so widespread that many young people no

Alan Milburn reported in March 2012 that more than 30% of newly hired

rising to 50% in some sectors, so unless someone has their foot in the

is interesting to see the controversy that has recently surrounded the

was a story about him employing his two daughters. He said that his
daughters had worked in other industries, that they had shown their
worth and that they could therefore make a great contribution to his
company, but the eruption of that furore shows how such things go to
the heart of people’s sense of unfairness. People will always
want to help their children because that is a natural instinct, but I
ask employers and business people such as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:11:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cities of London and Westminster to think twice; excluding people
who deserve a chance will damage their business because they are not
accessing the talent pool. I hope that in his new position Mr Caan will
be able, from his own personal experience, to be a good advocate and
ambassador for opening the field to people beyond family members,
thereby ensuring that the wider field of talent is drawn in. I hope to

are compelling practical reasons for having paid internships. I remind
people that long-term unpaid internships are against the law. Sometimes
we get away from that point. Anyone doing a job that involves set hours
and set responsibilities is a worker and is entitled to the national
minimum wage—I do not know how many times I have to say
that—and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has a
responsibility to make that crystal clear, which I know the Minister is
pushing. Many businesses that I meet are genuinely confused: they do
not know what the rules are and they would welcome some certainty about
the difference between volunteers and workers and about who is entitled
to the national minimum wage. I know the Minister is hoping to issue
some guidance, which will be incredibly helpful. HMRC is doing more

has stepped up its game. We have recently had information that, during
the past year, HMRC has ordered nine firms to pay a total of
£200,000 to people who had worked for them as unpaid interns.
Over the past year, more than 26,000 workers have been paid back a
total of £4 million after action by HMRC on breaches of national
minimum wage laws and some of the nearly 1,700 complaints relating to
unpaid internships. We are seeing a bit of a step change, but I would
like to see HMRC, rather than responding to complaints, take a more
proactive stance so that when it sees adverts that it thinks cross the
line between volunteering and unpaid internships it proactively
investigates those companies, rather than simply waiting for
complaints. It is very difficult, almost impossible, for young people
to make a complaint when they are perhaps hoping to get a full-time job
with the company with which they are interning.

find time to amend the national minimum wage legislation—
perhaps through secondary legislation, as I know how difficult it is to

Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears) talked about redemption.
Being a bad Catholic, one can deal with that, I hope. I join everybody
else in congratulating her on her success and drive with the
Speaker’s scheme and the wider issue of internships. I declare
an interest: when I went to university in the 1970s, I do not think
that there were internships. Because there were so few graduates, we
just went into the market. I did not know anything about
internships.</hs_Para>

that the right hon. Lady and others quoted seem to show that
internships work. An article the other week said that university
graduates on an internship scheme or some other kind of work are three
times more likely to get a job, and that 61% of graduates in
internships tend to get a job in that company or profession. Whatever
the system is—we have imported the word from the United
States—it appears to work. We must then ask what various hon.
Members have asked: how do people get into the internship
game?</hs_Para>

declare another interest. I was a teacher for 37 years,
including in social priority schools. In other schools, the drive was
to give people confidence and push the talented ones to get somewhere.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:25:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) hinted at my experience
of teaching in Leytonstone, where students could see the towers of the
City of London, but, because of their background and
circumstances, never dreamed that they could enter it. As she said, if
there were an internship system, their families could never have
afforded to say, “You can take six months,” or however
long, while keeping them at home.</hs_Para>

never dream of taking an internship in London—the great capital,
the centre of most of the great professions and
businesses—because, as everybody has commented, accommodation
costs alone would wipe out their money, let alone the costs of feeding
oneself and so on. It is just not possible. Arriving here as a new
Member of Parliament, I saw how many people were in the system and
knowledgeable about  it, because their families were
knowledgeable about it and could support them through it, and I began
to  ask questions.</hs_Para>

dropped when I saw an article in the <I>London </I><I>Evening Standard
</I>in 2010 about an auction of internships in the creative industry,
including in top fashion companies—at a charity event, to be
fair—for £10,000 or £15,000. I thought,
“Out of the people I represent and the people I used to teach,
who could ever afford to get into this game, even at the smallest
level?” There was something wrong. In Parliament, which is
supposed to set an example, although I know it sometimes fails to do
so, the same system operated.</hs_Para>

week that I read that article, I listened, as all politicians do, to
the “Today” programme. Suddenly, there was Baroness
Morris of Yardley—Estelle Morris as was—chatting away
with the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:27:15"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Member for Salford and Eccles about the issue. Then I wandered
into Parliament, and who was walking down the corridor but the right
hon. Lady? The last time she and I had spoken was during a heated
debate on television, when I was the Conservative opposing her and we
had done the usual political thing. The fact is that across parties, we
shared a common view that something was
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061868000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061868000007">People
have rightly talked about equity—that is the passion behind the
issue—but, as other hon. Members have said, it is also about the
talent that we are losing through the system. This is a competitive
world, a global race and all the rest of it. That talent is unable even
to take a first step. Part of that first step—as everybody has
said, it is also about money—is knowing that the system exists.
We need to get that right. Being a Conservative, I do not want too much
regulation, but we need to make the terms understood and to advertise
them across the system.</hs_Para>

the students and pupils whom I taught in the east end of London, most
of them would not know about internships unless teachers introduced the
idea, and most teachers came from my generation and did not know what
internships were. How were the students ever to learn that that system
operates in most top businesses and professions as an add-on to
graduation and a way of getting in? They lacked the knowledge even to
start. It is a double issue.</hs_Para>

restrictions. We must consider the definitions of internships and work
experience. I am pleased that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
is now working on that, but we must also sort out how we can advertise
in schools and universities, so that everybody with talent can see that
they need to use that system to maximise their talents and
contributions. There is a knowledge and advertising agenda. I also
liked the right hon. Lady’s compliments to the Social Mobility
Foundation, which has done a lot of work on the issue and is doing much
with the Government agenda to get the system

do we advertise the subject of internships?
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:29:46"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Lady is proposing that Parliament sets an example, which would itself
be a big advertisement: there is a thing called internships and,
whatever a person’s background, they have a chance of getting in
on this system. That is really important. As she said, paid internships
are spreading through the House; I do not know the numbers or whether
this figure is correct, but I saw the other day that 40% of internships
are still not paid, which is enormous, and that unpaid system is still
going on. If we have internships, we have to get right how they are
termed in the House, even though that is a small-scale thing.</hs_Para>

give someone a chance and to pay someone from Lancaster university to
do a month in Parliament. I pay the minimum wage and all the rest of
it. I have a rolling programme, so the interns appear to the
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority as paid employees. Anyone
who looks at my numbers thinks I am a bad manager, because I have a
huge turnover of people, in particular in summer and autumn, but they
are paid internships. We need to get the House regulations right for
what Members of Parliament are trying to do, so that no one can
construe things. I might be a bad manager, I do not know—ask the
staff who work for me—but at the moment it looks as if I have a

is important for the Minister to get in, but I shall emphasise my main
points: first, the equity issue; secondly, the loss of talent
throughout the country because people are not entering internships;
and, thirdly, when we begin to get this right and finally set an
example in Parliament, we need to advertise what is going on throughout
business and the professions. Internships are not some odd thing, but
are part and parcel of business and professional life. Every student in

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:32:22"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears) has done on the
subject of internships. I feel equally passionately about it, as a
former youth worker and as a former intern. I had an internship at the
Fabian Society in 1995—if anyone present, perhaps my right hon.
Friend, was getting the society’s mailings at the time, that was
me, with my blood from the paper cuts. I clearly learned a lot in the
year I was there, but it was different, and we need to understand how
the culture has now changed. That was back in history—the shadow
Minister is looking at me, so I shall say back in 1995—but
things have changed substantially since then.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:33:24"></hs_TimeCode> a youth
worker, I was horrified by the stories that young people told me about
the requirement to work full time for six or seven months or more
without pay, perhaps with occasional expenses. They did not see
anything wrong with the system, because everyone had to do it. That is
what we have to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:33:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061868000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061868000016">My
internship was pre-national minimum wage. The widespread abuse of young
people who want to get a step on the ladder is bad not only for them,
but for employers, because the badge of having done an internship is
being devalued as a result of the changes. It is no longer as clear to
employers as it should be that people  
<?notus-xml column=180?>who have done an internship have had a training opportunity to learn and
develop their skill set, so that they are worth talking to—an
internship used to be a badge of quality.</hs_Para>

question is how to get the best and to avoid the worst in such a
scenario. I have worked in the voluntary sector, so I see some simple
rules that we can learn from; it is not rocket science to fix the
problems. I made an intervention about the difference between
business-critical and value-added experiences; the issue is not only
about whether people are being paid, but whether, when they do an
internship, they are learning skills and developing themselves as an
individual, so that they are someone who a future employer will look at
and think, “Actually, that is someone who I want to have in my
work
force<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:34:12"></hs_TimeCode>.”
The voluntary sector is clear about what a volunteer can do and,
frankly, businesses should learn from that. For a key,
business-critical role in their industry, they should not be relying on
someone who has not had the requisite training and who might not be
able to take the pressures or deal with the possible demands. Offering
people opportunities through value-added experiences,
however —to learn about what we do, complement what we
do and see what else is happening in the industry—is a very
positive thing to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:34:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061868000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061868000018">Today,
therefore, I want to add to the debate how we get our own house in
order. Having had experience in the voluntary sector and the community,
as well as my personal experience, I am extremely concerned. Seeing how
things operate in Parliament, I am frightened that some of the progress
made in recent years is being put at risk by some of the decisions of
our mutual friend, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority.
Hon. Members have already discussed our concern that some MPs are
advertising unpaid internships—as many as 260 MPs, according to
some suggestions—but 183 MPs are definitely using the
voluntary internship agreement. I looked into the issue and talked to
IPSA about it, but I have real concerns, because a number of Members of
Parliament and I have applied for additional support; there has been an
increase in casework, the business-critical work that I need to do as
an MP for a community facing a lot of pressures, because of the changes
in policy in recent
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:35:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

is not to deal with the shortfall in funding for MPs or with the
increased pressures faced by them. A member of staff at IPSA even
suggested that I might make up the shortfall by using unpaid
internships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:35:58"></hs_TimeCode>. If
we acknowledge the increasing pressure on MPs’ offices, we must
recognise the resulting temptation for Members to deal with the
consequences. I myself had to make some difficult decisions about what
correspondence and activities I cannot undertake, because I do not have
the staffing complement to deal with them. Having been an intern and
feeling so strongly on the matter, I will not use unpaid interns, and I

for MPs’ staffing costs—there is a £7
million underspend in the system every single year. IPSA tells me that
the money is not carried forward, but simply returned to the Treasury.
I encourage the Minister to have some serious conversations about
whether, given the commitment to fund the positions and that MPs are
saying, “We need that support, we want to offer those training
opportunities”, IPSA could look at the possibility of feeding
the money into schemes such as the one put in place by

Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles. I also encourage the Minister
to seek urgently the legal advice given to IPSA about 
MPs’ voluntary arrangements, to ensure that no MP  is
inadvertently breaking the national minimum wage legislation and that
there is clarity about what we  can ask someone to do. MPs
should be advised about internships and about value-added versus
business-critical
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061868000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061868000023">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:38:14"></hs_TimeCode>

university placement. We must be clear that we can tackle the problems
and get our house in order in a number of different ways. They are not
difficult or impossible to do; it would be good for Parliament to do
them. We should open ourselves up to get quality staff, who will then
have a badge of pride—the young people will have had an
internship in an MP’s office and been paid, so their ability to
live  in our capital city would not have been at risk, and they
will learnt the requisite skills. Anyone who has had to deal with and
train young people knows that someone who does not have a good skill
set and who has not had good training is twice as much work for an
employer as someone who does come with
experience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061868000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061868000024">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:38:59"></hs_TimeCode>

my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears),
who has done so much in this House and in the country to highlight the
plight of unpaid interns and issues relating to the world of work for
young people.  
<?notus-xml column=182?>I thoroughly enjoyed her speech, and the passion with which she
delivered it is unsurpassed in the House. It was a delight to hear what
she had to
say.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000003">For
some time, unpaid internships have been thought to be necessary for any
young person who wants to fulfil their career goals, but they divide
our young people into those who can afford them and those who cannot. I
want to look at the scale of the problem. One poll has shown that two
in five people aged between 18 and 24 believe that not doing
an unpaid internship acts or has acted as a major barrier to them
getting a job. Another survey showed that 40% of people who thought
about applying for an internship reconsidered because they could not
work for free, and 39% of people offered an internship had to turn it
down for financial reasons. That highlights the problems with unpaid
internships and what they do for young people’s aspirations and
hopes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061869000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000004">Unpaid
internships are rife in some industries. It was right to have
highlighted some of the positives, particularly in the creative
industries and others, but in those industries, young people are so
desperate to start their career and get on the ladder that they often
feel they have no other choice than an unpaid internship. The cycle is
dismal: if someone wants to work in the fashion industry, for example,
they must have experience before applying, and the only way to get that
experience is to work in the industry for nothing. Even getting their
foot on to that first rung of unpaid employment is not easy, and it may
be more about who they know than what they know. Those are the key
issues in this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000005">In
his role as the Government’s adviser on social mobility, Alan
Milburn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:41:17"></hs_TimeCode> reported
last year that more than 30% of newly hired graduates had previously
interned for their employer, and that rose to 50% in some sectors. That
might be seen as a positive, in that some young people’s
experience of an internship has taken them on to employment. The key to
the problem is that when they are at university or leaving school,
young people see that the only way of fulfilling their dreams and
talents, and pursuing their desired career, is by taking an unpaid
internship. That is where the cycle started, and it continues. I hope
that this debate and my right hon. Friend’s work will stop that
cycle in its
tracks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000006">My

Interns 
<?notus-xml column=183?>Anonymous and Internocracy, as well as the National Union of Students,

remiss of me not to recognise that this is a cross-party issue that has
received support across parties, but conversely, some people have
undermined the campaign by their actions in the House. I may go into
more detail later. It is worth celebrating businesses that do well, and
I was delighted hear from my right hon. Friend that Monster and other

of the problem with where we are on the issue has to do with the
rewards and success that people can get from paid internships. These
programmes give young people a fantastic experience. All we are looking
for in taking this forward responsibly is for interns to be paid
properly for a day’s work. People providing unpaid internships
exploit a loophole. I want to put on record the contribution of Kezia
Dugdale, MSP for Lothian—I represent part of her constituency
here—who offers paid internships at the living wage for
three-month periods every three months. During her five-year term of
office, she will have offered that opportunity to dozens of young
people. Not only does she pay them the living wage, but she puts
together a proper programme, which is another issue. If someone told me
they would give me £10 if I could define
“internship”, I am not sure that I could. However, one
definition might be that it is properly paid with a proper programme of
work allowing the intern to gain a tangible
benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000011">It
is important to recognise that people give up their time to volunteer
without payment. Many charities and organisations that we rely on in
our constituencies would find it difficult to operate without
volunteers, but that is a completely separate issue, and goes to the
heart of why we need proper definitions of “intern”,
“volunteer”, “worker” and
“employee”. The difference between
“employee” and “worker” is difficult legal
territory, which is where some of the big issues come into
play.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000012">I

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:46:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles said, under the national
minimum wage regulations it is against the law to have someone working
set hours and doing set tasks without being paid. There is an explicit

internships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000013">It
is worth reflecting on the Government’s slightly schizophrenic
approach to the national minimum wage. Once upon a time, the idea of a
minimum guaranteed wage for people in the UK was pie in the sky and
highly controversial. Now, in light of its impact on family life, the
economy and indeed this place, there seems to be consensus that the
national minimum wage is an integral part of work and the UK economy,
and it has cross- party support. However, without the previous
Labour 
<?notus-xml column=184?>Government, there would be no national minimum wage, and that is one of
our proudest achievements. If anyone asks what the previous Labour
Government’s proudest achievement is, the national minimum wage
would be at the top. When it was introduced, it helped to raise pay for
more than 2 million people, and some 50,000 low-paid teenagers received
a boost in income when the minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds was
introduced in
2004.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000014">Crucially,
in 1997 the policy was opposed when the Labour Government were taking
the National Minimum Wage Bill through the House, and it is strange
that there are still calls from Conservative Back Benchers to scrap it.
I hope that the Minister will give a cast-iron guarantee that it is not
only here to stay, but is the foundation of the bottom end of our
economy, building on what is achieved in the economy. In 2010, many
Conservative Back Benchers signed a private Member’s Bill to
scrap the minimum wage and to undermine it for younger people. That
emphasises the whole issue of unpaid interns, and it would be even
worse if the national minimum wage regulations could not be used to
highlight this important
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000015">Intern
Aware has complained about several companies that have exploited
loopholes in the national minimum wage legislation, and has reported

she also update the House on the 100 companies she reported for not
paying the national minimum wage, and on what stage enforcement has
reached? Will she also explain how many enforcement actions have been
taken by HMRC on the national minimum wage over the last year, how many
resulted in criminal prosecutions against companies, and how many
companies were fined for breaking the

have concentrated on the national minimum wage; at the crux of dealing
with the issue of unpaid internships is enforcing the system and the
regulations that are in place. It is against the law to advertise for
something that breaches regulations, but people are still advertising
unpaid internships in newspapers and online, and if we cannot enforce
the rules that are in place to deal with that, we will end up in a very

Member for Edinburgh South directly, the minimum wage is absolutely
here to stay. It is a fundamental part of the protections that are
important for employees in our society, and that is generally well
accepted right across the House. That harks back to 1997, when I was

they are a worker. Each instance depends on the facts of the case, but
that is clearly set out, both for employees and volunteers, and for

issue is that there are some exemptions; if an internship is part of a

the point about advertising, which relates to definitions, I understand
the sentiment behind saying that all such adverts should be banned. I

about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:56:13"></hs_TimeCode> whether
the Serious Organised Crime Agency would like to get involved. I am not
sure whether it would, but one difficulty is that the adverts are not
always clear about whether the person will be doing the role on a
voluntary basis or as a worker; indeed, they may be on a higher
education course and doing the role as part of a placement in between
years, so they could be exempt. Therefore, an outright ban may be a
blunt instrument, but if people think that an advert is for an illegal
role, I encourage them to report it to the pay and work rights
helpline.</hs_Para>

welcome the meeting that we had to discuss the issue earlier in the
year, because despite the fact that an outright ban might be a blunt
instrument, more can and should be done. We and HMRC have commissioned
work to identify the adverts that have the greatest risk of offering
opportunities that breach the law. That online research is being done,
and the 100 employers that seem to be at the greatest risk of offering
such opportunities will be written to, to advise them of the national
minimum wage legislation that applies, and that they may be breaking
the law. That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T10:57:30"></hs_TimeCode> is
an important step forward. I am keen to ensure that we analyse the
success of that, and see how that perhaps changes behaviour. If we can
encourage businesses and employers to recognise not only the risk that
they may be running, but the moral case, which has been discussed
today, that 
<?notus-xml column=187?>is a good route to pursue. It is important, however, to keep that under

will investigate and it will then be in a position to take action. It
is also important to recognise that HMRC can also respect
confidentiality, so the fears that some might have about coming forward

rehabilitating prisoners in their care. Under the leadership of the
prison director, Janet Wallsgrove, Corin Morgan-Armstrong and his team
of staff and volunteers, along with numerous local organisations, have
led the way in rehabilitative work. The team are very special, and
their contribution deserves special recognition and wider

Walls is part of a wider network of support that Parc Supporting
Families undertakes to make rehabilitation a central part of its work
with prisoners. Underpinning that is a belief that a prisoner’s
life does not stop once they are inside and that punishment should not
apply to their family and especially not to their children. The payback
for society from Invisible Walls comes from the fact that, for some
prisoners, maintaining the family link is vital to successful
rehabilitation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:02:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000039">As
is always said in presentations about Invisible Walls, why bother? Why
bother helping a prisoner to stay in contact with his family and

offenders is expensive. Reoffending costs anything between £9.5
billion and £13 billion a year. Those affected by
crime—the victims and their families and the families of
offenders—bear a cost that has a huge and lasting effect. Some
200,000 children in England and Wales have a parent in prison. That is
two and a half times the number of children in care and six times the
number of children on the child protection register. More children are
affected by imprisonment than by divorce. The children of offenders are
more likely to offend themselves. Six out of 10 boys with a convicted
parent end up in custody themselves. The children of offenders are

Walls has three principal aims: to reduce the risk of reoffending and a

I have said,
Parc<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:11:43"></hs_TimeCode> is a local

possible. I understand that the Ministry of Justice is working towards
more prisoners serving the last six months of their sentence closer to
their home area. If that period could be extended a little, there would

Walls has generated new ideas, and there is a constant desire to
improve and learn from the programme. One such idea is to build links
between the prison and schools, specifically to support children whose
fathers are in prison. Children of offenders experience a range of
negative emotions, and are often vulnerable to being bullied and to
becoming bullies, so they have an increased risk of exclusion from
school. They may have experienced the trauma of witnessing an arrest,
and they have felt the impact of being cared for by one
parent.</hs_Para>

a link between a school and the prison can help to counteract that
trauma and to prevent problems from developing that might lead to the
child ending up in the criminal justice system. The idea is very
simple: the school signs an Invisible Walls accord, meaning that, when
a parent is in prison, the head teacher identifies a single point of
contact who is responsible for offering advice and guidance to children
and primary carers confidentially. The person identified will almost
certainly be the current child protection officer in the school, who
already has the necessary training to fulfil the new role, while the
prison would provide training, access to support online and an
electronic
library.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000054">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:14:40"></hs_TimeCode>

children at risk of becoming the next generation of offenders. I hope
that the Minister will talk to the Department for Education and obtain
its support. For the scheme to be established, it needs to be approved,
so will the Minister personally give it his seal of approval? Will he
undertake to talk to the Department for Education, so that the scheme
can be rolled out to prisons across England? The cost is negligible,
because the scheme builds on things and people already in place. It
would make a difference to children and their families and, indeed, to
schools and to the potential for education, because many people in
prison have low levels of educational
achievement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000055">Only
if we think for the longer term and use projects proven to work will we
bring down reoffending and steer the next generation away from prison.
I appreciate that Invisible Walls is not a project for everyone, but it
gives us the possibility of finding prisoners with whom such work could
be undertaken and of making a huge difference to future reoffending. I
look forward to the Minister’s
response.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/7439FEFF14AF9193D4586790585AA7772600FF25" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 June 2013">Tuesday

hon. Lady and I will be glad, as I am sure you are, Mr Caton, that
crime has been coming down for some time. The overall level of crime
recorded by the police decreased by 8% in the year ending December
2012, compared with the previous year. Such figures are encouraging,
but they are not grounds for complacency. We can do much more to
reinforce the downward trend, so that people can feel safe wherever

the hon. Lady pointed out,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:17:10"></hs_TimeCode> key is to
tackle reoffending by taking bold and effective steps to rehabilitate
offenders—assisting, encouraging and guiding them away from
crime into new, worthwhile and productive ways of life. That is
precisely the intention of the Invisible Walls project at HMP Parc. It
is worth saying that that matters because reoffending has been too high
for far 
<?notus-xml column=192?>too long. Almost half of all offenders released from prison offend again
within 12 months, and those with the very highest reoffending rates are
prisoners with custodial sentences of less than 12 months. A staggering
58.2% of those released in the year to June 2011 reoffended within 12
months. The current system simply does not address the problem in the
way we want, and many prolific offenders, with a host of complex
problems, are released on to the streets with £46 in their
pockets and little else, so
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:18:09"></hs_TimeCode> case for a
new approach is
clear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000059">We
spend more than £3 billion a year on prisons, and almost
£1 billion annually on delivering sentences in the community.
Despite that investment, overall reoffending rates have barely changed
over the past decade. The same faces come back through the system time
and again, because most crime is committed by that relatively small
number of prolific offenders. If we enabled them to turn away from
crime, we could make a real difference.</hs_Para>

the hon. Lady will be aware, on 9 May we set out our plans in
“Transforming Rehabilitation: A Strategy for Reform”,
which took account of the comments received in response to the
consultation paper that was published in February. The document sets
out that, for the first time in recent history, every offender released
from custody will receive statutory supervision and rehabilitation in
the community. We are legislating to extend statutory supervision and
rehabilitation to all 50,000 of the most prolific group of
offenders—those sentenced to less than 12 months in
custody.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000061">The
market will be opened up to a diverse range of new rehabilitation
providers, so that we get the best out of the public, voluntary and
private sectors, at local as well as national level. We will also
introduce payment incentives for market providers to focus relentlessly
on reforming offenders, giving those providers the flexibility to do
what works, along with freedom from bureaucracy, but paying them in
full only for genuine reductions in reoffending.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:19:52"></hs_TimeCode> will create a
new public sector national probation service, working to protect the
public, and building upon the expertise and professionalism that are
already in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000062">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:20:03"></hs_TimeCode>
particular importance, and of particular relevance to what we are
discussing, is that we are putting in place an unprecedented nationwide
through-the-gate resettlement service, which means that most offenders
are given continuous support by one provider, from custody into the
community. We will support the service by ensuring that most offenders
are held, for at least three months before release, in prisons
designated to their area. The hon. Lady asked me to consider how we
might extend that period. It would, of course, be desirable to have the
longest possible period of stability during a sentence, and she will be
reassured to know that we hope that many people, particularly those
sentenced to periods of 12 months or shorter, will be able to spend the
entirety of their sentence in a local prison, which will enable
precisely the sort of work we are talking about to go on with
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000063">The
hon. Lady described how the Invisible Walls project seeks to help
prisoners at Parc to avoid reoffending, and it also addresses the
genuine risk that those prisoners’ children may themselves be
drawn into crime. She rightly highlights what I think we all agree is a
shocking statistic: six out of 10 boys with a convicted parent end up
in custody themselves. The
project<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:21:15"></hs_TimeCode> involves
an extensive  
<?notus-xml column=193?>programme of support to assist offenders to repair, develop and maintain
healthy relationships while in custody, and the support continues after
release. Prisoners who may be eligible to receive support are those who
have no restrictions on contact with their children, and who will be
resettling with their families in south Wales when they leave custody.
That gives rise to the point about
continuity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000064">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:21:39"></hs_TimeCode>
has often been observed—not least this morning—prisoners
frequently have a wide range of complex interrelated problems that need
to be addressed as part of a rehabilitation programme, and Invisible
Walls helps offenders to find accommodation, employment, training,
education and volunteering opportunities. As the hon. Lady says, the
programme promotes physical and mental health—by addressing
substance misuse for example—helps offenders to manage their
finances, and manages offenders’ attitudes, thinking and
behaviour, to give them the motivation to begin
afresh.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000065">The
main focus of the project is on reducing reoffending and preventing
prisoners’ children from turning to a life of crime by
strengthening family ties. Research has shown that ensuring that a
prisoner keeps in contact with his or her family while in prison has a
direct effect in reducing the likelihood of reoffending. Some 7% of
children in the UK will experience having a parent in prison before
they leave school, and research shows that positive and regular contact
with the imprisoned parent significantly improves a child’s
outcomes, not only in school and at home but in later
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000066">An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:27:34"></hs_TimeCode>
interesting aspect of what goes on at Parc is that prisoners are
assigned a family integration mentor—FIM—who, as the hon.
Lady knows, supports them and their family during the custodial period,
and through the gate, into the community. The FIM links with other
mentors, who help the offender and the family to address problems.
Where we can arrange it, the support begins 12 months before an
offender is released from prison and, crucially, continues during their
first six months in the community. It therefore reflects very much what
we have in mind for the system in the future, not just at Parc but
elsewhere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000067">HMP
Parc is operated by G4S, which set up the project in 2009 and, as the
hon. Lady said, a number of outside agencies are now involved as well.
She also referred to the invitation from Invisible Walls

schools in the Bridgend area to work with them to offer discrete and
sensitive support to children with a parent in the prison, and she
asked me to ensure that the Ministry of Justice has regular contact
with the Department for Education. As she would expect, we have regular
conversations about all the issues, and I will ensure that that project
features in them, so that everyone, on both sides, is fully
informed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000068">Part<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:24:07"></hs_TimeCode>
of the thinking behind the project is the need  to move away
from an inward-facing prison culture to  an outward-facing
approach, with strong partnership relationships with outside agencies,
and that is precisely what our through-the-gate reforms are designed to
achieve.  
<?notus-xml column=194?>What we can see going on in Invisible Walls is a good indication of the
sorts of things that can work well elsewhere in the country

Walls received additional funding from the Big Lottery Fund in 2012 to
expand the scheme from its original design, and that is an example of
the sort of creative thinking we need if we are to make the big
difference to reoffending that I spoke about earlier. The hon. Lady was
right to point out that formal assessment of the project will not be
complete until 2015, and we will carefully consider that assessment
when it is available, but I hope that she can take it from what I have
said today that we do not intend to wait for 2015 to see a number of
elements of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:24:03"></hs_TimeCode> the

opening up probation to a wider range of providers, we can bring
additional skills and ideas into play, and the national probation
service will retain its key role in managing risk, including the direct
management of higher-risk offenders. The reorganisation of probation,
and the creation of 21 new contract package areas, has presented us
with an opportunity to consider release alignment. That is very much
along the lines of what the hon. Lady was describing, regarding the
continuity of approach that we all wish to see. It has long been
recognised that closeness to home is an important factor in an
offender’s resettlement process, and our reforms will strengthen
existing rehabilitation services by drawing on the best the market has
to offer and combining that with access to offenders at the start of
their time in custody, and again before release. It might not be
possible for certain longer-sentenced prisoners to stay in a local
prison for the entire duration of their sentence because of needs
attached to their sentence that can only be met elsewhere, but we
intend that they be returned to a local prison for the few months
leading up to their
release.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061869000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061869000071">Currently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T11:26:25"></hs_TimeCode>,

entire sentence in a resettlement prison designated to their area. That

the chance this morning to discuss the work of Invisible Walls and the

will scrapping the statutory requirement to advertise alcohol licence
applications in our local newspapers help ensure that those who sell
alcohol are right and proper people to do so? How will loosening the
current regulations ensure that we clamp down on the sale of alcohol to
minors? How can the community find out about new licensed premises in
their area or, even more importantly, applications for longer licensing

argued that the proposal would save taxpayers’ money. Fewer
people will object to the proposed nightclub because they will not know
it is proposed, which will save councils’ time. However, that is
a rather cynical view, and not what the Government are aiming for.

Home Office’s impact assessment focuses on the small cost
savings to the alcohol industry that might be achieved by scrapping the
requirement. That assessment puts the cost of a relevant advertisement
in a local paper at £450 plus VAT. It is worth pointing out,
though, that the figure is disputed by the newspaper industry, which
says that the cost is much lower than that. As someone who has had an
off-licence and a restaurant in the past, I can say that I would never
have paid £450 plus VAT for an advert in my local newspaper.
However, even if that is the cost, it is not a huge burden to a small

the current requirements, any premises looking to be granted an initial

has already been said clearly and compellingly, the purpose of the
requirements is to inform a community about licence applications to
enable local people to have a say. It is important to remember that the
Licensing Act 2003 gives the local community extensive grounds to
object to a licence. There are four explicit grounds for objection: the
prevention of crime and disorder, issues of public safety, the
prevention of nuisance and the protection of children from harm. The
right to object is fundamental to our licensing system, and anything
that undermines that right is a regressive

requirement to advertise is a significant cost to the licensed trade,
but it is a cost only when a venue is looking to open up or make a
major variation, which would normally be a licence extension. It is not
a charge that is levied on long-standing community pubs unless they are
looking to vary their licence. It is much more likely to be a fee
encountered by a new venue in city centres, nightclubs, off-licences
and supermarkets. That is important because a number of Members are,
quite rightly, concerned to protect their local community pubs and not
to impose further burdens on
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:48:07"></hs_TimeCode>. It is also

weekly reach of local newspapers was 67% of the population, compared

internet. I was struck by the hon. Gentleman’s comment that for
some people the digital divide means only the space between their
fingers: they do not have access to the internet and would not know
where to start to look on a council website. Could the Minister comment
on that issue and say how the public will be informed about what is
going on in their local area? Do the Government genuinely think that
this change can be introduced without reducing the number of people who
are made aware of new licences or variations to

dancing clubs in Hull. Although they were applications for clubs in the

people across

One was the proximity of the clubs to a boys school that is due to open
in September. Because the school has a city-wide catchment area, those
licences were of interest to many more people than would walk past the
venue. Because the notification had to be advertised in the local
paper, the whole community in the city could know about the application
and so were in a position to object. Indeed, many people chose to
object. What is more, the local paper followed up the story with an
article after the hearing, to keep the community updated about what had
happened. That was a proper dialogue, which informed local people and
demonstrated the value of local
papers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:51:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061889000040">I

the Government’s alcohol strategy are to reduce the social and
individual harms caused by alcohol consumption, particularly health
issues and anti-social behaviour. One of the features of the strategy
is a general promise to rebalance the Licensing Act 2003 in favour of
local communities. It does not appear obvious how preventing local
communities from knowing about a proposed new licence will help to
empower them. Perhaps the Minister can explain to me how it will do so,
because it seems to fly in the face of that stated aim. It appears that
the measure is much more about the “red tape
challenge”—the Government’s desire to boast about
reducing bureaucracy. In this case, they want to boast about reducing
bureaucracy on the alcohol industry.</hs_Para>

I understand it, the measure has already been the subject of two
consultations. The first consultation, which was launched in 2010,
asked for suggestions as to how the Licensing Act could be deregulated.
That consultation led to an impact assessment, which revealed the
Government’s preference to end the requirement to advertise in
local newspapers. However, nothing seemed to happen afterwards. In the
second consultation, which was launched in November 2012, it was set
out that one of the consultation’s four aims was to</hs_Para>

of the Government’s recent changes to the licensing system
removed the vicinity requirement. That change, which was introduced in
the Police and Social Responsibility Act 2011, means that someone can
object to a licence application without having to prove a connection to
a particular area. However, that measure is undermined by the removal
of the requirement to advertise in a local newspaper, which prevents
the wider community from finding out about a proposal.</hs_Para>

course, it is important to look at the particular measure that we are
discussing in the context of the wider alcohol strategy. We have to
consider the change not only in the context of other changes to
licensing but in the context of the local media market. I am unclear 
<?notus-xml column=201?>as to exactly what the Government are trying to achieve with this
particular proposal. They have introduced a raft of changes to
licensing. They have introduced both the late night levy and the early
morning restriction order to try to increase the contribution of
licensed premises to their local communities.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:55:02"></hs_TimeCode> problem is
that they expected local authorities to impose the levy and then give
the money to the police. However,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:55:08"></hs_TimeCode>there is no
guarantee that the money that has been raised will benefit the local
community. Hence, as I understand it, no area has introduced a late
night levy or an EMRO, and the £17 million that the Government
promised would be made available for local communities has not yet
materialised. Perhaps the Minister can update us on that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:55:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061889000046">The
Government have also made a commitment to introduce full recovery of
the costs of licence applications. An independent review conducted by
Lord Elton found that the current shortfall in licensing revenue was
approximately £17 million a year. So the Government have again
committed to raising extra revenue from the licensed trade for the
benefit of the wider community. Again, however, we are unclear as to
what has happened to those plans.</hs_Para>

there is the central plank of the Government’s alcohol
strategy—minimum alcohol pricing. The Home Secretary came to the
House to announce that policy; I think that she did so on a Friday,
because it was so important. She then launched a consultation on the
level of minimum unit pricing. Then she briefed the press that she had
actually blocked the policy, which was her own policy. I am sure that
the Minister will be able to tell us where the Government are in terms
of introducing minimum alcohol
pricing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:56:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061889000048">As
we understand them, the Government’s stated aims are twofold:
first, to empower the community to have a greater say in licence
applications; and, secondly, to increase the contribution of the
licensed trade to the wider community. However, the measures designed
to achieve those aims have all collapsed, and today we are discussing
the Government’s plans to do something that limits a
community’s access to information about licensing and restricts
the contribution of the licensed trade to the wider

is important to consider the effect that this measure will have on
local newspapers. The Government’s own impact assessment
estimates that it will cost the industry up to £8 million in
lost revenue. That is a big blow for an industry that is already
struggling. A number of regional newspapers have had to close and many
more are seeing their circulation fall to the point where they are on
the verge of being unsustainable.</hs_Para>

situation creates several problems. The closure of local newspapers has
resulted in significant news gaps, leaving areas without an adequate
source of local news. The decline of regional newspapers is bad for
communities, because it erodes the important role that newspapers have
at the heart of local areas. The decline of regional newspapers is also
bad for local democracy, as papers are no longer willing to challenge
vested interests and hold people to account for financial
reasons.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061889000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0001.htm#13061889000051">The decline
of local newspapers
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:57:41"></hs_TimeCode> not because
there is no appetite for local news or for the particular role that
local newspapers play in their communities. Despite the decrease in
circulation for paid-for regional newspapers, free local titles have
seen significant increases. The latest 
<?notus-xml column=202?>circulation figures, for July to December 2011, show that 18% of free
local newspapers increased their circulation. There is also huge growth
in the number of online visitors to local newspaper websites.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:58:14"></hs_TimeCode>Those
developments show us two things: first, local newspapers are under
threat and need to find new sources of funding; and secondly, there
remains a huge demand for local newspapers and the unique role that
they play in serving our
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:58:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Given those facts, the Minister should rethink implementing a policy
that will seriously damage an already struggling industry and that
appears to go against everything else that the Government’s
alcohol strategy is meant to
achieve.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/65BAF1A637FAFFE8725BFEF707604DEC89B81757" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 June 2013">Tuesday

my hon. Friend, I am also committed to a strong, local, independent

press as essential for local democracy, as it helps local people to
hold their local council and other agencies to account. The Government
have recently introduced measures in the Local Audit and Accountability
Bill to protect the independent press from unfair competition from
council newspapers—the so-called “town hall
Pravdas” that disregard the code of recommended practice on
local authority publicity. The code restricts the publication of
council newspapers and news sheets to once a quarter, but some local
authorities are disregarding it by publishing their newspapers as
frequently as weekly, taking paid advertising revenue away from the
independent local press. The new legislation will enable the Secretary
of State for Communities and Local Government to direct authorities to
comply with the
code.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000058">The
Government are committed to tackling alcohol-related harm and
developing a licensing regime in which the public have a strong voice.
At the same time, we want to lift the burden of bureaucratic processes

are small businesses, was introduced to remove what some see as an
unnecessary burden. I should like to be clear and say to my hon. Friend
that there is no desire to prevent local people getting information
about new licensing applications or playing an active role in the
licensing process. This Government have done more than any other to
increase the ways in which local communities and local people have a

Labour’s Licensing Act 2003 and rebalance it in favour of local

make representations and object to licensing applications regardless of
where they live in relation to the premises. In addition, we made it

is important, as hon. Members have said, to recognise that the vast
majority of our pubs are vital community assets, contributing to the

communities, fostering strong social values and encouraging responsible
drinking. The alcohol strategy reflects that.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:09:49"></hs_TimeCode> is also
notable that each pub contributes an estimated £100,000 annually
to its local community. The Government are helping pubs through a wide
range of measures. In the last Budget, we scrapped the beer escalator
and cut alcohol duty, resulting in a pint of beer being 4p cheaper than
if we had done nothing. We have also extended the business rates
holiday for a further year, until the end of March 2014, and got rid of
much of the red tape that frustrated landlords and kept them from
focusing on what they are best at: running a business and managing
drinking in a safe
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:10:23"></hs_TimeCode>.

proposal to cut red tape that the alcohol consultation

should highlight that there is a requirement for applicants to
advertise information about a premises licence application by
displaying a notice at the premises. That, too, can be a way of
alerting a community to the fact that a licence may be being sought in
respect of the premises. Alongside that obligation, the Government have
added a new requirement, from April last year, for licensing
authorities to publish details of such licence applications on their
websites. Some licensing authorities have gone further than the strict
legal requirements, and they proactively provide e-mail alerts to those
interested in licensing applications. The Government’s guidance
to licensing authorities encourages them to ensure they comply with
legal requirements. We will look to ensure that licensing authorities
consistently publish the relevant information.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:12:59"></hs_TimeCode>I recognise the

your mind back, Mr Streeter, you may remember a joke in a 1980s Eddie
Murphy film, “Coming to America”. A waiter brings soup to
a table and the customer asks him to try the soup. The waiter says,
“What’s wrong? Is it the wrong soup?” The customer
says, “Could you try the soup?” The waiter says,
“Is it too hot?” The customer says, “Could you try
the soup?” The waiter says, “Is it too cold?” The
customer says, “Please try the soup.” The waiter says,
“Okay. I’ll try the soup. Where’s the
spoon?” I have told that joke several times in the last few days
when people have said to me, “Rail services in north Cornwall?
There aren’t any rail services in north Cornwall.” When I
requested the debate, I think that I filled in the form with the words
“Rail services for north Cornwall”, but it makes the
point that, although many people in north Cornwall regularly use rail
services to get in and out of the duchy or to travel to points further
west, none of those services runs within the current boundaries of the
North Cornwall constituency, which covers the same area as the old
North Cornwall
district.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000075">Before
the last general election, I had the honour of representing the town of
Newquay, which has the Atlantic branch line from Par. At the time,
there was a debate about the success of Cornwall’s other branch
lines in driving up usage. The Par to Newquay line had not had such
success at that time, although looking at the figures for the services
to Newquay again, it seems that the numbers on that line have risen,
too, which is a welcome
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000076">In
the North Cornwall constituency as currently constituted, the railways
were victims of the cuts in the 1960s. The famous north Cornwall line,
which Sir John Betjeman wrote about and enjoyed travelling on, left
from Waterloo, not far from here, and went via Exeter and ultimately
through north Cornwall. It had connections to Bude, and ran through
Launceston and other places where many people would love to go to if
the railway line still existed. It also went through Camelford and Port
Isaac, where the Doc Marten series attracts thousands of tourists every
year, and then on to Wadebridge and Padstow. The services on that line
were victims of the Beeching cuts. In 1990, a small section of the
former railway around Bodmin was reopened by the Bodmin and Wenford
heritage railway. It is a popular tourist attraction and does a great
deal to conserve the rolling stock and to bring people to that part of
the world.</hs_Para>

focus today on how we might use existing railways better to meet the
needs of my constituents and what the prospects are in the longer term
of developing rail services again throughout the north Cornwall area.
The operators of the Bodmin and Wenford railway have plans—they
are not without controversy in the area—to extend their services
to Wadebridge along the Camel trail by the River Camel on the former
track bed. However, in doing that, they would seek to protect the Camel
trail, which has become a well loved part of our  
<?notus-xml column=208?>landscape for cycling, walking and riding, and brings many tourists to
Wadebridge, Padstow and the surrounding area. Any development would
have to protect that.</hs_Para>

struck by the operators’ commitment to work to bring tourists to
Bodmin town, too, which perhaps has not benefited from the Camel trail
in the same way. I am told that Bodmin has the second largest inward
commute of any town in Cornwall after the city of Truro. Of course,
most of that is by car, although there are some bus services. The
railway comes to Bodmin Parkway—it was called Bodmin Road when I
was growing up in the area—and continues on the main line
further south and west. If we were able to offer services along the
Bodmin and Wenford stretch back to Bodmin general station, where the
group’s headquarters are located, it would bring tourists and
commuters into Bodmin and back out again at the key points of the
commuting day. That would be a real
benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000079">Cornwall
council supports the exploration of that option. The current portfolio
holder, Councillor Bert Biscoe, was also the portfolio holder at the
tail end of the previous Administration. He is keen to provide a
solution and council officers believe that that option could make a
contribution to dealing with transport issues in Bodmin. I would
welcome any support that the Government could give to taking forward
such a
proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000080">My
constituents further north in Launceston and Bude are still some
distance from the rail network. My office is in Launceston and when
people visit from Government agencies or companies to talk about
constituency matters or casework and ask what the nearest station is,
they are often surprised to find that it is Plymouth or Exeter, or that
they must overshoot Launceston into Bodmin Parkway and come
back.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000081">Most
people in that part of the world would travel to Exeter St Davids and
pick up the service there or perhaps to Tiverton Parkway and use the
service there. Some people in Devon—your county, Mr
Streeter—have been talking about what contribution a parkway
station at Okehampton might make for people in west and north-west
Devon, as well as the north and east of my constituency. Devon county
council has considered that as part of the regeneration of Devon and
believes that it could make a contribution. If more services were
offered at Okehampton, it would bring rail services that much closer to
Bude, Launceston and the surrounding area, so people would not have to
drive into Exeter, which is busy at peak times, or continue around it
for some distance to pick up services at Tiverton Parkway. It makes a
great deal of sense to look at that proposal, although there may be
arguments about resilience. If there were problems with the line
further south in Devon, there would be an opportunity for people to
connect with rail services to Exeter and to pick up the mainline there.
Much could be said for development there.</hs_Para>

submission, with other colleagues, to the previous round of franchise
discussions, I raised both those matters. I hope that the Government
will consider them and that there is support for those changes and
their potential for people in Cornwall and in Devon. In the longer
term, it would be great to have the north Cornwall line back. That
would be wonderful for tourism, but we must be realistic. There has
been development along the track bed. We did not protect it in the same
way as some other European countries protected lines when they 
<?notus-xml column=209?>mothballed them. We must deal with the situation that we have, but
Councillor Biscoe particularly is supportive of looking at how to bring
other forms of public transport back to north Cornwall to complement
the buses that we still
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000083">Existing
services to London are incredibly valuable. For people who have
travelled from parts of the north coast—for example, to Bodmin
Parkway to pick up mainline services there—the suggestion that
they might catch a connecting service to Plymouth and pick up mainline
services there would be unpopular because it would mean another change.
I hope the Government will resist that. If we follow some of the plans
set out by Cornwall council, we can protect the through services all
the way to Penzance, which are incredibly valuable, and ensure that we
tie in east-west commuter services through Cornwall to provide more
regular services. People in my constituency who work in Truro, which is
the retail centre for Cornwall and has big public service and public
sector employers, often find that trains do not tie up with their shift
pattern or their work pattern, so there is a big disincentive to using
them, or a delay for those who must rely on them at the end or the
beginning of the day. A lot more could be done if we can create more
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000084">Cornwall
council has had discussions with the Secretary of State, who kindly
visited Falmouth recently and spent time with some of my parliamentary
colleagues. Sadly, I could not join him on that occasion, but I have
seen the case that was set out for him. Cornwall council is rightly
proud of the contributions that it and the preceding Cornwall county
council made in using European convergence and objective 1 money to
improve rail facilities and ensure that we can up the capacity of the
network in Cornwall, mainly in points further west, such as the Truro

have been very impressive increases in numbers. Across the whole
country, we have seen the rail network coming under increasing pressure
as ever more people seek to use it—a welcome
development—but branch lines in Cornwall have exceeded even
that. They might be seen as backwater services, but the numbers have
been upped significantly, and not just in terms of the tourist trade in
Truro and Falmouth. We now have the university in Falmouth, which is
increasingly bringing people into the area, so there are great
opportunities to build on that work.</hs_Para>

next level, so that growth, over and above the level of growth that we

people off the roads and on to rail services across Cornwall. The aim
is not only to protect the nine through-trains a day, but to see a
further 8% growth over the projected period. We aspire to having 23
mainline services a day along the length of the rail in the duchy,

they need frequent and reliable services to all 
<?notus-xml column=210?>the places that are along and at the end of the branch lines. If we can
add to that with developments around Bodmin, or perhaps by bringing

welcome the fact that the coalition Government have invested a great
deal in rail across the country, and that they are emphasising the
importance of that for future economic development and in ensuring that
we have a more sustainable way of getting around in general. However,
Cornwall will not be at the forefront of electrification, so there are
other ways in which we can seek to use Government investment creatively
to encourage more people to use the railway. That has been done in
previous years. The numbers are very impressive, but I hope that we can
move forward again.</hs_Para>

we could bring more regular services to Okehampton, which would help
us, and protect those through-trains, while offering more regular
commuter services across Cornwall. With the delay in the franchise

Mr Streeter. I congratulate the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan

lack of rail services in his constituency. He touched on a number of
important issues, including his plea for Bodmin. He raised, both
directly and indirectly, the issue of the First Great Western

services to Cornwall. I would also like to develop comments about
community rail, which I think may benefit him. However, if he will
forgive me, I will deal with those points in reverse order to the order
that he took them in. I will begin with the First Great Western

First Great Western rail franchise is a matter of keen interest, as is
shown by the hon. Gentleman’s contribution. It is right that
there should be so much interest in this franchise. It serves a huge
number of communities and businesses, and the Great Western rail
network has an important role in the economy of the many parts of
England and Wales that it serves, not least Cornwall. Railway
connectivity provides crucial support for jobs and growth. Delivering
high-quality rail services is, of course, also a means of addressing
road congestion and pollution by encouraging modal

of the success stories of Britain’s railways is the large number

crowding. As Department for Transport statistics show, train services
on the franchise have experienced some of the highest levels of
crowding. I am therefore pleased that additional carriages funded by
the Government have been introduced to First Great Western train
services. Those include additional carriages for services in Cornwall
and in Devon. I should like to highlight the role that the additional

in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:19:51"></hs_TimeCode> March. On 31
January, he announced the termination of the Great Western franchise

Richard Brown in his independent
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:20:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Having
considered the options for the Great Western franchise very carefully,
the Government decided to extend the current franchise agreement with
First Great Western for a further period of 28 weeks to October this
year. At the same time, the Secretary of State announced that he
intended to negotiate an interim agreement with First Great Western to
ensure continuity of train services. On 26 March, he announced that the
plan was to develop the franchise proposition further during an interim
agreement period lasting to July

franchising programme that we announced in March is the right one. We
want to secure the best possible rail services for both passengers and
taxpayers, and this programme confirms our belief that franchising is
the way to do it. By publishing the programme, we have provided the

Penzance local services; the extension of St Ives trains to Penzance;
additional Looe line services; additional Exeter to Okehampton

for Vale of York clinical commissioning group has suffered a triple
whammy. First, it started from the lowest base in Yorkshire and the
Humber, because its predecessor body, the North Yorkshire and York
primary care trust, received less money than any other PCT in the
region. Secondly, the PCTs’ base funding was not split evenly
between the five new clinical commissioning groups in north Yorkshire
and York, and Vale of York CCG, which covers the city of York, received
the lowest share of the funding. Thirdly, that meagre amount was
top-sliced, because the former PCT had overspent its budget in the
previous year. I will say a little more about all three
issues, after which  I will suggest an immediate remedy to the
problems and a longer-term solution to the funding crisis.</hs_Para>

funding received by PCTs in Yorkshire and the Humber in 2012-13 varied
considerably across the region. North Yorkshire and York PCT received
£1,475 per patient; Leeds received £1,550 per patient;
Sheffield received £1,700 per patient; Wakefield received
£1,800 per patient; and Barnsley received £1,900 per
patient. Why did the other PCT areas get more? It was because the NHS
funding formula allocates a base amount of money for each member of the
public, adds or subtracts an element to reflect the age or youth of
each person, and adds additional elements in respect of social
deprivation. Areas of Yorkshire and the Humber other than north
Yorkshire and York are deemed to face greater deprivation and,
therefore, greater unmet health needs, and as a consequence they
receive more money per capita.</hs_Para>

worked out through that formula, which reflects deprivation, was about
£1,300 million for north Yorkshire and York in 2012-13. That sum
was reduced this year by some £430 million, largely as a result
of top-slicing for services to be provided on a national basis by the
NHS Commissioning Board, which left some £865 million to be
divided between the five clinical commissioning groups. However, they
were not treated equally. Vale of York CCG received £1,050 per
patient, whereas Scarborough and Ryedale CCG received
£1,234 per patient, which is almost
£200—20%—more per patient. The odd thing is that
the same NHS foundation trust provides services for patients in
Scarborough and Malton, 
<?notus-xml column=216?>which is part of Ryedale, and in the city of York. For some of those
patients, however, there is substantially higher funding, which is
likely to exacerbate the problems of postcode rationing. Some patients
from the better-funded part of the patch will receive access to a wider
range of treatments than those from the city of
York.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000118">How
is the split justified? We are told that the funding was split between
the clinical commissioning groups in north Yorkshire and York on the
basis of the use that patients from their areas made of NHS services in
the previous year. It is well known that middle-class people in more
prosperous areas make greater demands of the NHS than do poorer people
in deprived areas, so the two parts of the funding calculation for the
Vale of York clinical commissioning group are pulling in diametrically
opposite directions. The funding formula that allocates money to north
Yorkshire and York reflects disadvantage, so north Yorkshire and York
gets less than Barnsley, but the funding for the CCGs in north
Yorkshire is split based on the use that they made of services, so
relatively deprived inner-city areas of York receive less. The problems
in those areas are not as severe as those in Bradford or Sheffield, but
they are still greater than the problems faced by Richmondshire or
Hambleton. It really is unfair to provide a baseline pot of money based
on a lower allocation for north Yorkshire and York because it is deemed
to have lower deprivation, but to choose the most deprived part of
north Yorkshire and York and cut the funding further because people in
deprived areas do not use health services as much as people in more
prosperous areas.</hs_Para>

that when the funding body was determining how to split funding between
the CCGs in north Yorkshire and York—indeed, across the
country—it decided to use a demand-led formula rather than a
needs-based formula, but it looked at what the results of a needs-based
formula would have been. I asked the Minister whether he would release
that information, but it was not readily to hand. If at least he
released the figures on the north Yorkshire and York split, it would
help us to work through with clinicians and health service managers in
our patch whether the current double whammy, as I call it, is

have though that it was as clear as the nose on your face that
consideration must be given to the rural nature of a county and the
degree of ageing of its

must note that under the previous Government the funding formula was
changed and more money put into the national health service. In
addition, deprivation was given more weight in the formula. On paper,
ensuring that deprivation is the most important factor, seems, morally,
the right thing to do. However, I believe that when that reasoning is
put into practice it starts to fall down. The distortion within the
funding formula has resulted in some areas being awash with money,
leading to well-publicised vanity health care projects, such as the one
in Hull, with its 72-foot ocean-going yacht at the cool price of
£500,000. At the same time, York and north Yorkshire have
consistently struggled, as ably put across
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:45:49"></hs_TimeCode> the hon.

their continuing to take difficult decisions about health care

example of such decisions is that the primary care trust had to stop
offering routine relief injections for sufferers of chronic back pain.
That decision has had a massive impact on the quality of life of many
of my constituents—it has hampered their ability to work and has
affected carers. I have raised that issue previously in this Chamber,
yet people are again coming through my surgeries, as I am sure they are
through the surgeries of other hon. Members here today, suffering from
a lack of access to those important injections. The decision is
consequently putting more financial pressure on areas such as welfare,
and that far outweighs the cost savings made by local authorities under
the funding formula. That demonstrates the lack of joined-up thinking

important to debate such issues and, in particular, to look at perhaps
the greatest determinant of need in the NHS, which is that many older

diabetes, heart disease—and to look at the very big human need,

considered as important as the quality of treatment or the clinical

Department of Health has set the mandate and a clear sense of direction
for the NHS, with the priorities that are clearly there. The Department
then makes allocations to several health bodies, including Public
Health England, Health Education England, the NHS Trust Development
Authority and NHS England. For 2013-14, NHS England received
£95.6 billion, and some of that money will then, in turn, be
allocated to clinical commissioning groups, but allocations to
individual CCGs and the formula used to decide them are now the
responsibility of NHS England, which has the key
role.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000147">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:54:03"></hs_TimeCode>
making those allocations, NHS England relies on advice from the

to each CCG to support equal access for equal need, as specified in the
priorities set out in the
mandate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061889000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/halltext/130618h0002.htm#13061889000148">NHS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:54:46"></hs_TimeCode>
England does not, therefore set income on an equal cost per head basis
across the whole country; allocations instead follow an assessment of
the expected need for health services in an area, and funds are
distributed in line with that, which means that areas with a high
health need receive more money per head. Under the formula, the 10%
most deprived areas received more than 30% more per capita compared
with the 10% least deprived, as

calculation is based on several factors. In particular, it is
increasingly based on the age of the population, the relative morbidity

consistent supply of health services across the country: the greater
the health need, the more money that will be received. I am sure that

shift from a PCT funding formula to a CCG funding formula resulted in
changes to the allocation for each particular area in 2013-14, as the
hon. Gentleman commented. Funding now often takes place at a more local
level—at the CCG rather than the PCT level—which we hope
will ensure better prioritisation for local health care funding, with
the funding formula being more sensitive to local health care

year. This decreasing UK presence, in line with security transition,
has meant that as of 30 April, we have already been able to redeploy
568 vehicles and major equipments and 949 twenty foot equivalent units

should be taken in comparing these figures. The increase in the total

flood defences, which would only move properties from one level of risk

February 2012 all travel document applicants have been required to
hold, or simultaneously apply, for a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP)
to confirm their immigration status in the UK. Where an applicant
already holds a BRP they need not apply for another. Such applications
for BRPs may experience delays if they are rejected, for instance if
required information is missing or the wrong fee paid. Rejected in this
context means that the application is kept open and the applicant asked
to provide the missing information and then
reconsidered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130618118000574" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130618/text/130618w0001.htm#130618118000574">The

their biometrics, or from the date of travel document application where

one to which many people give selflessly of their time. From the
smallest community groups to the

leadership and strategic direction of their volunteer trustees. I would
encourage more people, and in particular young people, to get involved
as charity trustees. Trusteeship offers an opportunity to gain new

voluntary grant for the first year of the new system of local council

Javid:</Member></B> The Exchequer receives no duty for unused air
tickets. air passenger duty (APD) is a tax on aircraft operators based
on the number of chargeable passengers on board a flight. Generally,
operators pass the cost of their forecast APD liability onto passengers

for protecting revenues and for ensuring public confidence in the
fairness and effectiveness of our tax systems. The Government is in
regular discussions with other member states on this issue and is
working closely with the Commission and member states on addressing the
priority areas for tackling fraud and evasion at the EU level, for
example the rapid adoption of the revised savings directive and on
countering VAT fraud. In addition the UK, together with France,
Germany, Spain and Italy agreed in April to develop and then pilot
multilateral tax information exchange on an automatic basis. This
initiative will help embed the new global standard leading to a step
change in the fight against tax evasion, something that the UK is also
taking forward as part of its G8 presidency. 12 other member states
have since joined this initiative together with Mexico and
Norway.</hs_Para>
