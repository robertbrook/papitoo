Bayley:</Member></B> The failure of the Government to use the
long-established funding formula for the NHS in dividing the budget
between CCGs in north Yorkshire has left us with glaring anomalies, so
that in York, the funding is £1,050 per head, but for
Scarborough and Ryedale, which is served by the same NHS foundation
trust, the funding is £1,234 per head. That is quite
unsustainable and will lead to further postcode rationing. The same
funding formula must be applied to all CCGs throughout the country.
When will that happen?</hs_Para>

Hunt:</Member></B> I share the hon. Gentleman’s concerns about
the way that NHS funding is allocated to different parts of the
country. The allocation in my constituency is about the same as in his
constituency, and I have long worried that things like age and rurality
are not factored into the final amounts in the way that they need to
be. However, in this case NHS England decided that if it was to follow
precisely the ACRA recommendations, it would lead to higher growth for
areas with better health outcomes and lower growth, or even cuts, for
areas with less good outcomes, which it thought would be inconsistent 
<?notus-xml column=140?>with its responsibility to reduce health inequalities. That is why it is
conducting a fundamental review, which it says it hopes will inform the
next set of allocations for
2013-14.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0001.htm#13061171000041"><Member ContinuationText="John Penrose" PimsId="4834" UID="13061171000843" xid="906" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0001.htm#13061171000843"><B>John

the actual allocations versus the intended amounts of cash which should
arrive with us based on the existing formula, are well below what they
should be; so even without changing the funding formula, we are still
getting dramatically less cash than we should. I urge the Secretary of

existing spending envelopes, to make the allocations
fairer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0001.htm#13061171000042"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jeremy Hunt" PimsId="4799" UID="13061171000844" xid="894" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0001.htm#13061171000844">Mr

about the way funding works at the moment. We are in a very difficult
situation because if we were to move closer to the formula proposed by
ACRA—I am sure he would agree with me that it is right that it
is done independently of Ministers, and in this case it is done under
NHS England—it would mean cuts in real terms for the budgets in
other areas. Given the pressures overall in the NHS, that was obviously
a decision that NHS England was very reluctant to
make.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0001.htm#13061171000043"><Member ContinuationText="Andy Burnham" PimsId="2376" UID="13061171000845" xid="81" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0001.htm#13061171000845"><B>Andy
Burnham</B> (Leigh) (Lab):</Member> The last Government matched health
funding to health need and reduced the gap in male life expectancy and
infant mortality, but this Government have reduced the weighting for
health inequalities. The Secretary of State’s public health
allocations mean that the areas he has identified today with the
biggest health challenges do not get a fair share. The area with
longest male life expectancy, Kensington and Chelsea, gets £133
per head, but Liverpool gets £89, Manchester £86, Luton
£61, and Slough just £37. If he really wants to do
something about health inequalities, should he not match his words with

Hunt:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman really cannot have it both
ways. The budget for public health is also decided by an independent
body, and we gave everyone a real-terms increase and then used any
remaining money to even out the differences, to get everyone as close
as possible to the independent formula. But if we are talking about
spending, I think the right hon. Gentleman needs to say precisely
whether he stands by his assertion that Governments should cut spending
on the NHS by £600 million—<I>[Interruption.]</I> He says
he has never said it before, but actually, up till now he has always
said that it was irresponsible for the Government to increase spending

that issue a great deal, and I have great sympathy, because areas with
high age profiles do have

things like social deprivation, which also have an impact. It is right

Gentleman is absolutely right to highlight that there has, in the past,
sometimes been unacceptable variation in the quality of post-natal
care. That is why we are increasing the number of midwives
and have done so by nearly 1,400, and why we are putting money and

NHS, housing providers and social care locally. That will hopefully
ensure that across the country we have a much greater focus on local
health care needs and, in particular, on better supporting older people

Burnham</B> (Leigh) (Lab):</Member> A moment ago the
Minister mentioned more elderly people coming in through A and E, and I
want to present the House with new, deeply troubling evidence of that.
Nobody wants to think of a very frail elderly person with no
other support at home having to come to A and E by ambulance, but that
is what increasing numbers of elderly people are having to do. Buried
in the general A and E figures is an appalling increase in people aged
over 90 coming to A and E by blue-light ambulance, which is up by 66%,
equivalent to more than 100,000 of the most vulnerable people in our
society. That is an appalling failure and a sign of something seriously
wrong in the way we care for older people, and it is set to
get worse as home care is cut further this year. Will he investigate

a long-term challenge in providing more integrated, joined-up care to
better look after older people. However, it is ironic that he should
raise that concern, because a previous Minister in the other place, the
noble Lord Warner, has made the case very clearly that the previous
Government failed to invest adequately in elderly care throughout their

is extremely important that all these plans take a holistic view both

the party political divide, could do far more both here and locally to
reduce the number of women who find themselves working on the streets
as prostitutes. I have long taken the view that these are some of the
most vulnerable people in our society, and without exception I have
never met a prostitute—I used to represent many of
them—who has not herself been abused, usually as a child. They
are vulnerable people and we should recognise them for

subjects such as English and history. There should be more testing of
advanced problem-solving skills in mathematics and science and more
testing of mathematics in science GCSEs, in order to improve

as well as sharper accountability from improved league tables and a
strengthened Ofsted—are raising standards in state schools. That
means that new GCSEs will remain universal
qualifications—accessible, with good teaching, to the same
proportion of pupils as now.</hs_Para>

Committee report and Ofqual recognise that controlled assessment, which
counted for 60% of the English GCSE qualification, undermined the
reliability of the assessment as a whole. I therefore asked Ofqual to
review the regulatory framework for GCSEs to judge how we might limit
course work and controlled assessment and to reflect on how we could
lift a cap on aspiration by reducing the two-tier structure of some
GCSEs. I also asked Ofqual to explore how we might reform our grading

has devoted a great deal of time in this House to reminding us how
important it is that we tackle that tale of underachievement. We want
to consult on exactly how the grading system can fairly reflect the
full range of ability, but we also need to ensure that students who sit
these examinations are supported long before they come to sit a GCSE so
that they are able to achieve more effectively. We are making a series
of interventions, ranging from the introduction of the pupil premium
and the extension of 15 hours of free pre-school education to the
poorest two-years-olds to the endowment from the Education Endowment
Foundation fund to support research into how we can support the poorest

Secretary of State, who is responding to the demands of employers and

pupils in Wales, who may want to seek employment opportunities across
the UK and beyond, could be disadvantaged if the Welsh Government
refuse to follow this reform? Will he agree to make the qualification

educational needs. These reforms have been widely welcomed, and I am

met constituents who have had to battle to get the special educational
support that their child needs. These reforms are ambitious; they aim
to ensure that in future, children, young people and their parents are
at the heart of the system, and that special educational provision
builds around them, instead of asking them to adjust to the system. It
will not always work perfectly in every case, but the pathfinders that
I have visited have convinced me that we have a really exciting reform
under way—one that challenges local authorities to design a
system around those who use it, rather than conform to existing
structures and processes. The reforms are also ambitious as regards
personal aspirations. The new system will support young people through
further education and training, up to the age of 25 for those who need
it, and focus much more strongly on independent living and helping them
to find paid employment. The provisions extend support to younger years
as well, so that children are supported as soon as their needs are
identified, from birth onwards, instead of having to wait until they
reach school to be assessed.</hs_Para>

provide the foundation for a system in which children and young
people’s needs are picked up early; parents know what services
they can reasonably expect their local schools, colleges, local
authority, and health and social care services to provide, without
having to fight for the information; those with more severe or complex
needs have a co-ordinated assessment built around them and a single
education, health and care plan from birth to 25; and parents and young
people have greater control over their support. I believe these
ambitions are shared across the House.</hs_Para>

point. Advocacy comes in different forms. We have advocacy in relation
to the legal process, and legal aid will still apply up to the point of
tribunal for those who require legal advice. There is also advocacy in
terms of trying to navigate the system. One thing that we are doing in
relation to the pathfinders is to see who can help co-ordinate and
navigate for parents and young people in a system that often has been
too impenetrable, labyrinthine and drawn out. That could be through a
key working role or through the work that the special educational needs

to co-operate, the joint commissioning clause, and now the duty on

there is already, with the pathfinders, a growing involvement of each
of those different agencies in coming together and concentrating on the
central and most important issue, which is the child. I hope he will
see that the Bill gives local authorities an opportunity to nurture and
grow their relationships with health and other agencies, and ensure

Timpson:</Member></B> As ever, I am grateful to the Chair of the
Education Committee for raising a crucial element for many young people
with a disability, and that is access to other activities outside those
of the classroom. I am mindful of that and as I told the Committee this
morning have seen for myself, at a special school in Chislehurst only
last week, how the integration of sport in schools, where children with
both physical and other disabilities are able to participate, can have
a huge knock-on effect in other areas of their life. It would not
always be appropriate through the identification of the needs and
therefore the support for each child in relation to their plan to have
a built-in element that incorporates and encompasses physical activity,
but clearly we want to provide as much opportunity for them as for any
other child. The schools should be doing it anyway under the Equality
Act 2010 and the reasonable adjustments for which they are responsible,
but it also makes good sense, as we know. I am happy—I made this
commitment to the Committee—to look at that in the context of
the code of practice, but also to work with many of the organisations
and charities who are already out there, through the project ability
scheme and others, to see what more they can do to spread good practice
in this area. I am happy to keep my hon. Friend informed of that

two points, clearly it is important that we know what is happening in
schools on the delivery of SEN provision, and since September 2012 we
have had a strengthened Ofsted framework that seeks to do that. I and
my colleague in the Department of Health want to explore what more we
can do to try to bring about a more multidimensional accountability and
inspection regime for special educational needs that goes beyond the
school gates and looks at it across education, health and social care,
so there is more that we can do in that area. The Education Department
is also looking at some of the destination measures in schools as a way
of ensuring that we do not miss out on understanding the progress of
children who sometimes fall below the radar because they do not count
towards any of the measures of success that the school is being marked
against. We need to get around that and make it more explicit that
every child needs to be making progress whatever their ability, and
there is no reason why all of them should not be doing so, and every
school has a responsibility in that

understanding is that there have been ongoing discussions. We are aware
of the issue. As with all organisations that have expressed an interest
in the Bill, we have been keen to keep an open dialogue with the RNIB
to see what solutions we can find. Many of the solutions will be found
at local level. We must accept that some conditions have a high
incidence and some have a low incidence, and that can affect the sort
of provision available right across the country. The beauty of trying
to develop the local offer is that it will make it far more transparent
not only in a local area, but across a regional area, so parents and
young people will have a greater understanding of what is available to
them, how they can access it and, if they are unable to do so, how they
can make a complaint, which in the past has been quite a convoluted and

Timpson:</Member></B> The short answer is yes. That is the intention of
the Bill. There are a number of reasons for saying that. One of the
complaints from parents about the statementing process relates less to
the statement itself and more to early identification and the need for
much greater effort from different agencies in co-ordinating the
assessment and the plan. Everything in the Bill tries to encourage that
and, in some circumstances, cajole the different bodies to come
together and work with the family, rather than, as we have heard far
too often, the 
<?notus-xml column=184?>family feeling that they are working in a different environment from
those around them. By ensuring that that happens, we will reduce the
prospect of conflict, misunderstanding and, therefore, the road to
tribunal, which we all want to avoid. That is why we included the
mediation process, albeit on a voluntary basis, to give parents and
those responsible for providing services every opportunity to work
together, co-operate and consult at every stage, but particularly in
the early stages, in order to avoid unnecessary discord and damage

will begin our consideration of the Bill’s SEN provisions by
speaking to new clause 9 in a little more detail and to Government
amendments 17 to 25. These amendments clarify responsibilities and make
consequential amendments to legislation as a result of provisions in
the Bill. With regard to new clause 9, it is important that the
responsibilities of local authorities are clear when a child or young
person with an education, health and care plan moves from one area to
another. The new clause provides for regulations to specify those
responsibilities. Regulations will make it clear that the new local
authority is treated as though it had made the plan. This ensures that
plans do not lapse when children and young people move from one area to
another and that support for their special educational needs is
maintained. I therefore urge the House to support new clause
9.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000376" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000376">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T13:39:41"></hs_TimeCode>
17 to clause 41 has been tabled at the request of the Welsh Government.
It would enable independent schools that are specially organised for
making provision for children and young people with special educational
needs, and specialist post-16 institutions in Wales, to apply to the
Secretary of State for Education to be on a list of independent
institutions that those with education, health and care plans can ask
to be named on their plan. If independent schools in Wales wish to put
themselves forward for approval, the amendment will be of benefit to
children and young people who live close to the Welsh border whose
needs would be best met in a Welsh independent school or those who
would be appropriately placed in independent boarding provision in
Wales. I urge the House to support the
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000377">On
amendments 18 to 20 on personal budgets, I signalled our intention to
table these consequential amendments when we debated clause 48 on
personal budgets in Committee. The changes they make are necessary
because of the changes we made to clause 42 in Committee by placing the
duty in clause 42(3) on health commissioners to secure the health
provision identified in an education, health and care plan. The
amendments allow health commissioners to discharge their duty to make
health care provision specified in EHC plans when this provision is
secured using a direct payment. This replicates the equivalent
provision on local authorities set out in clause 48(5). The amendments
clarify that when parents or young people exercise their direct
payment, this allows the commissioning body to discharge its statutory
duty. The proposed use of the words “having been” in
clauses 48(5) and 48(7) makes it clear that the duties on commissioning
bodies and local authorities to secure provision are discharged only
through the use of a direct payment when the child or young

Sharon Hodgson</B> (Washington and Sunderland West) (Lab):</Member> It
is a pleasure to debate this Bill again, this time on the Floor of the
House. In Committee we had some excellent debates on this part of the
Bill, in particular. A large number of amendments were tabled by hon.
Members on both sides of the Committee, but we were at all times united
in our ambition for the children and young people to whom the Bill
applies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T13:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000381" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000381">It
is crucial that children and young people with special educational
needs and disabilities be given the support they need to access
education and reach their potential, academically and in terms of their
physical, social and emotional development. It is not just a moral
imperative that leads us to seek those better outcomes for all
children; there is also a financial imperative for the whole country. A
young person who makes a successful transition to adulthood and has
achieved as much as they can educationally is likely to be less in need
of welfare, health and social care support and more likely to be able
to work and contribute their skills to the economy and their taxes to
the Treasury. We support a great many of the reforms that the
Government are making to achieve these better outcomes, but we have
sought at all stages to ensure that we are going as far as we can, that
current rights and entitlements are protected and built on, and that
children and young people, and their families, are at the very heart of
the changes made and are able adequately to hold agencies to account
where they do not get the support they
should<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T13:44:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000382" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000382">We
support the introduction of personal budgets to allow families a
greater degree of choice in securing the choice that their child needs.
As I said in Committee, I would have greatly welcomed such an
opportunity when I was trying to get my severely dyslexic son the
support he needed to get through his GCSEs. However, there are serious
and abiding concerns about whether they can work in the sense of
improving outcomes while providing value for money for the taxpayer,
and there are still questions about how the market for support that
this reform will create will really
look<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T13:44:45"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government are running pathfinders in an effort to answer these
questions, but they have not been answered yet. Parliament is therefore
being asked to legislate for something that we do not know will work
and could well be a costly failure.</hs_Para>

extending the maximum age of support for young people to 25 to ensure
that it covers further education courses and apprenticeships, and the
ambition to encourage joint working between different agencies in
drawing up those plans and providing the services described in them.
However, there are still some concerns that, as worded, the Bill would
give local authorities a get-out clause from providing services to
enable young people between the age of 19 and 25 to carry on in
education, even where they have not yet achieved to the level we might
expect for young people without SENs. Those concerns are addressed by
amendments 40 to 43, tabled by the hon. Member for South Swindon (Mr
Buckland), which we support. I, like him,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T13:47:07"></hs_TimeCode>would be

under the Special Educational Needs (Information) Act 2008, which is
transposed into clause 65. It stands to reason that if we are
maintaining support for these young people, we should also know how
well that support has helped them. I would be grateful if the Minister
committed to how best that might be done within the “special

information on the outcomes and costs to the public purse in tribunal
administration and the amount spent by local authorities on legal
fees—of the cases that reach that stage—so we can see who
the worst offenders are and which local authorities would prefer to pay
a lawyer £20,000 to prevent a child from getting
£5,000-worth of support. The Minister helpfully pointed me
towards some information that was squirreled away on the Ministry of
Justice’s website, but as he will know, it is not exactly 
<?notus-xml column=188?>what I am asking for in this amendment, and in any case the information

still fear that the Government’s plans for local offers, as
drafted, could lead to greater disparities in services across the
country. We welcome the requirement to compile and publish local
offers, but fear that without a baseline expectation from the
Department of what should be in them or, indeed, any departmental
oversight, they may not be worth the paper they are printed on. As the
Education Committee has pointed out, getting local offers right is
crucial. If we do not and the services that children and young people
need are not provided, we will just see more and more requests for

amendments 66 and 67 would therefore require local offers accurately to
reflect what is actually available in the local area, rather than
simply what the local authority might say it expects to be available.

69 would require the Secretary of State to set national standards for
what the local offers should include. I am no enemy of localism, as the
Minister might argue—local offers should absolutely reflect
local needs and priorities and be drawn up in consultation with local
parent groups. However, if we are to tackle the unwritten postcode
lottery, there should surely be a baseline of services that any child
or young person anywhere in England should be able to expect. I have
said before that local offers may simply codify the unwritten postcode
lottery, and that they have the potential to result in a race to the
bottom as local authorities look at their budgets and seek to undercut
the local offers of their neighbours. I want assurances from the

general population. At least 60% will have communication problems and a
similar percentage will have literacy and numeracy difficulties. Many
of those special educational needs will never have been identified,

factor to those people finding themselves in this

Friend the Minister for his constructive engagement with the debate,

Members of this House, but with the disability sector. He has brought
understanding and experience to the deliberations of the Bill, which we
have enjoyed. I note with enthusiasm his willingness to improve the

important legal duties on clinical commissioning groups to bolt down
the health elements of education, health and care plans. That good work

enjoyed the exchange that I had with the Minister about this matter in
Committee. It is correct that the groundbreaking Chronically Sick and
Disabled Persons Act 1970 contains an important duty that can be
applied to social care services for disabled children. However, there
is a danger that in failing to link that existing duty with the duties
that we are creating, we will not escape the silo effect of
assessments. What do I mean by that? There is a danger that a wholly
separate social care assessment will continue to be made, without the
global approach that I and the Minister believe is the ethos behind the
Bill. It would therefore be a missed opportunity if, for want of a few
short amendments, we missed this
trick<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:03:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000412">We
should look at this matter from the point of view of the parent of a
child who comes fresh to a system of which they have no experience.
Surely the thrust of our approach must be oriented around not just the
child, but their family. We have heard many stories—I speak from
experience—of parents having to reinvent the wheel every time
they engage with a separate part of local provision. We must all seek
to avoid that. That is why I commend the wording of amendment 37, which
would do much to tie together the assessment process in the way that I
have
described<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:04:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

a related theme, and with regard to the point of view of parents and
families, amendment 38 deals with the right of appeal against decisions
that are made about the creation and ambit of education, health and
care plans. The Bill allows the first-tier special educational needs
and disability tribunal to hear appeals only about the education
aspects of the plan. That means that it covers only part of the plan. I
worry that we could end up with a complex and bureaucratic system in
which challenges to the health and social care aspects of provision
have to be conducted simultaneously through different tribunals,
procedures and
processes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000414">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:05:38"></hs_TimeCode>

know that the draft code of practice, which is helpfully published
alongside the Bill and will be consulted on later this year, states
that having a single point of redress for all the provisions in an
education, health and care plan would be helpful. He said in Committee
that the existing complaints procedures in health and social care meant
that it would be unnecessary to extend the powers of the tribunal.

any accountability process could be complicated. The second issue was

a different and higher threshold than is currently set out in case law.
In the 1999 Bromley case, Lord Justice Sedley spoke about a
case-by-case analysis of particular applications, rather than a general
principle as seems to be suggested by the clause. We should therefore
consider a spectrum or range of provision from purely medical to purely
educational need. A large number of cases will fall inside that
spectrum, bearing in mind the common and well-understood scenario that
with a particular need often comes a co-morbid need—a special

pause for a moment and pay tribute to the families and carers who, day

those parents are taking their child to use a disabled lavatory in a

their child who may have a special need that means they make a lot of
noise or have to move about. We still have a long way to go in society
to achieve general understanding among a wider section of the public
about what it is like to live with a child who has special needs. It is
good that an increasing number of towns offer autism-friendly cinema
screenings, for example, that allow people to sit in comfort on a
Sunday afternoon without needing to have eyes in the back of their head

Buckland:</Member></B> That is absolutely correct, and I am grateful to
the hon. Lady. Sadly, mental health issues are a co-morbidity that
becomes prevalent if, for example, a condition such as autism is not
identified at an early age. It is a tragedy that so many young people
who have autism or Asperger’s-related conditions end up with a
mental health problem because their condition is not diagnosed or has
been misunderstood or in some cases mistreated. I pay tribute, however,
to child and adolescent mental health services that do the job well,
understand the needs of people with pre-existing conditions, and adapt
their services accordingly. A visit to a CAMHS unit can be quite a
regressive experience for a young person with autism, which is why
adapting services around the child or young person is so
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:17:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/1DA98EC2FC1829BDABFAE7BA4CEF1A989894E503" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 June 2013">Tuesday

Friend makes a powerful case. Does he share my view that, as with the
local offer, it is important to avoid confusion between two
things—educational provision for local students and educational
provision available in the local area? With some conditions, the local

40 to 43 deal with young people over 18. The extension of
legal protections for young people with SEN up to 25, which is at the
heart of the Bill, is warmly welcome. However, the Bill states a number
of times that local authorities “must have regard to” a
young person’s age when making decisions on the support they
receive after they are 18. We understand that the extension of
provision to 25 does not create a blanket right to education for all
young people with SEN, but we are concerned that the current drafting
could give another get-out to local authorities, which could use the
fact that a young person was over 18 to deny them support. Therefore, I

44 relates to the duty of health commissioners. As I have said, I
welcome that extension, which is a significant improvement, and which
breaks the problem of the silo effect on education and health care

<?notus-xml column=198?>whether the provision goes far enough. Clause 37(2)(d) places a duty on
local authorities to include in the plans health provision that is

other words, the health provision must be linked to the specific
impairment that has resulted in the child or young person being
considered to have SEN. If the health need is not specifically linked,
it does not need to be included. The danger is that limiting the
requirement could result in confusion and, bluntly, injustice. For
example, if a child with Down’s syndrome has a related heart
condition, health provision needed to support their medical needs would
need to be included in the EHC plan. However, if a child with
Down’s syndrome has chronic asthma, which is unrelated to their
Down’s and does not result in the SEN, there is no requirement
to include the medical need in the plan. Such a distinction works
against the Government’s intention to create a co-ordinated
system. Once again, energy is being wasted on arguments about what is
related to the special need. Let us try to cut the Gordian knot and
deal with the issue in a straightforward way that does not create
confusion and the potential for

45 relates to our debate on the status of higher education institutions
and their inclusion in the new framework. It is welcome that further
education will be part of the spectrum of provision. It is right to say
that many universities already meet the needs of disabled young people
well, with the provision of disabled students allowance and other
assistance. However, we still hear far too many stories about disabled
students having to battle to get the wider support they need to access
higher education and the problems they face in securing support from
local health and social care services. The current proposals stop once
a young person goes into higher education. Therefore, there is a
concern that more needs to be done to include universities. Again, I
pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister. He rightly acknowledged the
need for further discussions with universities, and I know he will look

I very briefly mention new clause 21, which is part of this group? It
relates to the duty to ensure that there is inclusion for children and
young people. That must not just be a comfortable word that we in this
place all use—it has to mean something. In transforming local
services, we must stop making an assumption, even for children and
young people in special schools, that there will not be times when they
will want to access mainstream services. I should add that a large
number of children with special needs currently enjoy mainstream
education with appropriate support. We need to underpin the spectrum of
provision, whether in the form of education or other local provisions,

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:35:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Washington and Sunderland West
(Mrs Hodgson), who led for the Opposition. She rightly
focused on education, which is vital in bringing out the talents and
abilities of children, and recognised that these issues should, at
every level—for education, certainly, but also employment,
health matters and so on—be person-centred. My hon. Friend will
agree when I say that disabled people are one of the groups that are
the furthest away from the employment market, and education has an
impact on that. Disabled people are twice as likely to be unemployed as
their non-disabled peers. In 2012, the Office for Disability Issues
estimated that 46% of working age disabled people are in
employment, compared with 76% of working age non-disabled
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:36:24"></hs_TimeCode>.

am joint chair, with Lord Rix, of the all-party group on learning
disability. We have achieved a great deal, but we still have much more
to do. One of the key features of the Bill, for example, under clause
19 is the move to involve young people and children under the age of 16
in decisions about their special educational needs provision. Children
and young people with special educational needs, particularly those
with a learning disability, have trouble reading and understanding
material unless it is fully effective, and that applies to Braille and
other things.</hs_Para>

localism is appropriate and schools should be judged on how well they
are doing, there nevertheless ought to be standards that are accepted

that although these matters have been devolved to the Scottish
Parliament, the annual economic and fiscal settlement has to bear the
Barnett formula in mind, so it is as appropriate to discuss these
issues in England as it is in the devolved institutions.</hs_Para>

that this means using easy read formats for blind or partially sighted

to conclude on this note. On the issues that we are dealing
with—education, health, care and social matters—coming
back to the child and the family is vital. Before I sit down, I shall
give one example. A few years ago, I was invited to an exhibition in
Glasgow organised by the National Autistic Society demonstrating some
of the wonderful work in art and music that young people with autism
were nevertheless able to produce. The VIPs opening the exhibition
stood beside a particularly impressive painting, but as we listened to
the speeches we were discouraged by the noise that one of the children
was making, until we realised that this beautiful painting, which we
had all admired, was painted by that young woman. That is the
opportunity. We can do it. We can deliver for special educational
needs. I hope that as the Bill progresses through both Houses, it will
be seen as a major step in that noble

framework for SEN will cover children and young people from birth all
the way to age 25. We should not underestimate the significance of
these changes. They will deliver a process for assessing and meeting

amendments have a common theme: to ensure that nothing in the Bill
reduces the centrality of parents in making decisions for their
children. I am particularly concerned to ensure that local authorities
do not use the Bill to seek to change the balance in their relationship
with the parents of children with special educational needs. I wish the
Bill to enhance, not diminish, the role, power and influence of
parents. I have particular concerns about parents who have chosen to
educate their children at home. From discussions with the Minister, I
know it is not the Government’s intention to undermine the
parental role, but unless that is made clear in the Bill, there will
always be the risk that these things will creep

is why I have proposed amendment 59. It would insert a new subsection

to the right of parents to make their own arrangements for their
children, in accordance with the Education Act 1996. Without this, the
possibility will remain that local authorities might try to steamroller
home-educating parents, who are only trying to do the right thing by
their children. I am not saying it will necessarily happen, certainly
not in all cases, but it is conceivable. My amendment is intended to
prevent the situation from arising, whether through sins of omission or
of commission. That is to say, the aim is to prevent local authorities

amendments to clause 23 are designed to focus the authority’s

62 is designed to underline the importance of parents’ and young
people’s roles in developing SEN arrangements with local

evidence that parents should be given a clearer mandate in this part of
the Bill. This sentiment was expressed by bodies such as the National
Autistic Society and the National Network of Parent Carer Forums. Brian
Gale of the National Deaf Children’s Society pointed out that
the list of local partners overwhelmingly represented the provider
interest and did too little to give a voice to children, young people
and their parents. Including parent carer forums on the list would
improve the situation, so I hope the Minister will give it careful

63 is similarly designed to safeguard parents’ rights. It would
amend the wording of clause 42(5). It outlines the situation
where a local authority or a 
<?notus-xml column=203?>health commissioning body is not obliged to arrange the specified
educational or health provision set out under an EHC plan. As drafted,
these bodies do not have to make provision for a child if the parent
has made “suitable alternative arrangements”. This
“suitability” requirement implies that someone in
authority will have to decide whether the parents’ arrangements
are suitable. It is another feast for the lawyers. This requirement
would be inherently subjective and risk introducing uncertainty, which
the Government are keen to eradicate, into the system My amendment
substitutes this phrasing for that of section 7 of the Education Act,
which currently already requires such arrangements to be suitable for a
child’s age, ability, aptitude and any special educational
needs. It is a much more specific formulation and will therefore avoid
the definitional pitfall.</hs_Para>

serves a second purpose, by emphasising that clause 42(2) and (3) do
not apply when parents have made appropriate arrangements and when they
have chosen not to receive assistance with making provision. It is
incredibly important that when parents are home educating and seeking
to make suitable provision, local authorities do not opt out of
offering support. It is essential that they continue to provide that
support. They do not have to be in overall control of the situation or
in charge before they fulfil that
responsibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000490" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000490">Finally,
my amendment 64 is designed to prevent local authorities from washing
their hands of home-educating parents. Clause 45 describes the
circumstances in which a local authority may cease to maintain an EHC
plan for a child or young person. My amendment would ensure that the
Bill expressly provided that local authorities cannot cease to maintain
an EHC plan solely because a child or young person is being educated
other than at school. In the absence of an EHC plan, local authorities
might argue that because a child is out of the school system, they are
not under a duty to provide anything and therefore the plan does not
need to be maintained. Home-educating families need to be protected
against any such reading of the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000491" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000491">The
amendment again may be accused of taking an unduly pessimistic view of
how local authorities may interpret this Bill, but local authorities
have a track record of interpreting the rules in ways that best suit
their own purposes. They often find home education anomalous and thus
something from which they would seek to remove help. Unless protections
are built into the Bill, parents of children with SEN will continue to
be concerned that they may lose out to unduly officious local town hall
bureaucrats. My amendment would put that right and, in doing so, would
put the issue beyond all doubt.</hs_Para>

may suggest that this is a matter for the new SEN code of practice, but
experience has made it clear that it is unsafe to rely on guidance
where there is ambiguity within the education itself. In education, as
elsewhere, one size does not fit all and the Bill should recognise
that, build it into the system and provide reassurance to thousands of
young people and their
parents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000493">If
I may, I will briefly touch on a couple of other issues. I welcome new
clause 8 and congratulate the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr Sanders) on
introducing it. Requiring schools to have a robust policy in place to
safeguard and support children with health conditions such as asthma
and diabetes would represent a positive  
<?notus-xml column=204?>step forward. Many schools have such a policy in place independently but
too many do not. Last week, my office met the Crawforth family from my
constituency. Their son suffers from type 1 diabetes. He is one of
29,000 children in the UK who live with the condition, yet a study by
Diabetes UK in 2009 found that in only 29% of cases did school staff
help with insulin injections. In 47 % of cases, someone other than a
member of school staff helps the young person with blood glucose
testing, including parents in 42% f these
cases.</hs_Para>

am mindful of your strictures on time, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I
would like to speak in support of amendment No. 43, tabled by my hon.
Friend the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland). I am concerned that
requiring local authorities to review the continuance of EHC plans for
young people aged over 18 with specific regard to their age may make it
more likely that support would be curtailed or dropped altogether on
the basis that the young person would be deemed to have made the
transition into adulthood. This concern is heightened by paragraph 231
of the explanatory notes to the Bill, which explains the thinking
behind clause 45. It gives examples of potential stages at which EHC
plans can be amended or replaced. These include the end of a specified
phase of a young person’s education or when a young person
becomes a NEET. This runs contrary to the recommendations made by my
Committee in our report, where we acknowledge the particular position
of NEETs and apprenticeships and the potential of EHC plans to assist
young people with SEN into constructive employment. We recommended that
the Bill should provide entitlement to EHC plans both to NEETs of
compulsory participation age and to young people who are undertaking
apprenticeships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000498" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000498">We

the case of two learners with profound deafness who were then on marine
engineering apprenticeships. They had to have signers to help them with
their training. These are precisely the young people who need extra
support in order to follow their ambitions so they can get on and make
a success of their lives. The amendment deserves support and clause

final remarks will be on the local offer. Getting that right will be
essential to ensuring that the Bill overall helps young people. I am
confident that those who get an EHC plan will be in a better situation
than 
<?notus-xml column=205?>those under the previous regime of statements. In fact, it is essential
to ensure not that it is easier to get a plan—the Minister,
surprisingly in my view, said he wanted to make that case. I hope that
there will be fewer people having plans than under statements, not
because there is an effort to guide them away from them, but because
local offers meet so many of the needs of parents and young people that
there is not a requirement for the bureaucratic involvement that will
be required even in our streamlined EHC
system.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/4F87381EDB66DB2DB3ECECB0F5C0B2B3C5767034" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 June 2013">Tuesday

the consideration that schools give to students with long-term

with staff often unaware of the implications of the disease, let alone
able to help children with their
condition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:07:59"></hs_TimeCode>. This

the centre is the impact on child health. A school environment that
does not include basic precautions or simple awareness training can
lead to complications 
<?notus-xml column=208?>arising from diabetes. For example, a child experiencing hyperglycemia
is at risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially fatal complication.
More than 3,000 children experience this every year, at significant
cost to the health care system and obviously considerable anxiety to
parents and families, most tragically in the 2% of cases that result in
death. Anything we can do to reduce this prevalence must be
imperative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:08:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000518" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000518">There
are more general problems, however. All too often, schools do not have
adequate plans in place to deal with the day-to-day needs of those with
long-term conditions. That leads to children being made to feel
separate and neglected, leaving them more open to bullying, and can
also have a detrimental impact on their education. Diabetes and other
long-term conditions should have no impact on a child’s ability
to learn—they do not have special educational needs—but
if those conditions are not managed appropriately in the classroom,
they will impede a child’s
education.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000519" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0002.htm#13061171000519">Ideally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:09:27"></hs_TimeCode>,

had visited the school to put a necessary care plan in place. It was
clear on the first day of school that the plan was inadequate.

and was certainly not suitable for a four-year-old. Importantly, it
stated that the child should test his own blood levels—something
he had never done before and something that no one would expect a

earlier. Diabetic children do not need to be taken out of class; they
simply need a hygienic environment in which to test their blood sugar
levels during the day, and to be allowed to eat in the classroom, or go
outside to eat, in order to boost their blood sugar levels. It helps
everyone if the staff understand those needs and explain them to other
pupils. In that way, the children can learn that many of us will have a
medical condition—not necessarily diabetes—at some time
in our life. There is a whole spectrum of medical conditions, and
treating children who suffer from them separately is worse than
providing for them within the mainstream and within the normal school
settings. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>All

Committee, I mentioned a specific subject, and I am pleased to see that
the Secretary of State has taken it up. My constituency has a
significant number of military families who, by dint of their career
paths, are frequently moved around the country. A disproportionate
number of those families with children with special educational needs,
having secured a statement in one part of the country, are then moved
elsewhere through no fault of their own. This can result in their
having to go back to square one in the process. I am therefore
delighted that new clause 9 takes account of that in seeking to make
the EHC plans far more portable, so that families who have already been

desperate to buy their own property, and as Westminster is a
phenomenally expensive borough to live in, they were hoping to move to
another part of London. They felt constrained from doing so, however,
because they felt that if they left Westminster, where they had secured
Mohammed’s statement, they would have difficulty in ensuring
that their new borough would continue to provide for his education at
TreeHouse school. Such was the importance to him of that school that
they were not prepared to put his education at risk. Instead, they have
continued to rent a home in Westminster, even though their long-term

share the aim of my hon. Friend’s amendment 46, which is to
ensure that education and social care provision is sufficient to meet
the needs of children and young people with SEN and to promote
improvements in that provision, but that should be balanced with the
need to retain local decision making; that point seemed to unite the
House in the debate we have just had. Local authorities, schools and
other services must determine spending on provision for
children and young people with special educational needs, taking
account of their legal responsibilities. Clause 27(3) would require
local authorities to consult a wide range of people and organisations
in reviewing provision, including, importantly, children and young
people with special educational needs and their parents, but placing a
specific legal duty on them to improve special educational and social
care provision until everyone consulted agrees it is sufficient would
be impractical, as views of different people and groups would
inevitably
differ<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>. Local

want to see the local offer trigger, and stipulating minimum standards

constrain parents’ ability to influence a local authority, which

integrated approach to meeting the needs of children and young people.
I share the goal of amendment 44—integrated health and social

be included. Amendment 44 would add unnecessary bureaucracy and hinder
pragmatic decision making. I am alive to the case studies that my hon.

37 seeks a specific duty on authorities to deliver social care

I fully expect that local authorities will provide care services to
meet assessed needs. In the case of disabled children, the Chronically

the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson), among others, has also raised
this issue. Clause 21(5) fulfils an undertaking I gave during
pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill that we would maintain existing
protections, including case law. The subsection was included to
preserve the current position whereby, of course, there is no duty to
secure the health provision in plans. Amendment 39 goes further than
current case law and would define all social care and health care

In Committee, I set out the well-established complaint procedures for

appeal to the tribunal about health and social care provision, where
that is mainly for the purposes of education and training. While
strengthening the role of health and social care in the assessment
process and laying a new duty to provide the health provision set out
in a plan, we have maintained the focus on special educational
provision in the Bill and as was set out in the Green Paper. It is

inadequate. It is shameful that successive Governments have gone for so
many years with a significant minority

a condition or a flare-up that requires action, they get sent off to
hospital, or their parents get called, whereas if the school had
trained someone up, it could meet that need. This is not good enough.
The Minister has done so much under the Bill; this is another area

why some are able to manage medicines effectively and others are not.
That suggests to me that there is not necessarily a direct relation to
the legislative framework that they are working under, and that it is
down to differences in practice and to the school’s commitment
to dealing with the issue. As I say, I am not stopping the discussion
at this juncture. I am sure that there will be other opportunities for
us to explore what more we can do. Reissuing the guidance is an

has a plan that names a school as the appropriate environment in which
to receive his or her education, parents will still be able to decide
to home-educate; that is an important point. If they do, the local
authority must assure itself that the parents are providing an
education in accordance with section 7 of the Education Act
1996—that is, a full-time education that is suitable for the
child’s age, ability, aptitude and special educational needs. If
the local authority is so assured, it will be relieved of its duty to
make the special educational provision set out in the plan, just as it
is now with regard to statements. However, local authorities will
continue to have the power to help parents to make suitable provision
in the home by providing support services. To take on the right hon.

they have SEN, which takes us back to the previous Parliament, where we
had many of these discussions. I can assure him that this is not the
case. Clause 23 sets out which children and young people local
authorities are responsible for under this part of the Bill. These will
be children and young people who have already been identified by the
authority or who have been brought to the authority’s attention
as having, or possibly having, SEN. There is not that overarching

63 seeks to tie the definition of the suitability of any alternative

unnecessary as the provision in the amendment is already contained

where it was decided it was no longer needed to meet the child’s
needs. Moreover, the new duty on commissioning bodies to arrange the
health provision in the plan and the greater expectation that the
social care provision will be made will mean that parents can expect
that these will continue to be provided. There is further scope within

already made, a successful transition into adult life. The Education
Committee recommended that we clarify whether there is an entitlement
to special education provision up to age 25. The requirement to have
regard to age makes it clear that there is not. However, I can
categorically assure my hon. Friend that no young person who needs an
education, health and care plan to complete or consolidate their
learning can be denied one just because they are over 18. Local

institutions must be part of this Bill. Local authorities are not
responsible for the education of young people in higher education and
it would be unreasonable to hold them accountable for securing special

students’ allowance. DSAs are not means-tested, are awarded in
addition to the standard package of support and do not have to be
repaid. We should not seek to duplicate or replace that system when it
appears predominantly to be working well. In the academic year 2010-11,
DSA provided 47,400 full-time students with support totalling
£109.2 million. The Government also provided £13 million
to HEIs in 2012-13 through the disability premium to help them recruit
and support disabled students, and in 2013-14 that figure will rise to

includes sharing the EHC plan with the university, with the young

and has made an early application so that support is in place when
their university course begins, on which the hon. Member for Washington

ensuring continuity of health and care services where those continue to
be required by the young person. In addition, we will work with those

I will comment on new clauses 6 and 7. As the House knows, we have
proposals, on which we have consulted, for providers with highly
qualified staff to be able to operate more flexible staff-to-child
ratios, in line with best practice in leading European countries such
as France, Holland and Germany. I highlight the fact that these
proposals would be entirely optional for nurseries and are about
empowering the front line.</hs_Para>

proposals received support from, among others, Sir Martin Narey,
formerly of Barnado’s, and Sir Michael Wilshaw of Ofsted. I
firmly believe that these flexibilities would allow nurseries to offer
more choice of high-quality child care places to parents, invest
additional revenue in attracting the best staff, and reduce costs for
parents. However, as I made clear on the media this morning, it has not
been possible to reach cross-Government agreement, so we are not
proceeding with this reform.</hs_Para>

which relate to the history of how child care systems have developed in
different countries. France, for example, has a long tradition of the
école maternelle, which involves structured, teacher-led
learning from an early age. That has been shown to improve outcomes for
children, particularly those from the lowest income backgrounds. Our

under the current employer-supported child care voucher scheme, which

total amount being spent on overheads. At present, only 5% of employers
offer employer-supported child care, and only a fifth of employees are
eligible for it. Those who are self-employed do not have access to it,
and whether a parent can or cannot get it is a lottery. Strangely, as
more than one parent can claim employer-supported child care, in some
cases there are two claimants for one child. That means that the costs
for one child could be covered more than for a single parent with
several children, and that is neither a sensible nor fair way to

available to any working family, except where one or both earners pay
the additional rate of income tax. It will be on a per-child basis and

Tax-free child care means that around 2.5 million families will now
have access to support. That support will be worth the same as the
basic rate of income tax at 20% of costs, making child care costs
effectively tax free. It will mean that the average family with two
children will receive up to £2,400 each year. Those on lower
incomes will continue to have 70% of their child care costs paid

28 is a technical amendment and introduces a transitional provision to

authorities have an important role in early education and child care.
Local authorities and their local agencies—family information
services or Sure Start children’s centres—have a vital
part to play in helping families who need support and in championing
the interests of children. For example, local authorities have made
strong progress on securing early learning for
two-year-olds—some 55,000 children are already benefiting from
places throughout the country. I am working with the Department of
Health to ensure that services are more closely integrated, and that
the two-and-a-half-year-old check is in place in 2015, which will help
in that regard. We need to ensure that families get the help they need,
and that a seamless service is provided by children’s centres,
with both the Department for Education and the Department of Health
contributing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000642">I
want local authorities to continue to work to attract high-quality
providers to their area, and to encourage schools to offer more nursery
places and school-based child care. At present, there is a big gap
between the proportions of outstanding providers in different local
authority areas. As I have said, we are supporting Ofsted with
increased funds to increase the number of Her Majesty’s
inspectors. Sir Michael Wilshaw has announced his intention to focus
more on weaker providers. Ofsted is to trial an improvement programme
with nurseries and pre-schools that are not yet “good” in
three London boroughs in the next few weeks to show how this approach
might work. Local authorities are also empowered to offer support and
training. The intention of the clause is to get rid of unnecessary
bureaucracy, so that local authorities can focus on these important
functions. I want to see a shift from process and bureaucracy to
focusing on what matters: outcomes for children.</hs_Para>

Government have got themselves into a complete shambles. With every
passing week, it becomes more and more apparent that Ministers do not
have a credible plan to tackle the child care crisis they have created.
Under this Government, parents are facing a triple whammy: costs are
rising faster than wages and even general inflation, with the average
cost having risen by almost 20% since 2010; support from the Government
for those on tax credits has been cut, meaning that some families are
up to £1,500 a year worse off; and there is a real struggle to
find places in some areas owing to the cuts in supply-side subsidies
and direct provision, such as through children’s centres. Since
the election, we have lost almost 900 nurseries and more than 1,500
child minders, and there are 500 fewer Sure Start children’s
centres.</hs_Para>

is no wonder, therefore, that the Prime Minister panicked and plucked
the Children’s Minister from the Back Benches to implement her
ideas without even bothering to check whether they were any good. The
main idea to come out of “More great
childcare”—increasing the number of children each adult
can look after—is the worst one, and we are pleased to hear that
it has been dropped. The Minister has been told categorically, most
notably by advisers commissioned by her own Department, that it was not
a good idea from the start, yet still she persisted with it.</hs_Para>

objection to childminder agencies, particularly if they are voluntary.
What the Government say they want to achieve through such agencies is
all very sensible: greater co-operation and peer support for
childminders, as well as access to training and help with gaining
bursaries. Childminder agencies will also be a single point of contact
for parents who might need a mix of child care solutions. These are all
good things that make for a vibrant childminder sector, and are all
things that local authority childminder networks and family information
services should be providing at the

the publication of this Bill, the Department has been consulting on
removing many of those duties from local authorities—such as

seems to be a clear sign that the Government want local authorities
almost completely removed from the child care equation and that
agencies are therefore the preferred configuration for
childminders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000680"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:41:10"></hs_TimeCode>Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:39:43"></hs_TimeCode>
that the Minister has said that there will be no direct funding from
the Government for agencies to provide those services, the implication
is that there will be a cost to the childminder. That cost will in turn
have to be passed on to the parents, because most childminders do not
earn the sort of money that would allow them to soak up the kind of
membership fee or commission that we might expect an agency to demand.
The most recent 
<?notus-xml column=236?>childcare costs survey from the Daycare Trust found that childminder
fees were already increasing by an average of more than 5%, year on
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:40:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000681" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000681">Of
course, as all the parent surveys tell us, cost is a secondary issue to
quality, and it is the end of individual inspections by Ofsted that is
the most worrying reform. Parents really value the fact that their
childminder has proved their effectiveness to Ofsted. A
National Childminding Association survey last year found that 80% of
parents thought that individual inspections were important, and that
75% might not choose a childminder without the reassurance of an
individual inspection. Childminders value the inspections too: 80% felt
that moving to an agency model of inspection would have a detrimental
effect on their professionalism, and they are obviously concerned that
this would put parents off using them as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:40:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000682" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000682">Of

without first consulting on it and establishing consensus. I would

On new clause 10, the Minister made great play of
introducing tax-free child care, but she should be clearer in her
closing remarks about what exactly that means, as I fear she is
misdescribing something. What she seems to be proposing is that after
people have passed through many hoops, including having both parents
working and receiving certain levels of income, 20% is paid, which is
not tax-free for the higher rate taxpayer. I want her to clarify this
point: she talked about those paying additional tax not qualifying, so
will she explain what tax threshold this will and will not apply to, so
people who might be affected can know about

long period, or is retired, which is not beyond the bounds of
possibility? Does the Minister have any plans to extend this as a
general policy to parents of over-fives? A chef in my constituency on
£15,000 or so a year raised with me the challenges of getting
child care out of hours, a situation faced by many people, both with
over-fives and with under-fives. I hope that she will give us some
indication of her thinking on this matter. Will she tell us when she is
planning to lay regulations on this issue, so that we can all be alert
in order to tackle that?</hs_Para>

new clauses 6 and 7, I will be generous to the Minister. She said that
the fact that she has lost support—perhaps could not corral
support across Whitehall—is not stopping her push for
“affordable, quality child care available to all.” On
that last sentence she and I are united as one, but, sadly, I disagree
with her approach. If that really was what was being proposed, I would
be a greater supporter of hers, but I am concerned about
misrepresentation: little ideas presented as big solutions. We need a
longer-term vision about child care provision for our under-fives and
our older children, and we must ensure that we see that as an
investment in those young 
<?notus-xml column=239?>people and, in particular, in women, in enabling them to work. However,

quality of care. That is a legacy of the late Lady Thatcher’s
years in government and it has not improved in all that time. I do not
want private companies to come in, cream off a profit and cut the
income of the childminders, who, in my area, consider themselves as
small businesses. The number of childminders has reduced because a lot
were on the list for local authorities but were not active, so as soon
as that list was tidied up they dropped off it. A number of those to
whom that happened were poor quality and did not want to have the
scrutiny of Ofsted or any other authority, because they were the
“pile ’em high, stack ’em cheap” sort of
childminder that the Minister seems to favour.</hs_Para>

Hillier:</Member></B> That is my worry. What exactly is an
“agency”? We hear one description from bits of government
and other descriptions from some of the organisations outside,
including Ofsted. If the Minister is saying, as she has indicated, that
some part of this move is about sharing professional experience and
providing support to professional colleagues, I can tell her that my
childminder network in Hackney does that very effectively in any case,
so does it count as an agency? I have suggested that it thinks about
setting one up. If it was to work in collaboration with the local
authority or with the local Sure Start centres in smaller areas, would
it then count as an agency? In the attempts to trial some of the
elements, is the Minister being prescriptive or is she allowing 1,000
flowers to bloom? If it is the latter, what is to prevent the bad,
rapacious private agencies from 
<?notus-xml column=240?>coming in, taking over, dominating in an area and
becoming a local monopoly? There is a real concern about that.

Loughton:</Member></B> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for taking up most
of the remaining debating time in reading out the list of the remaining
new clauses and amendments in the group. It is unfortunate that we have
a large group of new clauses and amendments here, covering a very wide
variety of important subjects to do with personal, social and health
education, foster care continuing support, young carers, care leaver
assistants, birth registration, adoption and so on, and yet we are left
with barely an hour, particularly for Back Benchers who have not had
the opportunity in Committee to point out things that we think are
missing from the Bill or things that could be improved. On Second
Reading we were time-limited in our contributions, too. I have taken a
lot of time in making that point, but it needed to be put on the
record<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:57:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000749" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000749">I
will speak as quickly as possible to the nine amendments and new
clauses that I have tabled. In doing so, I want to signify my sympathy
with new clause 4, tabled
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:57:42"></hs_TimeCode> the right
hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins), on continuing
support for foster children, which is important. I know there are
various problems with the way in which the amendment has been
fashioned. I support new clause 22, tabled
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:57:56"></hs_TimeCode> my hon.
Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom), on birth

clause 3, the lead amendment in the group, is the one I want to speak
least about; in the circumstances, I will limit my comments. It relates
to the performance regulations, which need to be brought into the
21st century. We did considerable work on that within the
Department for Education. They are 50 years out of date. We only had to
look at the “Britain’s Got Talent” finals and
heats the other day to see that a number of child performers are now
taking part in such talent shows. We need to be absolutely assured that
children are able to perform—strut their stuff, demonstrate
their talents—in a safe way that is appropriate to their
growing-up stage, and are not being pushed into it.</hs_Para>

the new clause I have set out in some detail the amendments that need
to be made to the regulations, which were drafted in the 1960s. That is
the result of a lot of work, done by members of the working group that
I reassembled under Sarah Thane, who produced an excellent report at
the tail end of the previous Government. Importantly, my new clause 3
also gives a practical and usable definition of
“performance”, which the primary legislation fails to do,
and really needs to do. I commend it to the Government. Although the
consultation seemed to prove inconclusive, there is a clear wish to
make sure that child performance regulations are brought up to date.
The revelations about Jimmy Savile have only made that more
urgent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000752" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000752">New
clause 11 is about ensuring the sufficiency of accommodation for
children in care. This should be happening already under section 22 of
the Children Act 1989, but it is not. Under that Act, we
should be prioritising locally sourced accommodation for children in
care. A number of working parties were set up last July, in my time in
the Department for Education, to look at how we can improve the system.
There is a real 
<?notus-xml column=251?>problem when 4,890 looked-after children are housed in children’s
homes, 50% of which are concentrated in just three regions: the
north-west, the west midlands and the south-east. Some 44% of children
in those children’s homes are placed out of their placing area,
28% of them more than 20 miles away from it. The figure for all
looked-after children is 12%. Little wonder that so many
children—a disproportionate number—run away or go missing
from many of these children’s residential
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000753" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000753">We
need to take the opportunity of this legislation to make sure that we
have much more robust guidance and instruction for local authorities
about placing children much closer to where they come from, if that is
possible without affecting their welfare—closer to anchor links
with extended family members or friends—and making it possible
for them to stay at the same school. It is crazy that we are spending
more than £1 billion on placing 9% of the in-care population in
children’s residential homes. That is from a total budget of
just over £3 billion.</hs_Para>

would beef up the regulations for placing authorities. If they do not
have economies of scale, they should look to federate with neighbouring
authorities, so that they can set up or buy places closer to
home—much more smart commissioning is required—rather
than spot-purchasing, which makes for costly placements that are often
not of the best. Too often, the placements end up in completely
inappropriate areas, often in cheaper, coastal properties—my
constituency of Worthing is subject to this—where there are
serious concerns about the safety of the environment in which children
have been
placed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061171000755" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000755">At

10. It is two years since that recommendation was made. In their
response to it, the Government said that they accepted all its
principles. It is about time to get on with it, and the new clause
would be a practical one in the 
<?notus-xml column=252?>Bill to give a clear indication to local authorities that early help is
an important part of caring for vulnerable children. It is a social
gain and it will be a financial gain from avoiding the costs when those
children get into trouble later on if they are not given the
appropriate support and care that they need at an early
stage.</hs_Para>

clause 13 is about serious case reviews. The Children Act 1989
introduced a local authority duty to investigate when a child who lives
or is found in their area is suffering or is likely to suffer
significant harm. The guidance produced in 1991 instructed area child
protection committees to conduct investigations or part 8 reviews. They
were beefed up into serious case reviews after the Laming inquiry and
parts of the Children Act in 2004. Again, they were beefed up in the
“working together” revisions in 2009, and in June 2010,
the new Government required all future serious case reviews to be
published in full, subject to various criteria and subject to anonymity
and redaction. That was the right thing to do.</hs_Para>

problem, as I warned at the time, is that the Government and the
Minister do not have the power to force local safeguarding children
boards to commission those reports in the first place. They have the
power to force them to publish them once produced, but not the power to
commission them in the first place. I am afraid that the figures have
borne out my concerns, because between June 2010 and November 2012,
some 147 serious case reviews were initiated by local
safeguarding children’s boards. In each of the previous two
years, the number of serious case reviews was around 130 to 136, so we
have effectively halved the number of serious case reviews. Alas, that
is not because the number of serious incidents happening has halved. I
fear there are still far too many unnecessary deaths and far too much
child cruelty happening. But serious case reviews that should have been
commissioned have not been.</hs_Para>

Nicholas Dann, head of international development at the Air Accidents
Investigation Branch, which was an interesting analogy about how
accidents/incidents happen and how we learn from them. But we need to
disseminate best practice and the lessons of poor practice as well.
That body should retain, monitor and approve a list of suitable
authors, and make sure that their qualifications are sufficient that
they can continue to be commissioned to author serious case reviews.
That panel will have the power to challenge local safeguarding boards
not initiating SCRs, but it does not have any statutory teeth, and this
is the only opportunity we will have to give statutory teeth to the
Secretary of State to be able to say, “You must commission a

clause 14 is a contentious one that I shall speak briefly on. It is
traditional for any children’s Bill to have some opportunity to
raise the issue of smacking, and I am amazed that no other amendments

smacking. I do not support any changes in the way that parents chastise
their children, but there is a problem with madrassahs and other
supplementary schools. It is a difficult problem that has been left on
the back burner. It was addressed by Sir Roger Singleton when he

I have tabled three amendments on adoption. I have mentioned why
adoption needs to be a priority. Many good things have happened in the
past two and a half years on adoption, and I am very pleased that the
Minister is committed to carrying that work on. The number of children
given the opportunity to be adopted has been increasing, although
numbers alone are not the be-all and end-all; it is the quality of the
placements that really matters.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:15:30"></hs_TimeCode> adoption
scorecards that were introduced a year ago lay out with full
transparency how well an authority is doing compared with other
authorities across a whole range of measures. We have the adoption
gateway to help recruitment, we are speeding up legal proceedings for
children left in limbo, we are bringing in and beefing up fostering for
adoption, we have the adoption support services that I mentioned, and
many other things are happening.
All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:15:05"></hs_TimeCode> that amounts
to a very serious structural overhaul, and it is beginning to work, so
we do not want to go and mess it up. I fear that in this Bill, the
Government, with the best intentions, are going too
far.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13061171000838" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000838">5.15

the thorny question of assessment and recruitment, many local
authorities do not do it well or nearly well enough; many independent
adoption agencies do it much better. However, do we really need a
blanket power that threatens to take away from every local authority in
the country the capacity to recruit, assess and approve the functions
of adopters? There should be the underlying threat that the Secretary
of State has the power to take away that capacity from individual
authorities that just do not “get it”—that
continue to fail to improve their adoption support services and
therefore fail these vulnerable children.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061171000774" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0003.htm#13061171000774">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:19:19"></hs_TimeCode>,
a blanket threat to take away the right from all local authorities will
disincentivise them from continuing to improve, and they may well not
continue to invest in good recruitment and assessment. The voluntary
sector is way off having the capacity to pick up those sorts of
activities in the necessary
numbers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:16:34"></hs_TimeCode>. In
amendment 29, I ask for a breathing space—a moratorium of five
years before clause 3 is introduced. Amendment 3 would take out the
blanket provision, which is not needed at this time. It is a bit of a
slap in the face for local authorities, a good number of which, though
not nearly enough, are doing a good job and do “get it”.
However, the Secretary of State should have the power to take that
right away from those which do

amendment deals with a very practical point. One of the things holding
back independent agencies from recruiting more adopters is that they do
not get paid until there is an inter-agency fee when a child is placed
with a couple. If we were to pay a bounty fee so that they were paid
for their time and effort in training and recruiting every appropriate
adopter couple who passed muster, that would enable them to go out and
recruit more; many independent adoption agencies do that well. This
would be a good, practical measure to recruit more adopters, whom we
all know we desperately need. Please let us not throw out the baby with
the bathwater.</hs_Para>

did not even understand the concept of consent. Our view is that we are
failing to equip young people with the knowledge, skills and resilience
they need to keep themselves safe. We must do much more to tackle child
abuse, but more importantly we must prevent it from happening in the
first place.</hs_Para>

We think that all children should have the opportunity to access
age-appropriate sex and relationship education. In a departmental
report on personal, social, health and economic education, young people
said that they valued the chance to express views safely and ask
questions, and felt that that had improved their relationship with
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:20:21"></hs_TimeCode>. We
believe that parents should retain the right to withdraw children aged
15 or under because they know their children best, but equally we know
that the vast majority of parents would like their children to have
access to sex and relationship education. For children whose parents do
not talk to them about these issues, this could be critical in keeping
them safe, especially given that a third of 
<?notus-xml column=256?>girls say that they have experienced unwanted

do not put speed before getting it right for children. It would ensure
that children are not placed in fostering or adoption placements either
before it has been decided that adoption is the plan or, in the

this at length in Committee, so I will not labour the point, but that

seems to me that placing children in fostering or adoption placements

possibly within a week, before placing the child and then considering
their wishes and feelings about whether adoption is suitable and the
placement is the right one runs the risk of putting more people off
adopting, as many Members have pointed out, and of more adoption

with trained judges and barristers, and the restriction of multiple

tabled new clause 18 notwithstanding our strong opposition to the

Ministers share our concerns about the acute shortage of foster carers
and adopters, we do not make the situation worse. We were struck by the

any independence in the evaluation and, if so, who is conducting it?
What, if any, evidence has been collected over the past two and a half

amendments 36 and 37 would ensure that children’s views and
sibling arrangements are taken into account when courts scrutinise or

to focus courts on the long-term aspects of care plans, we are
concerned that, in the real world, the acute pressures on social
workers, independent reviewing officers and guardians will mean that
important aspects may be missed. Does the Minister have anything
concrete to report from the discussion that he was holding with
independent reviewing officers about how he will alleviate that
pressure? Court scrutiny has helped social workers to ensure that
they have access to resources and has changed care plans to
allow sibling contact. I was grateful for the Minister’s
assurances in Committee that there is nothing to prevent courts from
looking at this matter, but given the pressure that family courts are

we should understand the important role that sex education provides, we

must provide sex education by law, and although there is no centrally
determined curriculum, governors and teachers, in conversation and
consultation with parents, should develop a curriculum on a
school-by-school basis, according to the ethos of the school. When

a good school should always contact parents to let them know when the
sex education curriculum is taught, precisely so that they can follow
up with their own conversations at home. The current procedures
encourage parental involvement, but new clause 20 would serve only to
diminish it. I cannot agree that that is the right approach at a time
when many people are concerned that we live in a society in which
opportunities for parental involvement and influence need strengthening
and encouraging, not reducing and diminishing. Throughout this
afternoon’s debate, I have repeatedly heard Ministers and others
say how important it is to take into account parents’ views with
regard to other aspects of education. Surely that should apply in this

approach—far from it. There is tremendous room for improvement
in our relationship and sex education, not least the fact that greater
emphasis needs to be placed on the duty to consult parents and
communicate clearly with them about what is being taught. Some head
teachers believe they must exclusively use whatever resources are
recommended by their local authority, but in fact a plethora of other
good materials provided by outside agencies can be used, such as the
Evaluate: Informing Choice programme. Other head teachers do not accept
that the decision should be for the governing body, which has a vital
role. I encourage governors actively to take up that role in all

campaigner, along with the Fostering Network, for allowing young people
leaving care to remain with their foster carers until they are at least
21. Currently, children in care leave on or before their
18th birthday, which usually means that children in foster
care must leave their foster carer. Every year, hundreds of the most
vulnerable young people have to leave home at age 17, but the average
age for leaving home in the UK is
24.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192000073">The
statistics on outcomes for care leavers are not good. One third of
those living on the streets have a background in care, and almost a
quarter of the adult prison population have spent time in care. Local
authorities have a duty in care planning guidance to ensure that young
people leave their foster care when they are ready and not before, but
in 2011-12 only 320 young people—5%—remained with their
foster carers after they reached age 18. Research shows that the longer
a young person can stay with a foster family, the more successful they

2008, the Labour Government set up a “staying put” pilot
to assess the benefits of allowing children to stay in care and with

family relationships and stability make a positive difference to young
people in care as they become adults. That is not a surprising
outcome—one of the basic values of our culture is the importance
of families in providing a nurturing and secure base for young people
to make the transition to independence. Not only that, but foster
families can become families for life. My aunt and uncle had long-term
foster children. To this day, contact continues, as we would expect in
other
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192000075">However,
there have been no moves to roll out that scheme. It has been left to
councils to decide what provision to fund. The provision is therefore a
power a council can choose to exercise rather than a duty to provide a
service. In effect, it is a postcode lottery. We have taken the
responsibility of parenting those children, having judged that their
parents’ care is not good enough. In doing so, we have

parenting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192000076">Since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:44:19"></hs_TimeCode>

young people in care have experienced poor parental care, emotional
neglect and abuse, and disruptive care placements. An increasing number
of young people are coming into care in their early teens, often with
complex needs. The care system is failing these children. They are
often the ones who run away or go missing, making them vulnerable to
harm, including child sexual exploitation. It is recognised that we
need to cut the number of out-of-area placements, with local
authorities making placements nearer home. The provision of supported
foster placements will need to be considered as an alternative to
children’s home placements many miles away, so that we can have
more vulnerable children in foster care at 18. Although they are adults
at 18, they are still vulnerable adults, which is demonstrated by

minimal. Loughborough university calculated that on average it cost

bigger public cost in providing services to a future generation of

concerned about sexual violence against women and girls. All of us in
this House are particularly concerned about the extent to which young
people are accessing their information about sex from violent
pornography. The influence of violent pornography is to normalise
distorted relationships. It teaches some young men that it is normal
for women to enjoy violent sex, and to have a total lack of
understanding about what constitutes consent. Disturbingly, many young

violent relationships.</hs_Para>

Young women have had no training in how to say no, or an understanding
that it is okay to say no. Too often, there is no one for them to
confide in. I put it to the House, therefore, that we need to have sex

address the simple decision that the new clause invites Members to
make: do we act to protect children and ban smoking in cars, or do we
leave them to suffer not just the discomfort but the tremendous health
problems they will otherwise encounter? In Committee, there was
considerable sympathy for the intention, with some reservation about
the introduction of an education programme for offenders, but the new

principle of such a ban has gained much support from fellow Members on
both sides of the House. A majority of people understand that smoking
is harmful to our health, particularly the health of children, and most
would not expose children to smoke in a vehicle. In a survey of 10,000
adults carried out by Action on Smoking and Health that included more
than 2,000 smokers and which asked about the car people travelled in
most frequently, only 6% said that people should smoke whenever they
liked. Some 71% said that smoking was not allowed full stop and 9% said
that smoking was not allowed if there were non-smokers or children
travelling.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>Despite that,
however, research from the British Lung Foundation found that more than
51% of eight to 15-year-olds reported exposure to cigarette smoke when

opinion is firmly on the side of change. A survey by YouGov found that
85% of adults in north-east England, where my constituency is situated,
said that they would support laws to ban smoking in cars carrying
under-18s. One factor that sets children apart from other groups is
that they are less likely to have a say on whether they are exposed to
second-hand smoke in a vehicle in which they are travelling.
Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:47:53"></hs_TimeCode> that
passive smoking is particularly harmful to children, we have a recipe
for a public health time bomb. With their quicker respiration rates,
smaller airways, less mature immune systems and greater absorption of
pollutants, children are at an increased risk from passive smoking in
an enclosed space. Passive smoking increases the risk of
a  
<?notus-xml column=264?>number of health problems, ranging from wheezing and asthma to
respiratory infections and bacterial meningitis, and doubles the risk
of sudden infant death.</hs_Para>

attitudes are backed up by survey data from the British Lung Foundation
that shows that many children are uncomfortable with adults smoking
around them, but feel unable to influence smoking behaviours. Some 31%
of children aged eight to 15 exposed to second-hand smoke in a car
reported having asked the smoker to stop. Alarmingly, however, a
greater share—34%—had refrained from asking because they
were either too frightened or embarrassed. As Members of Parliament, it
is our duty to act in the interests of the public we serve and
represent, including children and young people, and it is high time
that we heeded what our young people are telling us. In the interests
of preserving public health, the only way to protect completely against
second-hand smoke is to make homes and cars entirely smoke free. A good
starting point would be to ban smoking in cars when children are
present<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192000090">The
Government’s response to this developing crisis, in the form of
an informative educational campaign that has just been launched, is
certainly welcome, but the message about the dangers of passive smoking
must be spread even wider. We must stop this sort of behaviour, so this
campaign is of course welcome. Private vehicles are considered private
spaces—people argue that it is their private space—but it
is the young person’s private space as well, so I hope that the
House will support my proposal and that the Government will accept it.
Opposing a ban on smoking in private vehicles when children are present
assumes that the right to smoke trumps the right of the child to be
free from harmful smoke. It does not. I have stressed in the past, and
do so again, that this is not just a health issue, but an issue of
child protection. I hope the Government will now accept
it.</hs_Para>

deny that that target is very helpful and we hope that, in most cases,
we will be able to meet it. But we know—for example from the
Norgrove report—that, on average, cases take up to 61 weeks: 48
weeks in family court proceedings. The Justice Committee, of which I am
a member, held an inquiry into the operation of family courts. In its

taken with regard to the target as well. Clause 14 provides the
starting point for courts in setting a time for cases; proceedings
should come to an end within 26 weeks, as I mentioned. But there is
some ambiguity as to when courts should deem an extension appropriate.
As the College of Social Work and the Family Rights Group have argued,
there is a genuine risk that the proposed 26-week limit could result in
too much focus on procedure and not enough on the welfare of the
child.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192000099">The
vast majority of cases will be concluded within six months, but
deciding on permanent options can take longer for some children, not
always due to problems with the court process or unnecessary delay.
Social workers will attest that situations can change in the course of
proceedings; for example, when relatives present themselves as possible
carers late in the process. The Family Rights Group has pointed out
that, under the new limit, if family members are late in offering
themselves as carers there may well not be enough time for the relevant
assessments to be carried out.</hs_Para>

placing a child with grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins or other

anticipate that Government Members will point out that the safeguard
for granting extensions to cases is robust enough to allow for
complications to be ironed out. Sadly, I have it on good evidence that
judges are, in some cases, already imposing a 26-week deadline on
proceedings even before the limit has been introduced. It is crucial
that time considerations do not supersede the welfare of the child
concerned. What is more, some intervention programmes take longer than
26 weeks due to parents undergoing treatment for substance misuse
issues and similar problems. The pilot boroughs—Hammersmith and
Fulham, Westminster, and Kensington and Chelsea—have estimated
that 25 to 30 per cent. of all cases will take longer than the 26-week

to address that point as fully as I should like in the time allotted,
but one of the motivations behind the amendments I am speaking
to—by the way, I am hugely indebted to the NSPCC for its
assistance in this matter—is that some cases should be exempted
from the limit from the outset. Although the Bill as drafted would
allow for incremental eight-week extensions, practitioners in the field
have warned that they would need to know at the beginning of
proceedings how much time they have to work with the family, in order

worryingly, practitioners warn that social workers could be deterred
from seeking extensions other than in highly exceptional circumstances,
as the “specific justification” test in clause 14(7) may
be perceived as a barrier in borderline cases. That is why amendment 5
would allow courts to exempt certain cases from the 26-week limit from
the very start of proceedings if evidence relating to a planned
intervention or programme requiring a longer period was presented to
the court, or if the court considered it necessary to permit additional
time to safeguard the child’s welfare.</hs_Para>

discuss how we can extend those arrangements. The legislative framework
relating to care leavers is comprehensive and clear. I have written to

“staying put” arrangements. We have also issued practical
guidance on tax and benefits issues. We are monitoring “staying

young carers, in Committee we heard heart-felt arguments about the need
to do more for young carers. I promised to reflect carefully on the
arguments for legislative change. Since then I have discussed the
matter with the Minister for care
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T17:57:53"></hs_TimeCode>, my
hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), and we have
agreed that our joint aim is to ensure that young carers are protected.
We firmly believe that taking a “whole family” approach
to the assessment of care needs will be the key to achieving just that.
I have now given the matter careful thought and, with the changes being
introduced by the Care Bill for adult carers, I am persuaded that the
time is right to see what we can do to remove any barriers that may be
preventing these vulnerable young people and their families from
receiving the life-changing support they need.</hs_Para>

might be changed so that rights and responsibilities are clearer to
young carers and practitioners alike. We will also look at how we can
ensure that children’s legislation works with adults’

Care Bill, to enable “whole family” approaches. We will

is a strong consensus about the policy intention behind fostering for
adoption: that children should be placed as early as possible in a
stable placement. Amendment 33 would mean that clause 1 would bite too
early for concurrent planning. I listened to the concerns raised in
Committee about the impact on kinship carers, but there is no intention
that kinship carers should be overlooked as a consequence of this
clause. I am pleased to reassure hon. Members that I am giving
consideration to amending the clause to be clearer that local
authorities must first consider placing a child with relatives and
friends before they consider a “fostering for adoption”
placement. This is an issue that I expect to be returned to in the
other place, and I know that Members will welcome that

expectation that all schools should teach PSHE is outlined in the
introduction to the framework of the proposed new national curriculum.
It is not a statutory requirement, however, as we strongly believe that
teachers need the flexibility to use their professional judgment to
decide when and how best to provide PSHE in their local circumstances.
The Government do not believe that the right of parents to withdraw
their children from sex and relationship education should be diminished
in the way proposed. We see no need to amend the existing legislation,
which provides a clear and workable model for schools and parents.
Moreover, the new provision would place a disproportionate burden on
teachers, who would have to make and defend decisions on what
constitutes “sufficient
maturity”—</hs_Para>

fosters three children. As a consequence of the Government’s
decision to exempt only one bedroom from the bedroom tax for foster
carers, she is required to pay £14 a week to carry on fostering.
If she moved into smaller accommodation, she could foster only one of
those three children, and there would be a cost of about £3,000
a week if the 
<?notus-xml column=286?>children went into care. Will he, together with the Minister responsible

Timpson:</Member></B> Of course I am happy to look at the specific case
the hon. Gentleman raises in the context of the changes that have been
made. As he and Opposition Front Benchers will know, I have worked
hard, both before coming into government and since, to try to ensure
that foster carers are given the best possible support in their
endeavours, because we want to encourage more people to foster, and we
know from the research we have done that many more would like to take
up that opportunity. The Welfare Minister, Lord Freud, and I have
written jointly to all local authorities to explain the importance of
this, with regard to both the single room subsidy and making the
discretionary housing fund available to foster carers where
appropriate. We have committed to an independent review of that
progress, and I will be keeping a keen and close eye on how that
develops. I know that the Fostering Network, which has done some
excellent work on the issue, will also take a lead in ensuring that we
have a clear understanding of the impact of the
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192001219">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:32:39"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill will overhaul services for vulnerable children and support strong
families. It will raise aspirations and place children and young people
at the heart of decision making and support in the SEN system. It will
reduce delays in the adoption system. It is part of a wider set of
reforms to improve children’s services so that everyone involved
in a vulnerable child’s life—teachers, social workers,
health professionals and the police—has a proper sense of
responsibility for the child’s prospects, not just focusing on
their precise duties and whether they have followed the correct
processes and ticked all the boxes, but looking at the child’s
overall welfare. That means refocusing the system on the child’s
needs in a child’s time frame, foremost among which must be the
need to keep the child safe from
harm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192001220"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>We
often hear that the care system fails children, that it damages and
betrays them. Too often it does, but, as I know from my family and the
fostering and adopting we have undertaken, it can also transform lives.
As the recent research report “Safeguarding Children Across
Services” pointed out, when compared with those who are reunited
with their birth families, the majority of maltreated children do
better in care or accommodation. Looked-after children can and do
achieve in care in a stable placement. We know, for example, that there
is a marked correlation between the length of time in care and the
stability of placements and achieving good educational outcomes at
GCSE, yet we must remain resolute in ensuring that the child’s
best interests, not administrative or personnel considerations, are
always at the heart of the
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:34:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192001221">Delays
in care and adoption services mean that it currently takes, on average,
21 months to place a child. Those delays damage a child’s
development and reduce their chances of finding the love and stability
they need with a new family. The Bill will help to sweep away such
barriers through measures designed to speed up the adoption process,
help recruit more potential adopters and improve the support they can
receive. It will enable children to be placed earlier with
their potential adopters.</hs_Para>

the family justice review, we are tackling unacceptable delays in the
courts, ensuring that children’s best interests remain at the
heart of decision making, and encouraging parents to resolve disputes
outside the court where possible. By introducing a 26-week time limit
for care and supervision proceedings, the Bill will ensure that courts
focus on the essentials and that the most vulnerable children are not
damaged further by unnecessary drift and delay. This is already having
an impact in our courts. As the president of the family division
recently wrote to everyone involved in the family courts
system:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13061192001432" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192001432">“We
must get away from existing practice. All too often, and partly as a
result of previous initiatives, local authorities are filing enormously
voluminous materials, which—and this is not their
fault—are not merely far too long; too often they are narrative
and historical, rather than analytical...I want to send out a clear
message: local authority materials can be much shorter...and...should
be more focused on
analysis.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:35:16"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13061192001223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192001223"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:35:08"></hs_TimeCode>We
also want to improve support for children remaining in local authority
care, and so the Bill will make the virtual school head a statutory
role in local authorities. This sends out the strongest possible signal
about the priority we attach to the educational attainment of looked
after children. Changes to the Office of the Children’s
Commissioner will help the commissioner act as a strong advocate for
children, promoting and protecting their rights.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:35:36"></hs_TimeCode> children and
young people with special educational needs, the Bill will introduce a
single system from birth to age 25; new education, health and care
plans which ensure that health, education and social care are planned
around the needs of the child or young person; new rights and
protections for 16 to 25-year-olds in further education and

employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192001224">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T18:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>
most frequent complaint I have heard from parents about SEN is that the

friend; introducing new safeguards through regulations to ensure that a
local authority notifies the child’s birth parents when
considering a fostering for adoption placement; seeing what more we can
do to improve outcomes for young carers, ensuring that our approach

the Children’s Society discovered recently in its “Hidden

because of caring responsibilities. Young carers attain the equivalent
of nine grades lower than their peers at GCSE level and are
consequently more likely than other young people to be classed as not
in education, employment or training after school. There are also
health implications. Young carers are one and a half times more likely
to have a special educational need, a long-standing illness or a
disability than their peers. Those who are dedicated to looking after
someone else often do not take good enough care of themselves. That is

the Government. It is a measure of how the coalition is holding
together by concentrating on where we agree and such issues as
supporting adopters and young people with special educational needs

consultations and the formation of the policies in the Bill, and the

particularly on shared parental leave and flexible leave, of Sarah,
Andrew, Ruth, Kim, Chris, James and Chris. All those who have supported
them have been wonderful. The officials who 
<?notus-xml column=294?>developed the children’s guide to the Bill deserve particular

a BIS Minister, I am delighted to take forward measures in the Bill on
shared parental leave and flexible working. On shared parental leave,
it is important that we shatter the outdated stereotypes of how parents
divide their responsibilities—the assumption is that men are the
breadwinners and that a woman’s role is to stay at home and look
after children. Those decisions are up to individual parents, who will
work out the right solution and answers for them. It is not the

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0004.htm#13061192001268">The
flexibility of the Bill will enable more dads to play a bigger role in
the early weeks and months of their child’s life. We know from
research that that has a positive impact on child development and later

work responsibilities with their parenting, which is so important given
the contribution women can make to the economy, which was highlighted

right to request flexible working was introduced by the previous
Government, and this Government rightly want to extend it to everyone.
That will bring huge benefits to the economy. Employers benefit from
more motivated and productive staff, and from lower recruitment and
retention costs. Employees benefit because they are more in control of
their time and more able to juggle their responsibilities, whether
caring, volunteering or other outside interests. It is important for
other groups of workers, such as older workers and people with
disabilities, who can find a shorter, part-time or more flexible work
pattern incredibly helpful to their ability to continue within the

as far as I can tell, in coming to their decisions the justices of the
European Union Courts take very seriously their duty to apply the law
as it is found in the treaties and in secondary European legislation.
The appointment of judges at the EU Courts is subject to approval by an
expert panel. Indeed, to be eligible to serve as a justice in the

a senior judicial office in their home country or be of sufficient
standing in the law to be regarded as capable of exercising that kind

believe that the measure we are discussing will provide quicker and
more efficient justice within the European Union. The proposal is to
increase the number of advocates-general to nine from 1 July 2013 and
to 11 from 7 October 2015. The first advocate-general would
be a permanent Polish advocate-general. Under declaration 38 in article
252 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, member
states agreed in 2007 that if there were an increase in
advocates-general, Poland would have a permanent advocate-general and
no longer take part in the rotation of advocates-general. This step
would bring Poland into line with the other big six member states,
including the United Kingdom, which all already have a permanent
advocate-general. An additional two advocates-general would increase
the existing rotation system from three to five. Under 
<?notus-xml column=296?>current arrangements, we would expect the first two additional
advocates-general appointed in October 2015 to be Czech and
Danish.</hs_Para>

in those that raise a new point of law. There is no appeals process, of

opinions that advocates-general issue are a key element in the
efficiency of the Court. As Sir Konrad Schiemann stated in his evidence
to the House of Lords this year, advocate-general opinions
significantly shorten the time occupied by judges in agreeing a
judgment and improve the quality of the Court’s judgments. The
opinions assist the Court with its own deliberations, because the Court
can then test its own views against the detailed reasoning of the
advocate-general conclusions. It is particularly useful in the EU Court
because, unlike the practice in our own Supreme Court or Court of
Appeal, it has to reach a consensus for its ruling—the
possibility of separate dissenting opinions from different judges does
not exist at the European level.</hs_Para>

well as contributing to the speed of judgments, advocates-general also

is important that the Court is efficient, because of the impact that

ban on UK imports. The Court ruled that since EU legislation laid down
the necessary rules for the protection of public health, France was not
entitled to rely on the public health exception in then article 30 of
the treaty establishing the European Community to prevent the
resumption of beef and veal imports from the UK. I am sure that the

£430 million in exports to the British economy in
2011—the last year for which we have

impact of the EU Courts is not limited to cases in which UK businesses

benefits for the UK, directly or indirectly. For example, there was a
case on whether EU legislation allowed for prescribing incentive

that Poland is as equally entitled to have its own permanent

familiar with the reforms that the Court itself has introduced in the

Chamber from 13 to 15; abolishing unnecessary procedural elements such
as the requirement to read the report of the hearing in full, and thus
the need to produce a report; provisions allowing for the appointment
of temporary judges to the civil service tribunal; and establishing a

Scrutiny Committee has raised. Let me turn first to the important issue
of funding. Although broadly supporting the proposal, the Government
are clear that any additional advocates-general should not and need not
result in an increase in the Court’s budget. The appointment of
the new post holders and their support staff should lead to a
relatively small additional cost of about €4 million a year,
which the Court can meet from within its existing budget. Its budget
was more than €354 million for 2013, and the Court has
underspent by more than the cost of the additional advocates-general in
each of the last three years. In the current economic climate, there is
an imperative on all the EU’s institutions, including the Court,
to find ways to reduce their administrative costs.</hs_Para>

in itself will not be enough to guarantee cost-neutrality, but would be
a clear statement of the United Kingdom’s position ahead of the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:20:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset made a point about this in an
earlier intervention. The article 255 panel gives an opinion on
candidates’ suitability to perform the role of advocate-general.
The Government consider that the panel plays a key role in making the
judicial appointments process more transparent and helping to ensure
that the chosen candidates are of a high quality. The UK was a key
supporter of the creation of such a panel, and we have consistently
supported the application of rigour in the judicial selection
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:20:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The
article 255 panel is effective in its role of assessing the suitability
of nominees to serve as judges and as advocates-general. To date, the
panel has delivered 43 opinions, of which five were unfavourable. In
each case, the opinions delivered by the panel have been followed by
the Governments of member states. When the panel has been unhappy about
the calibre of a particular nominee, that nominee has subsequently been
withdrawn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

I said at the start of my remarks, this is a new procedure for us. This
is one of the provisions of the European Union Act 2011 and before
Ministers can vote in Council, the Government must secure affirmative
resolutions in each House of Parliament. It is one small but none the
less significant element of the work of trying to secure
greater oversight by Parliament of decisions taken by Ministers in
Europe on behalf of this country, and therefore in a small way helps to
increase the democratic accountability of the EU, a principle that this
Government strongly
support.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/36D6B8B9B0586E068FCD4F9BFE4C8F4A71455574" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 June 2013">Tuesday

Reynolds</B> (Wolverhampton North East) (Lab):</Member> We welcome the
opportunity to discuss the proposed increase in the number of
advocates-general at the Court of Justice of the European Union. The
Court performs a central role within the European Union. It has the
responsibility of interpreting EU law and ensuring its equal
application across the member
states.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001325" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001325">As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:30:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) mentioned—the Minister
also referred to this point—although it may be true that when
Labour was in government we did not always agree with the
Court’s rulings and sometimes found them problematic, the Court
and indeed the General Court play a crucial role in upholding EU law as
set out in the treaties, and in ensuring the effective functioning of
the internal market in particular. ECJ rulings have proven successful
in enforcing competition rules and in ruling against protectionism,
which is to the benefit of British businesses and British consumers. It
is therefore necessary that the Court has the capacity to carry out
those important functions allocated to it under the treaties. In
particular, it is important that it is able to issue judgments in an
effective and timely manner.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=303?><hs_Para UID="13061192001326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001326">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>
has been said, a significant backlog of cases continues to build and
there are many reasons for that. As the Minister said last July, much
of the recent delay at the European Courts is down to increased
litigation by private parties, particularly on single market matters.
In addition, the enlargements of the EU in 2004 and 2007 have brought a
raft of new cases before the Court, substantially increasing its
workload. That trend is likely to continue, as Croatia is to join in
only a few weeks’ time, on 1 July. Unsurprisingly, these new
member states have made greater use of the preliminary ruling
procedure, which allows national courts to refer cases to the ECJ for
guidance on EU law.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:31:26"></hs_TimeCode>Enlargement has
also meant that there has been an increase in the number of appeals
against decisions of the General Court which are taken to the ECJ. In
2008, just seven competition cases were appealed to the ECJ, whereas
the figure had risen to 52 in 2012.
Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:31:47"></hs_TimeCode> factor
is the changes introduced by the Lisbon treaty, particularly in the
area of justice and home affairs. The ECJ now has enhanced
responsibilities in that field, and the changes were not just
prospective, but retrospective with regard to the body of law in this
area already in place. Moreover, the increasing complexity of cases
brought before the Court has added to the
burden.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001327">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:32:17"></hs_TimeCode>
cumulative effect of all those factors is that the advocates-general,
in their current numbers, have sometimes been unable to deliver an
opinion within an acceptable time limit. At present, as the Minister
has explained, eight advocates-general advise the Court on all matters
of European Union legislation. However, it is in only about 50% of
cases that an advocate-general is able to issue an opinion. As has been
pointed out in evidence given to the House of the Lords by a
representative of the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe, the
absence of an opinion by an
advocate-general</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13061192001434" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001434">“increases

it would seem sensible to increase the number of advocates-general,
which would in turn increase the capacity of the ECJ to process cases
in a timely
manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:33:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001329">The
Court proposes, and the Council has indicated it will agree to, an
increase in the number of advocates-general from eight to 11, and the
Minister has today reiterated the Government’s support for that
change. As he has explained, the increase will be staggered, with one
new advocate-general starting, we hope, on 1 July this year, and the
other two appointed later. According to an explanatory memorandum from
the Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:34:21"></hs_TimeCode>
given to the European Scrutiny Committee in March, the proposed new
advocates-general are predicted to cost an extra €4
million. We agree with him that at a time of greater public spending
restraint and economic difficulty it is important that that money is
found from within existing budgets.</hs_Para>

budget of almost €354 million for 2013, so it is to be expected
that the money to pay for at least the first new advocate-general may
be found without the need for an increase in the budget. Will the
Minister update the House? He mentioned the negotiations in preparation
for next year on the financial implications of this change. Will he say
a little more about which allies the UK Government have found in other
member states, and what he thinks the chances are of ensuring that the
change is
cost-neutral<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

compensation even when the cancellation is caused by extraordinary
circumstances such as the eruption of the volcano in Iceland in 2010.

Rees-Mogg</B> (North East Somerset) (Con):</Member> I congratulate the
Minister on the Bill he brought forward a year ago that allows us to
hold this debate, which is crucial in ensuring that European matters
are properly discussed. As I understand it, we are the only member
state of the European Union that will have this type of debate to make
this important
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:36:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001334">Beyond
that, I diverge from the Minister. I diverge from him particularly in
his admiration for this Court. I do not believe it to be a just Court.
We must always remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was this Court that
ruled in its own favour to increase its own pay, against one of the
fundamental principles of justice—that a judge should not rule
to his own advantage. So it is not a proper, just Court like the noble
courts that we have in this land; it is a Court with a political
agenda, which is always pushing for more integration, for more Europe,
towards the federal superstate, which we in this House who value the
sovereignty of Parliament and of the British people should treat with
the greatest
suspicion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:37:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001335">The
Minister spoke of the rulings that have come down occasionally in our
favour, and the costs that we have been saved; I think BSE and
pharmaceuticals were the two specific examples that he gave. I hope he
might consider doing a cost-benefit analysis of all the judgments
delivered by the European Court of Justice, to decide whether it has
saved us money, or whether overall it has cost the British taxpayer
money, since we joined the European Union in
1972<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:37:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001336">But
let us come particularly to the increase in the number of
advocates-general and what is being achieved by that. What we are
really doing is contributing to the growth of the power, the
bureaucracy, the size, of the superstate that the European Union has
become. By making the European Court bigger and stronger and able to
take on more cases, powers are more centred at the European level. They
will have a greater ability to determine the law in this country. The
efficiency of the European Court of Justice is something that should
make people who are concerned about parliamentary sovereignty nervous,
because the more efficient it can be, the more it can interfere with
our laws and the more it can take power away from
Westminster<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:38:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001337">And
then we look at the cost: the €4 million cost that will be added
to the total cost of the European Court—the extraordinarily high
cost that the European Court has to start with of over €350
million. I looked up briefly 
<?notus-xml column=305?>the cost of our own Supreme Court. It was estimated
in 2009 to cost £13.5 million to run. Perhaps this is a case for
privatisation to a British court, because if we can get justice in this
country with our highest court for £13.5 million, I
wonder what it is that requires €350 million to be
spent at the European
level.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001338">In
a letter, the Minister explained some of the extra costs. These grand
panjandrums—these advocates-general —do not just get
their pay and their staff; they have to have cars as well. It is all
part of the great European gravy train, with cost being piled on cost.
When unanimity is the issue, the British Government, rather than taking
the opportunity to use their power to delay or stop something that the
European Parliament, Commission and Court want, give in at an early
stage, so the negotiating strength that we would have had
when setting the budget is frittered away. I ask the Minister: what are
we hoping to get in return for not using our veto?</hs_Para>

that I want, because that is at the heart of the political expansion
and centralising power of the European Union. If we look at what the
European Union has done, and how it has become an increasingly
federalised system, we see that it has done so through the judgments of
the European Court, which has increasingly ruled in favour of more
Europe. It is a political Court, much as the United States Supreme
Court was in the early 19th century. It is about bringing federalism to
the peoples of Europe. I accept that it has some of the highest
intellects as members; I would not begin to deny that. We have sent
some very fine judges there, with prodigious brains, ability and
intellect, but what they have done after getting there is take power
away from the United Kingdom and this Parliament. That is what I most
strongly object to, and I object to the Government not using their

fully support Poland getting the new advocate-general seat. As the
Minister’s predecessor, I was involved in the enlargement
process. We always thought, and thought correctly, that, given its
population, Poland would want to take its place as one of the big
countries of Europe. I am glad that we are sticking to the agreement
that we made that Poland should have this additional post. However, I
am not sure that the Minister told us who would get the other two
vacancies, and how that would be decided. If they are up for grabs, so
to speak, and bearing in mind the importance of the enlargement
process, perhaps it would be a good idea, rather than offer them to
other countries that are already represented on the Court, to offer
them to countries that have joined because of the enlargement process.

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:50:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Somerset wants the Court to slow down, because he
believes that speeding it up will result in greater integration. I am
in favour of speeding it up, which is why I support the proposal for
move advocates-general, not to ensure that we have a federalist Europe,
which I oppose, but to ensure that the decisions they have to take are
dealt with in a timely fashion. The delay is inexcusable. It should be
considered very carefully. I am disappointed that the Minister could
not assure the House that, as a result of the decision to appoint three
additional advocates-general, the Court’s decisions would be
speeded up, because of course he has no evidence to suggest that
appointing another three will make the decisions come through any
quicker—they will take their time to do what they have to do. I
would like to see decisions made much more quickly in a whole host of
areas, and primarily in one area that I believe is very important. If
decisions have to be made as part of the legal process, they
should be made as quickly as possible, because
that benefits all
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001355"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>I

emerged since between the two coalition parties over our attitude to
European scrutiny, take-note debates and debates on approvals of
Government actions in relation to Europe, such as this one, are
important procedures that we agreed in the 2011 Act. It set out the
terms and conditions under which referendums would be held and under
which votes of this Parliament would have an impact on European

strong European Court of Justice has to be a good thing for the UK. It
is the ultimate court in which matters of EU law are determined within
the European Union. That is a good thing for Britain because it ensures
not only, on occasion, that we are compliant with EU law but, most
importantly, that all the other 27 member states are too. As
the Minister rightly pointed out, that frequently benefits British
companies. Given the value of our relationship with Europe, it is
crucial 
<?notus-xml column=309?>that the single market operates properly and is seen to be properly

arguing for Britain to have a greater say over our interpretation of

£400,000, a year. I would entirely support any measures that we
can take to impose further austerity on these judges. That would be a
useful thing to consider if they really are getting free cars. There is
a need for the European Union collectively to realise that European
finances are in a parlous state. That applies as much to the EU level
of government as it does to the British level or to local or regional
governments. In a time of austerity, it is absolutely right to look at
the costs involved in such positions. It is a good discipline for us to

money could be well spent on behalf of British businesses, because the
benefits of a freely and efficiently operating single market could be

other member states, some 3.5 million jobs are associated with trade
with the EU, and some 200,000 British businesses trade with other
member states. The single market is enormously important for jobs. We
need it to operate fairly and efficiently in order to benefit British
jobs, and that means that the European Court of Justice must operate
smoothly and efficiently. That justifies the appointment of additional
advocates-general to try to clear the enormous backlog of cases that
now exists. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T19:59:05"></hs_TimeCode>I

hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset argued that the
Government should carry out a cost-benefit analysis of the
Court’s impact on the United Kingdom. The Government, as the
House will know, have launched a review of the current balance of
competences between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The
32 calls for evidence and reports on different aspects of
policy will give ample opportunity to businesses and others to argue
where ECJ decisions have been of 
<?notus-xml column=311?>benefit to this country and where they have been harmful. Without
revealing too much, I can tell the House that the forthcoming report on
taxation policy—it is as yet unpublished—will make
specific reference to leading cases in the European courts and how they
have had an impact on the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:04:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001375" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001375">My
hon. Friend also said that he wished that the Government had
demonstrated a willingness to exercise a veto over the measure for the
appointment of three new advocates-general. I say to him that a veto
should not be brandished if we think that the measure concerned will be
to our overall advantage. I also say to him that the Prime Minister has
shown that he is willing to exercise a veto and to block measures that
he believes would harm the interests of this country. We must use our
negotiating capital skilfully and be prepared to be cussed and awkward
if necessary about the things that really matter to the interests of
the British people. The Government have been right to play hardball on
issues such as the multi-annual financial framework and the long
overdue reform of the common fisheries policy, and in our refusal last
year to accept the proposal to set up an operational headquarters for
the EU’s common security and defence

Court reform, a key point to emphasise is that the treaties give the
Court of Justice the prime role in initiating proposals for its reform.
Under article 281 of the treaty on the functioning of the European
Union, changes to the Court’s statute can be proposed by the
Court on its own initiative after consulting the Commission or by the
Commission after consultation with the Court. The Court can propose
amendments to its rules of procedure, but they need the approval of the
Council. There is a Council lock on proposals, but the proposals must
in the main come forward from the Court. The House will readily
understand why the treaties were written in a way that protects the
Court to some extent from political pressures. Within that context, we
have been consistent in urging the Court to take seriously its duty to
look hard at the possibility of internal administrative and procedural
reform, as well as looking for other ways to enhance its efficiency and
deal more promptly with the growing backlog of
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001378">The
reforms that have been agreed over the past two years, with the support
of the United Kingdom, have included establishing the new office of the
vice-president of the European Court of Justice and General Court. The
quorum in the Grand Chamber has been changed to allow greater
flexibility. We have seen the abolition of the requirement for a report
for hearing and for the reading of that report. That has saved a lot of
time when one adds up the savings accumulated over a large number of
cases. We have seen the agreement to create a pool of temporary judges
for the civil service tribunal. We have also seen changes to the
ECJ’s rules of procedure to provide greater
efficiency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:09:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001379" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001379">Other<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:09:16"></hs_TimeCode>
ideas are still being discussed. One to which the UK Government are
quite sympathetic is the creation of specialist chambers within the
Court. However, that is 
<?notus-xml column=312?>for the Court to propose if it is persuaded that it is the right course
on which to embark. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:09:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Down (Lady Hermon) and other Members will know, the House of

let me turn to finance. The UK is one of a group of like-minded,
budget-disciplined member states that work together routinely to push
down the EU’s annual budget costs. The group includes Denmark,
Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Germany and Austria as well
as us, and we have no reason to believe it will be less focused on
budget discipline this year. It is fair to say to the House that the
€4 million needed for the advocates-general cannot be negotiated
in isolation and would be one part of an annual budget negotiation of
roughly €130 billion in total. The bill for the
advocates-general and their staff would be less than one 100th of a
percentage of the EU’s total annual budget for 2013.</hs_Para>

respond to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East, I say that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:10:21"></hs_TimeCode> Court can
request funds, but funding is for co-decision by the Council and the
European Parliament. If we look at what has been happening in the
EU’s annual budget for 2013, we see that the Court
requested an increase to its budget of
8.4%—€29.2 million—which in percentage
terms was the biggest requested increase for any EU institution that
year. In practice, the UK and its allies worked together to reduce that
increase to just 1.9% in 2013—slightly below the
level of inflation. There is no reason to believe that the same could
not be achieved on budget neutrality for the advocates-general,
particularly given the underspend in the Court’s budget in each
of the past three years.</hs_Para>

this matter is one component of a much bigger negotiation, and the
Court’s total budget forms just one part of the overall annual
EU budget. There is, however, no doubt about the Government’s
determination to ensure that those small additional costs are met from
within the Court’s existing budget, and in particular its
publicly known underspending. We will continue to work assiduously for
the best possible efficiency and the greatest possible value for money,
not just in the affairs of the European Courts but in every institution
of the European Union.</hs_Para>

the sort of thing one must declare, I declare an interest as I am proud
to be a former pupil of Falmouth school. It must be the only school in
the country to have a former hospital in the centre of its campus.
Budock hospital was for people with psychiatric care needs or
significant learning difficulties. The top half of the former hospital
site houses the buildings, and the lower slopes—known locally as
Trelawney’s field—were originally jointly managed by the
school with NHS social services and a farm project for young people
with learning difficulties. I have fond memories of volunteering for

current head teacher has been in place for 12 years or more.
Throughout that time, Cornwall council has had various conversations
with the NHS to try to secure the lower part of the site for
educational purposes, facilitating access to the playing fields on the
far side of the hospital. The hospital was demolished, and the whole
site was reclaimed and fenced off by the NHS in 2008. The school has
had an overgrown and derelict site at its centre for five years, which

representatives of the newly formed NHS property service company and
its agents, BNP Paribas, Origin 3 planning consultants and Cyril Sweett
quantity surveyors. It was made clear at the meeting that the NHS and
its agents felt bound by Government requirements to secure the highest
price for the site on the open market without consideration of
community benefit. We know that that contravenes the
Government’s policy and guidelines. The school presented the
proposed plans for development and the local planning officers
explained the local planning framework progress and emerging needs for

taken off the market. I cannot thank the Minister enough for his
intervention. The headmistress and the whole school community wanted me
to pass on their thanks for his helpful intervention to help us find a
resolution to this situation. I am very pleased that it has been taken
off the market, so that we can have another meeting and get around the

was, however, slightly concerned by something in the letter. The NHS
property company is advocating the original offer from some time ago,
of a land swap option to resolve the issue. This is no longer the best
outcome. Let me explain why. Approximately 15 months ago, the primary
care trust and the school were in talks regarding a straightforward
land swap, as the size and value of the two sites were relatively
similar. However, because of the changes to the planning framework,
which I have already outlined, the hospital site is designated as
educational, while the Union corner playing field is now clearly
designated as residential. This changes the value of the two sites. As
a result, the land swap would not be the best use of public money or of
these two sites.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:24:26"></hs_TimeCode>
I am grateful that NHS Property Services has signalled that it is
prepared to get around the table—this recent change of attitude
is very welcome. Although I do not think the swap is the best way
forward, I am sure that, with the Minister’s support, we can
find a sensible solution that works for the NHS—hard-pressed as
it is and in need of every penny to invest in front-line services, as
we all appreciate—for Falmouth school, for Cornwall council and
for the wider community.</hs_Para>

conclusion, this is an immensely important scheme for Falmouth. It will
be an Olympic legacy in terms of improved sports facilities for the
whole community. It will put the school on a secure footing for
generations to come and contribute to the economic redevelopment of
this part of Falmouth, bringing much-needed affordable homes and
supporting exciting new and growing companies in the area. Having
received the Minister’s support in his letter today, I now seek
an assurance that the land swap will not be the only option. If
following the meeting on 21 June with all the parties concerned, which
I am chairing, we can make a sensible case for giving significant funds
to the NHS while enabling us to realise this important project, we will
be very content

the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton) on securing this
debate and on her ongoing tremendous advocacy on behalf of her
constituents. She talked eloquently of her own knowledge of the
school—“care farm” is the expression I would use
in my constituency—and the relationship between the school and
the old hospital. She highlighted the importance when looking for value
in NHS land of doing as much as possible to maximise the land receipt
and put that money back into the NHS, but of course NHS land is
community land, and it is important that, wherever possible, we work
with surrounding communities to support them in local activities that
benefit the
population.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001413">My
hon. Friend also outlined eloquently the challenges faced by more rural
parts of the country, and Cornwall in particular. We know that
community resources and facilities are much scarcer in rural areas, as
she highlighted in her speech. When we look at the affordability of
local homes and the provision of community facilities, rurality is an
important consideration and one that we always bear in mind in the
NHS.</hs_Para>

sector land not only in releasing its monetary value, but regarding the
availability of affordable homes for local people to live in. I

begin the process of facilitating a mutually beneficial resolution of
the issues previously hindering the sale of this land to the local
school.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T20:28:13"></hs_TimeCode> Those
issues predate the transfer of ownership to NHS Property Services, and
were between the former Cornwall and Isles of Scilly primary care trust
and Falmouth school. Thanks to swift action since NHS Property Services
took over control of the NHS estate, the issues are well on their way
to being unlocked. NHS Property Services inherited a portfolio of 4,000
other properties from 161 disparate previous NHS organisations on 1
April, and a win-win resolution is now in sight.</hs_Para>

am sure we will have other debates on similar matters, so it is worth
outlining to the House the role of NHS Property Services and some early
successes that have occurred. On 1 April, NHS Property Services
inherited about 4,000 NHS assets, including health centres, office
accommodation, care homes and hospital buildings. It houses about
12,000 tenants and is valued at more than £3 billion. It also
inherited more than 3,000 members of staff from former PCTs and
strategic health authorities throughout England. This brand new
organisation is already doing tremendous work in the face of this huge
challenge to create efficient, fit-for-purpose facilities and services
for the benefit of patients and the public. All too often in the past,
there was an unacceptable variability in estates management—not
just in this case, but throughout the NHS—by PCTs and SHAs. The
advantage of having estate management under one central roof has
already paid dividends throughout the NHS. The creation of NHS Property
Services has generated an opportunity to explore options to bring
together a fragmented
system—</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061192001416" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192001416"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1050" UID="13061192002599" xid="293" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/debtext/130611-0005.htm#13061192002599">Mr

Property Services on 1 April 2013. The school and the former Cornwall

into a land swap to release the school’s playing

Government’s priority for easing the shortage of land for
housing development is to see development take place in sustainable
locations; the predominantly brownfield sites of some of the old NHS

on managing public money state that public sector organisations may
transfer assets among themselves without placing the property on the
open market, provided they do so at market prices. They also state that
the organisations should work collaboratively on the transfer to agree
a price, and that it is good practice to commission a single
independent valuation to settle the price to be paid. My hon. Friend

swap option. To enable both the school and NHS Property Services to
deliver these proposals, support will be required from the local
planning authority to ensure that a clear planning brief is available

facilities on the former hospital site, and much needed housing
development in the Falmouth area will be brought one step closer. I

I begin by declaring three interests—not pecuniary
ones—that I have in relation to the subject? The first is that
for many years I taught military history at the military academy of
Sandhurst and at the staff college, and I wrote or edited several books
to do with the British Army and the first world war. Secondly, I am one
of two parliamentary commissioners representing the House of Commons on
the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Thirdly, I am a member of the

cannot get away from the fact that the first world war is a
controversial subject. It was controversial at the time. When the
Liberal Government decided to declare war on Germany, following the
German invasion of Belgium, several Liberal Ministers resigned from the
Cabinet. During the war, there were the conscientious objectors, and
those, such as Lord Lansdowne, who wanted at different times to reach a
peace settlement.</hs_Para>

has also been controversial since then. Many veterans felt that they
were betrayed. In the 1960s, during the anniversary of the first world
war, an enormous debate went on. Films and programmes such as
“Oh! What A Lovely War” and “Blackadder Goes
Forth” probably have a bigger impact on public perceptions of
Britain and the first world war than all the memoirs and history books,
and we can see that today.</hs_Para>

about not only remembrance and reconciliation but pride. However,

the National Archives, which have hundreds of thousands—if not

to take into account the Commonwealth, remembering that in 1914 the
British Government declared war on behalf of the empire, and that the
participation of the empire is also a sensitive subject. Some
1.6 million men from the Indian sub-continent served in the
Indian army—mainly in the middle east, but also in Belgium and
France—and tens of thousands of them were killed and injured.
The successor states, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have ambivalent
views about how to commemorate the first world war, not least because
many of the soldiers returned to the Indian sub-continent and joined
groups that wished to see the end of the

there is the international element, which I have briefly touched on.
What the Government must do, and I am sure the Minister will comment on

countries—are doing.</hs_Para>

is important to recognise that the commemoration develops over six
years and that we need to maintain the momentum. Although the
Government have laid down a number of points that we are going to
commemorate, such as the death of Nurse Edith Cavell, who was from
Norfolk where I was born and live, they also have to consider the
legacy. In other words, how do we want this commemoration to be
remembered, particularly putting the emphasis on young people? I
suggest that we look at things such as education and the strengthening
of
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061147000023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061147000023"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T09:39:28"></hs_TimeCode>For
me, the purpose of this short debate is to consider what
role<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T09:39:36"></hs_TimeCode> Parliament
will play in this commemoration and to encourage my fellow

suggest that the parliamentary element should have two themes. The
first is to look at the political and constitutional role that
Parliament played during the war—in particular, the aspects that
resonate today.  After all, in 1914 the Liberal Government did
not seek Parliament’s permission and have a vote on the
declaration of war, which many colleagues will see as having a
resonance now. There is the whole business of the key debates that took
place here in Parliament. There is also the formation of the two
coalitions: the coalition of May 1915, of the Liberals and the
Conservatives; and then the Lloyd George coalition of December 1916,
which had the Libs under Lloyd George and the Conservatives, with some
Labour support.</hs_Para>

addition, there are the elements of legislation that were crucial at
the time and that still have a resonance today. The licensing laws that
we live with today were brought in at the beginning of the first world
war to encourage munitions workers not to get tired and emotional and
cut production. The Defence of the Realm Acts brought in massive
constraints on civil liberties; the Military Service Acts—in
other words, conscription—broke  
<?notus-xml column=4?>the back of the old Liberal party; and finally the Representation of the
People Act 1918 saw for the first time the majority of women, although
not all of them, getting the vote.</hs_Para>

does Parliament achieve this commemoration? I suspect that there will
be exhibitions, and there will be online information. It is possible
that the Speakers of both the Commons and the Lords will arrange a
series of lectures and talks. I suggest another idea, which some of my
colleagues might think is a little too modern, even for me; it shows
that I have a feminine side, of which the loss of my moustache is a
further example. The idea is that we could recreate some of the debates
I have referred to through the Youth Parliament. Let the Youth

world war.</hs_Para>

is also conceivable that Parliament could publish a book that would
relate to the second element of Parliament and the first world war: the
experiences, service and personal losses of Members of both Houses of
Parliament—both MPs and peers—and of their staff. I would
like to think that we could bring that idea up to date by asking
Members of both Houses and their staff to provide information about

were also people who never served in the armed forces, and we want to
bear that in mind; it is not only the military side that matters. There

us not forget the staff. Work has already been done by the archivists
and those on the educational side of Parliament. As an example, I give
two small pieces of information. First, it will not surprise Members to
know that the majority of Badge Messengers in 1914 were ex-military.
The majority of them were either recalled to the colours or—if
they were elderly gentlemen—nevertheless went back into uniform
to train people. Secondly, they were replaced as messengers in the
House of Commons by girl guides. That would have been quite a
remarkable change for the 1914 generation.</hs_Para>

second theme for this debate, which I will touch on briefly, is to
encourage parliamentarians to participate in commemorative events and
advise their local communities about them. Many colleagues are already
doing that. The Heritage Lottery Fund recently announced that
£6 million of funding will be spread over six years,
which can be allocated to people who bid either as individuals or as
local communities for projects related to heritage. I know that these
ideas have been taken up by many parliamentarians. If people visit a
few of our colleagues’ websites, they will see that they have
flagged that money up.</hs_Para>

more can be done? Colleagues can take an active part in events and
consider the specific experience of their own constituency, whether it
is in a town, a city or a county. I will briefly give the example not
so much of my own constituency of Broadland as of the work that is
already being done throughout Norfolk. I have tried to put questions
not only to local historians but to the <I>Eastern Daily Press</I>,
which is taking a great interest and which I think will participate

any city, county or constituency.</hs_Para>

first question was, “What was Norfolk like in 1914?” It
is a very good question for children to ask. Let us cut away all the
myths of a golden summer and everything else—what was it like?

what was the impact of men volunteering or being conscripted to the
armed forces? There were massive variations. We think of the Kitchener
volunteers, but they did not all rush away at first; in Norfolk, they
did not go until September or October 1914. Outside the cities,
volunteers or conscripts were mainly rural workers and they literally
had to get the harvest in.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T09:47:26"></hs_TimeCode>We forget the
conscripts. The majority of people serving in the British armed forces

somebody who saw the worst and the best of the first world war. We

first world war is not an occasion to celebrate. I pay tribute to the
hon. Gentleman for soothing out some of the jingoistic overtones in the
original speech that suggested that we might celebrate the end of that
war. I have a different tale to tell, but it is relevant and true,
about a young man who volunteered at the age of 15. He was full of
optimism and a great patriot, and went to war believing that it was
going to lead to dignity, glory and honour. It did not; it led to
disease, degradation, bitterness and early death at the age of
43<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T09:54:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061147000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061147000050">That
young man was a machine gunner. The belief on both sides was that
machine gunners were never taken prisoner, because they were
responsible for killing hundreds and possibly thousands of people. He
found himself in a machine gun nest—a foxhole—gravely
injured, and the others were dead. That was in April 1918, when the
Germans broke through on the Messines ridge. His life was saved. He
heard a German patrol coming to him and took out his rosary beads to
pray, waiting for the bullet to blow out his brains. He could not get
out of the hole, where he was identified as a machine gunner because
the machine gun was lying across his body. However, he was not shot.
The German officer, and two others, carried him across no man’s
land and his life was saved. He was ever grateful to the Germans for
the rest of his
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T09:55:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061147000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061147000051">He

returned to civilian life and found that he was on a pension. He could
not do what he called a man’s job ever again. In the mid-1930s,
his pitiful pension was reduced by an ungrateful Government, who
changed the reason for his pension from saying that his ill health was
attributed to his war wound to saying that it was aggravated by it,
although he went in as a perfectly fit

Two of the

a misunderstanding, or possibly a lie. The consequence for this country

vanity. If we wish to commemorate the true lessons of that war, I
suggest we do something that is now forbidden in this House and read
out the names of the current war dead from Iraq and Afghanistan. I have
done it twice and it is now forbidden. We are not allowed—it is
out of order—to read the names of the war dead. We could not
possibly do it for those who died in the first world war, who died in

the Member for Broadland (Mr Simpson) a debt for initiating the debate.
As he knows, my first grown-up job in politics was as research
assistant to Maurice Macmillan, which meant I was privileged to spend
quite a lot of time at Birch Grove. In my conversations with Harold
Macmillan, there was absolutely no doubt that his approach, and that of
other political leaders of the time, to Europe, the Common Market and
European politics was in large part based on their experience of having
gone through two European wars. For people such as Harold Macmillan, it
was not just the fact that they had gone through two European wars, but
guilt about the fact that they had  
<?notus-xml column=9?>actually survived—Harold Macmillan was almost the only person
from his Grenadier Guards officer cadet group to survive the great
war.</hs_Para>

Second Church Estates Commissioner. As a result of the first world war,
there was a need to demonstrate the huge and understandable grief over
the loss of the husbands, fathers, sons, brothers and friends who made
up the never-ending casualty list from the front line. There are,
therefore, now roughly 36,000 memorials to the dead of the great war,

community—every parish, every town and every village—will
look to refurbish or restore its war memorials. The recording of
names—often simply in alphabetical order, giving no priority in
death, because all are equal in death—is an important memorial,
and now is the time to ensure that our war memorials are repaired and
restored. Some memorials relate to streets or areas, such as those for
the Hull pals and the Accrington pals. Others relate to factories, and

asked them what made them leave their farms in Sussex—most had
never left their farms before going to war—they simply said,
“We went to defend our farms.” Edward Thomas was asked
why he went to war, and he picked up a sod of English earth and said,
“I went to fight for this.” Every one of the people on a

there was. Many of the gravestones there were of people who were 16.
Many of the Ulstermen who joined told lies about their age, saying that
they were 18 or 19 when they were 15 or 16—some were even 14.
Perhaps there was not as tight a control as there should have been on

as a consequence of the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, which demarcated
the middle east and created an explosive cocktail that rumbles on to
this day. I believe that the legacy is in the here and now, and I

the incredible change it brought to the lives of almost everyone in the

and the political consequences of that war affect our lives today, too.
We must remember that it was of a scale unimaginable to people before
the war. We must remember the stories that came from the war in the
history books, the poems and the diaries, which tell a story of a
conflict that cannot be recognised in terms of warfare today. The lives

Sassoon, who was Member of Parliament for Hythe during the first world

recollection was that it was “Lilliputian” compared with
the western front and that the battle of Waterloo, great and defining
as it was, had more in common with the battles of ancient Greece than
it had with Neuve-Chapelle or the battle of the Somme. The first world

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:27:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Broadland mentioned, it was not tens of thousands of men
who came through Folkestone during the first world war but tens of
millions. Nearly 10 million men came through Folkestone, which was the
main port of embarkation to the western front not just for British
soldiers but for soldiers from across the world who came to serve. That
can be seen marked in the graves at Shorncliffe military cemetery,
which is one of the Commonwealth war graves, 
<?notus-xml column=16?>stationed next to Shorncliffe barracks just outside Folkestone, which
was home to tens of thousands of Canadian servicemen. The graves of
members of the Chinese Labour Corps who died in the first world war can
also be found
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Folkestone, similar to Norfolk, was also home to tens of thousands of
Belgian émigrés who came to Britain to escape the
advancing German army in the early days of the war in the summer of
1914, so it has an international significance,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:28:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000022">For
me, the important thing about Folkestone is that it touches the
experiences of probably almost every fighting family in the country. At
some point, their ancestor was in Folkestone during the war, and it is
a site that can mean something to people across the country as they
consider the centenary of the first world
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000023">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:29:02"></hs_TimeCode>
House of Commons must consider an appropriate way to recognise the
sacrifices of families across the country during the war. We must
consider where we can create places in the United Kingdom for them to
go to try to gain some insight on the life and experience of their
ancestors. That is why there is still an incredible, enduring interest
in the first world war battlefields in western Europe. The tour
operators say that more people make the journeys now than for decades.
On any night at the Menin gate at Ypres, one can see large numbers of
people gathering to stand and hear the “Last Post”
played. Schoolchildren still make battlefield tours of the great
cemeteries, such as Tyne Cot and the memorial at Thiepval, to
understand what went on.</hs_Para>

create more opportunities within this country for people to visit
similar sites with broad significance. In Folkestone, we have embraced
that idea by creating a memorial walk tracing the last steps of the men
as they marched from the town down to the harbour where the boats
waited to take them to France, and we are raising money to create a new
memorial arch to stand over that route, or close to the site where a
memorial arch was put up between the wars to mark the silver jubilee of
King George V and the coronation of King George VI. It bore the simple
message “In our rejoicing, we still remember them.” The
road down which the men marched was rededicated after the war as the
road of remembrance. As other hon. Members have mentioned, there are
physical war memorials listing the names of men who fought, but there
are also other memorials that recognise the symbolism of and
people’s emotional attachment  to significant sites in
this country during the first world
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000025">In

first major air raid on the civilian population carried out by German
aircraft in this country was at Folkestone in 1917, on Tontine street.
It killed 71 people out of a clear blue sky. There were no air raid
sirens and no warnings; it was not something that anyone expected. Many
people lived through it, and many have family members who were victims
of that attack. The site in Tontine street means something to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000026">We

many years in this place, and he has done so extremely convincingly and
with great passion. I might surprise him by saying that I agree with
him absolutely. All war is hell. There is no question about it. All war
is a disgrace, and it should not occur. How human beings ever thought
it up in the first place is hard to imagine. Whether we are talking
about people killed in warfare, those who are injured or maimed or
those with mental illness as a result, it is an absolute blot on

I agree with the hon. Member for Newport West that most wars occur for
all the wrong reasons. We in this place and our ancestors for over
1,000 years have got all wars wrong. Even recent wars, without entering
into recent politics, have occurred for all the wrong reasons. They
have been ill thought through. As was said about the first world war,
lions have been led by

we should not renege on or stray from that clear theme, it is entirely

is “Arma pacis fulcra”, or “Arms are the balance
of peace”. Those young boys marched 
<?notus-xml column=18?>out of the gates of Armoury house in the City of London because they
were told to do so by their officers, who were told to do so by the
Government. They did so for King and country. They did not set off from
Armoury house saying, “I wonder whether this war is right, wrong

same applies, incidentally, to those people who have stood on the high
street of Royal Wootton Bassett in my constituency on 427 separate
occasions during the last few years to pay tribute to the dead bodies
returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. The people of Wootton Bassett were
not saying that they approved or disapproved of the wars in Iraq or
Afghanistan; they had no views on those wars. They took the view that
this was not the occasion to enter into the politics of it. They knew

Gentleman is saying, although he might find that modern historians are
a little kinder to the allied leadership in the run-up to the war than
he suggested. As well as the horror and the courage that will be
recognised during the national commemoration of the first world war and
its outbreak, it is right that Parliament addresses the complexities of

have been wars for the past 1,000 years, going back to the battle of
Sherston in my constituency in 917, when King Athelstan fought off King
Canute. Is it right that we in Parliament should consider whether
Athelstan was right or wrong to fight that battle with Canute in 917?
Of course not. Equally, we should not reinvent the causes of the first
world war. That is not a matter for us; it is a matter for historians.
We in Parliament must look to the present and the future. Reinventing
the thought behind the first world war is not our job at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000038">First,

be learned; we are considering whether to sell arms to Syria. We should
remember that all wars are bad. Secondly, we should also remember that
all wars are badly thought out; that applies today as before. Thirdly,
the purpose of today’s debate, leaving aside all the politics
and history, is that it is right that we in this place should say to
the people to whom we give instructions, “You are doing the
right thing. We respect and honour what you do, and we honour the fact

order to inform the work that we do in this place, it is worth
reflecting that most people appreciate the scale of the loss of life in
the first world war, although it is still difficult to comprehend. They
know something of the 750,000 British soldiers who died, or the 1.5
million who returned home injured, and they might have heard of the
20,000 British soldiers killed on the first day of the Somme or recall
Wilfred Owen’s imagery of choking soldiers drowning in a sea of
chlorine gas. Sacrifice on such a scale must always be remembered. It
must be commemorated.</hs_Para>

however, it is
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>important that
we remember the first world war for more than the industrialisation of
death that followed in its wake. The role of Government and of
Parliament therefore is to ensure that the commemoration of the
centenary is respectful, thoughtful and reflective, without of course
in any way glorifying the nature of the war and the appalling human
sacrifice that took place. This is a commemoration, not a
celebration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000045">The
first world war was a hugely significant moment in history, important
for Britain economically, politically and socially. It was a cause,
directly or indirectly, of all the major events of the 20th century. At
home, the first world war changed much for Britain, and our reliance on
Commonwealth countries for soldiers as well as materials led to a
desire for greater independence by nations who no longer wished to be
subordinate to the empire. The war also changed the terms of the
relationship between England and the other constituent parts of the
United
Kingdom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000046">Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:43:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>
was changed politically and socially for ever. Politically, the end of
the war triggered a flight to extremes. Socially, the war gave rise to
the lost generation; so many men of marriageable age died that 50% of
women remained single in 1931, and 35% of them did not marry while of
childbearing age. The conscription of so many men during the war,
however, led to an opportunity for women in the workplace, and the
importance of that change cannot be underestimated.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:43:30"></hs_TimeCode> other great
social change to come from the first world war was of course suffrage.
Before the war, neither working men nor women had a vote. The
sacrifice  of men of all classes, combined with the movement of
women into the working world and the campaigns  of the
suffragists and suffragettes, compelled politicians to change
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:43:30"></hs_TimeCode> situation.
We should also reflect on that in this
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061148000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061148000047">The
importance of the first world war cannot be counted simply in terms of
battlefield casualties or military innovation. There is no doubt about
that. From its influence and its timing, it is the single most
significant event of the 20th century. As such, it is something we must
remember, we must commemorate, we must learn from and we must educate
our children about. The centenary is an excellent opportunity to teach
younger people about the first world war in a direct and
age-appropriate way and to initiate informed discussion about our
country and our history. I very much agree with the suggestion of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T10:44:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

other Members have noted, the Imperial war museum will play a pivotal
role in the commemoration and will be opening groundbreaking new
galleries at its London site, as well as at its Manchester site. Those
efforts will reach a wider audience than ever before and create a
legacy for future generations that will hopefully revitalise the way we
teach the history of the first world war. In addition to the £9
million already donated, the Heritage Lottery Fund will give £6
million to projects marking the centenary. It provides funds to help
local areas and communities explore their history and heritage and to
understand the war’s impact on their communities. The lottery
money will be crucial to helping local communities in their important

very much enjoyed my hon. Friend’s story about the Sussex

the second world war reunion at Combermere barracks. A young officer
could sit at the feet of people who had taken bridges during the second
world war by stripping doors off houses and laying them across the

armed services and was elected to Parliament in 1910. He rejoined at

Ukrainian holodomor refers most specifically to the brutal, artificial
famine imposed on the Ukrainian people in 1932 and 1933 by
Stalin’s regime. In its broadest sense, the holodomor refers to
the Ukrainian genocide that began in 1929 with massive waves of deadly
deportations of Ukraine’s prospering farmers, as well as the
deportation and execution of its religious, academic and cultural
leaders, which culminated in the devastating forced famine that killed
millions of innocent men, women and
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:00:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Between 1932 and 1933, a man-made famine raged through Ukraine and
Kuban, resulting in the deaths of between 7 million and 12
million people, mainly Ukrainians, and it was instigated by the Soviet
leader, Joseph
Stalin.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061149000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061149000005">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>

existence of the holocaust. In fact, there is a division of opinion in
Ukraine on  the number who died—from 2 million or 3
million up to 12 million—but they agree that it was a man-made
famine directed at Ukrainians in Ukraine and Kuban, and that it meets
the criteria for the definition of genocide in the 1948 UN convention.
It is hardly surprising that there is some confusion about the
holodomor, because it is poorly documented, the records were
manipulated and those who conducted the census were
executed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061149000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061149000006">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:01:24"></hs_TimeCode>
main goal of the artificial famine was to break the spirit of Ukrainian
farmers and force them into collectivism. It was used as an effective
tool to break the resistance of Ukrainian culture. Moscow perceived it
as a threat to Russo-centric Soviet rule, and therefore acted brutally
and sadistically to crush cultural resistance. The goal of the
artificial famine was to ethnically cleanse Ukrainians from vast
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061149000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061149000007">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>
1932, Stalin increased the basic grain procurement quota for Ukraine by
44%, knowing that such an extraordinarily high quota would result in a
grain shortage and the inability of Ukrainian peasants to feed
themselves. Such a goal would not have been achievable had the
communists not already ruined the nation’s productivity by

year, not a single village was able to meet the impossible quota, which
far exceeded Ukraine’s best output in previous years. Soviet law
was quite clear that no grain could be given to feed the peasants until
the quota was met. Stalin then issued one of the cruellest orders of
his career: if quotas were not met, all grain was to be confiscated. As

every family attempted to conceal food, as we would expect: if

proficient at detecting even the cleverest hiding places. The result
was mass starvation that took millions of lives during the terrible

August 1932, the Communist party of the USSR passed a law mandating the

Ukrainians perished as a direct result. At the same time, the Soviet
Union dumped 1.7 million tons of grain on western markets. Nearly a

However, in December 1932, the communists introduced internal
passports. That made it impossible for a villager to get a city job
without the party’s permission, which was almost universally
denied. The internal passport system was implemented to restrict the
movements of Ukrainian peasants so that they could not travel in search
of food. Ukrainian grain was collected and stored in grain elevators

roadsides were filled with the corpses of those who had died seeking

Viktor Yushchenko, ordered the release of old KGB records on the
famine. With that information, it has become very apparent that the
famine was a deliberate act of genocide—a method to ethnically
cleanse Ukrainians from the territories of Ukraine and parts of Russia.
At first, only several thousand documents were released. Another batch
of 25,000 documents is in the process of being declassified. As more
and more documents are released, this event in Ukrainian history has

28 November 2006, the Parliament of Ukraine—the Verkhovna

include Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Estonia, Ecuador, Georgia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Poland and the

<?notus-xml column=29?>anecdotes and illustrations on which she drew in her speech can give us
only the briefest glimpse of an horrific picture that was the daily
experience of suffering among people in Ukraine during that time. The
numbers of people who were involved and who suffered are staggering.
Across vast swathes of what was then the Soviet Union—notably in
Ukraine, but also as far west as Moldova and eastwards into
Kazakhstan—millions of people starved to death because of the
policies of their own

is a cause for some heart searching in the western world that for
decades this tragedy was often overlooked or ignored. Worse, it was in
some quarters denied, even among some who had pretentions to serious
scholarship. Of course, countless people inside and outside Ukraine
have fought to keep alive the memory of those who died in this atrocity
and to raise awareness of the holodomor, but probably in the west it
was pioneering historians of their time, such as Robert Conquest, who
first drew attention to what had happened. I still remember reading as
a schoolboy the first volume of Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s
“The Gulag Archipelago” and finding there his account of
the famine set in its broader context of policies of persecution,
policies sometimes of slaughter, that were directed by Lenin and Stalin
against the peoples over whom they ruled. What the efforts of those
historians and of those many people inside and outside Ukraine have
achieved is that people across the world continue to remember those who
were lost and reflect today on the warning from history that the famine
clearly
provides.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061149000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061149000031">There
is no question, in the Government’s view, but that the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:17:22"></hs_TimeCode>famine took
place as a result of Stalin and the actions of his Government. It was a
man-made tragedy. It is clear, too, that it was within modern Ukraine
where the terrible consequences of those actions were most heavily
borne. On the question whether Ukraine was specifically targeted,
whether this was a campaign directed by Stalin against any
manifestation of Ukrainian nationhood, that is certainly widely
believed, although it is not without controversy inside Ukraine, but it
is also true that other parts of the then Soviet Union were gravely
affected by the famine. In Kazakhstan, for example, the death toll as a
proportion of the local population was higher than that in Ukraine.
Areas of rural Russia were also affected; innocent people died there,
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061149000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061149000032">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:18:21"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is also clear that the Soviet regime felt deep hostility towards any
manifestation of Ukrainian nationalism and it must have known that
policies targeting the agricultural regions of the Soviet Union would
have a disproportionate effect on Ukraine. The fact that, during the
famine, Stalin closed the eastern border of Ukraine to prevent starving
peasants from entering Russia in search of food is perhaps one of the
strongest indications that his policy was, at least in part, motivated
by a hostility towards Ukraine as a nation, with an identity, tradition
and culture of its own. I think that no reasonable man or woman today
would deny the horror, the atrocity, that was the

of the holodomor,  
<?notus-xml column=30?>I can well understand the depth and strength of feeling in favour of
doing that and why some Parliaments around the world have already done
so. As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:19:34"></hs_TimeCode> the House
knows, there is still a debate among historians and others on the
question of recognition of the holodomor as genocide. Genocide has a
defined status in international law, following the 1948 UN genocide
convention. The holodomor predates the establishment of the concept of
genocide in international law and the convention was not drafted to
apply
retrospectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061149000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061149000034">Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:20:16"></hs_TimeCode>
policy is that recognition of genocides should be a matter for judicial
decision, bearing in mind the terms of the convention and the
consequences for individuals and Governments that can follow from the
designation of their actions as genocide. It should be for judges,
rather than Governments or non-judicial bodies, to make a designation
of genocide. Recognition decisions should be based on a credible
judicial process, and the courts are best placed to judge what are
essentially criminal matters. The British Government have not
proactively designated any atrocities as genocide. Those we have
recognised—the holocaust, the 1994 killings in Rwanda and the
1995 massacre at Srebrenica—are all cases in which judicial
bodies had judged the outrages to be genocide, in line with
the definition in international
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061149000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061149000035">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T11:21:35"></hs_TimeCode>

They invite foreign ambassadors, and our ambassador  normally
represents the UK at that event. To mark the 75th

forget or overlook what happened. It is important for all of us that
Governments and peoples throughout Europe continue to learn the lessons
from what happened in Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern Europe in those
years, to ensure that no one is again tempted towards policies that
could have such an appalling effect on innocent men, women and
children. We will look for other opportunities to demonstrate our
solidarity with the people of Ukraine. We will mark with them the
opportunity to mourn those who suffered or lost their lives during the
holodomor and recall the importance of remembrance of the atrocity for
the new generations growing to adulthood today. Nothing should diminish
the horror or magnitude of the events in Ukraine and elsewhere in the
Soviet Union in the 1930s. Man-made policies, a brutal dictatorship and
a pitiless ideology led to the deaths of many millions of innocent
people. That is something that the world cannot and should never

NHS hospital trusts sources 50% or less of its food from Britain. The
campaign also points out that the cost of feeding a patient varies
between £14.40 and £2.11 per day across trusts. Most

addition, according to the campaign, 93% of  NHS trusts do not
carry out any traceability checks on their food. We know that, despite
what I said earlier about British standards within food—the
British buying standards and so on, of which the Government are a keen
proponent—the standards do not apply to hospitals 
<?notus-xml column=32?>and NHS trusts. Hospital food does not have to meet British farm-assured
standards, for example, that are signalled by the Red Tractor logo that
everyone knows and in which many trust. That is a practical
illustration of the job of work that has to be done. I am focusing on
food in this debate, but we could go right across the

on the basis of the best available legal advice and technical

EU law itself promotes transparency, and that is something that is
lacking at the moment. I do not say that to criticise the Government

hon. Friend the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie) is
absolutely right. Through the McClelland report and its application in
different devolved jurisdictions, we are seeing a different way
forward. First, we need absolutely to shatter the mythology, and then
to say, “Let’s all work together to devise a way in which
we can open the market up”. By so doing, we are not creating
unfair competition; we are increasing competition. We are not levelling
the field to promote just local farmers or food producers; we are
saying, “You should be aware of the tendering processes coming
up in your local school, the fire service and so on, and we will design
the contracts in a way that allows you to go for them, just as anyone
else can.” We first need to open the door, to allow them to do
just that.</hs_Para>

do not claim to be an expert in the field, but strong consensus is now
building in the devolved Administrations and elsewhere about the way
forward. Some of that relates to inadequate feedback, or its complete
absence, from public procurers to those who want to bid. SMEs might bid
for something and not be successful, and that is the end of
it—they are not told where they have gone wrong, what their
weaknesses are and how they might
improve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061163000023">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:41:02"></hs_TimeCode>
is no surprise, given the cost and resource intensity of putting some
bids together, that many SMEs say, “Well, that was a waste of
our time. We don’t know where we went wrong. We aren’t
going to do that again.” Big corporations, whether in the food
sector or elsewhere, have units and departments specifically to do
procurement and they can take off the shelf the computer model of their
recent bids and put in a lot of effort. An SME might be a local haulage
company with 20 people working for it, of which one, in addition to
their other jobs, is told, “Have a try for this one.
We’ve finally heard about a contract coming up, so have a go for
it.” However, they hear nothing back, so they receive no
guidance. That is simply
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:41:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061163000024">Many
tender documents for procurement are inadequate: some are too large or
too extensive, to the point that it is no wonder that SMEs do not

the cost of devising the bid. Why would they bother to go for
it?</hs_Para>

often to do with the fact that some of the bonds or liabilities
required are absolutely beyond the reach of SMEs. It is fair enough if
there is a reason for having large financial guarantees, but some
contracts are relatively small and the procurement could easily be
intelligently devised so that hurdles—liabilities and
bonds—were far lower. That would encourage more SMEs  to
apply. It is not rocket science, but it does require 
<?notus-xml column=34?>procurement officers and departments at all levels—central
Government, local government and all agencies—to have the
necessary will and capabilities, which I shall touch on in a

use of frameworks can amount to market exclusion.
Frameworks—long-enduring ones with four-year-long contract
applications, for instance—are sometimes there for a good
purpose, but once they are won the process is over. Long frameworks are
normally linked to large, onerous contract documents of immense detail
and complexity, and they are sometimes not the right way forward,
particularly if we want to encourage more SMEs to take part in the
bidding
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061163000027">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:43:39"></hs_TimeCode>
is a flip side: the more we go for frameworks, the more we are likely
to minimise the number of those wanting to tender and possibly to
encourage cartel operation. If there are only four, five or six large
players in any particular sector that can bid through a framework
document over several years, with all the complexity involved, that is
likely to lead to their taking the opportunity for cartel behaviour. I
have to stress that I will not, under parliamentary privilege, lay any
direct accusations before the

and, as a Welsh MP, I know it well. I am not saying that the Minister
must do what the Welsh Government say and follow their
example—although sometimes that is not a bad thing—but
simply that they are carving out a method that is in its early days,

procurement is approximately £4.3 billion a year,

of open and transparent competition for anybody who wants to bid into
the system, but the way we have traditionally done it has favoured very
few small players. There is a real issue of investment, both
financially and in guidance on the expertise of procurement
departments. We should force the pace of change with local authorities,
the NHS, fire services and Government agencies to go down that line to
ensure that we deliver the maximum benefit for our local and regional

Wales, and it is happening on a good sound legal basis. I am interested

ran a very small business for many years and know how hard it is to
procure contracts with public sector organisations. When dealing with
private sector businesses, I used to find that the public sector had
three questions. “Can you supply the goods? What is the price?
Is the quality of the product good enough?” Indeed if any of us
were buying something for ourselves, whether a three-piece suite or a
new carpet, those would be the three questions we would ask. However, I
understand that when considering public sector procurement, life is not
quite as simplistic as that; there are other significant issues to be
addressed. Moreover, as a public body dealing with public money, there
are certain other considerations that should be taken into account.
Ostensibly, though, they should be looking for the same thing: a good
reliable service or product that is properly produced at a competitive
price and has a robust after-sales back-up
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:55:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0001.htm#13061163000053">Let
us stand up for the public sector. Small businesses derive one
advantage from dealing with a public sector organisation—as I
can vouch from experience—and that is security of payment. I
have lost count of the number of times over the 25 years that I was in
business when private customers delayed payment, were slow in payment
or, even worse, went into liquidation or receivership owing my business
money. Sometimes they owed me very small amounts. Thankfully, it was
only on a few occasions that I was owed large amounts. At this point I
could veer off into the issue of phoenix companies, but I am sure that
Mr Hollobone would soon call me to heel.</hs_Para>

are talking about SMEs, which can employ 100 employees, but I also want
to bat for the micro-businesses with five or six employees. When a
public sector body sends an inquiry to a small business, that SME knows
that its money will be safe, which is important. My late father used to
say, “It is not sold until it is paid for, son.” An order
from a local authority was almost as good as getting cash in the bank.
When the public body comes knocking, it should be a cause for hope
and  
<?notus-xml column=38?>perhaps even celebration for a small business; they have an inquiry from
a responsible public authority that they know they will be paid for and
from which they can hopefully make a reasonable profit. However, in
reality, for the people I have spoken to, that is not the case. I know
of businesses that have actually ignored public sector inquiries on the
basis that they are not worth the effort the business has to put in to
get the work. I understand the amount of rigour that has to be
undergone for some huge infrastructure contract, but let us be honest,
a company the size of Laing O’Rourke has the capacity and
resources to deal with all that stuff. I am talking about the SMEs that
do not have such resources.</hs_Para>

my experience, when a small company gets an inquiry from a public
sector body, it comes bound up in a lot of bureaucratic red tape. The
small business owner, which is what I was, looks at it and considers
what they have to do even to put a price in. When they work that out
and look at the value of the contract, they find that by the time they
have fulfilled all the bureaucratic criteria, the profit is so small
that it is not worth doing. Some people might say, “So what?
There are plenty of other companies that will do it.” That is
not the point. The big companies might do it, and the hon. Gentleman
made some good points in that regard, but is it necessarily achieving
the best result for the taxpayer? I do not believe that it is. Although
I do not want to alienate the large companies in my constituency, I
have to say that many small and micro businesses run lean and tight
ships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T14:58:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

point of great relevance is about missed opportunities. A large number
of small businesses have quite useful inventions and new technologies
that do not always see the light of day. They apply to the national
health service or to some other large public sector organisation and
the simple process of getting them on to the table for negotiation is

I was saying, many small and micro-businesses run tight
ships—they are hyper-efficient. Consequently, they can offer
products and services at much reduced prices, and every bit equal in
quality. However, all the bureaucratic muddle and red tape is not only
depriving small businesses of the opportunity to supply but means that
public sector bodies are paying more money for the services they
procure. The process is costing public sector bodies more twice over.
First, someone in the public body must administer all the paperwork,
with all the forms having to be read, checked and all the rest of it,
so that creates a higher cost for procurement. Secondly, because the
public sector bodies are ruling out—shall we say?—more
competitive companies by their system, they are also paying more for
the products they procure. In many respects, the public sector is
paying more for goods; I hate to use the phrase, “paying through
the nose”, but it is paying a premium because of its own

they do so unwittingly.

Obviously, I do not want to disclose the company owner’s
details, because it is not fair on him. He tendered for a fairly modest
contract with a public sector organisation, which will also remain
nameless. He sent me a PQQ that is 20 pages long and asks for
information such as cash-flow forecasts. It also asks for a bank letter
outlining the company’s current cash and credit position. I am

lost it by a very small amount of money. However, what was not factored
in was the fact that the local authority I was tendering to, which was
very close to my premises, wanted an option to pick up and take away
tools. I lost the contract, but I lost it to a supplier 70 miles away.
Because my headline price was a little higher than they had quoted, I
did not get the contract, but I thought, “Well, how much is it
going to cost for the vans for the authority to go to and fro 70 miles

with the problem and they are doing some good things, but from what I
see across a wide range of public sector bodies there seems to be too
much focus on the process and not on the outcome. As a former small
business man myself, that drives me mad. The process is absolutely
ridiculous: it costs the authority more to administer; it costs the

we have to drive that practice out of the public sector. I know that we
cannot get rid of all of it but we really need to clamp down on it,

need to give them every chance to supply big public sector

procurement spend is significant even in these challenging times.
Public sector bodies, including central Government, the armed forces

procurement is an underused tool when it comes to keeping trade local.

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:23:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ogmore mentioned procurement examples in the food
sector, and I want to touch on another example of best practice, which
I am pleased to say comes from my constituency. It concerns the defence
and security industry, which is a massive industry for us. We are lucky
in Islwyn that we have General Dynamics UK, which moved there
specifically because of a Ministry of Defence contract. It has access
to markets and cutting-edge technology that can be used by small
businesses. I am delighted that the EDGE UK facility is in Oakdale at
the moment. It does an incredible amount of work with SMEs, helping
them to get access to defence and security markets nationally and
internationally. Not only that, but its modus operandi protects the
intellectual property of the SME and ensures buy-in from all sides,
offering clear benefits to both parties. If the Minister wants to see
an example of innovation in the procurement process, she has an open
invitation to come to Islwyn and to Oakdale. I shall be happy to show
her round; I think she will find it is a beautiful
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:24:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000104">Anyone
who has dealt with SMEs will say how important it is for them to work
with larger companies, retain their intellectual property and win new
business in the market. EDGE UK is appreciated by the customers of
General Dynamics UK, including the Ministry of Defence, as it helps
those with a niche capability from SMEs who usually cannot get access
to the customer. Through EDGE UK General Dynamics works with an average
of 50 SMEs a year, constantly seeking out and reviewing innovative
developments. I know from speaking with people from General Dynamics
that it is always keen to attend business events, to expand awareness
of EDGE UK through the SME community, and to invite new SMEs to talk
about ways they can engage with a company through EDGE UK. I remind all
those with small businesses, if any of them are watching the
debate—hopefully on television on a Sunday morning—that
they have an open invitation to get involved with EDGE UK, and to get
access to its innovation and capability. It is
fantastic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:25:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000105">Not
every SME can work with General Dynamics, of course. Products may need
maturing. EDGE UK provides support to such SMEs, to help them identify
avenues 
<?notus-xml column=46?>for funding that will help them develop their technologies. Those
include, for example, the Centre for Defence Enterprise, the Technology
Strategy Board, and the various business funding streams available from
the Welsh Government. We cannot talk about SMEs and procurement in the
public sector without looking at examples such as EDGE UK and seeing
what we can learn and apply. For every General Dynamics success story
and every EDGE UK there is someone in Wales, or somewhere in
Britain—perhaps a micro-business employing five people, such as
a painter and decorator—who is desperate to get hold of a
contract: to paint a council house or school building. That is because
those are what I like to term Bank of England contracts—they
will not fall apart under someone’s feet, and they will not walk
away: the business owner knows they will get the money at the end of
the day. When there are businesses that pay their bills late, access to
contracts of that kind is vital.</hs_Para>

frustrating that, as

hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore mentioned in an intervention, people
have to wade through 50 pages of tendering documents. The time and
money that goes into public contracts makes it harder and harder for
small and micro-businesses to tender for them. The process costs money
that is precious to them, and they become caught in a vicious cycle.
They have no money for the tender, but they need to tender to make
money. The fact that the Government are willing to promote the
tendering process, but allow companies to get stuck in a system where
they cannot get hold of contracts, is a bit of a hare-brained scheme.
On a recent visit to Axiom Manufacturing Services, a successful
manufacturer in my constituency, the frustration of the situation was
pointed out to me. First, no help is provided with filling in the
contracts: the business does not know what is being looked for in the
tender. Secondly, feedback is rarely given to those who are
unsuccessful, so it is not possible to move on and improve processes

return to the 25% aspiration, let me say that now is the time for a
coherent Government plan. Since I entered the House I have often heard
the accusation that all the Opposition do is oppose everything, but I
want to set out concrete plans, and I hope the Minister will listen to
five points. First, there should be agreement by Government that
procurement will be used as an engine of economic growth. I do not mean
central Government but all levels of government, including councils and
the NHS. Secondly, a border line should be established and we need to
set a target in stone. If 25% is too high, and is just an aspiration,
we need to bring the target down; but we need to begin achieving
targets, and they need to be measurable.</hs_Para>

I must return to the example of General Dynamics UK and EDGE UK for
this—every company with more than a certain number of employees,
in receipt of a Government contract, needs to produce a training plan
and an apprenticeship scheme, to enable young people to get on the
ladder, so that skills and training will improve. That cannot be put in
place at zero cost.</hs_Para>

we should take a leaf from the book of General Dynamics UK and use
procurement to encourage innovation, allowing bidders to come up with
new, fresh ideas. That should be in the tendering process. My fifth 
<?notus-xml column=47?>point relates to what I said before about Axiom. There is a need for
help from public bodies, for contracts to be designed in a way that
allows SMEs to compete. We need standard contracts across the board. We
also need a helpline or someone in Government, in the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills; at Axiom I discussed bringing
troubleshooters in. There is a need for a crack team that can be called
free and told, “I need help to fill this contract in.”
The Government could send it on.</hs_Para>

be innovative processes. However, we must remember that, without
Government will, a limited number of suppliers will still reinforce
their market share, stifle competition and keep prices high. Government
will and action are needed, and I hope that we see that
today.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/7C5B65F7B2A8D52AABF198E94B3DEB1549C29A26" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="11 June 2013">Tuesday

important subject and for setting us off so passionately. As has been
echoing around the Chamber this afternoon, we share a passion for the
same thing: seeing excellent procurement that serves the
customer—in this case, the taxpayer—and promotes growth.

the outset, the Government have fully recognised the vital role that
SMEs play in helping us achieve the best possible value for
money—in some cases for reasons of cost and in others for
reasons of innovation, a theme that has also rightly reverberated

other goods or

the minutes remaining, I will take the hon. Gentleman’s
invitation to shatter some myths. Let us do that together this

ways in which we can hold procurers to
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000140">I
will start by addressing the goal that, by the end of this Parliament,
25% of direct and indirect Government procurement by value should go to
SMEs. Although I want to move on to some content that I know will be of
great help to every Member when talking to their constituents, I first
need to make an overtly political point. I am sad to say that we had to
take the bold step of setting a 25% aspiration because before that,
under the previous Government, no effort was made to measure such
things. The lecture I have just received from the Opposition
Front-Bench spokesman is more than a little rich in that context. Even
a member of the previous Government has had the dignity to look ahead
and say what we need to do better for SMEs, and I am afraid that I do
not think the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman is hitting the same
heights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:47:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000141">After
a lot of hard work in 2010, we found out that SME procurement in
2009-10 amounted to 6.5% of all procurement, or £3.1
billion—a shamefully low figure given that 95% or more of
private sector businesses in 
<?notus-xml column=51?>the UK are microfirms, or companies with fewer than 10 employees. We
recognised that something had to be done to remove the barriers facing
many companies when bidding for Government contracts, and we have gone
a long way towards removing those barriers. I will work through a
couple of points that will help Members to express that to their
constituents, which is one important thing we can do to send the
message
outwards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:48:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000142">Over
the past three years, we have increased accessibility and transparency,
identified and addressed poor procurement practice and provided
practical assistance to help SMEs. I will start with
accessibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T15:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>
and transparency. We have made contracts smaller and broken them up
under various headings. Some of the finest examples of that can be
found in information and communications technology, where historically
Governments have been subject to procurement disasters. We have instead
deliberately gone out to approach SMEs for Government ICT needs and
have had some good successes. We have also set up Contracts Finder to
increase accessibility; it is a one-stop shop to enable suppliers to
find procurement and subcontracting opportunities. They can also find
tender documents and contracts online, all free of charge. I urge
anyone listening to or reading this debate to look at
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000143">People
will also find online and accessible pipelines of what the Government
are looking to procure under a range of topics. All those kinds of
thing help would-be suppliers to know what we are looking for. As I
said in my opening remarks, we believe in procurement for growth, and
we believe strongly that pipelines can help in that endeavour by
explaining to industry what this very large customer, the Government,
are looking for over time.</hs_Para>

dynamic marketplace, companies can register without cost to provide
quick quotes for low-value Government contracts below £100,000.
That enables them to bid and compete at minimal cost alongside larger
suppliers. I recognise the points made this afternoon about the cost of
bidding. We are doing something about that. On the other side of the
deal, what does that give customers—Departments and the
taxpayers whom they represent? It gives us cost-effective access to
pre-registered Government suppliers and allows bids to be issued and
responded to electronically, which again makes the procurement process
quicker and more
effective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000145">On

for Islwyn (Chris Evans), who wanted to know where SMEs could turn for
help. There is a Crown representative in Government especially for the
purpose of giving SMEs a voice at the table. That is vital, and we have
done it. We have also set up an SME panel to provide a regular forum
for SMEs to raise the issues that concern them most and hold our feet
to the fire. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the SMEs on that panel do
so. I have been there, and I have enjoyed meeting the panel very
much.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000146">Moving

wallpaper supplier in his constituency. I will start with that example.

contracts of more than £10,000 must be advertised on Contracts
Finder; I am sure that those who have their smartphones out will find
it a helpful source of information. The second question brings me to a
point that I shall make later. We need to leave some areas of
professional competence for the contractors themselves. It may be under
the headings that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. There are instances in

characteristics that suit their
procurement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000154">I
turn to a couple of other points that have been made. Hon. Members have
asked for there to be ways of giving feedback to unsuccessful bidders.
We have used 
<?notus-xml column=53?>the mystery shopper to provide that in some cases; I am interested in
how we can encourage it as a far wider practice. I will also give an
example of the move away from frameworks, another point made earlier.
In some cases, it can be an instance of poor procurement practice when
frameworks are used inappropriately. They can certainly be a blunt
instrument. I point hon. Members to the example of the G-Cloud, a way
that we are procuring for IT across Government that has done away with
frameworks entirely. There are many more such examples.</hs_Para>

fully appreciate that the Minister may argue that consumers should be
given the maximum amount of choice and should be empowered to make
their own decisions, but the plain fact of the matter is that, as we
all know and as is remarked on in the regulatory impact assessment of
the Bill, there is a huge amount of inertia among energy consumers, in
particular those who remained with their former monopoly supplier after
privatisation. If the provision in the Bill remains as it is, there is
a real danger that companies might take the second option and make an
offer to the consumer. We are then faced with the issue of what form
that offer might
take.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000171">We
already receive a huge amount of paper from our energy providers. As
well as bills, we get special offers and offers to take on maintenance
of domestic appliances, drains, pipes, electrics and whatever else. We
also get invitations to take up different ways to pay our bills,
especially if the providers have not yet signed us up to a direct
debit; once we have direct debits, they make regular attempts to
increase the amount we are paying by direct debit—amounts that
sometimes bear no relation to how much energy we actually use. Now,
too, we get annual and regular energy statements. That is all useful,
but how many of our constituents really take the time to go through
that mountain of information, and how many just put it in the recycling
bin with all the other junk

first option, however, is straightforward: if consumers are on a
contract or supply terms that are not the best, they can be
automatically transferred to a better deal, unless they make the
specific decision not to do so. That seems to have a better chance of
fulfilling the Prime Minister’s promise to ensure that every
customer is on the lowest tariff. Of course, the situation would have
to be monitored, to ensure that the energy company is indeed offering
the lowest tariff, but that can be addressed by Ofgem and to an extent
by the provisions of subsection (5) of what was the new clause. I am
interested to hear what Ministers have to say about that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:03:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

concern and the main point of today’s debate is how that relates
specifically to some of the poorest in our society who have to rely on
prepayment meters. If someone is on a direct debit tariff, that may be
fine, but if they are on a prepayment meter, for example, they will
still be stuck on a higher tariff, since those tariffs are generally
higher than the ones that would be available to someone who is paying
by direct debit. If the Government are truly intent on ensuring that
everyone has the lowest possible bill, they need to ensure that the
requirement applies not only within the type of contract that the
customers already have, but to allow them to move to a cheaper type of
contract<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:04:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000174">There

problem with prepayment meters is not only that the tariff tends to be
higher—to be fair, things are better than they used to be, and
many companies now fix at the standard tariff, although this is higher
than the tariffs that can be achieved on, for example, direct
debit—but that many, though not all, of those on prepayment
meters are put on them because they have a debt, and part of that debt
is recouped every time the consumer tops up the meter. The costs of
installation can also be added to the debt, meaning that consumers are
pushed further into
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000179">Meters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>

effect is that if people are already struggling to keep up with

debit, should they fall into difficulties—perhaps they lose
their job or become ill, or for any of a vast number of
reasons—they end up being put on an even more expensive tariff,

the debate was announced, Barnardo’s got in touch with me and
mentioned the problem, expressing its concerns that the
Government’s plans to simplify the charging system will still
allow fuel companies to charge higher prices for those who pay for
their electricity and gas through prepayment meters rather than through
direct debit. Barnardo’s quoted research showing that vulnerable
households in or on the margins of poverty are forced to pay through
their energy bills an extra  £1.1 billion a year above
those on high incomes. A key reason for that is that such households
often have to opt for a higher-cost payment
method.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000184">Interestingly,
the energy companies often argue that the costs of providing and
servicing prepayment meters are higher than for other payment methods,
but Barnardo’s cites the example of what it refers to as the
“reasonable cost” of the Northern Ireland keypad, which
shows that prepayment meters do not necessarily have to involve a large
premium. I am not familiar with the Northern Ireland system, but the

also makes the point that the reason that many people use such meters
is that they do not have access to a bank account to take advantage of
direct debit payment. That is undeniably true, but it is also true that
it is almost impossible for many people in such situations to get a
bank account, since, frankly, the main banks are not interested, and
many of them now seem to be moving to charging for current accounts,
which is hardly likely to help. Barnardo’s calls upon the
Government to extend the Post Office card account to allow payment of
bills by direct debit, which I understand was promised in the coalition
agreement. I appreciate that this may be outwith the Minister’s
remit today, but that could be considered when introducing the
universal credit.</hs_Para>

That applies not just in Scotland but throughout the UK. The hon.

issue with the term “self-disconnection”, making the
valid point that it implies an element of choice. It also makes the
point that in a harsh winter the loss of power to homes is national

news—yet the plight of prepayment meter users, who must endure a
regular loss of supply in both summer and winter because they cannot
afford to buy credit, goes largely

and district citizens advice bureau told me that it has worked with
other citizens advice bureaux and other organisations in its area to

the exclusion of people from the best deals is clearly part of the
problem, but it also noted that a worrying number of people do not
understand how they are charged when they have such a meter. Those who
move into a property where there is already a prepayment meter inherit
an unfair system. They may quickly get into difficulties through no
fault of their own and they often cannot afford to change the system
they

Advice Scotland also raised that point and noted that many consumers
are caught unawares by standing charges, so debt may accumulate in
periods when they are using very little energy and impact upon them
when they start to use it again in the winter months. It quotes the

Advice Scotland adds that when consumers are in receipt of benefits,
energy suppliers should recognise that they face additional payment
difficulties and take action to support them, especially given the
significant ongoing changes in the benefit system. In particular,
suppliers should monitor usage, particularly among prepayment
consumers, and take proactive action if there is evidence of self
disconnection. I have been contacted by the StepChange debt charity,
which has pointed out that an increasing number of over-60s are in fuel
poverty because of rising prices, and that that number is substantially
higher than in other age

Advice recommended that prepayment meters should be fixed at the

Minister to take it up with the energy companies and, if necessary,
introduce amendments to the Energy Bill in the other place to make it
happen. He did not accept my amendments when they were offered to him,
but I will not take offence if he introduces his own. That would help
to ensure that customers who have difficulty paying for energy and use
prepayment meters as a budgeting tool are not penalised for doing so,
and that customers with arrears are not pushed further into debt by the
additional costs of installing a prepayment meter and of paying a
higher

Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the
right hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon), said that he was not
in favour of a specific percentage because that could mean that people
would continue to pay towards the debt over the summer months when they
use little gas. However, as I said, because of the operation of
standing charges on prepayment meters, debts continue to increase over
that period whether energy is being used or not, so that argument does
not hold water. He also stated that it would take a long time for a
family to get out of debt. The problem with that approach is that
people on low incomes cannot ever get to the stage of being able to
heat their homes properly, leading to ever greater

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:15:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Angus (Mr Weir) on securing this debate on fuel poverty and the use
of prepayment meters. He is an acknowledged champion in this place of
the fuel-poor, and from my time on the Select Committee on
Environmental Audit I know of his personal commitment and professional
expertise. Whenever he speaks on the subject, we listen carefully and
thoughtfully even if we do not always agree. I reassure him that the
coalition Government are committed to helping hard-working families and
consumers with the rising cost of living. We recognise that the rising
cost of energy is currently one of the biggest worries for
householders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000200">The
modest fall in the number of households living in fuel poverty was
confirmed in April. The latest figures show that in 2011, 4.5 million
households in the UK were in fuel poverty. That was a slight decrease
from 4.75 million in 2010, which saw the first fall in the number of
fuel-poor since 2004. Throughout the last Parliament and for a couple
of years before, there was an inexorable increase in the number of
fuel-poor. Despite the modest falls, encouraging as they are, there is
absolutely no room for complacency. The figure is still far too high
and we are honest enough to realise that some of the problem is beyond
the Government’s control. The steady growth in the number was
driven 
<?notus-xml column=60?>primarily by increases in the wholesale price of gas. There is a direct
correlation not between the sympathy that the Government of the day
feel for the fuel-poor and the rhetoric they employ, but between the
wholesale cost of gas and the price of energy that people must pay. We
must do more to decouple that link and to cushion consumers from the
international gas

Barker:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman made several points that I hope
to cover, but I want to set out the framework and the context in which
we must operate. Of the 3.2 million fuel-poor households in England in
2011, around 20% paid for their electricity and 24% paid for their gas
with prepayment meters. Many hon. Members and certainly members of the
public will be surprised that the figure is so low, because there is
often an assumption that “fuel-poor” and
“prepayment meter” are synonymous. In fact, only a
relatively small number of the fuel-poor—20%—are on
prepayment meters. Prepayment meters enable customers to monitor and
control their energy expenditure in a direct and immediate way and, as
a last resort, they can be a valuable alternative to disconnection for
non-payment of bills.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061163000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000203">Where
prepayment meters are installed to recover a debt, that element of a
customer’s payment must be set at a level that takes into
account their ability to pay. The hon. Gentleman rightly says that
there must be an equitable balance in such situations between debt
repayment and the real ongoing needs of a household to cook, to heat
the home to a safe level and to light the premises, particularly where
there are children, or elderly or vulnerable people. It is
understandable that he seeks a cap for weekly payments. Customers in
debt repay a fixed amount at fixed intervals—for example,
weekly. The amount repaid is calculated for each customer based on
their personal circumstances and their ability to pay. He asked what
would happen if their circumstances changed. In those cases, customers
should talk to their supplier about the change and how it may impact on
their ability to repay
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000204">I
recognise that a percentage repayment, such as 20% of the amount spent,
may feel fairer, and that fixed payments can be a blunt instrument, but
there are two sides to the coin. There is a risk that setting a
percentage limit may create a floor rather than a ceiling. It may
encourage suppliers to use the limit as the automatic default position
rather than, as they do now, individualised payment plans, which are
surely in everyone’s interest.</hs_Para>

Gentleman makes the valid point that in some cases customers may feel
that they are set an inappropriately high debt recovery level. If that
is  the case, they need to speak to their supplier. If that
does not satisfy them, they should speak to Ofgem or the energy saving
advice service, which is run by the Government, for further advice on
what to do.</hs_Para>

seem right, but I am not aware that it is the norm; it is the exception
and if he is aware of such cases, I encourage him to take them up. I
want to know more about the individual circumstances of the household
and how the debt built up to such a level. We cannot have a situation
where we ignore moral hazard and certain households do not feel an
obligation to repay debt, because that penalises and is unfair to those
on low incomes who struggle to pay their electricity and heating bills
on time. We simply cannot give away heating when their next-door
neighbours are struggling hard to do the right thing and pay the bills.

Barker:</Member></B> I would be more than willing to do that. Perhaps
the hon. Gentleman will be kind enough to write to me with his
particular proposal, or the example he thinks best illuminates the
case. Prepayment meters obviously have a cost. Ofgem estimates that it
costs £88 more than paying by direct debit. If there is a
cheaper alternative model for prepayment meters in Northern Ireland, I,
for one, would be extremely interested in looking at
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000210">The
hon. Member for Angus mentioned the Prime Minister’s commitment
to put everyone on the best deal, but that deal must be
cost-reflective. As I said, it costs more to put people on prepayment
meters. Ultimately, with only 20% of the fuel-poor, roughly speaking,
on prepayment meters, we should not see them as a good thing. In an
ideal world, no one would be on a prepayment meter. We do not want to
create such an attractive situation that more people opt to go to a

meter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000211">One
of the exciting developments in technology is the advent of smart

people, I have a slight degree of target fatigue, because targets do
not get rid of fuel poverty: action, policy and committing to take
measures and following them through get rid of fuel poverty. I am
slightly sceptical that setting more targets is a good way of
addressing something. The previous Government had a target, and fuel

2010, most suppliers have chosen to equalise their prepayment tariffs
with standard credit prices, which is a major step forward. In the
current system, licence conditions require suppliers to take into
account the consumer’s ability to repay when setting instalments
to repay gas and/or electricity debt. That allows consumers or their

their circumstances.</hs_Para>

communication is the key to compliance.  An assessment of a
customer’s ability to repay a debt should be verified through
direct customer contact or through a third party, such as the citizens

that consumers know how much they are repaying each week and when the
debt will be repaid. The average level of debt owed by dual fuel
consumers in 2011 was £728, so a family with an average level of
debt agreeing to repay the debt at £5 a week on top of their

the Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale (David Morris) in his place. He
will know that the GLA was set up in 2004 after the tragedy of the
Morecambe bay cockle pickers disaster. He has spoken most effectively
in bringing these issues to the attention of the House previously. We
are talking about legislation that is directed at protecting the most
vulnerable people in society and particularly those working in the
agricultural sector. In many cases, they are a long way from home, have
difficulties with the language and are fearful of authority. They are
therefore vulnerable people who do need
protecting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:32:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000226">It
is remarkable that the consultation brought forward by the Department
seems to be excluding the measure that the Minister, in response to my
debate last year, said was an important tool that was lacking and
needed to be included. It may be helpful if I set out why I think that
the Department has got itself into this
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:32:45"></hs_TimeCode>. I
think that it is in large measure down to another ministerial
statement. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:34:00"></hs_TimeCode>
all like cross-departmental working, and it is very good that the
Department is taking note of ministerial statements elsewhere.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:33:02"></hs_TimeCode>The Minister of
State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon), quite rightly
articulated concerns about red tape. That is a concern that many hon.
Members share. My right hon. Friend therefore set out a new test: it
was a general rule that new powers to fine should not apply to firms
with fewer than 250 people. I think that there was good logic to
bringing in that measure, but it was a general rule; it was not
absolute. This Minister may want to clarify the position with his
officials. Obviously, the measure has been signed off by Ministers, but
there almost seems to be a bit of gold-plating whereby what is a
general rule has been applied in absolute
terms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000227">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:33:35"></hs_TimeCode>
course, most gangmasters do not employ more than 250 people. Indeed, if
they did, the existing powers would be confined just to those above
250, but we do 
<?notus-xml column=64?>not do that for the criminal powers, so is it not illogical that for
criminal powers we say that they apply to the gangmaster population as
a whole, yet for civil powers, where one assumes a lower test, we raise
the bar and say that they apply only to gangmasters with more
than  250 people working for them? That is at odds not only
with what the Minister said to me this time last year in response to my
debate, but with the existing legislation under which the Department is
acting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:34:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:34:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
It is also—dare I say it?—at odds with common sense,
because if we look at the use of criminal powers, we see that it is
clearly not
working.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000228">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>
us take, for example, two recent cases in Northern Ireland. In those
cases, the fines imposed on the gangmasters acting illegally and making
large sums of money—often, gangmasters are not paying tax, and
quite often they are linked to other crime, such as prostitution and
counterfeiting—were just £500 apiece. I think that most
hon. Members would accept that the profits that those gangmasters had
made far exceeded the fines that were imposed by the courts. We have a
strange situation in which we have criminal powers, which the GLA
rarely uses. If a gangmaster is unlucky enough to be caught, they know
that the fine is likely to be less than the profits that they have
made. They know that, on most occasions, witnesses are very fearful of
coming forward and therefore the number of prosecutions is very low.
Last year, for example, there were just 15 prosecutions against
gangmasters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000229">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:39:34"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson) will be familiar
with, Operation Pheasant. So far, it has raided 80 homes and it has a
number of live inquiries, but it is finding the most horrendous issues.
We had a case recently in Whittlesey in which migrant labour was living
in a house and there was CCTV not just on the front and back doors but
in the inside rooms in order that the gangmaster could control his
labour force. We have had other cases of people living in a garage with
an open
sewer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:36:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000230">This

that of my hon. Friend
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:36:43"></hs_TimeCode>the Member for
Peterborough but for the local residents, because where there are high
concentrations of houses in multiple occupation, there is antisocial
behaviour. It is very difficult for people to stay in the house, so
they tend to go out and street-drink. When they street-drink, we get
urination on people’s front doors. I cited some particularly
unpleasant and disturbing cases in the debate last year. I will not
detain hon. Members by rerunning those, but it is very clear that there
are issues of antisocial behaviour and legitimate concerns for the
local population that flow back to our unwillingness to tackle
gangmasters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:37:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000231">Therefore,
I suggest to the House that the key way in which we should be tackling
gangmasters is by hitting them in the area that they are most concerned
about. That is in their pocket; it is through fines. That is the way in
which we will change their behaviour, so I find it remarkable that the
consultation from the GLA is excluding a tool that the Minister last
year said was important, is gold-plating a legitimate concern of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:37:56"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Sevenoaks, and 
<?notus-xml column=65?>applying that in a bizarre and arbitrary way and is failing to address
the legitimate concerns about antisocial behaviour with enforcement,
because the criminal tools that are used are not working. They are
rarely applied. The fact that there were just 15 prosecutions clearly
shows that they are not working. Then when there are prosecutions, the
level of the fine is
derisory<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:38:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000232">I
say to this Minister that I find the situation quite disappointing. I,
as a Member of Parliament, articulate real concerns about things
affecting my constituency. The Home Secretary acts on those concerns
with Operation Pheasant. We have good support from Cambridgeshire
police—in the debate last night, I paid tribute to Inspector
Sissons and the work that he is doing. I am keen that my local council
does more, and I have been in active discussions to ensure that it uses
its powers. I am very sympathetic about the difficulties of resourcing
that the GLA has. We all know that the last Government left us with a
huge level of debt. Although I believe that the GLA should be far
better resourced—I think that that would be a good use of the
Department’s budget—I am very sympathetic about the
difficulties that the Department faces because of what was inherited.
But surely the answer, if we have a problem in trying to resource it
more, is to make it easier to prosecute—to make it easier to
impose fines, because it is the fines that will change the behaviour of
the
gangmasters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000233">We

gangmasters, but we know that there are illegal gangmasters and
heartbreaking abuses taking place in my constituency and the

being placed on local residents, who often have to bear the
consequences of the antisocial behaviour that flows from the
concentration of houses in multiple occupation and the lack of
enforcement against illegal gangmasters, who often misleadingly attract
people from overseas. Illegal gangmasters will go to Lithuania for
example and say, “Come to the fens. You have a guaranteed job
and guaranteed accommodation.” When the workers arrive, there is
often only one, two or three days’ work before they exhaust
their savings, are in debt and the gangmasters have
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000234">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:40:32"></hs_TimeCode>

best practice. Other Departments are acting, but the Department of the

look again at his consultation and at whether the powers it equips the

opportunity to make the GLA a modern enforcement agency that better
targets criminal activities, while applying a light touch elsewhere.
That is one of the thrusts of the work we have done. Part of the

that intervention, I was suggesting that in areas where the experience

regulation, we can safely remove those currently licensed activities
from the scope of regulation and redeploy the resources elsewhere. My

proposed reforms to GLA operations, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:48:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Cambridgeshire said. That consultation includes
proposals to exclude some activities that currently require a licence
from  the scope of licensing, where evidence suggests that
there is a low risk of exploitation of workers. That proposal would
remove about 150 businesses from licensing, 
<?notus-xml column=68?>saving those businesses about £60,000 and enabling GLA resources
to be deployed elsewhere to tackle serious
abuses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061163000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/halltext/130611h0002.htm#13061163000247">Changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-11T16:49:27"></hs_TimeCode>

the use of civil penalties as an alternative to prosecution in certain

distinction between the criminality of gangmasters operating against
vulnerable people—the raids are revealing some horrendous and
immoral issues—and the small business owner suffering from red

there is criminality I believe that criminal sanctions should apply. I
want to make it absolutely clear that, if the evidence is there, there
should not be the slightest hesitation in bringing a criminal action.

resources from areas where they are deployed to no great benefit

suffer the further penalty, where appropriate, of proceeds of crime
restitution, so that we get back the money that the gangmasters have

part of the 2010 spending review settlement, and in support of the
Government’s commitment to reduce the deficit, the FCO’s
budget is being reduced in real terms year on year. Further budget
reductions have been made in announcements at the last two autumn

creation of placement and internship opportunities across all industry
sectors, including the scientific sector. But the key responsibility
rests with businesses and universities, who must work together to help
students acquire the skills and knowledge that employers need.
Placements, internships, and work experience are part of this. For
example, Cogent (the Sector Skills Council for Science Based
Industries) takes the lead in developing an industry-owned approach to
identifying skills demand, establishing standards and commissioning
high quality training solutions. Earlier this month, they launched a
Life Sciences Skills Placement Service that will make it easier for
industry to recruit students for placements. The service aims to
provide 120 placements over the first two years, 100 placements a year
from the third year, and the first year will be subsidised for small
and medium-sized enterprises. This is in line with a Strategy for UK

UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) and its Investment Services Team (IST)
work closely with Cumbria partners. IST holds meetings every other
month with Invest in Cumbria—the Cumbria LEP's designated
delivery partner for inward investment—to discuss FDI 
<?notus-xml column=218?>issues and activity. Over the past 18 months, they have also worked
together on inward investment enquiries, relationship management of
foreign owned companies operating in Cumbria, organisation of an IST
visit to key companies and assets in Cumbria's important business
sectors, and an initiative to gather information and intelligence about
Cumbria's offer to foreign investors. This activity has involved
contact with foreign and domestic owned businesses such as Pirelli,
McVities, NuGen, Par Systems, M Sport, TIS, Forth Engineering and James
Fisher Nuclear. In addition UKTI representatives have held regular

research, to understand what makes individuals more vulnerable to
extremist ideologies and influence. This includes work to understand
the psychological and social processes, as well as local circumstances
which can increase or reduce vulnerability. A useful summary of our
understanding of vulnerability is the Channel guidance

Mundell:</Member></B> During the development and delivery of the
Scotland Act 2012, Scotland Office Ministers and Treasury Ministers met
regularly to discuss a wide range of matters relating to the new
Scottish rate of income tax, including its effect on pensions tax
relief. In May 2012, HMRC published a Technical Note entitled
"Clarifying the Scope of the Scottish Rate of Income Tax" which set out
the Government's intention to continue to give tax relief on pensions
individuals' marginal rates to all taxpayers after the Scottish rate of
income tax is introduced. HMRC continues to discuss the issue with the
industry via its Scotland Act Pensions Technical Group to find a method
of giving relief which minimises costs to the industry and HMRC and
ensures that contributors potential burdens on the industry are
minimised and that taxpayers, as far as possible, receive the right
amount of relief at the right time. The most recent meeting of the
technical group took place in April
2013.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_11_PT_1/9BFA1CF9F7AF26526FE82A9C0C3C792177087319" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="11 June 2013">Tuesday

setting school admission arrangements and must act in accordance with

authorities give priority to siblings in their admissions criteria but
they are not required to do so. We have no plans to amend the Code in
this respect. The revised Code, which came into effect on 1 February

Barker:</Member></B> The latest available data cover the years 2009-11.
This suggests that during this period in the west midlands, the average
proportion of expenditure on electricity, gas and other fuels was 5.0%.
This compares with 4.6% for the UK as a whole. These data are from the
Living Costs and Food Survey, run by the Office for National Statistics
(ONS). Data from this survey are not available at a lower level than
that of regions. Therefore data for Coventry and Coventry North East

of the scheme for an annual cost of around £350 million. Coupled
with the ECO Carbon Saving Communities obligation, worth around
£190 million per annum, we expect some 230,000 low
income households to be assisted each scheme year. We also expect the
main ECO carbon obligation to assist further low income

Swinson:</Member></B> The Government is very concerned at aggressive,
misleading advertising which lures consumers into a payday loan when it
is not suitable for them. It is not right to see payday advertising
outside job centres, as the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) found, nor is
it right for adverts to emphasise speed and ease of access at the
expense of giving customers balanced information about the cost of
lending. This is why Government and regulators announced in March this
year a strong action plan with both immediate and longer-term
measures.</hs_Para>

short-term, the OFT are taking stringent action on non-compliant payday
lenders as a top enforcement priority. Then, from April next year, the
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will take on responsibility for
regulating consumer credit. Its strong new powers will enable it to
restrict the form and content of advertising and will provide further
consumer protections. This Department is in the process of
commissioning research into payday lending advertising to help inform
the FCA's thinking on how to apply their rules in this
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="130611102000789" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/text/130611w0002.htm#130611102000789">The

Future Coastguard Programme it is recognised that all affected staff
will experience differing individual emotions which will inevitably
have an impact on collective morale. It is the responsibility of both
senior and local managers to support staff through the period of change
and this is being undertaken at all maritime rescue co-ordination

receiving adequate support. Ajoung Camp is better equipped to provide
the longer-term support for refugees, and we support the decision of
the Government of South Sudan and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees

at Adjoung Thok, which UNHCR see as a safer location given its
increased distance, particularly by road, from the insecure border

may have been adjourned for further evidence to be gathered. Complex
cases also often need a longer

they need. The Code of Practice for Victims of Crime
(Victims' Code) requires that any person alleging they are a victim of
criminal conduct that falls under the National Crime
Recording Standard, or who has had an allegation made on their behalf,
is entitled to services under the Code. Where a person has died as a
result of criminal conduct, or is unable to receive services as a
result of a disability, the victim's family spokesperson is entitled to
receive services under the Code. The Government recently consulted on a
review of the Victims’ Code. The consultation ran from 29 March
until 10 May. We are analysing the responses and intend to publish the
Government's response this
summer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306126000506" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130611/text/130611w0003.htm#1306126000506">In

on 25 April 2013 (cumulative findings from quarter 2 and 3 of the
Community Life Survey—covering the period August 2012 to January
2013) show that the proportion of people undertaking formal or informal
volunteering at least once a year now stands at 72%. This is an
increase from 65% in 2010-11, with a similarly large increase in the
proportion of people volunteering regularly (at least once a month).
This reverses the decline in levels of volunteering in recent years.

poverty in the UK. The current welfare reforms and introduction of
universal credit will simplify the system considerably, helping further
minimise delays and errors in payment as well as ensuring families are
better off in work. Our aim is to pay people the benefits to which they
are entitled accurately and on time and this happens in the
overwhelming majority of cases. Benefit sanctions are applied only in
appropriate circumstances, i.e. where the claimant was made fully aware
of what was required of them and the potential consequences of failing
to comply, a genuine doubt has been identified and a decision made in
the light of all available information, including that provided by the

of the numbers of EU citizens who are claiming contributory benefits.

two years to qualify for contributory benefits. For example an EU
