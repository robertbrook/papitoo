Valley passes through the site, so I may have to stand corrected on
which bit of the site they are made. The development upgrades and
improved ISTAR to which my hon. Friend refers will provide the RAF, and
the other six air forces that have already committed to the aircraft,
with battle-winning performance, as was demonstrated in the Libya
campaign. We are actively engaged with existing and potential partners
and customers on the scope for collaborating on the development of
further capability. We are also supporting industry in a number of
export campaigns, and are hopeful that other allies and partner nations

the armed forces needing medical care receives the very best treatment

Military Health Research confirms a low incidence rate of PTSD for UK

conjunction with the MOD and some superb charities, are providing
excellent mental health care for both serving personnel and veterans.
This includes wider awareness of the symptoms, early intervention on
deployment, greater access to mental health care for up to six months
after discharge, an increase in the number of veterans’ mental
health professionals, a 24-hour helpline in partnership with Combat
Stress, and an online mental health support and advice website provided

United Kingdom’s policy on Iran has been consistent under this
Government and the last. We share international concern, documented by
the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran’s nuclear
programme is not for purely peaceful purposes, and we deplore
Iran’s failure to co-operate fully with the IAEA, to uphold its
responsibilities under the non-proliferation treaty and to meet the
demands placed on it by UN Security Council resolutions. The Government
hope that, following Dr Rouhani’s election, the Iranian
Government will take up the opportunity of a new relationship with the
international community by making every effort to reach a negotiated
settlement on the nuclear issue. If Iran is prepared to make that
choice, we are ready to respond in good faith; our commitment to
seeking a peaceful diplomatic settlement of this dispute is sincere. So
I urge Iran to engage seriously with the E3 plus 3 and urgently to take
concrete steps to address international concerns. Iran should not doubt
our resolve to prevent nuclear proliferation in the middle east and to
increase the pressure, through international sanctions, should its
leaders choose not to take this

There have been positive words during the election campaign, but it

adopt a more constructive position when it comes to Syria, Iraq and
Lebanon, which he mentioned. The opportunity is there through the E3
plus 3 negotiations to make constructive progress on the nuclear issue
on the basis that he describes. The E3 plus 3 have made it clear since
February that we are open about the long-term benefits to Iran of
reaching a comprehensive agreement. We have been open to Iran that if
it could react in a constructive way to the offer we have put on the
table, that would open the door to the normalisation of political and
economic relations with the international community. We have proposed a
balanced and credible offer, to which Iran has not yet made a

earlier, we must be careful about how we interpret election results in
other countries. There is no doubt that sanctions on Iran are having a
major impact on the country, and that that is felt in the country, so I
want to make it clear again that if we cannot resolve the nuclear
issue, sanctions will be intensified. Iran faces a choice on this. I
cannot divine the exact feelings of the Iranian people, but I know that
they would be much better off if they resolved the nuclear

economic failure of the last eight years. The Iranian people obviously
want to change that economic failure. That provides a glint of light

signalled their agreement to a deal on reform of the common fisheries
policy. After more than three years of difficult and protracted
negotiations, the agreement confirms that EU member states can support
the deal brokered among EU institutions. All that remains is for the
European Parliament to give its approval, which we expect in the coming

am delighted to report that my fellow fisheries Ministers, and EU
institutions, have risen to the challenge of agreeing an ambitious
reform of this broken policy. The CFP has become a totemic example of
failure at EU level. Centralised micro-management and fudged objectives
have left us with fish stocks and fishing businesses that are nowhere
near as healthy as they could be. The public are rightly disgusted by
the spectacle of edible fish being thrown back into the sea.</hs_Para>

have reported back to the House several times on the progress we were
making in addressing those failings through the reform negotiations,
but despite support for a series of positive commitments, through some
difficult Councils and late-night drafting discussions, the robustness
of that reform could not be assured until we secured detailed text that
addressed the UK’s priorities. Subject to those last processes

the most tangible leap forward comes through the agreement of
provisions to eliminate discarding. The reformed CFP includes a discard
ban starting in 2015 for pelagic fish, which will be rolled out to
other fisheries from 2016. Importantly, that is supported by the
practical provisions to make the ban operational. The provisions
recognise the complex causes of discarding and address them, rather
than simply ban the practice on paper and consider that
sufficient.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306177000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0001.htm#1306177000270">I
do not underestimate the challenges fishermen will face as we adapt to
the new provisions, but we are already working with the industry in the
UK to ensure we can make the system work effectively in practice. A key
element of that will be working with the industry to develop effective
management rules. It has always been a top priority for the UK to
achieve a genuine regionalised process through reform to replace the
centralised one-size-fits-all approach. The UK led the way on that,
building support to move decision making closer to fisheries, with a
process that works within the existing treaty framework. The provisions
allow us to work together regionally, to agree the measures appropriate
to our fisheries with other member states, and to give them legal
effect through EU law or national
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306177000271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0001.htm#1306177000271">I
am pleased to report that we achieved provisions to put fishing on a
sustainable footing. For the first time, we have a legally binding
commitment to set fishing levels sustainably, eliminating over-fishing
so that we can increase biomass in the sea and improve fishing yields
in the long term. That could have a huge positive impact, not just on
stock levels and the marine ecosystem, but on the bottom line for UK
fishing
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306177000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0001.htm#1306177000272">Other
reforms will ensure that the same principles of sustainability apply to
EU vessels fishing outside Europe. Fishing agreements with non-EU
countries must be based 
<?notus-xml column=638?>on sound science and monitoring, with clauses on respect for human
rights. Under the common market organisation of the CFP, we have
secured sensible labelling rules and a strengthened role for producer
organisations to support growth in the sector and add value. Reforms to

should not underestimate the significant opposition we have faced in
achieving that momentous deal, or the rollercoaster of protracted and
detailed institutional discussions involved. The UK has been in the
vanguard of fundamental reform since the Commission published its green
paper in 2009. We have drawn support from member states and MEPs across
Europe, helped in no small part by grassroots campaigns that have
generated public enthusiasm for reform. Devolved Ministers have played
a strong part in the UK delegation to help us to face down those who
would prefer to keep the status quo, and to make the case for the
practical detail needed to make the reform workable in the diverse
fisheries that exist around the

regionalisation—and one that detained us a long time as we tried
to find a solution. Under the Commission’s original text, which
could have had a centralising effect, if the countries around a sea
basin—the North sea, for example—failed to agree, the
power to decide on the technical measures would have been taken by the
Commission. We thought that that was wrong, so we
developed—under the leadership of my Department, I have to
say—an idea that found its way into the text. Under this
provision, a measure becomes law where there is agreement among all the
countries fishing a particular sea basin, and where they cannot agree,
the matter is determined by co-decision. That is a much better way
forward. Throughout these discussions, I have always said, “I
would never start from here”. We are trying to improve something
that is very, very wrong. We are going to make it halfway right,
however, and there is still much more work to
do.</hs_Para>

sensible management will lead to increased biomass in the sea, so there
will be more fish for the small-scale fishing fleet to catch.

Benyon:</Member></B> There is a commitment at EU level that we must
protect small-scale fishermen. I entirely agree with that, because
there is a social dimension to the policy that must never be forgotten.
Part of the trio of awfulness of the common fisheries policy is
that we not only have fewer fish and fewer fishermen, but
damaged coastal communities, right through to the land-based jobs of
those who support those industries, so I absolutely agree. However,
national and devolved Governments have a responsibility to manage
fishing opportunities to ensure that we recognise the social dimension
and do what we seek to do, which is to transfer unused quota in
particular from certain sectors to the inshore fisheries sector. We
accept that the inshore fisheries sector is engaged in sustainable
management of our fisheries, so we want to see more of that, as well as
enhanced social conditions in coastal
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:37:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

was absolutely not the case. We were front and centre in driving this

of the country’s largest employers have now met their
auto-enrolment duties, and more than half a million eligible jobholders
were newly enrolled by the end of April 2013. Once this is
in a steady state we expect up to £11 billion more in pensions
saving every year. That is a very big and significant reform. People
from many other countries around the world have been to talk to
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>my hon. Friend
the Minister of State and have seen me about doing it themselves. We
are not breaking absolutely new ground, but for us and for many others
it is a real departure: getting people to save and save from the moment
they move into work.</hs_Para>

in the Bill will ensure that automatic enrolment works as intended. We
need to address some technical issues, clarify the existing powers and
provide for the automatic transfer of small pension pots. The last of
those is vital, because a quarter of people already lose track of at
least one pension, and it is estimated that some 50 million dormant
pots will exist by 2050 if we do nothing about this issue. It is
confusing, and I say 
<?notus-xml column=649?>with the greatest respect to my hon. Friend the Minister of State that
although plenty of people understand pensions, dine out on them, sleep
on them and can work them very cleverly—the word
“anorak” does not come into my lexicon at all—most
people find this a complex and difficult area. People can be left with
small pots as they move, and that is now the way of work; people move
in and out of different companies, leaving behind these pots. It is
vital to deal with that, and my hon. Friend has made a huge move to do
just that.</hs_Para>

with auto-enrolment, it is critical that people understand what they
get from the state and are able to save with some confidence. I
recognise that that is the biggest area, and it is what the single-tier
pension is all about. Auto-enrolment on its own without single tier
would be difficult, but single tier underpins auto-enrolment, making it
all the more important. The single tier will be all about setting a
basic level of pension above the means test.</hs_Para>

me give an illustrative example: 2012-13 prices would mean a single
tier of £144 a week, a basic state pension of £107 and
pension credit of £142. Under single tier, every

made the point about contributing to one’s future
wealth—reflects that we are combining both the basic pension,
based on contributions for more than 30 years, and the state second
pension, based on 49 or 50 years of contributions. We are
merging the two together. Yet even as we abolish the whole complicated
system of the additional state pension on the one hand and contracting
out on the other, we will still recognise people’s existing
contributions. This is an important matter which has been raised with
us a number of times. For example, someone who reaches state pension
age in 2016 under single tier who is due £160 under the current
system in whatever form will still get that pension of £160, so
it is locked in.</hs_Para>

who were contracted out at implementation will start to pay full

already do. In return, we believe they can build towards a pension at
full single rate. Rather than today’s much lower basic state
pension, they will get a reward for that effort to save, as I said
earlier, referencing the already existing auto-enrolment. As a result,
the vast majority, some 90% in the first two decades, will receive
enough extra over their retirement through a single-tier pension to
more than offset the higher contributions. Let us take a 40-year-old in
2016

regular review of the state pension age will ensure that the issue is
considered in every Parliament, which will avoid the necessity for
future Governments to have to take emergency action, as we did earlier.
Men and women retiring at 67 in 2028 can expect to receive a pension
for roughly just as long as those retiring at 65 today. The
review will work on the same principle—namely, that people
should spend a given proportion of their lives drawing a state
pension. By regularly considering the state pension age in the light of
changing life expectancy, we can ensure that our pension system remains
on firm foundations. That will ensure a continuing and fair social
settlement between young and old.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=653?>for too long. They now reflect a time gone by, in
which the life of a widow was quite different from what it is today.

space and time to settle and resolve most of the other issues that
require financial support. Those with dependent children will receive a
£5,000 lump sum and £400 a month for 12 months. Those
without children will receive a £2,500 lump sum and £150

history and the road to this afternoon’s debate. One of the
chief reasons why the Labour party will not stand in the Bill’s
way today is that we recognise the genuine effort to build on the
strong foundations that we left. Indeed, our only disappointment today
is that we think the Secretary of State is proposing to build only a
halfway house on those strong foundations. We think that the Bill is
merely half a reform. Therefore, the Opposition’s job during the
course of the Bill’s passage will be to ask him not simply to
fix some of the deficiencies we can see, but to be bolder and more
radical and to seize the moment that we think is there for the taking.
I want to set out a number of areas where I think he can do more to
seize that
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061715000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061715000085"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:16:57"></hs_TimeCode>I

out of absolute poverty and nearly 2 million out of relative poverty by
2010-11. It was the IFS that confirmed that both the absolute and

place. They tackled the grotesque pensioner poverty that we inherited
in 1997. That is not simply my conclusion; when the pensions Minister
spoke in the House back in 2000, he pretty much confirmed the same line
of argument and the same thesis. The job we did on pensioner poverty

purpose of the Bill is, in essence, to address one of the matters
flagged by the noble Lord Turner in his report and one for which we
legislated in 2007. As the Secretary of State mentioned, the noble Lord
recommended a new pension supplement for the 21st century—one
that is universal and, crucially, one that reduces means-testing, an
important part of the Secretary of State’s argument. As the
Secretary of State also rehearsed, the noble Lord recommended a system

Lord Turner had so assiduously constructed that we chose to follow his

the time Lord Turner flagged a number of risks in the strategy that the
Government are now pursuing. The Government have taken an approach
different from Lord Turner’s. That comes at the price of some
big notional losses for state second pension members. The goalposts on
state pension age have now been

improvement in means testing and potentially something about incentives

us take means testing first, however, as it was an important part of
the Secretary of State’s argument. Today, about 80% of people
are free of the pension credit means test; that pension credit is now
available for 20% of people. By 2020, that would have fallen to about
16% anyway. Under flat-rate pensions, there will be a further fall of
about 8%. If we put savings credit to one side, the improvement is just
2%, and of course about 35% of pensioners will still be eligible to
access council tax benefit, which is about 238,000 people, and 12% will
be able to access housing benefit—84,000 people. We
are still an awfully long way from the end of means testing, but none

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061715000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061715000095">The
Secretary of State was anxious to stress the point about savings. The
judgment of the IFS was that the effect of proposals on the incentive
to save were complex and varied. As the Bill reduces the long-run
generosity of the pension system—that is one reason why we
support it—it should increase the incentive to save. However,
although some will see lower effective marginal tax rates when pension
credit and savings credit are withdrawn, some will see higher marginal
tax rates. The IFS says, therefore, that the direction on the effect of
savings is
ambiguous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:25:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:25:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061715000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061715000096">Under
the proposals, some pensioners who have saved absolutely nothing will
be better off in real terms each week than those who have saved
substantial sums. A pensioner who has saved nothing will enjoy the
flat-rate pension of £144 a week and will be entitled to housing
benefit and council tax benefit, which is another £94 a week.
That is a total of £238 a week, which is considerably more than
what someone who has saved £24,000 will receive. They might
enjoy a notional income from savings of about 30 quid a week, plus the
flat-rate pension, which is a total of £174 a week. That is much
less—36% less—than what the pensioner who has saved
nothing will get. In fact, the pensioner who saves nothing will be
better off than someone who has put £50,000 away in the bank. So
there are still problems and disincentives to save, but none the less,

chapter 4 of “The single-tier pension: a simple foundation for

reaching state pension age after 2016 who will be eligible for
means-tested 
<?notus-xml column=657?>benefits for pensioners will fall to 16%, and that the figure will fall
to 11% by 2060. Under the single tier, eligibility for means-tested
benefits will fall by 7.5%. The hon. Gentleman will also have read, as
I have, Age UK’s evidence, which states, strikingly, that the
great bulk of that change results from the elimination of savings
credit, rather than from any increase in generosity. If we put savings
credit to one side, we will see that the change in the percentage of
pensioners eligible for means-tested benefit is just 1% or 2%. If he

DWP has published estimates that show that the cost of including those

to the Secretary of State that the change that he is taking through the
House today will net the Chancellor £5.5 billion in extra
national insurance contributions in 2016-17 and £5.4 billion in
2017-18. The Chancellor has obviously spent some of that money for the
Secretary of State by funding the proposals for social care, which are
scored at £1 billion in 2016-17, and by funding employment
allowance, which is scored at £1.6 billion. There is therefore
£2.9 billion left. The cost of remedying the position of these
women would be about 7.5% of the remaining NICs windfall that the
Secretary of State has kindly brought the Treasury and just 4% of the
overall NICs windfall. We are looking forward to working with the

together with the consequences of the reforms that the Secretary of
State has authored to auto-enrolment—I know he will do that. One
of the first decisions he took in the Pensions Act 2011 was to link the
threshold for participation in auto-enrolment to the personal
allowance. As the personal allowance has gone up, more and more
low-paid people have fallen out of the auto-enrolment system. In
2011-12, 600,000 people fell out of auto-enrolment, and another 100,000
in 2012-12. In 2013-14, 420,000 people will fall out of the
auto-enrolment system—1.1 million people have been carved out of

is that we have introduced a number of changes in the past three years
and an environment of instability and risk has been created. The
Opposition worry that reviewing it every five years will foster more
uncertainty and risk. The Government and Opposition share the objective
of increasing the level of savings. However, I am anxious to ensure
that there are safeguards against, or fetters on, not only this
Secretary of State, but future Secretaries of State, to constrain how
they make decisions on accelerating or advancing the state pension age
if they decide to do so in years to
come.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000018">The
second Opposition challenge to the Bill during its passage will be a
pressure test of the financial assumptions that underpin it. As I said
a few moments ago, those who were contracted out are now contracted in,
which is great news for the Chancellor—in fact, it is
£5.4 billion-worth of good news. In theory, that will mean that
the system will become more affordable over the long term, and that,
over the very long term, the fraction of gross domestic product and
national wealth that we spend on the pension system will come
down.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000019">The
Opposition believe that that is wise, but we are worried about a number
of short-term risks. First, how on earth will the national health
service, local government, teachers and the police find £4
billion-worth of national insurance contributions from 2016 onwards?
When the Chancellor presented his Budget, he was clear that there would
not be an awful lot of help for those in public services, but two
thirds of the money in the NICs bill comes from the NHS, teachers, the
police and local government. The Secretary of State has not said much
today, and we have not heard much from the Chancellor, on where on
earth our hard-pressed public services, particularly the NHS, will find
£4 billion from 2016
onwards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000020">During
the Bill’s passage, the Opposition would like the Secretary of
State to confirm the deal that is being offered in the Bill to the
self-employed. Currently, the self-employed pay lower NICs than anybody
else— 9% of profits in national insurance, whereas an
employee’s contribution is 12% of earnings, and an
employer’s contribution is 13.8% of earnings. However, under
clause 2(4), the self-employed get 100% of the new pension.
They therefore pay less, but get the same, which sounds too good to be
true. Experience tells us that, when something sounds too good to be
true, it often is. The self-employed deserve long-term certainty.
Although there is nothing on the precise NICs number in the Bill, we
hope the Secretary of State and the Chancellor will say more about the
long-term plan for funding that measure in the spending review. I note
in passing that the Institute for Fiscal Studies

final point on which we will press the Secretary of State during the
passage of the Bill is probably the most important issue that our
constituents will put to us: will the new flat rate pension offer them
a comfortable retirement after they have worked so hard for so long? We
are concerned that parts of the Bill fail that basic comfort test. Let
us be clear that the hard wind-up of the state second pension will
create a notional loss for many people under the age of 59. For
example, 190,000 people in their 50s could lose between £30 and
£35 a week, compared with what they would have got if S2P stayed
in place. Someone who has been contracted-in for all of their working
life and is aged 55 when the pension is introduced, would in theory
have been able to accrue additional state pension for the remaining
11 years of their working life, amounting to £24 a
week in additional state pension. That will no longer be possible under
the single tier. They will continue to contribute 12% NICs for the rest
of their working life, but there will not be an additional S2P
entitlement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:47:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000025">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:47:01"></hs_TimeCode>
situation is even more grave for those who are just starting work:
those in their 20s who will not retire until after 2060. By the
Department for Work and Pensions’ own calculations, the majority
of them will have lower pensions under the single-tier system, as the
income replacement rate will fall from 38% to just 30%—a big
drop that points us to the gaping hole where reform of the private

Government have been clear, as they rehearsed the arguments in the past
year, that they want personal accounts to pick up some of the slack for
the fall in income replacement rate. There was a degree of consensus on
the auto-enrolment system that the Government are now taking forward.
We are concerned that the measures to link membership of auto-enrolment

the new personal accounts, and that not enough people will be saving

Employment Savings Trust, the national pensions mutual created under
the Pensions Act 2007. We need to allow transfers in from other
schemes, end the upper ceilings on contributions—this is what
employers are telling us—and legislate harder for transparency
on costs and charges, which is why we have called for an investigation
by the Office of Fair Trading into workplace pensions. We want to see a

many lessons from countries such as Australia, particularly on the
establishment of a low-cost default pension fund; trustee directors for
every pension scheme with statutory duties to work in the interests of
savers; and requirements to publish a detailed charging structure and
past performance to ensure transparency. To deliver this kind of
industry for the future, we should be considering a legal requirement
that all pension schemes prioritise the interests of savers over those
of shareholders. We should also be considering obligations on trustees
to assess whether schemes have sufficient scale to deliver low costs,
and if the assessment is that a scheme is too small to deliver this,
trustees should be empowered to investigate merging with other schemes.
Finally, we should consider whether regulators should be empowered to
mandate small schemes to merge, as is done in Australia.</hs_Para>

conclusion, the Opposition have always believed that matters as serious
as those in the Bill should be approached in a spirit of national
consensus, and I say again that I am grateful to the Secretary of State
for how he has approached the debate, but the House must ask whether
the new pensions provision is sustainable, comfortable and genuinely
universal. I am afraid that we believe the answers are no, no and no
again. We agree on some of the principles, but now is not the time for
a failure of nerve; this is half a Bill, half a reform, and as the Bill
goes through the House, I urge him to be more radical, to build on his
inheritance and to give us a long-term scheme that will deliver a
better standard of living for pensioners who have worked so
hard for so
long.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/5DA7A7DF4D2867D3B1AD5ECAF3F93FE9511A1F06" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 June 2013">Monday

clearer what state pension some will get when they reach the happy age

improve the final part of the journey and make it clear what will
happen when someone reaches that happy retirement age and is told they
need to convert their pension pot into a pension income. There remains
a big weakness in the system around how fair a deal someone gets when
they default into the annuity their pension provider offers
them—that was something the Select Committee raised in our
pensions governance report. Action is needed. In my view, we should not
allow a pension provider to provide an annuity to the same customer.
That might be too radical a market restriction for most people, but
there is a real problem if people, having saved for years, see their
retirement income reduced because they do not know that they can shop

accountant, I know how to write lots of caveats, so I e-mail them back
saying “I think it might be this, but I’m not an adviser,
I don’t know your actual circumstances,” and so on. Key
to this reform being successful and retaining support, therefore, is
how we tell people what they are entitled to, what they can do,
what they need to do and when to do it

consultancy fees for auto-enrolled schemes, because if the state is, if
not quite forcing people into a savings system, certainly encouraging
them strongly to do so—through the opt-out—the
auto-enrolled scheme must be a fair and decent one, and that means not
being ripped off by excessive charges. We should be saying,
“This is the most you can charge people. You cannot add
unnecessary and expensive consultancy fees”. Therefore, the
provisions in the Bill are a welcome change, even to a free-market,
non-regulatory person such as me. It is the right

provisions on the transfer of dormant pots are also a step in the right
direction. When starting to think what retirement might bring, one
wants to know how much pension income has been accrued, but that can be
hard. If someone has changed jobs a few times, they will have lots of
small pots, which means they will get those strange, complicated
documents once a year that they do not understand. Even if they read
them, they will not be able to work out what income it will equate to
in retirement. If those pots were moved into a single pot, they would
get only one statement. If we made that information clear, they might
find out that they have accrued only a third of what they want and that
they need to take action several years before
retirement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000045">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:00:20"></hs_TimeCode>
is a welcome step. I asked the Secretary of State earlier whether we
could use this Bill to make changes to the National Employment Savings
Trust so that those who choose to use the scheme or their employers 
<?notus-xml column=666?>who use it can make those transfers. I am not quite
sure what the situation will be for those who think they can transfer
their pot but cannot, even though their employer might have chosen one
of the best schemes out there. We need to get that clear in the system
as soon as we can, so that people understand how that will happen. As
the Bill proceeds in Committee and on Report, I hope those changes to
NEST can be sneaked in, once the consultation ends. I
suspect that some attempts to table amendments to that effect might be
made in Committee, if the Government have not quite got
there—not that I am saying I will draft them or am in
any way qualified to achieve that, which I suspect is well outside my

l<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:00:18"></hs_TimeCode>eading on from
auto-enrolment and NEST is the fact that the regulator responsible for
auto-enrolment is the Pensions Regulator, yet most auto-enrolment is
into contract-based defined contribution schemes, for which the
Pensions Regulator has no responsibility. We are in a slightly strange
situation, as everyone out there thinks, “There’s a
Pensions Regulator,” yet most people’s pension schemes
are probably not caught by it. They have no redress to that regulator
and instead have to go to the Financial Services Authority, or the
Financial Conduct Authority or whatever it is called now—the
organisation that did such a good job with the banks that we entrusted
it with pensions as well.</hs_Para>

am not entirely convinced that that is the right place, partly because
when the FCA gave evidence to us, it did not seem to be giving pension
schemes quite the focus that such an organisation ought to give them,
as I suspect members of the Committee who were present would agree.
There is real confusion out there about who does what in the pensions
regulatory system. There is an attraction to having the role of
supervising individual pension schemes all in one place—that
place being the Pensions Regulator. I accept that the Minister recently
replied to the Committee with some sensible reasons why he comes down
on a different side of that line, but this issue is worth exploring, to
ensure the right protections as more and more people move into
contract-based defined contribution schemes, which is a hugely
important sphere.</hs_Para>

we are on the Minister’s response to the Select Committee, may I
welcome the fact that the start date for the change has made its way
into the Bill? I questioned him quite strongly about that on the
Committee, because this is a fundamental change to the pension that
millions of people can expect, and to have the date slip by some
accident or change of policy after the election would be hugely
disadvantageous. If the date changes by even six months, that is six
months’ worth for people who retired thinking they were getting
£143, but who would then drop back into the old system. That
would be disastrous, and all those women we have taken out would be
dropped back in. I suspect that none of us would fancy that, so having
the start date firmly in primary legislation in this Bill has to be
right. I welcome the fact that the Minister listened, although I also
hope that his power in the Bill to change the date by order is not one
that he plans to use. I would have thought that the power should
lapse—maybe in March 2015—so that it cannot be changed
once we are a year from the start date. It would be awful if less than
a year’s notice was given of a slip by six months or something
like that.</hs_Para>

our taxpayers to provide 
<?notus-xml column=667?>pensions to people who had a short stay here or to
spouses who have never come here and who, by the time they retire, have
had 40 years in a different state and have a pension there. It is not
right to give them a small state pension that we have to administer. It
is right to say, “If you haven’t paid in for this number
of years, then you get nothing.” For that period to be more than
10 years would have been unfair—someone who has paid into a
system for 10 years probably deserves something back out. It is right

Government choose seven years, 10 years or somewhere in
between as the process continues.</hs_Para>

am reluctantly content with the idea of increasing the state pension
age—I suspect that future Governments might be grateful for this
one. However, some kind of mechanism should be put in place to force a
review every Parliament or every five or six years to see what the
decision has to be. Increasing the state pension age by another year
will never be politically popular, as a few hundred thousand people
will then be retiring later than they wanted to. However, it would be
right and fair to have a transparent mechanism—or
transparent-ish: it would only force a review, not be a real
power—so that we said to people, “As life expectancy
increases, we have to accept that you retire later, and we have to try
to keep a sensibly fixed proportion of your life that you can expect to
be in receipt of a pension.” If people can understand that
principle—“This is the proportion of your life for which
you will receive a state pension”—or if it is at least
there for them to try to understand, that will be powerfully clear.
Rather than suddenly saying, “Actually, we’ve got a big
financial problem again; let’s make a change that no one was
expecting,” let us set that within some kind of trend.</hs_Para>

There are some questions about the detail that I am sure we will all
want to understand, such as how precisely the calculations will be
made, how people will know when they have been contracted out and where
people who have been contracted out for part of their working lives
will fall between £108 and £143. That will be difficult
to understand, but it is important that the Government make that clear.
There is clearly a huge role to play outside this place in making
people understand what pension they will receive and what they can do
about it, which will probably be more important than the debates we
have in this place or the agonising over commas and full stops that is
to come. I welcome the Bill and look forward to the chance to

Anne Begg</B> (Aberdeen South) (Lab):</Member> It is important that any
pension reform has support in all parties across the House, because the
last thing we want is for pension reform to keep changing every time a
new Government come in. Up to now, the reforms introduced by the Labour
Government in 1997 and later have not been changed by the present
Government—I will talk about pension credit later. The proposals
we are discussing in this Bill build on a number of those reforms,
particularly auto-enrolment and changes to the occupational or
second-tier part of a pension.</hs_Para>

is right that we should support the principle of this Bill. It is
crucial that people know what pension they can expect from the state; I
am glad that they will be able to expect a state pension in future.
There has been a lot of debate in various media and elsewhere about
whether future Governments will be able to sustain the whole principle
of a single-tier pension or even the first tier of a state pension. I
pay tribute to the Government for nailing the fact that this is what
the future will hold. There will be an element that is not quite
universal, because people will have to pay in, but everybody who has
lived, worked and cared in the UK for more than 10
years—and up to 35 years—can expect a basic pension from
the state, and everybody will know how much it will be.</hs_Para>

is a huge mismatch between what people expect on their retirement and
what they are saving. The Scottish Widows report published the other
week showed that most people want an income of around £25,000 in
retirement, yet less than 20% of the population are saving at a level
that would take them even remotely close to that. Even with the reform
of the state pension and the introduction of auto-enrolment,
people’s income in retirement will still not come close to the
£25,000 that they might expect or aspire to. However, it will
come a bit closer as a result of these reforms, because establishing a
single-tier pension—a flat-rate pension—will make it
easier for those giving advice to people saving for their retirement to
say that it will always pay to save.</hs_Para>

right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne)
provided an example of where savings might not necessarily give someone
a larger income in retirement, but the measures in this Bill will
generally make it easier for those kind of calculations to take place
and will make it easier and more understandable for people to realise
just how much they are going to have to contribute to get an income
that comes close to what they desire.</hs_Para>

One of the Select Committee’s recommendations in our
pre-legislative scrutiny report was that there should be clear blue
water between the level of the single-tier pension and the pension
credit—a bit more than the £1 and something that is there
now. We had hoped that that principle would be built into the Bill and
we are disappointed that the Government did not see their way to doing
that. The principle is important —that the single-tier pension
will always lift someone out of the basic means

credit has come in for some criticism today, but at the time, it was

out of poverty. It means, too, that pensioners are not generally living
in poverty; being old no longer equates to being poor. There are still
people who are old and poor, but not in any different proportion than

Anne Begg:</Member></B> I welcome the reduction in means-testing, but
the hon. Gentleman should be aware that there are two different types
of pension credit. There is the savings credit, which the Bill is
abolishing completely; that means that someone with savings but no
other income might be worse off than someone who has no savings. The
savings credit tended to be more complicated, and people found it
difficult to judge whether or not they qualified for it. The people
eligible for savings credit were generally those who had a little saved
or were a bit above the minimum, but those people tended to believe
that they did not qualify for anything because they had never qualified
for anything before. The take-up among those who qualified for just the
minimum income guarantee part of pension credit, on the other hand, was
well over 90%. I do not want the hon. Gentleman to be confused over the
fact that large numbers of people were not claiming what they were
entitled to in pension credit. Very often, the savings credit might
have qualified people for only about 50p a week, so they thought that
it was not worth going through the bureaucracy. I know this from
conversations I have had with my own

more about the fact that the start date was accelerated, as I recall
laying into the Minister for that when we last debated the issue on the

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:14:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Amber Valley—I call him my hon. Friend because he

age, what age he will be before he receives any kind of state pension.
I know how he might feel. I have said here before that as someone born
in 1955, I have been hit by all the increases. I was of the generation
of women who, under the Pensions Act 1995, would not receive
a state pension until 65. I had accepted that and was planning for
that, but then the Government introduced an acceleration up to 66 for
2020, so I can well understand why some women feel that they never seem
able to reach their state pension age because the Government are
continually moving the goalposts. That thinking may well be behind some
of the anxieties expressed in many of the briefings I have received on
the pension age provisions.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:16:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Amber Valley mentioned that we published a report on the governance
of pension schemes, in which we recommended that the Government should
consider making a single regulator responsible for pensions. He has

confusion about exactly which body is responsible for which parts of

pensions must be well regulated, because we have to rebuild trust in
them so that people know that if they invest in a pension they will get
a good income from it and not be ripped off by a pension company. They
want to know that the charges they pay for their pensions are fair,
that there are no hidden charges and that nothing pertaining to their
pension has not been properly explained to them. It is really important
for people to have that faith in the pensions industry and for the
pensions industry to step up to the plate and ensure that it offers
very good, well regulated products that are not overly
expensive.</hs_Para>

also produced a report about the lifting of restrictions on the

of auto-enrolment and if indeed they are to get rid of what was the
state second-tier pension in SERPS, or S2P, it is crucial that a
state-backed second-tier pension is available, and that default option
should always be NEST. In saying which restrictions should be lifted,
we said only that the transfers in and out and the cap should be
lifted; we did not say that the restriction on NEST always to have a
public service duty should be lifted, as we thought that was absolutely
right. There has to be a default scheme that cannot turn anyone away.
If NEST is to undertake that important work, it is unfair if some of
the restrictions have not been lifted. I hope that, as the Bill goes
through its stages here and in the other place, the Government will
come up with some proposals to change the present restrictions that are
hampering NEST’s ability to do business.</hs_Para>

today’s debate, it has become clear that a good communications
strategy is crucial. There is no doubt that when the single-tier

while those who were born the day after would receive £144. I
think that people still have that impression, and that it is still felt
that the new system will be more generous to everyone. Well, it will be
more generous to some—the self-employed will probably do
slightly better out of it—but those who have assumed that all
their second tier of pension will be covered by the state
earnings-related pension scheme or by the state second pension may be
worse off in the long

end when the single-tier pension is introduced. However, one of the
main issues dealt with by the Select Committee was the issue of
women—for it is usually women who are affected—who
currently depend on the pension contributions of a partner or husband
and whose pensions are therefore based on derived rights, because that
system will end. The Committee recommended that women within 10 years
of pension age should continue to enjoy those rights, because in less
than 10 years they would not have time to build up a contribution
record that would enable them to receive any kind of state pension in
their own right. That, we thought, was very unfair, given that all the
household planning might depend on the assumption that the wife would
receive 60% of the husband’s basic

women’s lives have changed. Younger women may have built up
contributions in their own right, either through caring
responsibilities or through their own 
<?notus-xml column=672?>work, but there is a generation of women who may not
have retired or reached pension age, who have stayed at home throughout
their lives, and who expected at least to receive that 60%, although

accept that, ultimately, that system should probably end, but I think
it unfair to take the 60% away from people who are too close to pension
age to build up contributions in their own right. I also accept what
the Government have said about people who do not live in the United
Kingdom, but some of those affected will be living here, and that group
may include a number of people who have been in work but have not
qualified for national insurance credits, because their income has been
too low to register, or because they have had a number of very small
jobs and have therefore not made NI contributions that would have
covered those
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000078">We
have already discussed the group of women who were born between April
1951 and 1953. Some of their fears have been allayed—I think
they initially believed that they would suffer a major change in their

addressed, partly through the communications strategy. The

cliff edges, as there are bound to be when any change is
made, and there may be some groups whose cliff edges will be worse than
the one facing that group of women, although we have not spotted them
yet. I hope that those who give evidence in Committee will make the
Government aware of any other cliff edges, because the last thing we
want is to discover in April 2016 that there are unexpected problems
affecting certain groups. There will also be a great deal of complexity
in the new system. Nothing will not be simple, particularly the
migration from the old system to the new system and the calculation of
accrued rights. That was never going to be easy, which may be why it
has taken the Government so long to come up with a
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000080">We
know that in the long term the Government will be spending less money.
There obviously cannot be more winners than losers overall, because the
pensions bill will be lower in 30 years’ time—which, I
suspect, is why the Government managed to get the legislation past the
Treasury. I hope that that will make the situation more sustainable,
but I believe that this will be an election issue in years to come. The
level at which the single-tier pension is set will be in the gift of
Governments, and it will be up to them to decide whether to increase it
or
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061718000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000081">However,
overall the Bill is to be welcomed. It is the right step in the right
direction, and it will build on the good work that is already being
undertaken. It is also important that people realise that the subject
of pensions affects not just those of pensionable age, but everyone,
and especially those of working age, because if they do not start
making provision for their pensionable age now, they will find that
they do not have enough money to be able to have the quality of life
they expect in
retirement.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13061718000104" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061718000104">6.30

is not only an obligation, however; it is also financially sensible. It
makes financial sense to have a simple state pension that gives people
not only a fair basic level of income in retirement provided by the
state, but certainty as to what the state will provide in their
retirement. That entails certainty about what they need to do in
respect of their income throughout their working life, which will, of
course, fluctuate, in order to add to the amount and get to the levels
of pension income they would want.

hon. Member for Aberdeen South, made clear? I shall tackle the
controversial issue first: we have not grasped the simple reality that
for some time there have had to be changes to the retirement age. That
has been ducked, which is understandable, as it is never going to be
easy or popular, but it can be ducked no longer. The state pension age
has been 60 for women and 65 for men since the 1940s. There has also
been a strange and institutionalised form of unfairness between the
sexes, and it is right to tackle that, particularly as we have known
for some time that men have a slightly lower average life expectancy
than women.</hs_Para>

reality is that our population is rising most quickly in the oldest age

2035 for women. The Government estimate that even now almost 11 million
people in the current work force face inadequate retirement incomes.

us look at the key groups and the need for reform. The first and most
obvious change, and in many ways the most welcome, is what the reform
will do for women. The single-tier pension will give a better pension
to women, and it will clarify for them—as it clarifies for all
pensioners—what they will receive from the state. The terrible
reality is that under the current complex state pension system, on
average women receive £40 less per week than men. The
single-tier pension is, at its heart, devised to address that
inequality, and also to count fully time spent out of work caring for
children, which applies predominantly to women.</hs_Para>

the different systems and the transitional arrangements to make sure
that what we have is fair, so that people who have contributed in
different ways and have certain reasonable expectations of income will
not be penalised. This will get simple in the end, when we reach the
stage at which every citizen in this country knows precisely what the
state will provide for them in old age, so they know exactly what they
have to do. They need to be signposted to the correct advice as to how
they build up other forms of pension. I warmly welcome the

marks a decisive change in the policies of Governments since the 1950s.
It is a change I hoped the previous Labour Government would make, but
they did 
<?notus-xml column=676?>not. This Government have made it, under the careful stewardship of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:44:14"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb), in
particular. I congratulate him unreservedly on this success. The
objective of having an insurance-based minimum pension that attempts to
take people off means-testing is something that voters have long asked
for but that Governments have long denied them. On that score alone, I
congratulate
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061725000003"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:44:53"></hs_TimeCode>I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>
also congratulate the pensions Minister on this being the one single
move the Government could have made to make an honest man, woman or
person out of the National Employment Savings Trust, as we were in real
danger of having an auto-enrolment scheme that would automatically
enrol people and mis-sell to them the pensions that they would thereby
be buying. On those two scores, the Government are to be
congratulated.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061725000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061725000004"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:45:26"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me now enter some caveats. Clearly, objectives are immensely important
for any Government, as they give us the direction of travel, but they
do not necessarily mean we will reach the desired destination. I wish
to discuss those who will regard this scheme as unfair and the
costs. First, it is clearly unfair to the group of women in respect of
whom the pensions Minister was actively defending his stance: those
born between 1951 and 1953. He said that they will not be worse off
than they would have been, but of course they feel that they will be
worse off than they would have been because the Secretary of State and
the pensions Minister are changing the pensions that males born during
that period will get. I seriously question whether the Government will
be able to maintain their line on that issue.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:49:19"></hs_TimeCode> was a good
debating point in this House, but I do not think we can take an annual
cost—the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary was talking of
that—and equate it with the cost over decades. The annual saving
the Government will get from cancelling the contracted-out rebate
is £5 billion to £6 billion, and that comes in
every year—the cost of doing justice to this group of women is a
very small proportion of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:47:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061725000005">The
second area where injustice has been created is between the employers
and employees of public and private pensions. Why have the Government
allowed employers in the private sector to have the right to adjust the
pension of their employees, given that less money will be going into
those schemes and given that they will get a better state pension, but
not allowed that for the public sector as a whole? If there are real
problems in the health service—leaving aside other public
services—the near £1 billion the NHS would have to pay in
additional pension contributions will play its part. Unless one wants
another period of contracting out of state schemes, what is the
Government’s game plan behind the inequity they are
creating?</hs_Para>

I wish to congratulate the pensions Minister, because I have rarely
seen such pork barrel politics in my 30-odd years here in Parliament.
We know that at the cornerstone of the Liberal vote are the
self-employed, and they will be cheering all the way to the bank
because of what he has delivered them. He dresses it up in this
language about putting aside unfairnesses, but the rest of the
population will not think much of his definition of
“fairness” because this is an unbelievable, God-given
gift to the self-employed. <I>[Interruption.]</I> Conservative Members
are saying, “Hear, hear”, but they have not realised what
the electoral ploy is vis-à-vis 
<?notus-xml column=677?>the Tory vote and Lib Dem candidates. The pensions
Minister is still blindly leading the coalition on this issue, even
when what he is up to has been spelt out, and I congratulate him on
that. I do not believe the settlement he proposes for the
self-employed—as opposed to that for the employed, with their
contributions and their employers’ contributions, which are part
of the wages settlement after all—is sustainable.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:49:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg), and concerns the losers
from the Bill. One might have thought that the Bill offered milk and
honey for everyone and, indeed, when the Secretary of State was
introducing it I could not but think that it was almost like Moses was
leading us into the promised land of milk and honey for everybody.
During that journey, however, quite a few people will drop out. We know
that the Government’s own data show that 22% of contributors
will be worse off and that the average income replacement ratio will be
lower. It all comes back to the key point of the £5 billion
to £6 billion that the Government are taking out of the
scheme and the price that the pensions Minister paid to get this
important reform past the Chancellor.</hs_Para>

give the Government credit for having the nerve to get up and criticise

not lead to better pensions when this Bill proposes to do exactly the

is important to put the changes in context, because the truth is that

welfare state and changes to the state pension system. Every Opposition
speaker so far has welcomed those changes before moving on to criticise
various specific individual points that will, I suspect, be addressed
in Committee. The important point is that, despite the terrible
financial background, these changes have been taken on by the coalition
Government after three years, whereas for 13 years under the

previous Government dealt with the worst circumstances faced by some
pensioners, but only by 
<?notus-xml column=678?>creating the view that the only way to deal with people in retirement
was to ensure that the state could provide through a means-tested
system. The worst thing about the previous Labour Government was that
those individuals in pension schemes within businesses who were saving
up for retirement were punished for trying to do the right thing by
ensuring that they provided for themselves in retirement. Yes, the
previous Administration offered some benefits in dealing with the worst
aspects of poverty for pensioners, but at the expense of the concept of
self-reliance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:53:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

simply include the introduction of things such as pension credit, which
has helped to finance the Bill by a considerable amount. The Labour
Government introduced the state earnings-related pension scheme; a

created the degree of confusion and complexity that has resulted in
people not saving up for their retirement. Yes, there was a state
system imposed on the British public by the previous Administration but
in many ways that was at the expense, I would argue, of the simple
concept of a basic state pension that meant that anything and
everything that a person saved above it would be beneficial to them. It
should be noted that the only people who suffered significantly as a
result of the changes introduced by the previous Administration were
many of the self-employed and many of those in schemes operated by
companies that stopped operating because of the tax charges that

sufficient for most people to have the standard of living that they

the fact that the changes are very beneficial. I had not previously
seen a single press release from the National Union of Teachers that

Minister is introducing these changes for the self-employed because he
believes there are votes in it for Liberals, long may he continue to
bring in changes that will benefit the Liberal vote. In my constituency
of Aberconwy and in many parts of rural Wales, a significant percentage
of the population are self-employed, and a significant percentage of
the population were paying their 9% class 4 contribution and
did not know what they were getting for their money. The class 2
contributions made by the self-employed ensured that they got the
basic level of state pension. Anything that they paid into
class 4 was deemed to be on top. That could amount to a significant sum
and there was no feeling that anybody was getting anything for that
contribution.</hs_Para>

create their own job in order to stay employed in their own community,
and it is unreasonable to argue that because there is no employer
making a contribution on their behalf they should be treated worse than
other employees. If the self-employed are contributing on a par with or
at a similar level to the employed, we should not bring into the

reluctantly by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Somebody

system that is better for the worse off or the less well paid in
society, and which is better for women and carers than the current

the subject of transition, there has been some discussion about the
issue of women born between 6 April 1951 and 5 April 1953. When
I started receiving e-mails on the issue—I have now received a
couple of dozen—it appears on the face of it to be a very unfair
situation. But we need to bear it in mind that this could be an issue
of communication rather than of the change in the legislation. Making a
comparison between a woman born between those two dates and a man born
between those two dates takes out of the equation the fact that they
will be retiring at different times.</hs_Para>

about 85% of the women affected should be able to retire with a level
of pension support equivalent to that enjoyed by a man born during the
same period. There is therefore a message to be conveyed. Does somebody
retire before the age of 65, which is the relevant age for men at that
point, or do they opt to retire a couple of years earlier and accept a
slight reduction in their pension? We need to ensure that the DWP takes
that type of communication into account so that when people see
what they perceive to be an unfairness, they see the issue in context

the state should make sure that it provides the focus for an individual
to make decisions that will allow them to help themselves. That is what
we are doing throughout our welfare changes, and I am glad to say that
it is what the Bill does. Yes, there are some

others, we in Plaid Cymru give a guarded welcome to the proposals for a
single-tier pension. This will benefit key sectors of society who have
been excluded in the past. Pensioner poverty is unfortunately an all
too common feature of the society that I live in as well as across
Wales and the UK. For us in Plaid, the hon. Member for
Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) made a very pertinent point. We share his view of
the potential advantage for people who are
self-<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:08:37"></hs_TimeCode>employed. I
speak as someone who has been employed by one employer and then by
another and who had a couple of pots going. I was then self-employed
for many years before being elected to this place. I have some direct
experience of the complexities and the disappointments that that might
bring in pension
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:09:09"></hs_TimeCode>. In my
own area, small enterprises and companies are overwhelmingly the most
common model, run by self-employed people working either as sole
traders—one-man bands—or in partnerships. This is
therefore an extremely pertinent issue for rural Wales.

at which the new pension will be set and maintained so that it can
fulfil the stated aim of providing people with a level of income that
will keep them out of means-testing. That will be one of the best
features of the Bill.</hs_Para>

respect of the single-tier pension, those with fewer than 35 qualifying
years will receive a pro rata amount, subject to their having a minimum
number of qualifying years. However, in Wales we have an appalling
legacy of de-industrialisation and subsequent long-term
worklessness. Thousands of people have suffered persistent unemployment
since the early 1980s and have severely broken employment records. In
some areas, people in their 50s, particularly men, have little prospect
of any further employment before reaching the age of 65 or 66. We are
concerned that there will be a disproportionate number of such people
who might not qualify. In addition to that being a personal blow to
them, it will sharpen the burden for communities as a whole. It is in
no one’s interest to have whole communities in which old age,
and particularly older old age, are characterised by poverty and by
people just scraping by. Last winter, for example, people were having
to choose between heating and eating.</hs_Para>

Bill will also raise the state pension age. People in general
are living longer, but that is not true of all economic groups. The
Minister might recall our late colleague Malcolm Wicks making this
point in a moving speech that I think marked one of his last
appearances in the House. He said that the better off live longer than
the worse off, and that the worse off work more years because they
start earlier. Even when the state pension age is generalised, poorer
people will still work longer before they can claim their pension, and
they will still die earlier. The disparity will therefore be
perpetuated, and they will continue to receive a pension for a shorter
period of time. It was noted earlier that they could receive a pension
for up to 16 fewer years than their better-off counterparts. That
long-term inequality will still exist.</hs_Para>

has the lowest gross valued added of all the UK nations and regions,
and life expectancy there is lower than in England. These effects will
therefore be even more marked in Wales. I understand that the
Government intend to review changes in life expectancy as frequently as
every five years. I think that the figure of six years was also
suggested. Some would argue that that will simply reinstate the very
uncertainty that the Minister has been so anxious to quell. I am not
sure whether that will be the case, but I would say that a period of
five years is fairly short, in terms of pensions provision. Lord Turner
recommended seven years, but even that seemed shortish. However, if
life expectancy is thus to be reviewed, it is essential that those
undertaking the review have the confidence of all involved, including
those who start work earlier, work longer and have a shorter
post-retirement life. I would therefore press the Minister to give an
undertaking on the independence of any such review panel. That

referred to Malcolm Wicks a moment ago. He suggested that certain
pensioners who had done years of manual work and whose life expectancy
was therefore shorter should receive the pension after 49 years. He
suggested that that particular group should work for 
<?notus-xml column=684?>that set period. The Minister replying to him put forward a number of
counter-arguments, mainly involving practicality. He asked how such
people could be identified, for example, and noted that the pre-1970
records were incomplete and unreliable. However, as the body reviews
successive cohorts who began work after 1970, that will not be the
case. Perhaps we can therefore hope that the review panel will also

November 2012, pension credit was claimed by 2.5 million
people. The Minister intends that the higher level of the single-tier
pension will move many people out of that dependence, but for those who
remain, the value of pensions credit is vital. I am glad that he has
secured the triple lock on the value of the single-tier pension, but I
understand that no such lock can be extended for those pensioners who
do not qualify. This again is particularly important in Wales, given
our lower average GVA and the number of people with broken contribution

shall turn briefly to the funding implications of the proposals.
Contracting-out is to be abolished and the Government are planning to
increase national insurance contributions. It seems reasonable that
those who get more out should pay more in, and I will be
interested to see how that pans out. It was a matter of
particular interest in Wales that, on 11 February this year, the Health
Secretary announced that these revenues would help to meet the cost of
the Government’s proposed changes to the funding of social care
and support. He noted that the reforms would cost the Exchequer
£1 billion a year by the end of the next Parliament,
and that that would be met in part by freezing the inheritance tax
threshold at £325,000 for a further three years from 2015-16. He
also noted, however, that the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary to the
Treasury had agreed that the remaining costs over the course of the
next Parliament would be met from public and private sector employer
national insurance contributions revenue associated with the end of

the inheritance tax threshold for three years from 2015-16, rather than
uprating it in line with inflation, will yield some £20 million

Graham</B> (Gloucester) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to speak
in this debate. The Bill is a major piece of legislation that is ready
to make us more fit to face the challenges facing pensioners in the
21st century. Of course, the complexity of the subject is responsible
for the reduction in the normally large number of Members in the
Chamber—it also baffles most of our constituents. Therefore, the
major goals of this legislation must surely be to make pensions simpler
and clearer, to reduce the amount of means-testing, which is
responsible for much of the complexity, and, above all, to implement 
<?notus-xml column=685?>the pledge that it always pays to save. That mirrors the other important
work of the Department for Work and Pensions: implementing the promise
that it will always pay to work. Those two pledges, I believe, are the
two most important things the Government are trying to achieve. It is a
great shame that the Labour party, which was in power for so long,
contributed to a system in which it certainly did not always pay either
to work or to save. Surely the major goal of this legislation is to put
that dire situation right.</hs_Para>

welcome the entirely new state pension system outlined by the Secretary
of State, which has a single state pension that is much easier to

takes away one area of complexity that is potentially open to abuse. I

than those of four other European Union countries and a great deal
closer to the reality of life expectancy, which is that we all need and

longer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061725000050">That

not yet been mentioned in the debate. As many of us here draw closer to
retirement age, and access to a pension, than to our time at school,
college or university, it is vital that we do not inadvertently preside
over a system that is grossly unfair to our children and to the next
generation. It is also valid to remember Age UK’s response when
the new state pension age was first raised in the House, which was to
focus on the opportunities available to older people as well as the
reassurance needed by those who feared that they would have to work
longer in demanding
occupations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061725000051">Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:22:46"></hs_TimeCode>
aspect of the Bill that I think deserves a brief comment is the new
framework on the age of the state pension, which gives clarity. Some
Members have asked whether that inadvertently raises an expectation
that the retirement age will be increased every five years at the
reviews, but I am sure that that is not the intention of the provision.
Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</hs_Para>

the consolidation of the so-called small pots—the
defined-contribution pots—I think that many people will welcome
the auto-transfer proposed in the legislation. Clearly some of the
bodies representing pension schemes fear that some of their members
might lose out as a result of being transferred into weaker schemes,
but it seems to me that, in general, that provision, which is broadly
welcomed by the National Association of Pension Funds, the Association
of Consulting Actuaries, the Association of British Insurers and the
CBI, will benefit many of our constituents, because at the moment there
are too many pots that are unlooked at and unknown. The provision will
make it easier for our constituents to engage with the whole business

really
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0002.htm#13061725000054">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>

<?notus-xml column=686?>for less than two years will not be able to demand that the employer
refunds their contributions. I think that that will be welcomed,

details of the Bill’s provisions complement the earlier
introduction of the auto-enrolment scheme, which in itself should be
responsible for introducing an additional £11 billion in savings
and between 6 million and 9 million new savers. The object
of the exercise is clearly to widen the pool of those constituents who
are saving and make it easier for them to have savings that they can
later draw on in their retirement. The Bill complements that earlier
work in helping to meet the challenges of a century in which we will
all live significantly longer than our parents, let alone our
grandparents.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/5F61011A50C31F69DB5EE51844FCF5D1C9CD4BFA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 June 2013">Monday

Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field) suggested that those born between
April ’51 and April ’53 appear to be
disadvantaged. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm some
of the figures, because they are complex and, as several Members have
mentioned, need to be communicated. My understanding is that
there are currently 2.8 million women receiving less
than £80 a week in pension—the comparable figure
for men is 474,000—so there are huge numbers of women on low
pensions. My understanding is that 750,000 women who will reach pension
age in the decade after the introduction of the Bill—after
2016—will get an extra £9 a week. Over a lifetime, that
is a significant amount of money. I would be grateful if the Minister

rules. It happened, I think, in 2000, so it was not the last
time that the previous Labour Government raised pensions. The
arrangement applied in every year of the Conservative Government after
the earnings link had been broken. If inflation had provided for a 75p
increase in 1996, doubtless that increase would have been given.

pension schemes about £100 billion. Secondly, although the hon.

me take the hon. Gentleman up on a specific point. He is a reasonable
man, so does he not accept that the breaking of the link with earnings

pensions and earnings caused considerable upset across the country and
was the reason why the Gloucestershire Pensioners Forum was founded
some 30 years ago during that earlier Conservative Government. However,
let us imagine the forum’s disappointment that nothing at all
was done about the matter in 13 years of Labour Governments.
The Gloucestershire Pensioners Forum had to continue into a coalition

move on to other aspects of the Opposition’s response today.
Many of us will recall that the shadow Secretary of State has promised
us a laser-like approach to public expenditure, but it was not clear
today whether he was advocating that the 700,000 women born between
April ’51 and ’53 should be given the
additional £4.5 billion that it would cost to put them on
precisely the same footing as those born later. Perhaps in his

we have heard from Members across the House today is an extraordinary
amount of unanimity and consensus on the fact that, although
means-tested pension credit was well intentioned, it is not the
solution and should be replaced. Many Members, including the
distinguished Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, have welcomed
the approach of a single state pension and the doing away with the
means-tested pension. For many of us, the means-tested pension has
caused sad arguments between neighbours, some of whom have small
amounts of savings. Someone needs only more than £10,000 not to
qualify for the means-tested pension credit; the income generated from
£10,000 is tiny in a low-interest-rate environment. The
consensus has been encouraging, but some things have clearly not been
covered in the Bill today. It is worth touching on those; perhaps the
Minister will address some of them in his summing up.</hs_Para>

to the hon. Lady is that Scotland is spending a lower proportion of its
GDP on social protection than the UK as a whole, and that has been the
case for every one of the past five years. Moreover—I have made
this point several times in the House—Scotland has lower life
expectancy by almost two years, and that is not simply a geographical
disparity; it goes across every social class. To my mind that means
that we have to look at tailored solutions for Scotland and understand
that the scheme will not result in equal benefits for people who are
likely to live two years less than the average in the

people who will be able to do that. In fact, as we move into a new

the face of it, the single-tier pension should, in theory, encourage
people to save for retirement, but I have a few reservations about how
that will work in practice, simply because we have had a succession of
pension reforms in 1998, 2002 and 2006, all of which have shifted the
goalposts for certain cohorts. The reforms have had a cumulative
effect, in that they have eroded some people’s confidence in the
value of saving for retirement. That has been compounded in the past
few years since the financial crash by extremely poor annuity rates and
poor terms for draw-down pensions, while older people trying to derive
an income from their savings have been hit on all sides by historically
low interest rates and the value of their capital being reduced by
quantitative easing. People who thought that they were doing the right
by saving are seeing little reward for their efforts. From speaking to
people of working age, I know that many are looking at their
parents’ experiences and thinking twice about how to save for
the future and, indeed, whether it is worth doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061725000101">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:50:07"></hs_TimeCode>
hope the Government are right that people will be encouraged to save

trust in state pension provision is at a low ebb. That uncertainty will
continue to play out with people who are set to retire many years from

number of people have talked about the single-tier pension extending
the state pension to more women. It is true that most women will be
entitled to the state pension in their own right, but the Bill is far
from a panacea for the historical problem of women facing an
impoverished old age. Even under the new arrangements, women will be
less likely than men to receive the full pension. If the main drawback
of the proposed scheme is that in the long term, the majority of people
will have reduced pensions, the fact that the state pension will
constitute a lower proportion of people’s income, will be lower
as a proportion of average earnings and will be less money in real
terms than pensioners have now means that we risk inscribing existing
inequalities into the single-tier

Government hope that a lower state pension will encourage a greater
reliance on occupational pensions. Although there is protection in the
Bill to allow those who take time out to look after young children or
frail elderly relatives to get credit for the single-tier pension,
there is no equivalent protection for full-time parents 
<?notus-xml column=693?>and carers in private pensions. As the value of the
state pension erodes and people become more reliant on what they have
saved in their occupational pension to maintain a decent standard of
living, disproportionate numbers of women are once again likely to be
poorer because it is predominantly women who punctuate their working
lives with breaks to care for
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:51:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061725000104">Many
women take low-paid jobs so that they can juggle family and work
responsibilities. There is also a persistent gender pay gap, so even
women who have not taken breaks find that their pay, on average, is
lower than that of their male counterparts. That is by no means a new
problem, but much of the income inequality between men and women in
later life can be attributed to more men having private and
occupational pensions. I am far from convinced that the introduction of
NEST and auto-enrolment will make much difference to the gender gap in
private pension provision or do enough to help women secure a

such patterns of work. There is a danger that somebody who works only a

want to ask the Minister about one last point. Under the current
legislation, one way in which full-time stay-at-home parents earn state
pension entitlement is by being in receipt of child benefit for a child
under 12. When child benefit was a universal benefit, that was a good
way of ensuring that mums and dads who took a break from work to care
for children did not lose out. Now that child benefit has been
withdrawn from higher-income families—often it is higher-income
families who have a stay-at-home parent—what mechanism will the
Minister use to ensure that a stay-at-home parent in a high-income
household does not miss out? With single-tier pensions being unique to
the individual and not transferable between spouses, it is more
important than ever that such parents are not disadvantaged and are not
pushed into total dependence on a high-earning

commend the Bill for maintaining the principle of national insurance.
In recent years, much of our welfare bill has become means-tested or
universal, rather than contributions-based, which, as we all know, is
not what Beveridge intended. The Bill will entrench the contributory
principle, not least by recognising the contribution of self-employed
workers and by improving the treatment of women who take time out to
raise
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061725000113">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:56:34"></hs_TimeCode>
the whole, the Bill is very good for women, but I do have concerns that
I hope the Minister will reflect on in Committee. The Chair of the Work
and Pensions Committee raised the concern about women who will be
disadvantaged because they have stayed at home to be homemakers, but
have not had children. That group of people has been identified by Age
Concern. They are people who have never worked, but who had expected to
inherit pension rights on the basis of their husbands’
contributions. It is easy for women of my generation to be sniffy about
women who have never worked, but we need to look at what society was
like. That was a legitimate lifestyle choice. Those people were
homemakers, and we should not diminish that role. Now that we are in
the era of the ready meal, encouraging more homemaking might address
the rise in obesity and diabetes, but I
digress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061725000114">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:58:09"></hs_TimeCode>

People will be affected by this problem if the husband retires under
the current system and the wife under the reformed single-tier pension.
We are changing the deal that such people have anticipated for many

will illustrate the problem with an example. I have been lobbied by a
constituent who is extremely anxious about the changes. Her husband
will retire in three years and she in five. She fully anticipated
inheriting derived rights from her husband’s pension. She has
never worked, has never had children and has struggled with illness all
her life. She will therefore not be covered by the transitional
arrangements for women with lower contributions. The couple have dealt
with the challenges that life has thrown at them with considerable
stoicism and with no help from the state. This is the one period in
their lives when they have expected the state to 
<?notus-xml column=695?>honour the deal. They have planned for their retirement on the one

has been estimated that 30,000 women will be affected. I notice the
Work and Pensions Committee has recommended looking at women who are
within 10 years of retirement and at where the current
inherited rights could be retained. As I understand it, one reason the
Government are not minded to alter the system is that some 70% of women
who would benefit from that provision live overseas. I completely
endorse their position in not wanting to pay pensions to widows living
overseas—particularly those who may never have had any real
relationship with this country—but we could look at protecting
widowed ladies who are expecting a pension if they are resident in this
country. I doubt whether such a provision would be particularly costly

lifestyles have changed over time and women tend to work more than stay

that society does not value women who do not work full time. I consider
that regrettable, and I speak as someone who is as much of a feminist

this is an extraordinary deal for the self-employed, who are paying
half the national insurance contributions of everybody else but still

the Government is that this is a deal for the long term. It is not
clear that this deal will stick; it is generous and sounds good for the
self-employed, but is it there for the long term? We think the

self-employed do not have access to occupational pension schemes. At a
time when self-employment is increasing, the role of the self-employed
is growing, not least because people have different

the early 1950s and who perceive an injustice in the changes proposed

evidenced by the reactions we have seen to any proposed changes.
Perhaps we need a requirement that any changes to pensions should give
as much notice as possible to those affected, so that they can plan for
and address those changes. We can, therefore, appreciate the
apprehension displayed by people up and down the country when further
changes to pensions were announced, including the intention to
introduce a single-tier state pension for future pensioners from April
2017<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:05:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I support

problem with implementing the single-tier pension on 6 April 2017 is
that a group of women born in the early 1950s will not be eligible for
it. Around 700,000 women born between April 1951 and July
1953 will miss out. They will be deprived of many hundreds of pounds a
year on average—money they could well do with in these austere
times. Women born in this period are, quite rightly, angry at what they
see as a dual adverse impact of the increase in their pension age and
their non-eligibility for the single-tier pension. They will be forced
to wait longer to retire, and will miss out on the new £144
pension. Instead, they will receive around £127 a week. Even the

hours. Her benefits, which act as a safety net to allow her to live,
have been cut, and now she will be unfairly affected by the
Government’s pension reforms. Despite having started work at 16
and having paid her share of taxes ever since, she has no idea how she
will plan for her retirement as a direct result of the
Government’s actions. Another lady, Mrs McKay, also of Port
Glasgow, will lose out when the single-tier pension is introduced. She

opinion has always been that the measures are unfair for two reasons.
First, they give no chance for those people to prepare for their
retirement and adjust to changes in the state pension age. As I have
said, as much warning as possible should be given before any
change in pension age. Secondly, the measures disproportionately affect
a group of people—women in their late 50s—who are among
the least well equipped to bear the brunt of the Government’s
failed economic policy. A woman in her mid-50s will have average
pensions earnings of just over £9,000, but, on average, a
56-year-old man has more than
£52,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061725000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061725000142">The
women hit by the changes are the backbone of the UK. They are mums who
took time off work to bring up children, daughters who helped their
parents as they got older, and grans who help their children to have a
work and family life by providing child care for grandchildren.
Frankly, the measure is a disgrace, and the Government should have
regard to that group of women, who have done nothing wrong except to be
born in the early ’50s. I call on the Government to play fairly
and reasonably with those women. I hope that there is a consensus in
Committee and that we can find a way of righting that injustice for
those
women.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/51190110D78CFB37C5C67615D1F1C8901183B64B" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 June 2013">Monday

Reckless</B> (Rochester and Strood) (Con):</Member> Before I come to
the substance of the Bill, I want to make one point in response to the
Opposition on the supposed 
<?notus-xml column=699?>break in the link from earnings to prices. History is mis-remembered.
Labour would like it to be considered that, in 1979, the Conservatives
broke a long-established link that had been part of a golden age, but
that is not the case. The 1974 to 1979 Labour Government changed the
link from prices to wages when wages were not keeping up with prices.
In addition, they had a four-month transitional period between July and
November 1975 when pensions were not linked to anything. Four months
might not sound like much, but in 1975, inflation hit a peak of 27%, so
not linking pensions to anything for a four-month period
significantly hit pensioners, who did much worse under that Government
than they did either for the 18 years of the following Conservative
Government, or for the 13 years of the Labour Government, who did
nothing to change the system they liked to
attack.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000018">I
initially approached the Bill from a position of significant
scepticism. I am not, in all matters of Government policy, naturally a
cheerleader. I was concerned that the Bill was a big redistributive
Government policy, and was worried that it might take away from those
who had paid in most over their working lives. I have been convinced in
part by the knowledge of my hon. Friend the pensions Minister—if
I may call him my hon. Friend—and how he has presented the case,
and in part by the Work and Pensions Committee pre-legislative
scrutiny. In addition, the more I have worked to understand the Bill
and as my understanding has increased, so has my enthusiasm. I would
like to put on record my thanks to Djuna Thurley of the House of
Commons Library, who has answered many of my technical questions,
allowing me to respond to constituents’ cases in a bespoke
manner, which in most instances satisfied the individual concerned. Her
work has helped them and me to understand what is proposed in the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000019">I
wondered whether the Bill would take money away from people who have
paid a lot in. Yes, such people are better off, but they have
contributed a lot through national insurance, and I questioned whether
they will suffer to pay for others and whether there is a big
redistribution from those who have contributed. The answer to those
questions must be no, because existing accruals are
protected—that is the key protection. It is pleasure to follow
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:17:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie), but when he mentioned a lady from
Port Glasgow, he did not make one important point. Her
accruals—whatever she has built up under the existing system,
which I understand might not be that great because of the difficulties
he described—will be the same under the new system and are
protected. It is important to understand that the Bill does not take
away from those who have contributed and give it to
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000020">Another
key reason I am in favour of the legislation is that it seems to
reverse the usual distributive trend and burden of Government tax and
spend initiatives. The losers are always much noisier about their
losses than the gainers are publicly grateful for their gains—I
cannot be certain that there will not be a reversal of that or a degree
of change as the Bill passes. Those who benefit from the existing
system do not much appreciate it and very often are not aware whether
they will gain or get any pension above the basic state pension,
despite contributing under the current state second pension and,
previously, the state earnings-related pension.</hs_Para>

the other side of the equation, it is obvious to those who will gain
that the single-tier pension will be higher than the existing one, and
that, although it will be taxed, they will be able to keep everything
they put aside on top of it, which is a great benefit of the Bill. My
concern, if anything, is that there might have been a degree of
communications failure, because quite a lot of people believe
that, when the transition happens—it will happen in 2016 rather
than 2017—they will suddenly get the great benefit of the
single-tier state pension and do a lot better than they would have done
had they retired a little earlier.</hs_Para>

far—this plays into the usual way of gainers and losers in such
things—I have largely had complaints from people who think that
they will just miss out on the benefits of the single-tier state
pension and that it will benefit those who are a little younger than
them. I have been able to explain that that will not be the
case—there will not be a cliff edge. When I explain that all it
will mean is that the person who is a little younger than them will
have the opportunity gradually to build up entitlement under the new
single-tier pension over time—for instance, gaining £4 or
£5 of accrual per extra year of working—they understand
that and think it is perfectly reasonable.</hs_Para>

caution the Minister about the other side of that coin. I wonder
whether a lot of constituents think that they will receive a big gain

us if, come 2016, they have expected a big gain and it suddenly does
not materialise. It would be helpful if Members of all parties,

have one technical question for the Minister, and I have worked hard to
understand it. The White Paper was clear, as far as White Papers go;
there were a lot of great examples with lovely diagrams so that, by the
time I got to the end, at least I thought that I understood. On the
transition, for people who currently decide to put off retirement and
earn a greater state pension—I am not sure whether every 10
weeks equals 1% or whether the rules have changed, but it is something
like that; my impression is that it is a reasonable deal and a good
thing to take advantage of, particularly for women with higher average
life expectancy—I understand that the opportunity to buy extra
pension will still exist, but that there will be a less generous,
different system. In his concluding remarks, will he wrap up one point
for me? If someone is taking advantage of that system before the
transition and is receiving extra pension and wants to continue doing
so after the transition date, will the old rules or the new rules apply
to that
individual<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:21:51"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000025">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>

would like to turn to his remarks. I was quite taken aback by them.
There was the glass half empty issue, which we have discussed. I think
he agreed that the proposals were better for women, but he raised
concerns—as others have—about women born between 1951 and
1953. That issue is the product of the equalisation of pension age, not
of the Bill. In addition, as I understand it, the women concerned have
lost out most compared with what they may have previously
expected—although the coalition Government have mitigated some
of the worst of that. However, I believe it is still the case that they
will retire earlier than men of the same age, and, on average, they
will have longer life expectancy. They are 
<?notus-xml column=701?>losing out relative to expectation, but there are
those two positives—one by virtue of nature and medicine, the
other by virtue of
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:23:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000026">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>

kind of—I will not use the word scam—initiative by the

to the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, are almost entirely Liberal

Overall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:28:21"></hs_TimeCode>, I
strongly welcome what the provisions will do, because of their
simplicity, for the self-employed. In a sense, a self-employed person
runs their own company, yet still pays national insurance through two
classes as if they were an employee, albeit at a somewhat reduced rate.

Reckless:</Member></B> I was just about to come on to that point. That
is an extraordinary challenge. Public sector workers will have to pay
more, as they will not receive the contracted out national insurance
reduction. I think that is fair, because they will benefit from the
state second pension, and even the NUT realises that they are getting a
good deal. In perhaps eight or nine years, they could build up to the
whole single-tier pension, despite having a number of decades in their
working life when they had benefited from being contracted out. That is
a good deal for many of those employees. It will be a significant
challenge for employers, however, and will imply a significant further
reduction in public spending in these areas early in the next
Parliament. I would be interested to know whether the shadow Secretary
of State has worked out his proposals for dealing with that
if—God forbid!—Labour were in office at the time.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:28:45"></hs_TimeCode>Further changes
might need to be made, but we can use separate legislation for that,
whereas the private sector cannot, so it is right that the Bill

workers will no longer benefit from contracting-out

attraction of the Bill is that it will greatly simplify our pension
arrangements. The Minister has done well to make even the transitional
arrangements, which inevitably add complexity, as simple as possible,
although there remains the job of explaining to our constituents how
they will work. Overall, however, the Bill will provide for a pension
that accrues on a straight-line basis over 35 years of contributions.
People will know what their pension is going to be, and it will be
above the limit at which people got top-ups under what used to be the
minimum income guarantee and pension credit—the system that
Labour introduced and which, however well intentioned, effectively
punished people who saved and so did not benefit from the measures in
place. It dulled, if not destroyed, incentives to save, and that was a
terrible mistake. Now we will have a single-tier pension and people
will know what they are going to get. It will be taxed, but not
withdrawn if people do the right thing and save. That will benefit our
constituents, who will know where they stand, and we will have a better
pensions
system.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/EF3F4BDC1815EC04DAE2D6EA02C612B45F0774AA" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 June 2013">Monday

William Bain</B> (Glasgow North East) (Lab):</Member> Increasing
dignity in retirement, respecting the contributory principle in our
social security system and reducing poverty among the elderly are all
marks of a good society. In our consideration of the Bill tonight, some
of those 
<?notus-xml column=703?>principles, which were also followed by previous Governments, have been
referenced. The previous Labour Government, whom I supported, began the
process of auto-enrolment for work-based pension schemes, which will
eventually encourage 11 million people to save for a secure second
pension. That Government also made substantial progress in halving
rates of relative pensioner poverty, with as many as one in six of my
constituents seeing significant increases in their living standards as
a result of expanding pension
credit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000036"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:31:15"></hs_TimeCode>Nevertheless,
a great and growing number of our constituents who are approaching the
state pension age or are just above it want to continue working. If we
are to see an increase in the UK’s employment rate, providing
work incentives through the tax and benefit system for this group of
people will be essential too. If the current working-age population are
not to experience a triple whammy—facing continued weakness in
the value of real wages for the foreseeable future while taking most of
the burden of fiscal consolidation now and much lower levels of
retirement income than they would aspire to—it is vital that we
reform the state pension and encourage pensions saving through
occupational and other similar
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:32:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000037">As
the Institute for Fiscal Studies established last Friday in its
analysis of the DWP’s data on households below average income,
there has been a large improvement since the 1970s in levels of
relative and absolute pensioner poverty, with the number of pensioners
with incomes in the lowest quintile down from 47% in that decade to
just 21% in 2011-12. Most of that improvement came with the changes
introduced by the previous Labour Government, which made the reduction
of pensioner poverty such a priority. Four decades ago, levels of
pensioner poverty were between six and eight times higher than those
for working-age adults without children, while 40 to 50 years ago,
nearly two in five poor people were pensioners. By 2011-12, the latter
figure had fallen to just one in five before housing costs and one in
eight after housing
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000038"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>Last
week’s IFS research also shows why it is right that the Bill
should build on the work of the previous Government by encouraging
workplace and other second pension saving. Across the income spread for
pensioners, income from second pensions has had a big impact on raising
overall incomes. Over the past three decade, it has risen from 18% to
36% as a share of total net pensioner income for the richest fifth of
pensioners and increased almost sixfold for the poorest pensioners to
15% as a share of total income in 2011-12. That, alongside the increase
in the value of pensioner benefits and relatively lower housing costs
in retirement as a result of a large increase in the proportion of
pensioners owning their homes outright—now as many as three in
four—has driven the major decline in relative pensioner poverty.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:34:09"></hs_TimeCode>There is also a
large group of pensioners over 75, however, who are still the group
most likely to be on the brink of falling into poverty. They must not
be forgotten in this debate either.</hs_Para>

the Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg), who is no longer in her
place, the recent Scottish Widows annual pensions report shows adequate
provision for retirement at an all-time low, with just 45% of people
able to save enough for their retirement and a fifth unable to make any
savings at all for it. That is driven by the unprecedented 
<?notus-xml column=704?>drop in recent years in real wages and therefore disposable incomes.
There is also a gender gap, with women at a bigger disadvantage in
pension saving than men. The average worker in the UK wants to retire
at 66 ideally, on an income of £25,000 a year, which means
savings of £1,000 a month from the age 30—a truly
daunting
prospect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000040"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>In

contributory principle. Making some changes to the state pensionable
age is sensible, given changing demographics and life expectancy, as
well as the changing patterns of people’s working lives, to
which I referred earlier. However, the power in the Bill potentially to
revise the state pension age upwards every five years is problematic.
It has the potential disproportionately to affect poorer communities,
which experience lower life expectancy on average, in constituencies
such as mine, where there are larger numbers of workers in manual
occupations, which are more physically demanding.</hs_Para>

1953, including around 600 in my constituency, who, under these
proposals, will potentially receive a state pension worth £6 a
week less on average than that of a man born on the same day. The
Government have also been unduly silent about the 100,000 people who
will have to work five years extra to be eligible for the full
flat-rate state pension, on the back of 35 years of NICs rather
than 30 years as at
present.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000042">That
is an issue for people working part time in more than one
job—they are mainly women—who might be earning below the

above the living wage. They deserve a guarantee from the Government
that they will not lose out disproportionately as a result of these
changes. The employment rate among women aged between 50 and 64 has
increased by 3.5% in the last few years. I welcome that, but it would
be remarkably unjust if they ended up with weaker pension rights as a

shall come on to say in a moment, further doubt has been cast on the
future of pensions by utterances from the Scottish Government today,
and the answers that people in Scotland are receiving from them are
precious few. With their public face the Scottish Government are
promising people more generous social security, while they are planning
the precise opposite behind closed doors at the Scottish Cabinet table
in Bute House. Despite their panel of advisers last week producing
reasons in favour of a UK-wide social security system 
<?notus-xml column=706?>to share risk even after separation, the Scottish Government said, as
reported in <I>The Herald </I>this morning, that should Scotland no
longer be part of the UK, they could not guarantee to match the
flat-rate state pension at £144 a week and that this
Bill’s provisions would no longer apply in Scotland from 2016.
What further evidence could there be for people in Scotland that if we
want to guarantee the pound in our pocket, our deposits in the bank and
now the security of our accrued pension entitlements, the only way to
be sure of doing so is to vote to remain within the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:43:43"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000050">The
general principles of the Bill are sensible, but it requires a good
deal of further scrutiny to ensure that the losers do not outnumber the
winners and that young people, women on low incomes in part-time
employment and those in low-paid work do not pay a disproportionate
cost for a flat-rate state pension. The Bill could go much further in
extending the principle of auto-enrolment to those who earn enough to
pay national insurance and in capping pension costs levied by
providers. I hope that the Government will be generous enough to
consider those points in Committee and on Report. People want long-term
pension reform that works. There are good ideas from all parts of the

Gilmore:</Member></B> I think the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that all
parties—and I am not sure this had come from his party any more
recently than quite recently—suggested that should be the case.
What then happened was that the state earnings-related pension scheme
was dismantled under a previous Conservative Government. In my view at
least, the worst thing that happened was that people were given the
freedom to opt out of SERPS and go into personal pension provision. In
many respects, that has proved to be a disaster for a lot of people. It
was an illusory freedom. I suspect that a lot of people who took that
path now regret that they were ever given the freedom to do so.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:50:26"></hs_TimeCode>Although SERPS
was a very good scheme, and will have left people in a much better

was one of the changes in pension provision that the then Government
made, but it was not the only one. From 1995, the state scheme stopped
underwriting contracted-out schemes, for example, whereas previously it
had provided preservation and inflation-proofing of the guaranteed
minimum pension. There are lots of ways in which pensions have been
interfered with and changed, therefore. I do not think any Government
have a monopoly in being able to say they have got this right or the
changes they have made have been helpful.</hs_Para>

much maligned—by certain people, certainly—pension credit

expenditure has 
<?notus-xml column=708?>been laid out on that. The debate at the time and
subsequently on pension credit was not for the most part—there
were exceptions—about saying, “Everyone should get a
flat-rate pension credit level.” The big debate was about the
link to earnings being restored. The incoming Labour Government in
1997, faced with very severe pensioner poverty, took the route of
concentrating on those in most need, and they succeeded in quickly
alleviating pensioner poverty. That would not have happened if there
had simply been restoration of the earnings link, as that would have
taken many years to alleviate that level of pensioner poverty, nor
would it have happened even in relation to the introduction of a
flat-rate pension, because the pension credit system applied to all
pensioners whenever they had retired, which a lot of the prospective
reforms, including this one, do not
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:52:39"></hs_TimeCode>. That is why

last Government also introduced the revised additional state pension
through the state second pension, which was particularly beneficial to
low earners, and which did build in credits for people with caring
responsibilities, as, indeed, did SERPS, as it was
based— or would have been, if it had ever gone through
to maturity—on the best 20 years of people’s earnings,
which would have been particularly beneficial not just for those with
caring responsibilities, but for other people with interrupted work
patterns, perhaps through illness or unemployment. That issue has not

proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000063">I
would argue, therefore, that much of what has made this step forward
possible has been done already, and that this would not be financially
viable otherwise. That is not to say that a means-tested top-up is the
best system to go forward with for ever. When I was campaigning for
election prior to 2010, there were complaints and issues about pension
credit, with people feeling that those who had saved or contributed to
a pension scheme were relatively disadvantaged, even if they were not
actually disadvantaged. That and the work capability assessment were
two issues I picked up strongly from constituents, and I came here
determined to argue for change, whoever won the election. I, for one,
would certainly have been seeking to move us towards a system that was
not so dependent on means-testing. We have to accept, however, when we
look at all the impact assessments carried out by the Government, that
there will still be a substantial element of means-testing even with
the changes that are proposed. That will go on for many years and we

has been made to some, but not all, of the issues of detail in the
Bill, which are important and we have to get them right. Constituents
have contacted me about the changes to bereavement benefit. I know they
were flagged up some time ago, in a White Paper and so on, but it is
often only when these things get close that people realise they are
really about to happen. The concern is that 90% of claimants of this
new bereavement benefit would be worse off under the reforms and, in
particular, that parents who have the misfortune to lose their partner
while their children are young will be particularly badly affected. The
feeling is that the current system gives parents an opportunity to be
there for their children, who have already been through the trauma of
losing a parent, and to resettle them without the stress of having to
go back to full-time work quickly or to enter the labour market, where
previously they had not

thing that I had not picked up on—perhaps the Minister will say

relaxation of the conditionality requirements for a year after taking
on the care of their grandchildren, whereas widows or widowers would

are also issues to deal with in relation to the changes being made to
contracting out, some of which have been referred to—I am not
sure this one has, although it has been brought to the attention of the
Select Committee. Some people who were previously in the public sector
but now work in industries no longer in that sector had been told that
there would be protection for their position, and they are concerned
that that will change. Private sector employers have the ability,
through the override provisions that are part of the
Government’s proposals, to make changes, either to contributions
or to benefits, to counteract the impact of having to pay higher
national insurance contributions. This particular group of former
public sector workers are concerned about promises made to them
previously—indeed, until fairly recently—that their
protections under the protected persons regulations would never be
interfered with. They fear that those may now be interfered with
because of this change and they are asking for clarification from the
Government.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:58:46"></hs_TimeCode>other worries
about the change from the contracted-out situation and the national

public sector employers—including the NHS—with these
higher levels of national insurance contributions and the promise the
Government have made that there will be no ability to change the
benefits or contributions. How that will be paid for? What effect will
that have on public spending in general? Are we, perhaps, simply
robbing Peter to pay Paul? Will it have an impact on services in the
future?</hs_Para>

other issue is the speed at which some private sector employers have to
make changes to take all the provisions into account. I am not sure
whether the Government changed the date from 2017 to 2016 simply, as
has been suggested by some speakers, to allow them to understand the
needs of some of the women affected by the changes or whether it was
something that the Treasury wanted. The Select Committee had previously
been assured by the Minister that it would not be possible to make the
changes until 2017 and that it would not be practical to have an
earlier start date, but suddenly an earlier start date has been put in
place. The more cynical take the view that that might have had as much
to do with generating additional income for the Treasury as it had to
do with compassion for the women affected by the changes to their
pension.</hs_Para>

matter is serious because the one thing that nobody wants to see is any
further diminution in the provision of defined benefit pension schemes
in the 
<?notus-xml column=710?>private sector. There are concerns that some employers, rather than
going through the changes that would have to be made even with the
benefit of the override, might simply decide that the time has come to
close their defined benefit schemes entirely. That would mean that even
fewer people would benefit from such provision and we must be clear
that that should not happen.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T21:01:40"></hs_TimeCode> industry is
looking for some reassurance—including through early sight of

debates by the late Malcolm Wicks, who paid considerable attention to
the problems of people who had had to leave work early and who were not
always able to build up their pension contributions. The Joseph
Rowntree Foundation has pointed out in some of its most recent work on
poverty among different groups that one group in which poverty remains
unchanged is those aged between 55 and 64. Pensioner poverty among the
over-65s is down from 25% 10 years ago to 15%, but in the 55 to 64 age
group the figure has stayed static at 20%. The report from the

number either have poor health or are caring for somebody with poor
health or a disability. Those people are already out of the labour
market, are not contributing towards pensions and might not have the
opportunity to contribute. We must consider their problems, especially
as the pension age is going up. The assumption that everybody will be
fit and able to work, not just to 65 but to 66, 67 and potentially
beyond that, is belied by reality. A substantial group of people are
already unable to remain in the work force up to that point. Provision
must be made for them and thought must be given to them. They should
not be left in a limbo land, as they often are at present.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb), who is not in his place at
present, viewed the measure as a companion to welfare reform and
suggested that it would ensure that people benefited from savings made
through their lifetime contributions to pensions in the same way as
universal credit would make work pay, but the irony is that at the same
time as saying how good it is that means-testing will be reduced for
older people, the Government have been pursuing a path that increases
means-testing for those of working age. The taper in universal credit
is set much higher than the current taper for tax credits, which means
that people lose benefit much more quickly. One of the groups who will
not benefit at all from universal credit are those who work full time
but not necessarily on high incomes and who, because of the taper
change, will lose benefit much more
quickly<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000073">Working
households with some capital will be subject to a test. This is again a
change from tax credits. People who have relatively low incomes but
have some savings will not be eligible for benefits. That is
means-testing. The restriction of employment support allowance to one
year for those in the work-related activity group 
<?notus-xml column=711?>also exposes a group of people to means-testing who were not previously
exposed to it. Somebody in that situation who loses their contributory
ESA after a year, who has savings, who has a working partner or who has
an early retirement pension is subjected to means-testing in a way that
did not happen previously. So we need to look at the different ways in
which people are treated, and we should not take comfort by saying,
“We’re dealing with means-testing here”, when in
fact means-testing has been expanded for other
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T21:06:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000074">Some
of those people are the same people that I have already described as

State seems to think this is extremely amusing—who are likely to
find themselves hit by the loss of contributory benefit and the means
test that is applied. Those are the sort of households who may
find that they have to use up their savings in order to get to
retirement age, and they will require a means-tested pension in
due course. <I>[Interruption.]</I> It is relevant because these are the

people in their 30s and 40s now are sitting at home and thinking,
“If I don’t save, I’ll get pension credit so
I’ll be fine. That’s why I’m not going to
save.” There are many other factors involved in pension saving
or the lack of it. One of those is a lack of trust in the financial

enough—ensure that if people are saving into private pensions,
they are well protected and get a good result at the end. That means
the Government looking at aspects such as pension charging and
considering putting a cap on pension charging. There is still an
opportunity to amend the Bill to include that. The Government have
indicated recently that they are coming round to looking further at the
issue. We must ensure that people are not paying into schemes where too
much of what they contribute is taken out by way of fees and charges,

speaking, pension provision in this country can be divided into thirds:
one third of people are in public sector pensions, one third are in the
private sector, and a third have no pension provision at all. For that
middle third who are in the private sector, it is almost certain that
their pension pot will not be large
enough.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000082"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T21:12:32"></hs_TimeCode>We

example—at the age of 65, would have a pot of £400,000.

reason that people are not saving is that there is massive distrust of
the industry. I have many colleagues in the private sector who would
almost cut their arms off than invest in the pensions market. They
would do anything to avoid doing that. They would buy houses to rent,
for example. Perhaps that is a rational response to a market
that has failed. I am a free marketeer. I sit on this side of the
Chamber and I believe in markets. If they work, they get rid of
supernormal profits and unfair advantages, and all that goes with that.
However, they will not do that when there is an asymmetry of
information in the market, and when that market has failed. I would
contend that the market for private sector pensions falls into that
category.</hs_Para>

way to make a market work better is to make it transparent. I have

business as the shadow Secretary of State—in my opinion is doing
what we sometimes did: playing it long. It knows that it is making
unacceptable profits and that that will have to change, because
eventually this place will get around to fixing it. In such a
situation, it plays it long. It is beginning to regularise charges and
talk about annual management charges, but of course that is different
from total expense ratios. There are entrance fees, exit fees, churn
fees and trailing commissions. I have a double maths A-level, an
engineering degree and I am a chartered accountant, and I can just
about understand this stuff. The idea that most people who are having
to buy pensions could be educated to such a degree that they could make
the market work is ridiculous. The market knows that and the result is
a median pension pot of £10,000. It is a crisis, even with the

would like there to be more enforced simplicity. We should look at what
the Department of Energy and Climate Change has done with electricity
and gas charges. It has insisted that bands should be brought in so
that there is comparability and consumers can say, “I’ll
go with them” rather than being swamped in a myriad of
complexity. Pensions are massively more material to the well-being of
most people than utility bills, yet they are massively more complex.
Perhaps we could consider standard charges and standard comparisons of
the annuity market, so that when people choose an annuity they are much
more able to make a reasoned decision. The Cooper reforms in Australia
are an example of that, and I would like us to move down that
route.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000098">I

I think there is a case for saying that the base supplier should not be
allowed to provide an annuity. If we really want to force the market to
work, we should do something such as that. If we are going to leave the
matter with the base supplier or the organisation that the person has
saved with, we could ensure that they register so that we know that

significant reform to reduce pensioner poverty and Opposition Members

more than 1 million women the ability to build retirement savings via

will give the Minister a case study. Catherine Kirby is nearly 61 and
was born on 1 October 1952. She has worked for 41 years that qualify
for national insurance contributions. At today’s rate, her basic
state pension is £110 per week. She receives £20 in SERPS
and S2P, so the total amount that she gets each week is £130.
That is £15 less than the single-tier amount will be. Catherine
had to leave school at 16 because her parents could not support her any
longer. She had caring responsibilities and in later years, due to
health constraints, had to reduce her hours of work and her already low
income. She is unable to afford a private or other pension arrangement
and is unable to defer taking her state pension as she has no other
income. She has chronic, deteriorating health conditions. Every pound

retirement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0003.htm#13061744000116">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T21:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>

that a man of the same age will receive. We accept that there are many

issue is the rise in the national insurance contributions required to

both low and higher earnings, the abolition of the second state pension
means losses. More generally, Government Members might consider that
one way of looking at the new pension scheme is that it puts a cap on
state pension savings because no one can get more than £144 a

made the point repeatedly, but simply reducing state pension
provision—that is what the Bill does in the long term—and
hoping that will act as an incentive for people to save into private
pensions is not enough. The Opposition have set a direction of travel,
which the Government have finally begun to follow, to ensure that
saving pays into private pensions. We set out the way to ensure value
for money for every saver in the UK occupational system, and we called
for the Office of Fair Trading investigation into costs and charges
that is now taking place. We called for the Government to deal with
consultancy charges and auto-enrolment practices, and we welcome moves
in the Bill to give the Secretary of State the power to do that. He

responsibility for pensions at the time or which of my 10 predecessors

overflowing. This Government have grasped the nettle and provided for
the self-employed to be full members of the state pension system. I
have never heard a Government measure described as too good to be true,
as that measure was described today, but I can assure the House that
the deal is that the self-employed are full members. Low-earnings
self-employed people pay more national insurance than their low-waged

will address a number of the substantive issues raised in the debate in
turn, the first of which is the move from 30 to 35 years. To be clear,
30 years currently gets people a basic state pension of £110 a
week, and 35 years gets people a full single-tier pension of
£144 a week. We are therefore not comparing like with like. As
my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said, the Government
are merging a basic pension for which people work for 30 years with a
second pension, for which people might work for 50 years. Thirty-five
for the merged pension is therefore hardly ungenerous. If people who
have already retired on the expectation of 30 years would have got more
under the old rules than they will get under the new rules, they will
get what they would have got under the old rules, so nobody in that
situation will get less than they were

brings me on to women born between 1951 and 1953. To be clear, they
will receive their state pension on the day they would have got it if
Labour had continued 
<?notus-xml column=721?>in office. We have not changed their state pension
age. They will receive the pension they would have got had Labour
continued in office. We have changed, with one exception, neither their
pension age nor their pension amount. To hear Opposition Members talk
about this group of women, one would think we have ripped them off,

Gentleman probably knows. I was interested in what he had to say about
pension spending, because apparently pensions will be included in the
cap on welfare. As I understand it, if a Labour Government had a bad
year on housing benefit, they would take some money off pensions. How
would they do that? We were told this week that they would not
undermine the triple lock, so what is left? They are in favour of
raising the state pension age. As I understand it, if they have a bad
year on housing benefit they will jack up the state pension age in the

hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price) asked about
another group and the whole issue of derived rights. The single-tier
pension is designed for the future, whereas the current state pension
system is rooted in the 1940s when men had jobs and women had husbands.
We cannot go on like that. We have introduced a lot of transitional
protection. For example, there was an option for women to pay something
quaintly called the married woman’s stamp. If they did that at
any point in the 35 years up to their pension age, we would protect
them and pay them the pension they would have got. There is extensive
transitional protection.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend raised the question of what she described as homemakers.
People who are not in the paid labour force can still receive
protection for their pension rights in a number of circumstances. If
they are at home with children, caring for an elderly or disabled
relative, or are unemployed and looking for a job, they receive
credits. If they are too sick to work, they receive national insurance
benefits credits. So a whole raft of circumstances are
covered.</hs_Para>

contributory principle was—I agree with
that—and she was right that in many ways the Bill
reasserts that principle. To reassert it, however, and then say that
someone who has paid no national insurance, not been a carer, not been
looking for work and not been too sick to work should none the less get
a significant pension creates a tension. I can reveal to the House that
she and I discussed this issue in the Tea Room before we got here, and
she said, “But aren’t you changing the rules late in the

would say to my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock,
then<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T21:54:25"></hs_TimeCode>, that there
is extensive protection. If the lady in question were widowed, for

thank us—financially at least, although perhaps for other
reasons as well. Getting on for 95% of them would say, “Why did
you do this to me? Yes, I might get another six quid a week, but
I’ll have to wait two or three years longer for it.” That

age want to have their pension as early as possible, and again the last
thing these women want is to get their pension when men do, because if

their pension straight away, not later. The comparison with men born on

praise from those on the Opposition Front Bench, which I hope will
trouble him. He asked whether there is any analysis that underlies our
decision; I can assure him that there is. He asked why we do not shunt
all those with small pots to NEST—that was the proposition. We
are talking about a pot limit of £10,000, so if all the small
pots in a single year went to NEST, it would be become enormous and
unbalance the market. Unless we wanted NEST to become huge, we would
have to have a low pot size limit to make it work, with NEST becoming
the home of small lost pots. However, if we did that, we would end up
with significant fragmentation. In other words, with a low pot size
limit, people might have something in NEST, a few thousand pounds they
can nothing with in another provider, their current
pension—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> What I can suggest

important points. She said that the single tier was not a windfall or a
great leap forward. When she quizzed me in the Work and Pensions
Committee, she said—and I quote—that it is not exactly
“fandabbydosey”. She is right: it is not fandabbydosey;
it is a simplification. It is about spending the money that we were
going to spend, but better. She also said that SERPS was great and
asked whether it would not have been better to continue with it.
However, the fundamental problem is an unfunded pension promise. We
already have a very large unfunded basic state pension, which will
represent a rising share of national income even with these reforms. If
we had added a massive unfunded SERPS to that, those promises would not
have been kept. It is nice to think they would have been, but they
would not. Future generations of working 
<?notus-xml column=725?>taxpayers would have had to pay so much tax to meet all those unfunded

giving people time to plan—are doing the right thing for the
long term.</hs_Para>

the private pension side of things, automatic enrolment has started
incredibly well. For example, McDonald’s—just one
employer—has found that the opt-out rate among some of its
low-paid employees is as low as 3%. From memory, that means that
10,000 lowly paid employees at McDonald’s are now in
pensions, with fewer than three in 100 opting out. That is a real
achievement. One of the reasons for that is the communications work we
have done—the “I’m in” adverts
that we see on the tube, on television and so on.</hs_Para>

was a key issue. We absolutely have to communicate this change
effectively. We are doing fieldwork over the summer on how best to
communicate it and to whom. We are working with partners such as Age
UK, the Money Advice Service and the Pensions Advisory Service. The one
constraint we have is that we cannot presume exactly what the scheme
will look like, because the House will consider it. We cannot write to
people now telling them what will happen, because it might not
happen—it might be changed by the House. That is a frustration
for us, but as soon as this is determined and settled, we will be out
there.</hs_Para>

Griffith</B> (Llanelli) (Lab):</Member> I should like to thank you, Mr
Speaker, for allowing me this debate to bring to the House’s
attention the issue of lethal autonomous robotics, or LARs, which are
sometimes referred to as “killer robots”. I have the
privilege of being the vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group
on weapons and the protection of civilians, and I wish to raise the
issue of what plans the Government have to engage in international
talks to try to limit, through means such as international regulation,
the development and proliferation of such weapons. I believe that the
UK has a key role to play in international talks and that without
concerted international agreement and pressure it is unrealistic to
anticipate that many individual states will pause in their drive for
ever-increasing technological
advantage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000187">This
debate is timely because just over a fortnight ago, on 29 May, Christof
Heyns, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
executions, presented a report on lethal autonomous robotics to the UN
Human Rights Council in Geneva. The following day, 24 states took part
in discussions on the report, and with the exception of the UK, they
all agreed on the need for further debate. Germany and the United
States were among those who expressed a particular willingness for
further international discussions. Brazil and France urged the need for
an arms control forum, and suggested using the convention on certain
conventional weapons. That is a framework convention with protocols
on specific issues. It is the mechanism that was used to
make an international legal agreement to ban the use of blinding lasers
before they were ever
deployed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000188">Before
returning to the need for international dialogue, I want briefly to
explain what we mean by lethal autonomous robotics and why we need to
take action now. I also want to highlight some of the concerns raised
in the UN special rapporteur’s report. The term LARs refers

further intervention by a human operator”.</hs_brev>

the robot has the power to “choose” a target
independently and to “decide” to use lethal force against
that target. That element of full autonomy means that LARs represent
more than just a game-changing development in weapons technology. They
represent a revolution.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061744000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000190">LARs have
sometimes been grouped with modern unstaffed weapons systems, such as
remotely piloted aircraft systems, sometimes called unmanned aerial
vehicles but most are more commonly known as drones. However, they go a
considerable step further than drones. LARs are fully autonomous
weapons systems which, once activated, can select and use lethal force
against targets without further human intervention. The key departure
from existing military technology—the factor that differentiates
LARs from unmanned weapons systems such as drones—is the absence
of human intervention once a fully autonomous weapons system has been
activated. A robot would be able to make the decision to kill a human
being, which has never been the case 
<?notus-xml column=730?>before. For that reason, LARs would constitute not an upgrade of the
weapons that are currently in our arsenals, but a fundamental change in
the nature of war. LARs explode our legal and moral codes which assume
that the decision-making power of life and death will be the
responsibility of a human being, never a
machine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000191">It
is the natural horror of a scenario in which a robot could decide to
kill a human that has led to the description of LARs as “killer
robots”. They are also sometimes described as “fully
autonomous weapons”. Whatever the label, no lethal, fully
autonomous weapons system has yet been deployed, but we need urgent
action now, before further technological development and investment
make a race toward killer robots impossible to stop. Make no mistake:
technological know-how is widespread, and it is estimated that more
than 70 countries have military robotics programmes. The United Kingdom
is a leader in the field of sophisticated high-tech military
industries, and is therefore at the forefront of development of the
types of technology that could be used in
LARs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000192">Inevitably,
much of the development of LARs worldwide is shrouded in secrecy,
including development in the UK. What we do know is that weapons
technology is developing at an ever-increasing pace, and it is
therefore very difficult to determine how close we are to the
production of LARs that are ready to be used. Weapons systems with
various degrees of autonomy and lethality are already being developed.
One is the UK’s Taranis system, a jet-propelled combat drone
prototype that can search for, identify and locate enemies
autonomously, and can defend itself against enemy aircraft without
human intervention. It is clear that LARs are not a fantasy of science
fiction, or a technology belonging to the distant future; they are a
real possibility for our
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000193">The

was published on 9 April, raised a plethora of concerns about LARs.

the gravest danger posed by these weapons is their perpetuation of the
philosophy that might is right? Is it not the case that, while the use
of sophisticated technology in certain countries against other,
unsophisticated countries may secure victories in the short term, huge
resentments will be built up because of that difference in technology,
and will leave a legacy of continuing
conflict?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000195"><B><Member ContinuationText="Nia Griffith" PimsId="4784" UID="13061744000331" xid="862" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000331">Nia

increase the distance, physical and emotional, between weapons users
and the lethal force that they inflict. Drones already offer the states
which deploy them the military advantage of being able to carry out
operations without endangering their own military personnel, and thus
distance the operators from the action. LARs would take that a crucial
step further by lessening the weight of responsibility felt by humans
when they make the decision to kill. They could lead to a vacuum of
moral responsibility for such decisions.</hs_Para>

give rise to legal issues. Given that they would be activated by a
human being but no human being would make the specific decision to
deploy lethal force, it is fundamentally unclear who would bear legal
responsibility for the actions performed by them. If the legal issues
are not tackled, an accountability vacuum could be created, granting
impunity for all LARs users. Furthermore, robots may never be able to
meet the requirements of international humanitarian law, as its rules
of distinction and proportionality require the distinctively human
ability to understand context and to make subjective estimates of
value. The open-endedness of the rule of proportionality in particular,
combined with complex circumstances on a battlefield, could result in
undesired and unexpected behaviour by LARs. It is clear that existing
law was not written to deal with
LARs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T22:09:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000198">Thirdly
comes a multitude of terrifying practical concerns. The lowered human
cost of war to states with LARs, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T22:10:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn) pointed out, could lead to the
“normalisation” of armed conflict. A state with LARs
could choose to pit deadly robots against human soldiers on foot,
presenting the ultimate asymmetrical situation. States could be faced
with the temptation of using LARs outside of armed conflict, finding
themselves able to eliminate perceived “troublemakers”
anywhere in the world at the touch of a button. LARs could be hacked or
appropriated, possibly for use against the state, and they could
malfunction, with deadly
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T22:10:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000199">This
report corroborates the revolutionary difference between LARs and any

Griffith:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a very valid point, which
shows why the negotiations are so crucial. We need to define exactly
what is meant by LARs and examine that international law to see what we
can do to regulate all the appropriate weapons. If we are to make
progress on banning LARs, nations need to be clear about exactly what
we mean.</hs_Para>

to look at what mechanisms could be used. One suggestion would be to
use the convention on certain conventional weapons, the mechanism used
to make an international legal agreement on a pre-emptive ban on
blinding lasers. Another option would be to use the process that led to
107 states adopting the convention on cluster munitions, five years ago
last month. That treaty was groundbreaking for three main reasons:
first, it banned an entire category of weapons; secondly, it brought a
ban into existence before the use of cluster munitions had become
widespread; and, thirdly, the treaty process was multilateral, shaped
through the initiative and sustained leadership of the Norwegian
Government, with a strong partnership between states and organisations
working together towards a clear common
goal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061744000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/debtext/130617-0004.htm#13061744000213">The
UK needs to be at the forefront of the debate on LARs. Now is the time
for further international discussion. Now is the time to encourage a
wide range of states to adopt a moratorium on the development and
deployment of LARs until a new international legal framework has been
developed that takes account of the potential of LARs and lays the
basis for discussion on their future regulation or prohibition. I very
much hope that we will see the UK taking a lead on this
matter.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/269B6631031720195EE16C9D3DCCC8D521390540" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 June 2013">Monday

thank the hon. Lady for her summary of the report presented by Christof
Heyns, the special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary
executions, which was discussed in Geneva on 30 May. Let me summarise
the report. Mr Heyns highlighted that the “possible” use
of lethal autonomous robotics raises far-reaching concerns about the
protection of life during war and peace. In his findings, he
recommended that states establish national moratoriums on aspects of
lethal autonomous robotics and called for the establishment of a
high-level panel to produce a policy for the international community on
the

hon. Lady asked whether the Government were willing to accept the four
recommendations made in the report. I believe the point she
particularly wanted to discuss was the question of why, as she said,
the UK was the only state that did not support a moratorium. Let me
make things a little more clear, if I may. The UK has unilaterally
decided to put in place a restrictive 
<?notus-xml column=735?>policy whereby we have no plans at present to
develop lethal autonomous robotics, but we do not intend to formalise
that in a national moratorium. We believe that any system, regardless
of its level of autonomy, should only ever be developed or used in
accordance with international humanitarian law. We think the Geneva

prevent anyone from developing the weapon in such a manner as the hon.

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T21:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>has suggested.
It would not fit export criteria, so I do not think that we are at odds
on that. The issue is whether the legal framework is sufficiently
robust to prevent that. The United Kingdom, having made its own
decision that it is not developing these weapons, believes that the
basis of the legal system on weaponry is such as to prevent that
development.</hs_Para>

Burt:</Member></B> My understanding, having discussed this with
officials, is that it is the setting of the parameters that is the
human element. For example, once the parameters were set of some
existing weapons system that would seek to identify and defend itself
against missiles coming at one of our ships in a situation of conflict,
plainly an operator would not be needed to press the button each second
to fire off the missiles—the system will do that automatically.
That is an automatic system where the parameters have been set. What is
envisaged through lethal autonomous robotics is a step beyond that,
which no one has reached. To use the definition that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

be weapons systems which, once activated, could select and engage

universal support for a moratorium, given the number of states that did

to use national safety authorities where rolling stock would only be

Council considered the proposal for a regulation on the technical
roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles and a
proposal for a directive on the registration documents of vehicles (the
last two parts of the roadworthiness package—the Council had
agreed its position on the proposal to change the periodic testing
regime in December 2012). The Council agreed its position on the
registration documents without discussion, while the roadside
inspection proposal prompted a round table discussion. The most
contentious issue was whether to exclude the N1 category of vehicles
(vans and smaller lorries not exceeding 3.5 tonnes)  from the
scope of the proposal. I was able to support the presidency’s
text, and in particular the exclusion of N1 vehicles.</hs_Para>

Government are committed to championing the public library service.
Libraries can and do contribute to a range of local and national
government priorities including assisting people to access a range of
educational materials, to find employment and work with parents,
schools and colleges to support education and learning agendas. All
these connections can have positive benefits for
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1306174000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/petntext/130617p0001.htm#1306174000015">The
Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 requires all library authorities
to provide a comprehensive and efficient library service based on local
need within available resources. The assessment, funding and provision
of library 
<?notus-xml column=6?>services, including issues such as opening hours, are therefore for
local authorities to determine. Decisions about Burnage library are a
matter for Manchester City Council, and the Department notes that the
Council Executive has recently agreed that the six local libraries
including Burnage originally identified for closure should not now
close on 29 June. This is to allow flexibility for work to be
undertaken with community groups to develop a local solution for each
of the areas affected and the Council anticipate that the community
plans for each library should be in place by the end of June if not
sooner.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1306174000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/petntext/130617p0001.htm#1306174000016">The
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has a duty under the
Act to superintend the delivery of library services by local
authorities. A number of local authorities have announced plans to
reconfigure their library services, and we monitor progress on plans,
including those of Manchester City Council. Where the Government
considers that a local authority is no longer providing a comprehensive

Government continue to support libraries and have transferred the
responsibilities for the development and improvement of public
libraries to Arts Council England (ACE). Two significant publications
produced by ACE this year include, “Envisioning the library of
the future” and “Community libraries—Learning from
experience: guiding principles for local authorities”. The
former of these two was published on 23 May and was a major research
project undertaken over the past year to help library staff, funders
and users to better understand what libraries could and should look
like in the future. The latter publication was issued on 22
January and will assist local authorities who are considering reviewing
the delivery of their library services to work with their
communities.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="443"><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/48DB548ECE2CDFF9CB0CC8F8622A16C56558C80B" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 June 2013">Monday

and the Charity Commission for England and Wales have a close working
relationship. HMRC uses a statutory gateway to share intelligence and

there is a mutual interest, HMRC and the Charity Commission
investigations staff run joint operations, which have proved to be very

records of the charities it has identified as being used for tax
avoidance purposes. This is because tax avoidance takes a number of
forms and HMRC's compliance work therefore spans across multiple
sections of the Department. Further, the use of a charity for tax
avoidance purposes does not necessarily indicate that the charity is
complicit or even aware of its involvement in tax avoidance.</hs_Para>

of the animals. At the BIP the consignment will be subject to a

meet animal health requirements; have been transported in suitable

main means through which representations are received and discussed is
the National Asylum Stakeholder Forum, which includes a wide range of

Green</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 3 June 2013]:</I> Police officers
need to be able to use physical restraint from time to time in order to
carry out their duties All police officers are trained to ensure that
they do this within the framework of their powers, as set out in the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Mental Health Act 1983 and
other statutory and common law powers. Such powers should be used in a
way that best protects the safety of the person being restrained, the
officer and members of the
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061735000515" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/text/130617w0002.htm#13061735000515">Training
and guidance on the use of restraint is an operational matter for the
College of Policing. Guidance issued in 2010 requires that officers
using restraint must reasonably believe that it is necessary to prevent
harm to the person who lacks capacity, and that they ensure that the
degree, type and period of restraint is proportionate to the likelihood
and seriousness of harm. The Department of Health has funded pilot
schemes that will see mental health nursing staff accompanying officers
to incidents likely to lead to detention under section 136 of the
Mental Health Act, with the aim of delivering better outcomes for
vulnerable people in such circumstances and a reduction in the use of
the section 136 detention power.</hs_Para>

Governments rely on a wide range of legal services, whether those
services are provided for litigation or advice; whether provided in

practice. It would not be possible to carry out the suggested
estimation without an examination of the cost of each provision of a
legal service. Nor is it the case that the litigation and advice for
which legal aid is made available is analogous to the work of
Government, which is vastly more varied and complex than that for
individuals and corporates. No realistic comparison can be made. Much
of the legal advice which Government obtains in the course of its

Featherstone:</Member></B> The UK Government's assessment is that St
Helena has adequate water resources to meet its sustainable development
needs including future demand from an increased population.
Distribution of water, however, is a greater problem than shortage of
water. The mountainous terrain means that there are 11 disparate water
systems making it difficult to pump water from 
<?notus-xml column=483?>one system, and from one area of the island to another. The current
localised drought, where the northwest reservoirs are seriously
affected while the rest of the island has enough water, underscores
difficulties in
distribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061739000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/text/130617w0002.htm#13061739000024">All

that distinguish pre-1967 Israel and the areas occupied since 1967 when

not need to provide disaggregated statistics for this. The impact was
sufficiently larger for social issues, migration and employment, and it
was agreed that in these areas, Israel should be asked to continue
providing disaggregated statistics for any study carried out in these

Murrison:</Member></B> Our relationship with Japan—the third
largest economy in the world—is crucial to our prosperity.
However, it is also increasingly important to our security; as a
like-minded ally Japan shares many of our interests, values and goals.
Our security and defence engagement relationship has become stronger
and closer in recent years and continues to improve. In Tokyo in April
2012, the Prime Ministers of Japan and the UK issued a joint statement
pledging the UK and Japan to work more closely together on defence and
security issues, including peace support operations, counter piracy,
cyber and collaboration on defence equipment. We have been working on
an information sharing agreement that will permit the sharing of
classified material and on an agreement that will establish the legal
basis for the UK and Japan to collaborate on joint research, production
and development of defence
equipment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061746000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130617/text/130617w0002.htm#13061746000104">The
Strategic Defence and Security Review made it clear that the USA
remains Britain’s most important bilateral ally. Ministry of
Defence personnel engage on a daily basis with their US colleagues on
defence issues 
<?notus-xml column=498?>that affect our national interests, and take action to ensure that we
remain the US’ partner of choice on defence and security
matters. The relationship continues to evolve and remains central to
the development of important UK capabilities (e.g. Joint Strike
Fighter, Carrier Strike, Successor Deterrent) and securing the
interoperability and expertise necessary to ensure our armed forces are
able to work with their US counterparts bilaterally, in NATO or

seeking to encourage hew routes and improving airport surface access

distance sector, which includes the West Coast Main Line, has
deteriorated and is worse than its end-of-year target for 2012-13.
There is now a real likelihood that Network Rail will not achieve the
England and Wales targets for PPM or cancellations and significant
lateness that it was funded to deliver at the end of control period 4
(CP4). The Office of Rail Regulation has specified a sliding-scale
penalty should the company not achieve its commitments to the long
distance passenger sector by the end of March 2014. I am encouraging

additional national insurance revenue for the Exchequer. However, the
abolition of contracting out impacts those working today, not the
pensioners of today. If the national insurance revenues were used to

£3.7 billion of the increase in national insurance revenue is
from employer national insurance contributions from the public sector

of English local authorities. While health and wellbeing boards have no
statutory responsibility for holding commissioning budgets, local areas
are able to delegate to a health and wellbeing board if they so wish.
The boards are however under a duty to encourage integrated working
between commissioners of services across health, social care, public
health and children's services. Health and wellbeing boards are
encouraged to explore how the mechanisms for integration included in
the NHS Act 2006, such as pooled budgets or lead commissioning
arrangements, can be used to provide more integrated commissioning
across health and social

development of knee osteoarthritis. The mechanism linking the two is
complex, involving both biomechanical (due to increased strain on the
joints) and metabolic factors. Prolonged elevated Body Mass Index (BMI)
throughout adulthood carries a high risk of knee osteoarthritis. Obese
people are almost four times more likely to develop knee osteoarthritis
than those with a BMI below 25 kg/m2. There is less evidence on the

a devolved matter. However, including match-funding from tourism

£140 million to Visit Britain and Visit England to promote
tourism in England and the UK to deliver on our target to deliver an

Robertson:</Member></B> The Government is leading the nation in acts of
remembrance and enabling communities and individuals to participate in
the centenary, in a way which is meaningful for them. Building on
support of, so far, £13 million for first world war projects
from within its existing funding framework, the Heritage Lottery Fund
(HLF) recently launched a £6 million small grants programme to
help communities mark the centenary of the war and explore their local
heritage. 
<?notus-xml column=575?>HLF has a number of initiatives in place to ensure that all communities
have access to its funds, such as the identification of priority
development areas, which includes Barrow. Development areas will not
automatically receive funding, but special efforts will be made to
raise awareness of the availability of funding, and to give them
practical help to make applications able to compete with those 
<?notus-xml column=576?>from other areas. Additionally, the Imperial War Museums' Centenary
Partnership is a network of over 1,000 not for profit cultural and
educational organisations, including local and regional groups. This
network provides access to resources, expertise, a special logo and
networking opportunities to enable millions of people across the world
to discover more about life in the first world
war.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/Index/00D9D200691560CF3FBC45863B853334C1DB71A8" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="24" cday="Monday" cmonth="June" cyear="2013" date="17" day="Monday" issue="18" maxparts="1" month="June" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201314" type="back" volume="564" year="2013"><title col="603">Oral
