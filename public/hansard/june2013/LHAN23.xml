target. The Government’s macroeconomic framework includes an
independent Monetary Policy Committee responsible for monetary policy
that seeks to deliver price stability through an inflation
target of 2% as measured by the 12-month increase
in the consumer prices index. Under this framework the exchange
rate is allowed to adjust
flexibly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:36:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Empey" PimsId="5912" UID="13062572001081" xid="2122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001081">Lord

am sure to many in your Lordships’ House, that the export-led
recovery which we had all hoped for has not yet occurred. Does the
Minister agree that while we take no action with our exchange rates and
play by the Queensbury rules, our principal trading competitors in
China and Japan are not so constrained as they deliberately manipulate
the value of their currencies to the grave disadvantage of our
exporters? Will he join with US President Obama, who in the past few

Newby:</Member></B> The UK exchange rate has fallen by about 20% since
2007. It was hoped that that would give a big stimulus to exports; it
has given some, but not as much as we would have liked. On China, our
trade to China over the past three years has increased by 76%. In
April, for the first time, trade in goods to China reached £1
billion in a month. The access to China is proving rather better than
the access to some other
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Peston" PimsId="165" UID="13062572001083" xid="1171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001083">Lord
Peston:</Member></B> I congratulate the noble Lord on his answer, which
seems to me for once to be entirely right. The exchange rate did
collapse but it had no noticeable effect on improving the balance of
payments, as he said, because the supply side of our
economy has not been able to respond. Apart from
that—theoretically—we do not know whether it is the
balance of payments that affects the exchange rate, the exchange rate
that affects the balance of payments, or whether it is the two
interacting. In other words, we do not know very much about this at
all. A sensible Government will therefore concentrate on trying to
improve the supply side of the economy and leave the exchange rate to
go where it
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord. I would just
say, however, that we have been successful in reorienting trade towards
the BRICS countries. China trade has increased by 76% while trade with
Russia has increased by 71% and trade with other countries has
increased by an almost similar amount. The problem we have been up
against more than anything else is that the demand in our principal
market area, the EU, has been very flat and declining. There has been a
rebalancing of trade, and as the EU comes out of recession later in the
year we hope that we will be able to pick up exports there as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000007"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taverne" PimsId="4208" UID="13062572001085" xid="1460" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001085"><B>Lord

have over a prolonged period all countries devaluing or competitive
devaluation becomes a race to the bottom. The Governor of the Bank of

that the price devaluation of sterling can hardly be zero and that
saying that price does not matter in export markets would make a
nonsense of the whole argument about competitiveness? Would it not be
more true to say—here I echo my noble friend Lord
Peston—that when it comes to our manufacturing in particular
exports, where the ratio of visible trade is 2:5 against us, we must
have a policy on both sides? We must be competitive in price, which
might require the pound to go down further, on that argument, but we
must also give a massive shift of economic priority towards
manufacturing as against the financial services
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13062572001088" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001088">Lord

Who is thinking about the interests of people who do the right thing
and save, but who find that as a result of the programme of
quantitative easing the returns on their savings are minimal?
Pensioners who go for annuities are robbed blind because they get very
little return on their savings. Surely the last thing we need is a

is absolutely right: knowledge of the funding available does not seem
to be percolating through. That is a real shame, because SMEs account
for some 98% of all businesses in the UK and internal market. They also
account for so much activity, and there could be a huge opportunity for
growth and for employment, because if every SME in the UK, and where
possible in the internal market, took on one extra employee, there
would be no unemployment. The combination of getting the banks to let
go of some funding for SMEs, plus trying to encourage more employment
by the SMEs, could get us out of trouble very
quickly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:47:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Popat" PimsId="5792" UID="13062572001102" xid="2062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001102">Lord
Popat:</Member></B> My Lords, since the banking crisis in 2008, the
banks are a little risk averse. They do not want to have excessive
lending. At the same time, the SMEs are risk averse too; 61% do not
actually borrow money for their businesses, mainly because they have
retained profits to run their business but quite often because they use
their own capital. However, I agree with the noble Baroness that
awareness is key. This is where we have partly failed, and we are
taking steps to ensure awareness. Having said that, we launched the
Funding for Lending scheme this time last year, and so far we have lent
£16.5 billion through it. That is a pretty good record for the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:48:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the deplorable situation with respect to Funding for Lending.
Loans in general to SMEs year on year are down by more than 3%, and
Funding for Lending in the last quarter was down by £300
million. Billions of pounds are being drawn down by participating
banks, but precious little is getting through to SMEs. It simply is not
working. What we really need in this country is a fully fledged

months. We have also got other banks to join the scheme. Given time, it
will prove to be successful. We have £80 billion allocated for
that scheme. It is the best scheme available for SMEs. I also said that
the banks are risk averse. They do not want to go through the crisis
that they went through in 2008. SMEs are partly risk averse too. Not
many SMEs are borrowing, which is why there is a little contraction in

over 20 years ago, when they took the managers out of the branches and
that in fact there is nobody for the average SME to relate to but a
relationship manager at the end of a telephone, whose only word is no?
The real problem we have is to bring back a relationship between the
banks and the small firms. The Government are trying to do

years ago I had direct contact with my branch manager, and it was the
manager who did the lending. Now, most banks have corporate offices and
half the decisions are made on their computers rather than by human
brains. I agree with my noble friend, but the good news is that we have
set up competition within the banking sector and that the new

Indeed, I thank him for all that he has done personally to advance the

Research Council seems unable to launch fundamental research into this

that it is pretty complicated, one reason being that the Medical
Research Council is constrained by the quality of the research
proposals presented to it. There is a bit of a chicken-and-egg
situation going on, as I see it, and I am working with my noble friend
Lord Howe and the British Lung Foundation to break that situation. We
are hosting a seminar on the importance of mesothelioma research
shortly to try to stimulate the proposals for funding. As for
the second aspect of the question, clearly there has been much
debate on the exact level of compensation. In the end, this has been a
very complicated and intricate deal to make sure that we can get good
sums of money. We are getting an average of £87,000 a head to
people who suffer from this terrible disease who have not been able to
find any compensation whatever.</hs_para>

burden of the cost. I have been very anxious to get to a position where
I am as assured as I can be that the bulk of that cost is carried by
the insurance industry, not by British industry as a whole. The risk is

cross-government discussions are taking place to consider our options.
We will provide advice to members of the Armed Forces as soon as

reassuring Answer. Can he advise on this situation? A commanding
officer orders a soldier to take part in operations overseas against an
armed enemy, so clearly there is a risk of injury or loss of life. Is
that officer’s order lawful? If the soldier disobeys the order,
is he liable to a charge and court martial under Section 12, possibly,
of the Armed Forces Act because he did not go into the operation? Is
the officer liable to be charged or found disciplined under the human
rights legislation because the soldier followed his instructions but
was killed in

will create uncertainties, we are determined that it will not undermine
the authority of commanders in the field to give orders required in

Armed Forces personnel concerned can take action against the Ministry
of Defence, since the court ruled that the doctrine of combat immunity
should be interpreted narrowly. The individual claims concerned will
now return to the High Court and it remains to be seen what the exact
outcome will be. While it is essential that the MoD and the Armed
Forces have a duty of care to service personnel, the concerns that have
been expressed by the Defence Secretary and senior military figures on
the potential military implications of the ruling should give pause for

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, as I have said on a number of
occasions, this is a curious Bill. While the whole House welcomes its
intentions, many of us are deeply alarmed at the absence of detail
about their cost and how and whether they can be implemented in
the timeframe depicted on page 34 of the so far undiscussed
<I>Transforming Rehabilitation</I> White Paper. I have received many
letters of concern about this, including a number from serving members
of the National Probation Service, who are understandably worried about
what is being done to them and their service, 31 of whose 35 trusts are
adjudged to be performing well, with the remaining four performing
exceptionally
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000054">Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:08:42"></hs_TimeCode>
Thursday, the Minister was kind enough to e-mail me a copy of the
revised impact assessment, which I have to admit I find as
disappointing as its predecessor, because it is still so thin
on analysis of impact, cost or risk. I note that, yet again,
the Government’s justification for not releasing more details is
that to publish estimates would put contractual negotiations at risk
and so prejudice the effectiveness of the competition for delivery of
offender services. Indeed, compared with what has been put to
Ministers, as disclosed in articles in the <I>Times</I> and
<I>Guardian</I> today, it feels rather more like a ministerial pat on
the head of a recalcitrant

drawing the attention of the House to the inadequacy of the initial
impact assessment, I questioned whether, because it was published on
the same day as the Bill and the White Paper to which it referred, it
had been available to Ministers during their analysis of risk, or added
later. I have to ask the same about the draft strategic risk register,
prepared for a rehabilitation programme board on 21 May, referred to in
the articles. If a board saw a draft only 12 days after the Bill was
published, when were the risks that it assessed seen and discussed by
Ministers<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:09:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000056">I
presume that the impact of these risks was excluded from the impact
assessment, because it refers only to the Bill, not to the whole

asking the Minister when he and his colleagues considered these

implementation of their ambitious proposals has been drawn up, telling
Ministers—and so the public, whom it is their duty to
protect—exactly how, when and by whom they are to be

reassess what can realistically be achieved using available resources,

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord has made very clear,
this amendment addresses issues both of form and substance. I
entirely concur with his devastating and magisterial critique of the
way the Government are seeking not merely to impose massive changes on
a highly successful—indeed, award winning—public service
but to do so without an evidence base, proper costings or any
parliamentary scrutiny. The farce of the impact assessments has been
compounded by the revelations of advice given to Ministers by Ministry
of Justice officials on the risks attendant on the implementation of
their policies and by the recently leaked document showing that the
residual probation service dealing with high-risk offenders that is
envisaged by the proposals will face further cuts in funding of 19% by
2017-18<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:22:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000071">When
the Government drove through their controversial, some of us would say
disastrous, reorganisation of the National Health Service, they at

the subject of a Bill that was itself subject to scrutiny. In this
case, as I have previously observed, the future of this service, so
vital a part of our system of criminal justice and so important in
maintaining the safety of the public, would not be being debated at all

astonishing, indeed disgraceful, that we read today that in their risk

of the reforms” on the passing of the legislation. I do not
blame officials for this, nor do I blame the Minister in this House.

Randolph Churchill famously described Gladstone as an old man in a

and if he continues on his present path, rushing on with eye-catching
gimmicks and policies which have attracted the deep concern of the
senior judiciary, such as those on criminal legal aid, judicial review
and court privatisation, his political career is likely to end in the

want to address the amendment as it is tabled and ask a couple of
questions of the noble Lord when he comes to respond, if not of my
noble friend. First, although this sounds quite counterintuitive, is
there such a thing in legislation as the probation service? The
Offender Management Act 2007, which is what I understand the changes
which are being described are based on, talks about probation
provision, probation purposes, probation service, but not the probation
service. Secondly, again looking at the 2007 Act, have the proposers of
this amendment taken into account the provisions within the Act for
affirmative orders? Section 5(3)(c)—I know this is not the sort
of speech that holds the House, certainly without me handing out
programmes—provides for the purposes of a probation trust to
include a purpose specified in regulations made by the Secretary of
State. Those must be made, we find later in the Act, by affirmative
resolution. Section 38(2)(a) is about amending, repealing or revoking
an enactment and this again requires an affirmative resolution. As I
said, being rather tedious, I am struggling a little with the form of
the amendment and in understanding quite how it would apply in taking
forward the points that have been made by the two noble Lords, given
that I think we have to base what we are doing on the existing

turn now to the detail of the changes that we are proposing. First, let
me put on record that the Government recognise the excellent work that
is done by the probation professionals across the country. I have said
that time and again from this Dispatch Box. Our proposals for reform
seek to build on those achievements, not to minimise them. We are doing
that in two ways: first, by extending rehabilitation to all offenders
who need it through the provisions in this Bill; and,
secondly, by seeking to restructure the way in which these
services are delivered by opening up the delivery of probation services
to a wider market and by bringing the retained public sector probation
service into a national entity. These latter elements of our reform
proposals are crucial to the core aim of our proposals: to break the
cycle of reoffending. We do so for three reasons. The first is
that by opening up the provision of rehabilitation services to the
private and voluntary sectors, we are seeking to promote additional
innovation and investment. Despite the excellent work and commitment of
those supporting offenders within the public sector, we are unable to
achieve this fully under our current structures.</hs_para>

restructuring the public sector probation service into a national
entity, we are focusing public sector resources on areas where it is
most needed: on protecting the public from harm and providing clear and
impartial advice to sentencers. By managing this service nationally, we
are seeking to drive excellence across the country, bringing all
delivery of these services up to the level of the highest
performers.</hs_para>

most importantly, through both elements of this structural reform we
are seeking to drive efficiency and savings in current practices and to
provide the necessary investment to open up provision to all those who
need it. I remind noble Lords that we simply cannot afford to expand
rehabilitation to short-sentence offenders without these
savings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000092">I now
turn to the detail of the structural reforms that we are proposing. We
are committed to maintaining a strong local delivery structure within
the public sector probation service. Although current trusts have
clearly built excellent relationships with other local delivery
partners, much of this local working does not take place at the level
of the 35 existing trusts but within the 150 local delivery units that
sit beneath them. Our firm intention is to retain a strong local
delivery structure based on these units, providing clear representation
and involvement within both local authority and criminal justice
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000093">Senior
managers in the new organisation will have a strong presence within the
National Offender Management Service and the Ministry of Justice, with
directors for both England and Wales sitting on the NOMS board.
Probation has often been viewed as the junior partner within NOMS, and
this reorganisation is an opportunity to remedy
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000094">For
probation functions that are being competed for, we are committed to
retaining the skills, expertise and experience of operational staff
currently within trusts. We are working closely with unions and
associations representing probation providers to ensure that any
process of selecting staff for the new structures is fair and minimises
disruption as far as possible. We have also been engaging with
interested parties to develop proposals for a professional body for the
probation profession, and are strongly supportive of this
idea.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000095">We also
recognise how crucial working in partnership is to the successful
rehabilitation of offenders, and how probation trusts are integral to
many of these excellent local partnership arrangements, including
integrated offender management. The Government are determined not to
disrupt this, and we are clear that contracted providers will need to
demonstrate how they will engage effectively with key local partners
when they are bidding for
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000096">As

these changes will deliver, including the extension of rehabilitation

Richard:</Member></B> Before the noble Lord sits down, perhaps he can
help me with one small issue concerning the risk assessment. If you
have a risk assessment, surely it follows that risks have to be
assessed. The noble Lord says, “No, they do not have to be
assessed; they have to be identified”. Why does he make that
distinction? It goes to the essence of the point that the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, is making. If there is an assessment of risk, surely
we are entitled to see it, not to be told merely that certain risks
have been identified but, as far as we know, remain
unassessed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:46:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000101"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13062572001141" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001141">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> Of course, part of the problem is that it is
described as a risk assessment by journalists. As I said before, a
variety of exercises is carried out by the project development team,
using various combinations of some of the figures that the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, plucked out—in fact, it was a third source
because they came from a leak to a journalist to the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, to the House. So I ask the House to decide how accurate
they are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000102">Of
course, the Opposition cry, “Tell us”, but they went
through similar exercises on big projects when they were in government.
They realised that this was work in progress and it remained part of
the management team’s work-in-progress tools. It is not a
document that would give help to anybody in terms of what the noble
Lord is talking about as risk. It is not about that kind of thing; it

Countess of Mar:</Member></B> My Lords, before the noble Lord sits
down, following his comments about his noble friend Lady
Hamwee’s remarks about the probation service, he twice at least
used the phrase “the probation 
<?notus-xml column=669?>service” in his speech. Can he say what he
was covering in that phrase? In addition, has he not considered that a
major stumbling block is the fact that we do not know how much this is
going to cost? My noble friend Lord Ramsbotham and the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, both said that we need to know the cost. The Minister has made
no mention of the

McNally:</Member></B> We are working within a very strict budget.
Because we have other commitments as far as the overall expenditure of
the department is concerned, we have also said that we will be spending
a little less than the £1 billion that is spent on
probation at present. We believe that with our experience of piloting
other schemes we can bring that down. But that will unfold as we test
against the market. One of the reasons why we cannot give the precise
figures is that we will be going into negotiations with commercial
operators who would very much like to know in advance what our baseline
would be, along with our other financial operations. We know the
figures in broad terms and, as we have said before, while this will
make some savings, it is the flexibility, the hard bargains that we
were able to drive with the private sector, and the efficiencies that
we will introduce which will bring the costs
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:50:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

term “probation service” rather loosely. What my noble

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may put a point to
him. No doubt the noble Lord will recollect that at the end of 2010,
the National Audit Office calculated that the cost of reoffending lies
between the parameters of £9.5 billion and £13 billion
per annum. Is it not therefore a reality that, even with the best will
in the world and the most accurate attempt at analysis, it is
impossible to arrive at any meaningful figure for what these new and
revolutionary changes will bring about? It is not a question of not
showing your hand in what might be a commercial negotiation that will
have to follow, but that the figures are virtually unquantifiable and
could mean massive public
loss<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

McNally:</Member></B> I am extremely grateful to the noble Lord for
that intervention, which probably was not intended to be helpful, but
certainly was. That is because these are the stakes we are playing for.
I do not doubt the figures he has given and indeed I have seen them.
Reoffending costs this country between £9 billion and
£14 billion, so let us not say that we are going to aim to
prevent 50% of reoffending. If we could get it down to 40%, just think
what that would mean in hard cash. That is the prize we are aiming for.
Of course it takes some radical thinking and means taking risks that
are outside the box—that is exactly what we are doing. When
there is a new idea, it is a lot easier to throw spanners in the works
or to say what is so often said about any new and radical idea,
“Let’s have a bit more time to think about it and take it
all a bit more slowly”. We have put a lot of work into this
project and, as we develop and unfold it, we are willing 
<?notus-xml column=670?>to share information with Members of this House and others. However, the
noble Lord is quite right that, as well as the impact on offenders who
are taken out of the cycle of crime, and apart from the impact on
victims who will avoid the crimes that the rehabilitated will not
commit, there really is big money to be saved by carrying this through.
I am as enthusiastic and confident about it now as I was when we
started, and I hope that the House will feel the same as it did

legislation would suggest that although we can say what we like about
those tools, it does not matter a damn, because the Secretary of State
is going to go ahead anyway, encouraged by the legislation’s
permission for him to do so. In that case, we would be denied any
chance to have our say and to put our expertise and intent at

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by reiterating that I and
colleagues on these Benches, and indeed across the whole House, are
entirely supportive of the Government’s intentions in the Bill
to reduce reoffending. We congratulate them on that aspiration. We want
to work with them to see its fulfilment but we have legitimate
questions to raise about the way in which they seek to proceed. Having
said that, I repeat that we are at one with them in the objective of
saving large amounts of public money and, equally importantly, helping
to reshape the lives of the people and communities upon whom they have
an
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

trust passes the Hamwee test, deals with payment by results. The
Government’s proposals, which are of course not in the Bill,
postulate a system in which for short-sentence offenders there will be
supervision, from which the probation service will effectively be
excluded, in respect of what have been described as low and medium-risk
offenders. That work will be carried out under contract by independent
private or voluntary sector organisations, or a combination of the two.
The amendment is designed to ensure that such a scheme is properly
piloted. It does not rule it out, but it suggests that the scheme be
properly piloted and then approved by Parliament as a radical change to
the nature of the probation
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000116">I am
grateful to the noble Lords, Lord Taylor and Lord McNally, for
answering after a fashion several questions which I raised at Second
Reading and in Committee on payment by results schemes in connection
with this question of the prevention of reoffending. The noble Lord,
Lord Taylor, responded to my request for an explanation of why the
Government abandoned pilot schemes by the Wales and the Staffordshire
and West Midlands probation trusts, and why they refused an FOI request
for details of the evaluation of those pilots, by a curious answer to
my first question—to which I shall return—and by
responding to my second by falling back on the wholly unsatisfactory
defence that the information relates to the formulation and development
of government policy.</hs_para>

“judged the public interest was better served by
withholding the information to ensure Ministers and officials
can conduct rigorous assessment of developing
proposals—including considerations of 
<?notus-xml column=675?>the pros and cons, and learning from any pilots—without there
being premature disclosure which might close off discussion and the
development of better options”. The latter point seems to be a
classic non sequitur, especially in the light of the preceding
paragraph in the letter, which asserts that, “The lessons the
Ministry of Justice has drawn from implementing the pilots has
given them confidence that they can design and commission robust
contracts that drive right behaviours and generate value for money. It
was decided that value for money would best be served by discontinuing
work on pilots that might be incompatible with the wider reform
programme”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000118">If
the pilots are not to shape the wider reform programme, why can their
evaluation not be disclosed? Is it because the Government have
determined as a matter of policy—or rather, ideology—that
the probation service is to be excluded from this area of work? Did the
results demonstrate a capacity on the part of the trusts to deliver the
objectives or not? If they did, why have the Government chosen to rely
entirely on other providers?</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord McNally, in his letter says that the department
“does not hold evaluations of the pilots”, but that it
does hold “notes of lesson learned workshops”—that
is the phrasing—“relating to the pilots”. From the
back of these departmental envelopes, the department is apparently
“considering what information it should publish before formal
procurement begins and information relating to these pilots is being
considered as part of the process”, but without any intention,
apparently, of their being disclosed to Parliament. Ministers appear to
be adopting the character of Kaiser Wilhelm II in the famous
<I>Punch</I> cartoon on the occasion of his dismissal of Bismarck as
Imperial Chancellor. The caption showed the Kaiser dismissing a
nautical Bismarck over the legend “Dropping the Pilot”.
That is exactly what the Government appear to have done in respect of
these two
pilots.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000120">However,
it is otherwise, apparently, with the interim reports on the two prison
pilots at Doncaster and Peterborough, rather too glibly hailed by the
ever casual Mr Grayling as successful. The noble Lord, Lord McNally,
very helpfully referred me to two reports. The one on Doncaster was
dated 2011, which is before the project got under way in Doncaster. The
other was an interim report on Peterborough. Both pilots are supposed
to run for four years. The amendment suggests a more modest period of
three years. In any event, that would take us beyond the next election,
which is too long for Mr Grayling’s political agenda. At best,
as my right honourable friend Sadiq Khan, among others, has pointed
out, these very early results are mixed with Doncaster being,
if anything, disappointing and Peterborough, on one measure, barely
encouraging. Yet the Government appear determined to press on with
payment by results in any event. I was going to say “at all
costs”, but of course they have no intention of revealing the

host of questions is still unanswered. The Minister’s letter
asserts that the Government will “design a competition process
that allows a range of different kinds of entities to be able to bid to
deliver services. Such entities would have to be capable of bearing
financial risk so cannot be public sector bodies, but this could
include alternative delivery vehicles and mutuals designed by staff

seems to me that this latter is a naked bid to defuse opposition from
within the probation service, but it rests on another non sequitur.
There is no reason why public sector bodies should not engage in
activities which involve financial risk. They do it all the time: the
Government do it, the health service does it, local authorities do it,
and they frequently manage that risk better than private sector bodies,
as the shambles of our economy only too painfully

make a number of other points which raise more questions than they
provide answers. Thus, apparently, performance indicators will be used
to measure service delivery and the Ministry of Justice will be able to
deduct an unspecified proportion of the fee for service payment. There
is simply no indication of how this will work. What proportion is
envisaged? What weight will be given to the nature of any reoffending?
Will a motoring offence count the same as a burglary or a crime of
violence? The letter states that any offence committed within a

strikes me as much too broad a definition. However, 12 months may well
be too short a period within which to judge whether the supervision has
been successful. The notion that performance payments are to be made by
cohort with potentially undifferentiated weightings for the character
and severity of the offences or the record of the individual offender

the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, has just said, because he has covered
everything. However, I notice that, in a recent letter to us,
the Minister mentioned that results were to be paid for after one year.
I suspect that this is very welcome to both the voluntary and private
sectors, which will be competing for payment. The voluntary sector
would find it very difficult to go for longer without payment. However,
as the Minister knows, reoffending rates always used to be measured
after two years. Indeed, if you follow the reoffending rates after
that, you find that they decline over time. Therefore, is it not rather
premature to come to a judgment after one year? Could the Minister say
whether it is intended that, if an offender goes on to reoffend two or
three years after release, the company that has been paid will be
expected to make a repayment for reoffending that happened
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:28:04"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000132"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Goodhart" PimsId="3491" UID="13062572001150" xid="1169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001150">Lord

Ramsbotham, appeared to propose at one moment, that he should withdraw
that amendment and come back with another version at Third Reading. For
some reason—I would be interested to know why—he did not
do that, but pressed his amendment to a vote this time. The result was
that the amendment was passed and cannot be changed, except by the

noble Lord, Lord McNally, the National Audit Office’s figures,
which he accepts. In 2010, the parameters were from £9.5 billion
to £13 billion. The noble Lord now says that they are from
£9.5 billion to £14 billion. That is apparently the
point, in relation not only to the earlier amendment but to this one,

why must we assume that we shall make that saving? The probation
service, which is now about 100 years old, is one of the most
distinguished public services that this country has ever had. These
changes are the greatest ever conceived for that service, and have the
capacity to wreck it and emasculate it completely. If we get them wrong
and they are failures, and if that, not unnaturally, results in more
reoffending, we could be talking in terms not of saving millions but of
the possible loss of millions, or even
more<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>. Why should
we automatically assume that there will be a saving? The Minister may

could be no better bill of health, so there is no justification for the

that I have been concerned about a payments-by-results service, not
least because of the 
<?notus-xml column=680?>threat, as I see it, to innovative, interesting,
small-scale provision which is delivered so effectively by a number of
organisations that are very often—because this is the way with
the voluntary sector—working on something of a knife edge. I
have had reassurances, which I have very much welcomed, about the
financial arrangements being such as to support small organisations
which—I do not want to be pejorative towards them—may
feel that they are lurching from month to month not being entirely
certain that their income is sufficiently stable. They are also at a
disadvantage compared with bigger organisations when it comes to a
bidding war. There are a lot of sectors where some sort of beauty
parade is undertaken. Sometimes, the money gets spent on the
beauty rather than the content, and that is what wins the contract. I
say again that I have heard reassurances about support for small
organisations for part of the bidding

want to take this opportunity to ask my noble friend for reassurance
about something that struck me only earlier today. It is entirely
likely that large outsourcing companies—we know the various
names—will bid for some of the contracts. We also know that the
proposed changes to criminal legal aid are likely to mean that the same
large organisations may, through different parts of their workforce,
bid to undertake solicitors’ services under the new legal aid
contracts. What occurred to me was the danger of a conflict of
interest, whereby two parts of the same organisation are representing
an offender and providing rehabilitative supervisory services. I am
using this occasion to ask my noble friend for an assurance about the
solidity of the Chinese walls that will be required to be put in place,
and the monitoring of them, if these two parts of the

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, it is always a great pleasure to joust
with the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, as he is such a well read man and we
heard about the Kaiser “dropping the pilot”. However, I
like to think that the Opposition’s support for the Bill, which
he again gave fulsomely at the end of his remarks, is like the rope
that supports the hanging man—in saying that, I look to Lenin
rather than the Kaiser—and so he introduces another amendment
which would at least throw a considerable spanner in the works, if not
wreck the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:40:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000144">I
say to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that I, of course, consider
the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, to be a saintly man. However, my
reading of <I>Lives of the Saints</I> makes me well aware that one or
two of them were quite capable of landing fairly lusty blows.
Therefore, I have never equated saintliness or sanctity with pacifism
or a lack of willingness to trade blows. If noble Lords read
today’s opening speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, they
will see that it contained a few lusty blows directed at the Secretary
of State and the department, but is none the worse for that. I am sorry
that, acting in their individual capacities and making up their minds
individually, not a single Cross-Bencher managed to support me in the
Division, as I understand it, but that is the nature of
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:41:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000145">The
noble Lord, Lord Beecham, really should stop reading spy and thriller
novels because his speeches are based entirely on sinister facts. As
regards the FOI 
<?notus-xml column=681?>request, our refusal to release the relevant
information was based on the criteria in the Freedom of Information
Act, which the Labour Government crafted. As he well knows, that
procedure gives the Government the opportunity to develop policy before
premature disclosure occurs. As in the previous debate, the noble Lord
saw all kinds of sinister motivations behind the use of a management
tool which his Labour Government developed in Whitehall to allow those
developing policy not to make predictions but to test possible dangers
before making policy public. We have published the process of
evaluation of our pilots at Peterborough and Doncaster and our justice
reinvestment pilots. We do not have formal evaluation reports of the
other pilots because they were discontinued. However, we have learnt
from the process of designing the pilots and we are applying that
learning process to the design of the new system. That is part of our
policy development
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000146">I
have known the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, keep the House going
for a long time over one wrong word in a piece of legislation so it is
a little rich for him to ask what is in a word. I again make the point
to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that we have given considerable
assistance to small innovators in the voluntary and charitable sectors.

running a two-part £500,000 grant to voluntary organisations to
overcome the barriers to their participation in the rehabilitation

wider range of potential providers, including the voluntary sector. We
are keen to see partnerships between voluntary organisations or between
private and voluntary providers coming forward for contracts. We
continue to develop a strategy to support the voluntary sector to
participate in future competitions and are working closely with the

organisations to deliver payment by results

point raised by noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about Chinese walls is
very valid and becomes more and more prevalent as various companies
provide services across the criminal justice system. I assure her that

raised by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, and myself that we are
dealing with a considerable reoffending rate. Nobody puts it all at the
door of the probation service. Nobody is accusing probation officers of
not being up to the job. But when you have the kind of offending rates
we have experienced—often called the revolving
door—with prisoners coming out, often unsupervised, only
to offend again, we are right to look at new ways and to try
to bring in new ideas, new methods and new efficiencies to address this
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:46:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

require the details of any system of payment by results to be laid
before and approved by a resolution of both Houses before being
implemented. It would also require the piloting of payment by results
for three years, subject to independent evaluation and based on
existing probation trust areas. 
<?notus-xml column=682?>As with Amendment 1, I ask noble Lords to consider the full effect of
this amendment. It would mean that any system of financial incentives
for organisations to reduce reoffending would have to be
subject to this three-year pilot. That could mean a probation
trust looking to subcontract delivery of a community payback with an
element of incentive for providers, just as much as it can mean a wider
system of payment by
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this but I want to underline the full impact of what I would call
micromanagement by Parliament. We firmly believe that paying providers
by results will drive them to focus on reducing reoffending so we can
make a difference to reoffending rates. The need to do so is pressing.
If I said £14 billion I will correct it as my notes say
£13 billion, so another one up for the noble Lord, Lord
Elystan-Morgan.

nature of what rehabilitation providers will do means that we intend to
pay them through a combination of payment by results and more
traditional fees for services. In his merry and engaging way, the noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, was suggesting that we would be standing at the
gate with a bag of money dishing it out for the merest improvements in
performance. We believe that this scheme will produce the best of
probation treatment with the incentive brought by payment by
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:49:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I
should emphasise that the Ministry of Justice has consulted carefully
on our payment by results approach. Our February 2013 consultation,

</I><I>M</I><I>anage </I><I>O</I><I>ffenders</I>, sought views on how
to get the right balance between incentivising providers and
transferring financial risk to them, and on how to ensure that
providers work with all offenders, including the most prolific and the
hardest to help. We listened carefully to the responses and, as the
consultation response, <I>Transforming Rehabilitation: </I><I>A</I><I>
</I><I>S</I><I>trategy for </I><I>R</I><I>eform</I>, published in May
this year, set out, we have refined our approach in response. I am
aware that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, has been particularly
concerned to ensure that providers are not able to neglect the
offenders who are the hardest to help. As we have developed our payment
by results approach, we have specifically sought to ensure that they
are not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000152">We
have not stopped looking at the design of our payment mechanism
approach—I am aware of how important the details are to driving
a reduction in reoffending. In May 2013, the Ministry of Justice
published a draft <I>Payment Mechanism</I><I>—</I><I>Straw
Man</I> document, which we are using in discussion with potential
providers to make sure that we develop an effective final proposal. I

say this again because noble Lords have been lured in that direction
partly by the idea put about that we do not seem to have done any
planning or consultation and that we have not put out information. We
have been doing a lot of work, testing a lot of these ideas and
bringing in a lot of experience and expertise, so let 
<?notus-xml column=683?>us not be lured into the idea that Parliament or the country is being
asked to accept a pig in a poke here. This is a system where I think we
shall be able to see some real success and where the returns of that
success will be enormous.</hs_para>

amount that providers are paid will depend both on the proportion of
their offenders who have completely desisted from reoffending and on
the total number of repeat offences committed by offenders. Therefore,
providers cannot simply focus on those whom they can easily stop
reoffending; they also need to work with the most prolific reoffenders
and to keep working with offenders when they
reoffend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000155">Since
the House last considered this amendment, the Ministry of Justice has
published the interim results from two of our continuing payment by
results pilots. As the Justice Secretary said when the results were
published, the figures from the pilot at Peterborough prison, which is
the sort of approach we want to see rolled out to all offenders leaving
prison, are very encouraging. They show a sizeable fall in
reconvictions and clearly demonstrate that, with targeted support and
help aimed at the right people at the right time, we can divert more
offenders from a return to crime. We will continue to learn the lessons
from these pilots as we develop our final approach.</hs_para>

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister and to
other noble Lords for theirs contribution to this short debate. I begin
with the question from the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about the
potential conflict of interest. If I may say so, it is potentially
rather worse than the two instances that she gave because, in addition
to the two services that she referred to, these contractors may be
involved in two other areas. The first is increasing involvement with
the police service and the second is the latest proposal for the
privatisation of the courts. The whole spectrum of the criminal justice
system could thus, in one way or another, come to be run by one of
these bodes. Therefore, I think that there is real substance in the
point that she
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:54:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:54:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

enough to compare me with Lenin. Apart from the hairstyle I do not
think that there is a huge resemblance. He referred to Lenin’s
famous dictum about giving support to the social democrats that the
rope would give to the hanging man. I would never do that, except
possibly to Liberal Democrats, which is a rather different
category<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:54:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000159">However,
there are more serious issues here. The noble Lord quoted with
approbation the results of the Peterborough pilot—not so much
the Doncaster pilot for fairly obvious reasons—and said that it
has shown an improvement of 6%. That was true but it took the situation
back only to the preceding year of the period. The crucial point is
that the two probation trust pilots were terminated. We still do not
know, because no Minister has condescended to tell us, why those two
pilot schemes in Wales and Staffordshire in the West Midlands, run by
the probation trusts, were terminated; 
<?notus-xml column=684?>not only that, Ministers will not give us the
evaluation. Yet, in Peterborough and Doncaster, not yet halfway through
the proposed piloting period, they disclosed results. I find that
inconsistency wholly
inexplicable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:55:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000160">On
the question of payment, I am not asking for details of the eventual
payment scheme, but for an indication roughly speaking of what
percentage might be attributable to the results. What proportion
are we talking about? Are we talking about 10% of a fee,
something up to 20%, or somewhere in between? There is no indication at
all of the proportions that the Government might be contemplating. It
is nice to know that at some point information will be placed in the
Library; it will be a little late for this House to use unless the Bill
comes back from the Commons in a different form.</hs_para>

in relation to piloting, I spoke in Committee of another pilot that the
Government are conducting on drugs offences which will not report until
2017-18. The Government, quite rightly, have not produced evidence on
that yet but they will not implement anything until those pilots are
completed. That is the thrust of the amendment. I repeat that we want
reoffending reduced. We like the notion very much of affording
supervision to a great many more people. We are not convinced that the
Government have the evidence yet on how to do it efficiently,
effectively and economically. This amendment would help them to do that
in a timescale that I repeat is less than the timescale of the various
other pilots about which we have heard. I am afraid that the Minister
has not given satisfactory answers to the questions that I and others
have raised and I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13062572000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000265">4.57

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, noble Lords will be relieved to hear
that this is not an amendment on which I propose to divide the House.
Rather, it is an attempt to try to elucidate some of the issues around
the question of risk, to which I have previously referred. It is a
matter on which the Chief Inspector of Probation has commented. In
particular, she has drawn attention to the movement between risk
categories, which is generally assumed to be in the order of 25% with a
significant proportion moving from a lower to a higher risk. Indeed,
studies carried out by the inspectorate show that as many as 50% of
offenders change category. There is a real concern that, given this
binary system, the information required to transfer from a low or
medium risk to a higher risk category, which would involve a change in
supervisor from the organisations that are to be contracted under the
payment-by-results system—assuming that they are non probation
service, as the Government intend—to the probation service as
the body responsible for high risk offenders is, to put it mildly,
unclear.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062572000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000164">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:13:37"></hs_TimeCode>
potential problem is that the information may not be timely, if it is
available at all. That may lead to high risk offenders not receiving
the degree of skilled supervision which is primarily available from the
probation service. What the amendment seeks to do, quite simply, 
<?notus-xml column=688?>is ask the Government to work through their
proposals more substantively than so far appears to be the case with a
view to defining the categories more clearly. In particular
there is a suggestion that the definition should exclude from the low
and medium risk categories those offenders who have been convicted of
offences, as the amendment states,</hs_para>
<hs_quotefo UID="13062572000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000246">“of a violent

be regarded as potentially of high risk. The effect would be
that people in those categories would be supervised by the probation
service. Given the nature of the offences, that seems to be a sensible
precaution that will allow the service to monitor the offender and, as
I indicated in the previous debate, to relate to the victims.
These victims will clearly be vulnerable individuals and usually,
although not necessarily, women. It is as much the job of
the probation service to protect the safety of those people
as it is to promote the rehabilitation of
offenders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:15:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062572000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000165">Even
if he cannot give assurances today, I hope that the noble Lord will
consider coming back at Third Reading, perhaps with some formulation
that would meet the objectives here. They are not at all inconsistent
with the thrust of government policy but do identify a potential
problem given the split of responsibilities to which we have referred
and which we debated earlier. I hope that, in that spirit, the
noble Lord will look at this issue again and respond in a way that
would not only be satisfactory to your Lordships’ House but
would meet the concerns raised, perfectly legitimately and forcefully,

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make
one very brief point in relation to this. Of course, one has sympathy
with the overall notion that it is important that the classification of
offenders as low, medium or high-risk is carried out with a
great degree of care. However, I would suggest that the classification
reflected in the title of the new clause as proposed in the
amendment,</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062572000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000234">“Low,

more likely to be accurate than the classification in proposed
subsection (2) of the amendment, which deals with the classification of
offences. The reason for that is found in the words of
proposed subsection (2), which says
that,</hs_parafo><hs_quotefo UID="13062572000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000247">“the

would mean that any ordinary common-law offence of assault, any assault
occasioning actual bodily harm or any low-grade affray would take an
offence out of the classification that would enable the offender to be
classified as low or medium risk. These classifications need to be
capable of fine-tuning and I have serious doubts whether it is
appropriate for that fine-tuning to be given effect by a classification
that merely considers the offences rather than the
offenders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062572000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000167"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13062572001158" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001158">Lord

to the Chief Inspector of Probation, Liz Calderbank, and the concerns
that she has expressed. I make it clear that we have carefully
considered the points she has made in response to our consultation. Our

some of her concerns are met. The Secretary of State has met
the chief inspector to discuss her concerns and she will continue to

point made by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, was the importance of
victims. We share that concern. We are retaining the victim liaison

decided it was right that the public sector should continue to exercise
its experience and professionalism in conducting this
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000171">In
discussing these areas, it is easy to exploit public emotion and
concern when one refers to sex offenders, murderers or rapists. Let us
be clear: every offender who poses a high risk of serious harm to the

allocation in each case. They will retain management of every offender
who poses a high risk of serious harm to the public and every offender
who falls under the multiagency public protection
arrangements—or MAPPA. We will not get into second guessing the
judgment of probation professionals about who poses a high risk of
serious harm but we will have a very clear set of

managing the risk of serious harm that an offender poses sits with the
organisation allocated the case management according to the standards
set. This will be the public sector in the case of those who pose a
high risk of serious harm and contracted providers in the case of those
whose risk of harm is assessed as medium or

reassure noble Lords that this matter of risk has been foremost in our
minds when designing the new system. Although the majority of offenders
will in future be managed by contracted providers, we are clear that
every offender who poses a high risk of harm to the public will
continue to be managed by the public sector National Probation Service.
We are also clear that it will be professionals in the National
Probation Service who assess the risk posed by every offender at the
outset. By the way, I take pride every time I read the words
“National Probation Service”. One of the good things that
will come out of these reforms is a National Probation Service with the
esteem and professional recognition that it deserves.</hs_para>

have already recognised that the public will want reassurance that
those who have committed the most serious sexual and violent offences
will be managed by the public sector probation service. That is why we
have said that anyone managed under multiagency public protection
arrangements will remain with the public sector, whatever their risk
level. That includes offenders who have committed serious sexual or
violent offences and other offenders who may cause serious harm to the
public. The proposed amendment would go further, requiring all those
who have been convicted of violent or sexual offences, stalking or
domestic violence to be treated as high risk regardless of the length
of sentence imposed. Many of those individuals will already fall to be
managed by the National Probation Service under MAPPA, but we believe
that a blanket approach like this goes too far and would not be
effective in identifying those individuals who need the most careful
management. Indeed, it would mean major changes to the way the current
probation framework deals with offenders. While I am sure that is not
the noble Lord’s intention, I hope it will help if I explain how
risk is assessed and managed, and why this amendment would cut across
professional
discretion.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_25_PT_1/132FA1106EA0D9B6DC4CA16F923230CC02608233" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 June 2013">Tuesday,

and managing the risk posed by offenders is a complex job involving a
great deal of professional expertise. It needs to take a wide range of
circumstances into account. The offence of which an offender has been
convicted is only one of the relevant factors and is not always
a good indicator of risk. There will be many others: age, criminal
history, education, employment, substance misuse, interpersonal issues,
and accommodation status, for example.</hs_para>

experienced professionals can use their expertise to make the right
decisions to protect the public. I believe that it should be those
practitioners, rather than Parliament, who should decide what
constitutes a high risk of harm. Automatically deeming high risk an
offender who has committed a particular offence could mean subjecting
that individual to supervision that is significantly in excess of what
is warranted. Indeed, there is a possibility that for low-risk
offenders, providing overly heavy supervision and intervention might
actually increase rather than decrease their risk.</hs_para>

some reassurance if I set out in more detail how the process will work
once the initial allocation has been made. During our consultation, we
were told that splitting the management of offenders between the
National Probation Service and the contracted providers would require
clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities at every level
and a clearly defined process for managing rapid changes in offender
risk. We agree, and we have built those into the design of the new
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000178">We are
developing a risk management system that is both proactive and
responsive to changes in risk. At the heart of our system is the
recognition that at an operational level those managing an offender
must have day-to-day responsibility for managing the risk of
harm posed by that offender. This will be the National Probation
Service in the case of those who pose a high risk of serious harm and
contracted providers in the case of those whose risk of serious harm is
assessed as medium or low. However, we also recognise that risk 
<?notus-xml column=691?>of serious harm can change during the course of a sentence, and we are
putting a series of safeguards in place to ensure that changes in risk
are picked up and appropriately acted on and that responsibilities are
clear at every

pursue an approach that will build on existing good practice. We

the process we envisage. The National Probation Service will conduct an
assessment at the outset, which will determine who manages each

the case of those whose risk of serious harm is assessed as medium or

the course of the sentence, providers will be required to risk-manage
the offender within their case load We will place contractual
obligations on providers to ensure that they have appropriately trained
staff and organisational policies for the management of risk of serious
harm. Where there is a significant change in circumstances that
indicates an increase in the risk of serious harm, the contracted
provider will be required contractually to refer the case to the
National Probation Service. It will be for the National Probation

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that
very full explanation of the Government’s approach, and I derive
a reasonable degree of comfort and assurance from it. I am not entirely
convinced by the concept of the National Probation Service as an
improvement on the more localised service that is 
<?notus-xml column=692?>currently being delivered through probation trusts at local level. I was
not a great admirer of the previous Government’s decision to
create the National Offender Management Service either. The Minister

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000186"><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13062572001160" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572001160"><B>Lord

the probation service being where it should be, at the top table and
with direct access to the Secretary of
State.</hs_para>

Beecham:</Member></B> I can certainly see the case for an arrangement
of that kind, but the operational workings of the service are better
driven at a more local level, with the service being involved in the
relevant areas— as I said, I think there are 35 at the
moment—by engaging with the other partners, which are a
necessary part of dealing with the problems of offenders. That includes
magistrates, who I understand will no longer be involved in this
process, and there is some concern about that among magistrates. It
also includes other government departments, such as the DWP, local
authorities and the voluntary sector operating at a local
level.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062572000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000188">I
continue to have reservations about the nationalisation of the service,
as it were, which again might differentiate me from Lenin. I am
reasonably assured by the process that the Minister describes, but on
the more substantive issue I still have some anxiety, which may be
shared generally, about the process of identifying a change of category
and the reference upward to the probation service, however constituted,
particularly if there was a large jump from a lower-risk case, which
might well be supervised by a contractual or voluntary organisation at
a comparatively low level of skill, which might make it more difficult
to detect the change. Without suggesting further pilots, since these
are not in fashion at the moment, it would be helpful to hear from the
Minister at some point, perhaps just informally, whether the transition
will be kept under review and an effort made to collate the experience
across this scheme to see how it works over a reasonable
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000189">The
other question that arises is how this arrangement of transfer will
affect the contract. I suppose it should not be assumed that a transfer
of risk necessarily means that the provider has failed in their
contractual obligation, because there might not be another offence.
Again, I appreciate that we are talking about cohorts, but there are
some significant numbers here. Given that 250,000 people are to be
involved, I do not know how big the cohorts are to be. I am not asking
for an answer to this now—again, perhaps it could be by
letter—but if there is a change of category so that at different
times you have two separate organisations with responsibility for part
of the cohort, how will that impact upon the payment system? Are there
any incentives, perverse or otherwise, in that context? For example, if
somebody was a bit difficult at the lower level and if there
are large numbers, it might be convenient to move them up to the
probation service. Will that have an implication for the
funding?</hs_para>

amendment is to exclude anyone aged under 18 on the day of sentencing
from the new supervision period of one year by a new provider of
probation services, even after they have turned 18 and before the
detention period has come to an end. Currently, sentencing for
under-18s includes a detention and training order which requires the
young offender to serve half their sentence in custody and half in the
community. Only those sentenced to at least two years on a DTO are
required to do 12 months on supervision. However, the
Government’s new proposals are that all those young people will
be required to do 12 months on supervision, even if they have had only
a six-month DTO and if they are over 18 at the end of the custodial
period. Thus, they would be transferred from the YJB and YOTs to an
unknown private provider, with all the demands and expectation of
adults. That would run directly counter to current practice.</hs_para>

interest in and an admiration for the work of the Youth Justice Board,
whose work I have followed for many years and which is responsible for
the administration of services for young people in trouble with the
law. I am sure that your Lordships will not need persuading of its
levels of experience, professionalism and skill, which have been
developed and honed in working with this challenging and vulnerable
group, particularly in the past few years. Most of us have been parents
of adolescents but we cannot even guess at the breadth and depth of the
difficulties that characterise the lives and problems of this group.
They are young adults who, because of the date when they turn 18, are

quite different.</hs_para>

evidence is that this exceptionally vulnerable group of young people
have many issues, which we have rehearsed on these Benches regularly,
and which consist of multiple deficits in their difficult lives. They
need highly skilled, professional help if they are not to
get into even deeper trouble and increasingly make the lives of the
rest of us more difficult through reoffending. I will give just one
statistic to illustrate the counterintuitive vulnerability of this
group, which 
<?notus-xml column=694?>is that 18 to 20 year-olds account for about 9.8% of the custodial
population but nearly 20% of all who self-harm. These are very
vulnerable people. The YJB is the highly professional and specialist
body whose expertise is widely acknowledged in dealing with this group,
and for the range of collaborative work it does with other agencies
where issues and needs overlap, including family and children’s
services. It is impressive how these working partnerships have evolved
over time to address the complexity of the difficulties of these young
people.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062572000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000195">As
well as the range of offending, crucial to this age group in particular
is the skill in dealing with issues of transition. This includes the
process of moving from the youth justice system to the adult justice
system at a stage in the life of these young people when they are
particularly vulnerable. The YJB is quite clear when it says that this
is a high-risk group with significant needs that requires skilled
support from statutory agencies, in particular, from the probation
service. The Government have clearly acknowledged that management of
risk is where the probation service still has a clear role, and this
group is characterised by high risk. Managing transition and managing
risk go hand in hand, and I hope that the Minister can confirm that
this area, which has not been properly clarified so far, will indeed
continue to be choreographed jointly by the YJB, YOTs and probation,
which would be in all our interests.</hs_para>

where transitions are not appropriately managed, breach and reoffending
follow. The converse is also true: when good, expert partnership
working is in place, which is needs-led and flexible, especially at
times of transition, the time of heightened risk, outcomes are better,
breach is lessened and all of us are safer. The YJB is working towards
transition before 18 is reached and then beyond. It plans, it works
ahead and it knows what it is doing. It recently published an
impressive youth-to-adult transitions framework, which I am sure would
impress the Minister, and a youth-to-adult portal, which is used to
transfer a young person’s information securely from a
YOT to probation. Private providers are not legally able to
work with under-18s, even if they had the skills and experience, and I
reiterate that continuity and consistency are vital with this age
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062572000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0001.htm#13062572000197">When we

6 is a continuation of the argument I made earlier and relates
to the arrangements to be made for the supervision of offenders who
were under 18 when sentence was passed. It would mean that they would
automatically be the responsibility of the local youth offending team
until such time as they became 18, with the assumption hitherto that
continuity is all-important and that the YOT’s work would be
likely 
<?notus-xml column=695?>to continue. This amendment specifies that the
supervisor could be either an officer of a provider of probation
services or, for people sentenced as juveniles, a member of the youth
offending team. I hope that this amendment will endear itself to the
Minister because it opens up the possibility that there could and,
indeed, should be room for discretion in the supervision of
young adults. It implies some form of mutual discussion and planning
between the YOTs and the new probation service providers for the future
supervision of a young offender who has passed his 18th birthday. He is
already known to the YOT, which has done all the relevant work to
realise positive transitions in various relevant aspects of his life
and for whom his life is entering a potentially challenging and
difficult stage. Relationships are therefore all-important. This is an
area that has had very little examination, but the long-held assumption
has been that there will be as much continuity as possible, that plans
will already be in place to be carried through and that important
relationships will be established. It is to be hoped and expected that
these issues will be recognised and discussed and that planning will be
taken forward with the agreement of all parties. To do otherwise would
be to create damaging rather than helpful planning for the young
person. I am not aware of any discussion on this period of transition
involving these two agencies, yet it will be crucial that the
continuity of work with the young person, which has always been pursued
hitherto, is acknowledged and discussed and the vital discretion of the
youth offending teams is taken into account.</hs_para>

updated impact statement issued by the Government last week, and I will
discuss it on my next amendment. I would be grateful if the Minister
could clarify the Government’s thinking on this transition. What
is the view on continuity, planning, responsibility and relationships,

continuing provision by the Youth Justice Board for all young offenders
until the age of 21 and therefore continuity of provision, planning,
support and all the skilled input by the range of professional agencies
under the umbrella of the YJB. This what practitioners of all kinds

do not really understand or believe just what a challenge these young
people represent, what a real, deep-seated mess they are in and how
much time, care and persistence of support they need when they so
readily offend. They find change and transition of any kind very
difficult and many of them are immature and vulnerable. This is not a
short-term issue, but a complex, multifaceted range of issues that
takes real skill and persistence to turn around. Chris Grayling is
right that long-term support is necessary, but of a skilled and

issues, more likely to be unemployed and in general more likely lead
more chaotic lives. In absolute terms this difference is difficult to
quantify, but our best estimate is that offenders released after
serving custodial sentences of less than 12 months are, for
behavioural reasons, 35% more likely to breach than offenders released
after serving 12 months or more. Our lowest estimate is that they are
10% less likely to breach, and the highest estimate that they are 50%
more likely to

Ponsonby of Shulbrede:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the noble
Baroness, Lady Linklater, in the general thrust of her amendments. Her
introduction made clear the vulnerability of this group of young people
and its importance in terms of their being very likely
to reoffend. She also made the point very forcibly
about the excellent work done by the Youth Offending Teams, and that is
something which I see very

that currently the Youth Offending Teams can agree to continue working
with any young person who turns 18 while they are sentenced. They will
make that decision based on how well they know the young person. In my
experience, if they know them even relatively superficially, they will
commit to carrying on working with them for the very reasons that the
noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, has given, such as the benefits of
continuity and continuity of
supervision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000003">Perhaps
inevitably, I ask myself whether members of the youth offending team
should be obliged to work with these young people if they hardly know
them. I came across a case quite recently where a young man pleaded
guilty to robbery with a knife and was looking at a two-year sentence.
He had been in London for only a relatively brief time and was pretty
much unknown to the YOT which had the responsibility for him. Is it
right that the members of the team should have no discretion in whether
they have continuity of supervising this young man when they do not
know him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>?

practical
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:55:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I agree
with the noble Baroness’s general points that if there can be
continuity it is preferable. We need to give discretion to the
professionals involved. My experience is that they certainly will want
to continue supervision if at all
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:55:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Linklater, described Amendment 15, which gives the YJB
responsibility up until the age of 21, as “whistling in the
wind”. Here again, I agree with the sentiments behind this, but
can see a number of practical problems, not least that parents or
responsible adults are very often encouraged to be part of the sentence
process. That may well not be appropriate for somebody who is over 18
but under 21. One would have to look at the sentences if one were to

piece of work to be done looking at the outcomes of YOTs versus the

a more caring approach, if I can use that word, to the people they deal
with. The noble Baroness has raised a very profound question regarding
people in the 18 to 21 age group and I agree with the general thrust of

thing that worries me about the thought of the professional probation
service in future being responsible only for high-risk offenders is
that young probation officers are not going to have the chance to cut
their teeth on the low and medium-risk offenders on which they build up
the expertise which they can then go on to apply to the higher risk
offenders. One of the cases that is frequently quoted against the
probation service is the case of a man called Sonnex who murdered while
he was on probation supervision. He was under the supervision of a very
young and inexperienced probation officer who should not have been put
in charge of so serious an offender. I hope that the Minister will
reflect on this and on the importance of career development for the

4, 6 and 15 all relate to the supervision of young adult offenders. The
aim of Amendment 4 is to exempt offenders sentenced when they were
under 18 from receiving top-up supervision, even if they
were 18 or over when released from custody. Amendment 6 is, I
understand, an alternative approach to Amendment 4, because
it applies to those offenders who are under 18 when sentenced and
requires that such offenders may be supervised by a member of the youth
offending team<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:00:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
The last amendment in this group, Amendment 15, relates to
offenders subject to detention and training orders—or
DTOs—and, as I understand it, would apply top-up supervision to
offenders if they were 18 or over at the halfway point in their
sentence and they were under 21 on the last day of the supervision

the outset, I should say that we believe there are a number of
technical issues with these amendments, which I shall briefly
highlight. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, I am generally
sympathetic and understand totally the general thrust of the amendments
as tabled. Amendment 4 would mean that an offender 
<?notus-xml column=699?>sentenced when under 18 years of age, regardless of sentence and
regardless of their age on release, would not be subject to top-up
supervision. Although not part of the amendment, this would in effect
render Clauses 4 and 6 redundant, since they set out how offenders
turning 18 during custodial sentences are supervised. In response to
Amendment 4, I also stress that the Government believe that our
commitment to provide 12 months’ supervision should apply to all
those aged 18 and over when they reach the point when they would be
released from
custody.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000012">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:02:06"></hs_TimeCode>
all recognise that offenders who have just turned 18 can have different
needs from older adult offenders. The National Offender Management
Service has been developing and translating the evidence base to
support more effective targeting of interventions with young adults in
custody. We want to work with providers to ensure that their needs are
met as they move back into the community. When supervising young adult
offenders who have just turned 18, we will expect providers to
recognise this difference and tailor their supervision to the
particular needs of the group—and, as my noble friend
highlighted, they are particular needs. It is certainly in the
interests of providers to do so, because this is an important and
challenging group in terms of reoffending. To make a significant change
in the levels of reoffending requires us to tackle this group and
recognise the support they need as they transition into adulthood and
adult services. Young adults are at the peak age for desistance from
offending, and we want to ensure that they are given every opportunity
to desist
sooner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000013">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>
do not believe that supervision is a hindrance for young adult
offenders. In fact, the Government see this as a real opportunity for
real support for young adult offenders, not as something that they
should be excluded from. As my noble friend acknowledged, at this age,
young people as they transition to young adults are looking for greater
levels of support. Therefore, the supervision
element<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:03:23"></hs_TimeCode> will
surely assist them and provide an opportunity for that development. So
I hope that my noble friend can reconsider and withdraw this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000014">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:03:39"></hs_TimeCode>
6 offers an alternative approach. It also deals with the application of
top-up supervision. In short, it is designed to ensure that any
offender who was sentenced when under 18 and who is released aged 18 or
over, so is subject to top-up supervision, must be supervised by a
youth offending team—or YOT. I say this is an alternative
approach because, if Amendment 4 were to be adopted, no
offenders sentenced when they were under 18 would be subject to top-up
supervision. That said, I understand the thinking behind this
amendment. The fact is, however, that these offenders may under current
arrangements be supervised by probation
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000015">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:04:38"></hs_TimeCode>
the current arrangements, when the offender’s behaviour is
challenging or when there are additional offences yet to consider, it
can be agreed that it is more appropriate for probation providers to
supervise the offender on release rather than a YOT worker. This is a
decision that happens every day between probation and YOT
professionals, based on their professional expertise, taking account of
the interests of the particular

professionals’ expertise and their particular needs. It is that
professional expertise that we want to home in on. After all, who are
we seeking to assist but the young person, in ensuring that their needs
are met? We believe that this flexibility for dealing with young adult
offenders on release should be retained, because it is likely to
provide for the most effective ways to rehabilitate this crucial

in this group, I turn to Amendment 15, which relates to Clause 6. The
clause deals with offenders serving detention and training orders who
turn 18 before or at the halfway point of their sentence. The DTO is
the main custodial sentence for under-18s. It is imposed for a
fixed period of months, with the first half spent in custody and the
second half under supervision in the

as an aside, while I have not been involved from the

6 provides for top-up supervision for offenders serving DTOs who turn
18 before they are released from the custodial part of their sentence.
In this way, as with other adults on release, they will receive an
overall period of 12 months of supervision in the
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:06:39"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
not totally clear about the intended effect of this amendment, but it
appears from what my noble friend has said to be an attempt to carve
out a cohort of young adults who qualify for YOT supervision. As
tabled, it applies top-up supervision to offenders who turn 18 at or
before the halfway point of the DTO and would be under 21 on
the last day of the supervision period. The additional requirement in
this amendment, that the offender must be under 21 on the last day of
the supervision period, is unnecessary because, even if an offender was
sentenced on the day before their 18th birthday, given that the maximum
period of a DTO is two years, it is inconceivable that any offender
would be 21 or over at the end of the supervision period.</hs_para>

replacing proposed new Section 106B(1)(b) of the 2000 Act, the
amendment would also remove the exclusion of those offenders sentenced
to a 24-month DTO. That provision is important, because a 24-month DTO
includes 12 months of supervision, so top-up supervision is
unnecessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:07:51"></hs_TimeCode>. As
I said, I do not want to go into the technical details but, in short,
the Government believe that it is important that those sentenced to the
shorter DTO sentences who are 18 at the halfway point should receive an
overall period of 12 months of supervision in the community as we are
providing for other adult offenders. I stress again that it is the same
period of supervision, but it need not be the same type of supervision.

shall pick up on a couple of points that were raised during the debate.
My noble friend Lady Linklater talked about delivering top-up
supervision for those sentenced as juveniles who are turning 18.
Arrangements for supervision of young offenders on release from a DTO
are flexible, as I have already said, which allows for local agreement
as to the most appropriate provider of supervision. I assure her that
it will be tailored to the individual circumstances of the offender,
their age and the risk of reoffending—a point well made by the
noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby. The Bill provides for supervision top-up to
be delivered by either the YOT or probation
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:09:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000021">My
noble friend also referred to the issue around transition, which was a
very important point. I assure her that the Ministry of Justice, NOMS
and the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:09:24"></hs_TimeCode> Youth
Justice Board recognise that transition between youth and adult
services is a potential point of vulnerability for young people.
Indeed, we all acknowledge

The MoJ, the Youth Justice Board and NOMS are already working closely
together to help improve support for young people who are transferring
between the youth and adult justice systems. For example, in September
2012 the YJB and NOMS respectively launched the transitions framework,
to provide guidance for providers working with young people in the
community, and the transitions protocol, to guide those working as
custodial practitioners. Those promote better practice and aim to

However, the message that we have been given about flexibility is much
more important. It is important that inexperienced and new probation
providers are not brought into this scene. Transition is, of course,
fantastically important, as is professional expertise. Part of my theme
was that the combination of partnership working between various
professionals in the field—the YJB, the YOTs and the probation
service, and also other services working with families in the

to the life chances of those young people. If that is combined with

with Amendment 18, and I hope that I shall be in order in
addressing my remarks to both of them. Amendment 5 is in my
name, and Amendment 18 is also in the names of the noble Lords, Lord
Beecham and Lord Ponsonby. The two amendments deal with the particular
position of female offenders, and are designed to give effect to an
understanding that I hope is now generally accepted—that women
offenders undoubtedly have particular needs. They are—to echo
the words just used by the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad—a special
group, who need particular attention. I hope that the Minister will
feel that the amendments acknowledge what he has said previously during
the progress of the Bill about his concern about female offenders in
custody. He has expressed that concern eloquently, and I endorse what
he has said. I hope that he, in turn, has now come to accept that it
would be a significant move forward if a recognition emphasising the
requirements of female offenders were included in the Bill, which takes
a novel approach to dealing with the problem of

circumstances in which a court dealing with breach concludes that the

Government agree that it should be possible for courts to make a
recommendation to the Secretary of State and that there should be a
process for acting on that recommendation. This should apply whether or
not a court decides to impose a sanction for breach. In other words, a
court could impose a sanction and recommend that future supervision

explicit provision for this in the Bill would therefore be unnecessary.
It could be seen as restricting the discretion of the court to make
recommendations in other areas where no specific power exists. It could
also mean putting in place a new specific court process for making the
recommendation, rather than the relatively informal process that would
occur now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000046">To
my mind, the more important question is how we put in place a process
within prison and probation services for ensuring that a court’s
recommendation is acted upon by those setting supervision conditions on
the Secretary of State’s behalf. There is a precedent for this.
Probation and prison instructions already set out a
process for cases where courts make recommendations 
<?notus-xml column=706?>about future licence conditions at the point of
sentence. This involves probation staff present at court recording the
recommendation and passing it to prison governors.</hs_para>

should act on the court’s recommendation unless there
are exceptional circumstances. To make sure that courts are aware of
their ability to make recommendations to the Secretary of State, the
Government will also discuss with the Sentencing Council whether it

Councils, which has briefed me on this amendment, argues that there is
clear evidence from the Work Programme that commissioning
services from the market, when applied on a large scale and
managed on a national scale, can lead to low levels of engagement with
local partners and therefore low levels of effectiveness. Therefore,
the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that community safety
partnerships have a role in performance managing the future delivery of
contracts. There should be accountability measures within the
contracting process and action should be taken where providers fail
adequately to work in partnership at a local level. Community safety
partnerships should have access to performance data from prime and
subcontractor providers in order to have a local oversight

the London borough of Sutton, where this issue is
“bottom-up” but structured, there is a very interesting
partnership between the local authority and the police. The structure
is such that there is joint management of certain services provided by
those two parts of the public sector. Sutton tends not to go in for
strident self-publicity so it does not seem to have made very much of
this, but what it has done is extremely interesting. The joint
management whereby the two arms are brought together works well as
there is joint accountability. Whether or not that is a good example, I
take the point about the need sometimes to have a framework. It is much
better if that can happen locally but facilitation through legislation
does not go amiss. If the Government still maintain that there is no
need for this, are they considering issuing any guidance? I would

responsible authority, providers of probation services already
participate in this process. Nothing in this Bill will amend or change
the Crime and Disorder Act. Providers will need to demonstrate how they
will work in and strengthen local partnerships if they are to be
successful in bidding to deliver probation services. Specifically, we

However, I fear that some unintended consequences may arise from it.
The amendment would in effect mean that every provider of probation

participate in and be accountable to community safety partnerships and
other crime and disorder reduction partnerships. Different areas of the
country will have different partnerships, of different sizes and with
different challenges. The right approach is to look at this carefully

Ponsonby of Shulbrede:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 17
would make it possible for probation trusts to be able to tender for or
commission future probation service contracts. The Government have said
that it is open for probation trusts to convert to mutual status and to
bid on that basis. I understand that assistance would be provided to
trusts that wished to change their status into a mutual organisation in
order to bid for the contracts. A mutual organisation would need its
own financial backing and therefore any risk would be on the new
financial backers of the mutual organisation and not on the Government.
The Government argue that probation trusts as public bodies must not
take financial risks. However, as we have heard from my noble friend
Lord Beecham, there are many examples of government public bodies
taking financial risks. In this context, it has been deemed that they
must not take them.</hs_para>

to bid and win then of course the risk would be on their backers and
not on the Government. This begs the question as to why the Government
are unwilling to take on the financial risk. Do they believe that the
contracts will be too risky for the public purse? It also raises the
question of the need for the public probation providers to maintain
competition with private providers. We have seen in recent
years—I am thinking of the prison service—where the
public sector has bid and won contracts back from private providers. My
argument is that you need to maintain competence in the public sector
in order to keep the private providers

<?notus-xml column=711?>competition is maintained? It is very
difficult—I would argue impossible—to oblige people to
take on financial risk. The Government clearly want to offload their
own financial risk. The argument and the purpose of this amendment is

interesting developments have taken place, and I have no doubt that the
noble Lord is aware of them, including a veterans in custody support
scheme at HM Prison Everthorpe, which has links to service charities.
There is also something called the Prison In-Reach initiative. The
Cheshire probation service, interestingly, has a veteran support
officer in each of its six offices. I do not know whether that is one
for each or whether there is somebody available in each from time to
time. It is also looking at a veteran support programme. In
parenthesis, I wonder whether the Minister will ensure that such
initiatives will survive the very reforms that we were discussing
earlier today in a rather more contentious spirit than I hope will be
the position on this

League, having looked at the American experience, concludes that it is
not appropriate to adopt it here. It did that on the rather superficial
argument that veteran offenders should not, as a class, be treated any
differently in the system from other offenders. That underestimates
both the obligations that we have to this group of people and the
particular characteristics that they have. I do not see that it
necessarily follows that what is being proposed, which is, I repeat,
not a separate court to try the issue of guilt or innocence, but one to
deal with offenders who are not in prison, in a constructive way in
order to avoid their reoffending. The conclusion does not necessarily
follow from its analysis and I hope that it is one that the Government
will not adopt.</hs_para>

discussed in Committee, there are other examples of special courts, be
they domestic violence courts or drugs courts. It could be argued that
this proposal for a veterans’ court is an extension of that
concept; it is not hugely out of kilter with the rest of the structure.
In any event, I would urge that this group is important enough to
warrant at the very least a piloting of what has proved to be an
extremely successful process in the United States, with very
substantial reductions in reoffending rates, to the extent of 100%, as
I understand it, in Buffalo, which was an earlier one, and something
like an 85% reduction in reoffending in Minnesota. A number of American
states have passed separate laws about the treatment of their veterans.
We are not suggesting that that should be the case, but a framework
should be established within which their particular needs can be
addressed for their benefit, and indeed for the benefit of the
community.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062583000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000089">I
very much hope that the noble Lord will give his blessing to this and

other government departments, notably the Ministry of Defence and the

can be reached that will assist these people, help society as a whole,
acknowledge our debt to veterans and, at the same time, reduce the

draw the noble Lord’s attention to the military covenant. The
right honourable gentleman the Secretary of State for Defence has to
make a report at a prescribed time on the state of the military
covenant. In his meetings with various ministries to gather
information, I would have thought that the Ministry of Justice would be
paramount in the thinking and discussion to find out what the plan is
for young veterans who do not have or need a custodial sentence but who
need rehabilitation. What is the plan from the Ministry of Justice to
achieve this? I also remind the Minister that, with the coalition
deciding to get rid of 25,000 soldiers, this problem will get much
worse. There has to be a 
<?notus-xml column=716?>plan. All I am asking is that if the Minister still
does not wish to trial veterans’ courts, which I would be sad
about and which I consider probably the best way to move forward, the

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am particularly grateful for the way
in which the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, put forward this amendment and
for the contribution of the noble Viscount, Lord Slim. Both
contributions show the value of chats outside the Chamber; they bring
rich dividends. I should say to the noble Viscount that I still have my
doubts about veterans’ courts but I shall return to that later
in my remarks. I accept fully, and it was clear from the remarks of the
noble Lord, Lord Beecham, that there is no division between us about
our commitment to fulfilling the military covenant. As the noble
Viscount, Lord Slim, made clear, the Ministry of Justice has a positive
part to play in ensuring that in carrying out that covenant we address
the problems faced by ex-servicemen who fall foul of the criminal
justice system to see whether and where they need specific assistance
in
rehabilitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000093">I
am cautious because I think that we have to be clear about the nature
of the problem. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, referred to the American
experience and I am not afraid to look at where good ideas have worked
in the criminal justice system in the United States.</hs_para>

clear: a minority of offenders in the criminal justice system served in
the Armed Forces before being convicted. NOMS works with the Ministry
of Justice, the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Health to
ensure that ex-armed services offenders can access appropriate support
and rehabilitation
services<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. All
probation trusts routinely supervise and provide offender management
for former Armed Forces personnel sentenced to community orders. But on
the latest statistics available—this is why it is important to
get things into perspective—the number of regular veterans in
prison is estimated to be 2,820. That is about 3.5% of the prison
population. About 5,860 offenders in the community, approximately 3.4%
of community offenders, had served in the regular Armed Forces. In both
cases, more than 75% are ex-Army, the others being ex-RAF or
ex-Navy<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000095">In
prisons and in the community we are dealing with a very small number of
people. Another statistic that I have seen is that 99% of those are
men, which is not surprising. But that is the nature of this. However,

characteristics of this Government is that when someone has a good idea
we respond to it positively and
constructively<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
In a way, we are doing that immediately. I know that the noble Lord and
his honourable friend David Anderson MP, the Member for Blaydon, will
be meeting my right honourable friend Damian Green to talk about the

noble friend Lord Ahmad said in Committee, we are aware of concerns
about ex-service personnel in the justice system, but we need to make
clear that the vast majority of the men and women who served 
<?notus-xml column=717?>in the Armed Forces go on to lead successful
law-abiding lives. Indeed, it is often their experience in the services
that provides them with the necessary skills and ethos to succeed in
civilian life. But some ex-service personnel struggle in civilian life
and it is right that we do what we can to ensure that the transition
from the Armed Forces to civilian life is supported. I draw attention
to the good work that the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces
already do in this field, and the important work of the voluntary

those ex-service personnel who do end up in the criminal justice system

including addressing the particular needs of ex-service personnel. My
noble friend Lord Ahmad said in Committee that we would not bring
forward government amendments in the Bill to create a new
veterans’ court. I also want to make it clear that this does not
mean that we have ruled out a pilot of the veterans’ court. We

proposal is to create a body to divert, where possible, ex-service
personnel from the criminal courts or a criminal court with
specifically experienced judges—more akin to a drugs court or a
youth court—or whether it is a body designed to oversee the
rehabilitation of ex-service personnel offenders sentenced by the

acceptance of the notion that a trial should be made of the
veterans’ court concept. I appreciate that it is probably not
necessary for legislation for this purpose, but there has to be a peg
on which to hang the proposal and this was a suitable example for such
an exercise. Given that we are not talking about large numbers and that
it would obviously be sensible but not essential to pilot such a
scheme, and that the costs would be minimal, I find it difficult to
understand why the Government cannot say that they will look at all the
issues and give this particular concept a go to see what works. The
measure would be, as has been the case elsewhere, whether it results in
reductions in the reoffending rates.</hs_para>

than the military to operate the drones. Another factor is the
international and domestic criticism of secret detention, rendition and
Guantanamo. Killing has become a more attractive proposition than
making captures, but where does that leave the rule of law, about which
the world is so repeatedly lectured? Where does it leave the
credibility of the alliance? Where does it leave the society which all

the US has centred on the legitimacy of target killings and signature

target. However, it has been strongly argued within the US itself that
no US President should have the sole power of life and death over
civilians, whether US citizens or not, and that although the US can
target al-Qaeda suspects who are claimed to be beyond the reach of the
law on the basis of what they describe as legitimate self-defence, that
power must be subject to judicial and congressional oversight.

Tunnicliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Judd,
for tabling this debate. I wish that more noble Lords had taken part to
discuss this important issue. I also thank the Library for its
extremely useful briefing note. I agree with much of what the noble
Lord, Lord Judd, has said, but at the beginning I must state
categorically that we on these Benches believe that unmanned aerial
vehicles are a good thing, particularly in the military environment,
and that by a “good thing” we mean that we believe that
their value-added exceeds their risks. We agree with the noble Lord
that appropriate controls over their use are
essential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:35:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000126">In
essence, the noble Lord’s question is this: do we need a code of
conduct, along with regulations for the manufacture of and the
operation of drones, and should these be international? I shall touch
as quickly as I can on three areas, the first of which is safety. The
operation of drones in UK airspace raises three areas of concern:
collision; what we might call “terrain strike”, where
drones fly into buildings and so on; and the possibility of technical
catastrophe. Noble Lords will know that their computers are of a
generation that is more adolescent than mature: that is, they are
brilliant but they fail frequently. All these possibilities 
<?notus-xml column=723?>generate risk in the air environment, and any code of conduct or process
of operation in UK airspace must cover all these
risks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>. The risks
are a particularly difficult regulatory challenge because drones do not
have an established position in UK airspace at the moment, and
therefore safety could be assured by simply denying them access. That
makes it even more important that we understand the value that drones
provide, the risks that they present, and that there are appropriate
procedures to mitigate those
risks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000127"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:36:37"></hs_TimeCode>What
is the value of UAVs? The answer can be divided into two parts, the
first of which is what I would call observation, and the other is the
military delivery of lethal force. Observation can be secured by manned
platforms: helicopters and fixed-wing aeroplanes. What is special about
the drone in this observational area and what are the new challenges? I
contend that the potential for drones to be both cheap and small
introduces a new series of challenges for society as a whole. Because
drones are potentially cheap and small, they have the potential to be
both numerous and covert. The military use of drones for observation
and reconnaissance is unexceptionable. Armies, navies and air
forces throughout history have used all reasonable methods to secure
information about their enemies, and I believe that drones are but part
of that suite of capability. I do not believe that the military use of
drones in the observation and reconnaissance role is particularly
contentious.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000128">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>,
in the non-military role, the potential for problems emerges,
and we should address it. The non-military role divides into two: the
state and the private sector. In the state sector, there is the
potential for observational roles for the security services, the police
and some other services. As the briefing note points out, we have some
legal protections in the police and perhaps some in the security
services, but by no means are they comprehensive, so one of the areas
that has to be addressed is that of the whole suite of law covering
operations that the state must obey in the use of this new
technology.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000129">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:39:05"></hs_TimeCode>
the private use of drones, one can certainly see the potential for them
developing the inspection of hazardous environments and so on, but the
area of most concern to me is that of intrusion. The fact that it is
probably technologically feasible within a relatively small number of
years to have an affordable drone the size of an apple that has a
high-resolution camera in it means that there is a whole new potential
for intrusion in the private environment. We know that our present laws
are ineffective on intrusion by the press, and we are at the moment
agonising over that with respect to Leveson. Surely, this new area must
be included in those concerns to make sure that the whole
issue of privacy is considered when developing the codes of
conduct for these
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000130">The
final and most contentious area is the use of drones for the delivery
of lethal force. They are very effective in this role in uncontested
airspace. They are able to deliver force with great precision and are
therefore better than many other weapons that have defended us in the
past: they are not indiscriminate like cluster bombs, mines or even
modern artillery. They have the ability to loiter and be persistent,
which 
<?notus-xml column=724?>allows for high precision, smaller munitions and the potential for less
collateral damage. They also eliminate operator
exposure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000131">The
regime for their use essentially uses the manned platform regime, which
involves military advisers in all aspects, including targeting
and compliance with international law; there is a human decision-maker.
As far as we know, society is not contemplating autonomous use. All
those things are there. However, it is this very precision that causes
us to think about the drone and that brings home to us that it is about
damaging the enemy and killing them. Very usefully, the pack refers us
back to Robert E Lee’s

war has no risk to the aggressor, how do we ensure that we do not

note points out, it is the remote warrior that is at the centre of this
whole dilemma. The retention of the remote warrior as the stepping
stone, the filter, and the way in which the state’s use of
lethal force is used is absolutely crucial. We certainly, as I have

and that appropriate, politically accountable systems ensure that this
frightening delivery of lethal force by our remote warrior is properly
controlled. We agree that there is a need to look at new controls and
that, where possible, these should be developed internationally. We

overseen to a lesser, but proportionate, extent by the CAA but, in
certain circumstances, such as for commercial use, a permission is
needed. They are also subject to the Data Protection Act and the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. The noble Lord, Lord
Tunnicliffe, talked about intrusion. He will be aware that the
activities of Google also cause similar concerns and that this concern
is not unique to
RPAS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000137">The
House should not overlook the technological importance of the growth of
the remotely piloted aircraft sector. For example, systems which can be
used to detect other aircraft could, in time, greatly assist all
pilots, in the same way that aircraft transponders have contributed to
safety across the sector. I would point out that the UK’s
ASTRAEA consortium is at the forefront of international efforts in this
field. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, told the House about a wide range of
uses including anti-poaching operations. Noble Lords will have read the
article in this week’s <I>Sunday Times</I> about the use of RPAS
to assess the health of a vineyard in France—a very commendable
use, I would suggest. Surely, this is the start of yet another
technical revolution facilitated by the ubiquitous modern electronics.
The noble Lord, Lord Judd, is right of course when he says that
the potential for their development is
considerable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000138">The
overall objective of the Government and the European Commission is to
enable the full and safe integration of remotely piloted aircraft into
the total aviation system so that they share the same airspace as their
manned counterparts. With UK and EU input, the International Civil
Aviation Organization is currently developing RPA guidance material,
due for publication in autumn 2014, with standards expected about two
years later. Within Europe, the Commission’s RPAS roadmap,
published on Thursday 20 June 2013, is aimed at an incremental
integration of RPAS into European airspace from 2016. To achieve this,
there are a number of significant technical challenges to be overcome,
primarily concerned with ensuring the RPAS is airworthy and has the
capability to avoid collisions. However, until the technological and
regulatory hurdles can be safely overcome, operations of larger
remotely piloted aircraft will continue to be restricted to segregated
airspace. For these reasons, therefore, my view is that there is
already a suitable framework in place to regulate the operation of
civilian remotely piloted aircraft and that no additional codes of
conduct are
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000139">I
now turn to the military element, which I suspect is of more concern to
the House. Although the MoD operates a number of unmanned aircraft
systems, Reaper 
<?notus-xml column=726?>is the UK’s only armed remotely piloted aircraft system and its
only operational use is in support of UK and coalition ground forces in
Afghanistan. Although predominantly used for intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance tasks, the aircraft is also armed with
precision-guided weapons, which offer an attack capability if needed by
ground commanders. The system is operated by highly trained, skilled
and qualified RAF pilots in accordance with the principles of
international humanitarian law and the UK’s rules of engagement,
which are identical to those used by crews of manned combat aircraft.
That applies even for joint operations with US
forces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000140">The
UK’s selection and prosecution of all targets is based on
rigorous scrutiny. Targets are always positively identified as
legitimate military objectives and every effort is made to ensure that
harm to civilians or damage to civilian property is minimised. The
Government have a longstanding policy of not divulging the detail of
our rules of engagement; that would give our adversaries useful
information about how and when we might choose to use lethal force. I
also gently remind the House that the pilots operate under military
discipline. Similarly, the RAF has well established command, control
and supervisory frameworks that I have seen on exercise. I do
not believe that anything extra needs to be provided
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000141">The noble
Lord, Lord Judd, suggested that the UK military has 500 RPAS. However,
there are currently only five armed RPAS. Of course, rather smaller
RPAS are used for tactical surveillance. The use of remotely piloted
aircraft systems is no different from other airborne or indeed
ground-based attack systems. The only difference from a traditional
aircraft is that their cockpits are on the ground. The systems can only
launch their weapons when specifically commanded to do so by the pilot.
They do not have the capability to launch any weapons autonomously. In
addition, there are no future plans to replace military pilots with
fully autonomous systems. I know that that is a matter of great concern
to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and the whole House. The MoD has no
intention of developing any weapons systems to be used without human
involvement. Although the Royal Navy has defensive systems such as
Phalanx that can be used in an automatic mode, to protect personnel and
ships from enemy threats like missiles, a human operator oversees the
entire engagement. Furthermore, all our remotely piloted aircraft
systems used in Afghanistan to protect troops on the ground are
controlled by highly trained military pilots. There are no plans to
replace skilled military personnel with fully autonomous

noble Lord touched on the perceived disadvantages of the military use
of RPAS. As of 20 June, the UK Reaper RPAS has employed 394
precision-guided weapons. There has been only one known incident that
resulted in the deaths of civilians. On 25 March 2011, an
attack on two pick-up trucks resulted in the destruction of a
significant quantity of explosives and the deaths of two insurgents
but, sadly, four Afghanistan civilians were also killed. In line with
current ISAF procedures, an ISAF investigation was conducted to
establish if any lessons could be learned or if any errors in
operational procedures could be identified. In that case, the report
concluded that the actions of the Reaper crew had been in accordance
with extant procedures and rules of
engagement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000146">The
noble Lord, Lord Judd, asked if the UK had conducted any targeted
killings and whether the UK uses the ICRC definitions of combatants and
civilians. Her Majesty’s Armed Forces will engage the enemy in
accordance with international humanitarian law and the UK rules of
engagement. The necessity and legality of engaging the target does not
depend on the means of doing so. The noble Lord stated that we either
uphold the rule of law or we do not. He is right. I can confirm that
Her Majesty’s Government uphold the rule of law. How the US
Government conduct themselves is not a matter for me to comment on and
I have already touched on joint US/UK

noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, talked about the remote warrior. Our
experience of operating the Reaper remotely piloted aircraft system in
Afghanistan suggests that Reaper aircrew are just as if not more
connected to the situation on the ground when compared to 
<?notus-xml column=728?>operators of other aircraft types. That is because they fly missions
over Afghanistan for years at a time and not in short-duration
rotations. Remotely piloted aircraft can loiter over areas of interest
for a considerable time, providing that much-valued intelligence
picture. I remind the House that surveillance is their primary role.
Should an attack be requested, their persistence enables them to assess
a target in detail and select an optimum time for attack that
minimises the risk of civilian casualties. Indeed, because of this
increased awareness of the ground situation, enabled by the
connectivity that a ground-based cockpit offers, there have been many
occasions when crews have elected not to fire a
weapon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062583000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-0002.htm#13062583000148">I will

companies—AOS, BAE Systems, Cassidian, Cobham, Qinetiq,
Rolls-Royce and Thales—plus a further 70 SMEs and universities.
The aim of the programme is to enable the routine use of UAS in all
classes of airspace without the need for restrictive or specialised
conditions of operation. The £62 million programme was split
into two phases, each lasting three years. Phase 2 ended on 31 March
2013. Some 50% of the funding came from industry partners, with the
remainder from government—the TSB and the regions. Future

highlighted the importance of foreign airlines being included in the
“Stop the Clock” system. The Council then took note of
the Presidency’s progress report on negotiations on the
Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases proposal, with the Commission referencing
the recent US-China agreement on hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). On the
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive, the Presidency

Substances have the potential to pose serious risks to public health
and safety. Despite often being marketed as legal alternatives to
controlled substances, users can have no certainty of the health risks
that will arise from using them, nor the legal status of these
substances.</hs_para>

psychoactive substances poses challenges due to the rapid development
of new drugs. The UK published an NPS Action Plan in May 2012 which
committed us to a range of measures to address the threat, including
galvanizing international partners and institutions to meet this global
challenge.</hs_para>

leading role in meeting this challenge and building international
partnerships. Over the past two years we have successfully led two UN
resolutions to foster international action and collaboration. We have
also taken the opportunity of the G8 Presidency to progress our
response to this threat with other G8 member states, the UN and the EU.
We are engaged in a very positive exchange, sharing our understanding
of the market and different approaches to protect the public and
exploring opportunities for collaboration going forward.</hs_para>

information among international partners on the emergence of new
substances, their impact on public health and the supply routes is
invaluable in addressing the challenge. I am pleased to inform
Parliament that the G8 have agreed a Statement of Intent to progress
our close joint working on this. The statement is available on the Home

4 December 2012, during the Adjournment Debate on the position of the
Visteon pensioners, I announced that I would be conducting a review of
how the Pension Protection Fund compensation cap operated, particularly
in relation to those who have been members of a pension scheme for a

Government accepts that the PPF compensation cap could have a
disproportionate effect on some people who were members of a scheme for
a long time. As a result, I propose that the compensation cap will be
increased by 3 per cent for every full year of service above 20 years.
There will still be a maximum, which will be double the standard
cap.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062569000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130625-wms0001.htm#13062569000027">It is my

compensation cap will not be backdated: anyone covered by this change
who is already in receipt of capped compensation will get
any increase from the date the relevant legislation is in place. The
revised cap will also affect any scheme that does not enter
the PPF, but only where it begins to wind up or enters the
PPF assessment period after the revised cap is introduced.</hs_para>

example, a person who has been a member of a
pension scheme for 40 years and had accrued a pension of £50,000
would, if they took their compensation on reaching age 65 today, be
paid a capped amount of £31,380. Following my proposed change,
this person would see their compensation increase to
£45,000.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="101"><?date 2013-06-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_25_PT_1/8209AC8986B627B7096537F72A08E09E4308C39F" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 June 2013">Tuesday

in NHS England's ambition to ramp up the pace and scale of change, and
deliver better outcomes for patients across all five domains of the NHS

Warsi:</Member> Ahrar al-Sham likely formed in late 2011 as an
independent anti-regime fighting group and formally announced its
existence in February 2012. Its stated goal is the removal of Syrian
President Bashar Assad and the establishment of an Islamic state. The
Al-Farouq battalion is a Homs based anti-regime fighting group. We have
limited information on its goal beyond the removal of Assad. Jabhat
Al-Nusrah or Al-Nusrah Front (ANF) is a UN designated terrorist group
active in Syria. ANF was designated as an alias of AQ-I and has
publicly sworn allegiance to AQ leader AI-Zawahiri. We draw a clear
distinction between extremist groups and the moderate opposition,
including the Syrian National Coalition and the Supreme Military
Council led by General Idris. These groups have rejected and condemned
all forms of terrorism and any extremist ideology or
mentality.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">
