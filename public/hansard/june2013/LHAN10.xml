the current loan book now stands at close to an estimated £40
million and no fewer than 22% of students from overseas are either not
paying or have disappeared, and that involves a figure of no less than
£50 million. What are the Government doing about this failure to
repay by students who have taken loans, not least because if no further
action is taken, that figure of £50 million will rise well into
the hundreds of millions due to the recent increase in student

debt that students are accruing, but I would again stress that they
will begin to contribute back for what they have gained from their
university education only after they graduate and are earning a salary.
We will be monitoring the effect on students from disadvantaged
backgrounds. I would also point out that there are very generous forms
of mean-tested grants for students, while many universities have
instituted

noble Lord says, because substantial numbers of students are still
applying for university. There was of course an increase last year when
people applied early, ahead of the new scheme, but the figures we are
getting back from the higher education authorities show that the
numbers going into higher education are still holding up. We very much
hope that the new fee structure will not be a deterrent; in fact, it

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, a paper in the Library produced by the
Government forecasts a major increase in defaults on student loans to
40% of the total. The two main causes appear to be non-payment by
people from overseas—certainly not just Europe—and, more
particularly, students not earning enough to meet the requirement to
repay. Will the Government consider two options to address these
problems? First, it is quite difficult to set up banking arrangements
to repay

Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> The answer to my noble friend’s
last point is yes. However, his point on vocational training is
slightly wide of the Question that we are discussing. Most of the loans
from the Student Loans Company go to UK-based students or students from
other EU countries. We have set up much more effective systems for
ensuring that payments come through from bank systems and other
assurances. He is absolutely right that most of the people who do not
repay are those who go into very low-paid jobs. However, the percentage
of students who do not entirely repay their loans tends to be higher
than the percentage of the total value of the loans repaid. The cost to
government will still be less than if the same money were given in the
form of a

undergraduates, the coalition Government introduced non-means-tested
tuition fee loans for the first time in 2012. We have asked HEFCE to
continue monitoring changes in part-time demand and supply, and we are
working with Universities UK on its review of part-time study, which
will identify barriers to participation by prospective part-time
students and offer practical advice. Our communications activity for
2013-14, including our student finance tour, will include activities
specifically targeted at part-time

an interest as the president of Birkbeck. The increase of university
fees in 2012 led to a dramatic downturn in part-time studies, which

education, with benefits to employers, individuals and the economy,

Birkbeck is one of the tremendous organisations, along with the Open

that the messages that go out to the different universities and

encourage them to take advantage of the finances that are available. He
is quite right that the older students may well be more cautious, but

regulating the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. Again, in response to this
consultation, we have heard various parts of the legal profession
harping on about the worst-case scenario, which we simply do not
accept. We are in consultation and have put forward proposals about
legal aid contracts. However, the legal professions are facing a number
of changes, irrespective of what we are proposing on legal aid—a
point I have made before from the Dispatch Box—and they will
have to adjust to the new circumstances if they are going to survive.
We are consulting with the Law Society and Bar Council, and with other
bodies and individuals. We are listening and we hope to get a solution
that will reflect what the Government can afford to pay on legal aid at
the moment but that will also leave us with the protections for our
legal aid system that many of us have taken pride
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T14:57:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

when we came in, a spending review took place that asked for 23% cuts

legal aid, courts services and staff. All five of those have had to

the Carter report had a look at this matter. It is more than three
years since the previous Labour Government made cuts to criminal legal
aid. The Labour Party, in its 2010 manifesto, was the only party to say
that it would look for further cuts in legal aid. In that time there
have been changes—alternative business structures and other
changes—to the legal profession, yet we are still told that this
has come as a surprise. Instead of asking for more time and
putting forward arguments that are mainly scare
stories, it would be good if the legal profession

of the victims have been Muslims? I will put the evidence for that in

gathering of grand muftis and others agree to issue a fatwa against the

heard, violent religious extremism is not simply an issue for Muslims.
In the Inter Faith Network we were constantly reminded, through other
faiths across the world, that millions of people suffer from violent
extremism, often for political purposes and not religious ones.
Secondly, does the Minister agree that, while there is of course a
responsibility on those of us who lead religious and political
organisations, there are other factors, such as how foreign policy is
perceived, that send signals and triggers to people that it is very
difficult for leadership on its own to deal with? Therefore, there has
to be a partnership between religious and political leaders and those

violent extremism. The latter cannot be justified in any way in terms
of the former. I completely agree with the right reverend

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a huge privilege to be
leading on this important Bill, which will make marriage of same-sex
couples lawful in 
<?notus-xml column=938?>England and Wales. I will go into detail shortly, but I want to be clear
from the outset that this Bill is not just about allowing same-sex
couples to marry; it is also about protecting and promoting religious
freedom. It is not often that we get to debate and decide legislation
that affects people’s lives so directly. This Bill addresses
things that matter to all of us: our personal freedoms, our faith in
what we believe, and the acceptance of who we are and who we love.
Perhaps I should declare from the outset that I am not married, and as
long as George Clooney is still available I am prepared to wait. But
even though I am single—and I of all people understand that not
everyone wants to get married—I believe in the institution of
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000071">Like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:11:51"></hs_TimeCode>
many other people, whether married or not, I believe marriage to be one
of the fundamental building blocks of a strong society because of the
stability, continuity and security that it promotes. I admire couples
who make the big decision to marry. Marriage remains, as it has for
centuries, the way in which most people choose to declare their
commitment publicly and permanently to the person they love. When we
hear two people exchange their marriage vows, whether in a place of
worship or at a registry office, we know that we are witnessing a
couple commit to the kind of values that we associate with the special
enterprise of shared endeavour—loyalty, trust, honesty and
forgiveness. We know that through marriage existing families are
extended, as is their commitment and support to new family members. We
think that is a good thing, and any of us can choose to do
this—unless, of course, we happen to love someone of the same
sex<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:12:28"></hs_TimeCode>. This
Government think that is wrong, and we want to put it right. So much do
we believe in marriage and its importance to our society, we want all
couples, whether gay or straight, who are prepared to affirm publicly
their commitment to each other and all the responsibility and joy that
comes with it, to be free to
marry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000072">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>
people argue that civil partnerships have provided same-sex couples
with equality already, and allowing them to marry is not needed. They
are right that civil partnerships provided equivalent legal rights.
Indeed, the progress made by the last Labour Government in advancing
gay rights was massive, and I salute them for all that they achieved. I
am grateful to the Labour Front Bench for supporting this Bill. But in
2004, Parliament did not provide same-sex couples with the equal
opportunity to marriage itself; back then, we could not conceive that
society would allow it. So instead a separate legal regime was
established just for same sex-couples. Marriage, the exchange of vows,
and all that that means, remained available only to men and women
prepared to make that commitment to each other. Less than 10 years on,
independent polling, all of which is included in the House of Commons
Library research paper on the Bill, shows that the majority of people
in this country are now ready to open up marriage to everyone. Indeed,
support is growing all the time, and we are not alone; change is
happening around the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:14:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000073">As
to my own party’s position, in 2006, at the first Conservative
Party conference after he became leader, David Cameron voiced his
support for marriage and equated the commitment of same-sex couples
with that of opposite-sex couples. In 2010, the Conservative 
<?notus-xml column=939?>Party made it clear that it would consider the case for equal marriage
in its document <I>A Contract for Equalities,</I> which was published
alongside the election manifesto. In 2011, David Cameron said, to wide
applause at the Conservative Party conference, that he supported
same-sex marriage because he is a

Government have decided to take this step to allow same-sex couples to
marry because we believe that doing so really matters. Gay and lesbian
couples being allowed to marry—to join the institution that
they, too, recognise as important—matters because it marks the
final acceptance of who they are. Allowing same-sex couples to marry
and not separating them out from the rest of society matters to
families. For parents especially, it means peace of mind. A gay son or
daughter will be able to aspire to the same things as their straight
brother or sister and be recognised and respected equally.</hs_para>

same-sex couples to marry also matters to all of us who believe in the
institution of marriage. Marriage, this vital element of our social
fabric, stands a much safer chance of remaining important to future
generations if we make sure that it reflects modern society. We believe
that marriage will become nothing but stronger if we open the doors to
couples who are currently excluded only because they happen to love
someone of the same
sex<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:15:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000076">The
Bill provides a new freedom for same-sex couples to marry, but theirs
is not the only freedom that concerns us. The Bill also protects and
promotes religious freedom. That is why, as well as allowing same-sex
couples to marry in civil ceremonies—in register offices and
approved premises such as hotels—the Bill takes an entirely
permissive approach to religious marriage ceremonies. It will be for
religious organisations to decide for themselves whether they wish to
marry same-sex couples according to their rites. Some have already said
that they will; these include the liberal Jews, the Quakers and the
Unitarians. In this way, the religious freedom of these organisations
and perhaps others in the future is promoted by this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Equally,
no religious organisation or individual can be forced to conduct or
participate in a religious marriage ceremony of a same-sex
couple. The religious freedom of those organisations and individuals is
protected. The Government’s public consultation in 2012, which
prompted nearly 230,000 responses and became the largest of its kind
ever, was important in informing our approach. Since we published our
proposals in December last year, we have discussed this permissive
approach with a wide range of religious organisations, and I am pleased
to report that they are generally content with the protection provided
in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:17:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

carefully crafted to contain each element of the quadruple lock which
the Government committed to last December and which I outlined to this
House when I repeated the Statement by my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State at the time. Because it is so important, I will
explain the quadruple lock again. First, it
ensures that the Bill states explicitly that no religious organisation
or individual minister can be compelled to marry same-sex couples 
<?notus-xml column=940?>or to permit such a marriage to take place on their premises; it
provides an opt-in system for religious organisations which wish to
conduct marriages for same-sex couples; it amends the Equality Act 2010
so that it is not unlawful discrimination for a religious organisation
or individual minister to refuse to marry a same-sex couple; it ensures
that the duty on the clergy of the Church of England and the Church in
Wales to marry parishioners will not extend to same-sex couples, and
that Anglican canon law, which says that marriage is a union for life
of one man with one woman, is
unaffected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:18:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000078">I
turn now to other rights that we all have and will continue to have
because they are not affected by the Bill, most specifically the right
to freedom of expression. Some people are concerned that the Bill will
impact on freedom of speech, that people such as teachers—or,
indeed, anyone while at work—will not be able to criticise
same-sex marriage. I can reassure the House that this Bill does not in
any way affect the perfectly legitimate expression of the perfectly
legitimate belief that marriage should only be between a man and a
woman. Teachers will be expected to teach the factual and legal
position when teaching about marriage, as with any area of the
curriculum, but they will not be expected to promote or endorse views
that go against their own beliefs. It will be unlawful to dismiss a
teacher purely for doing
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000079">That said,
and as noble Lords would expect, the expression of personal beliefs
should be done in a professional way and not in a way that would be
inappropriate or insensitive to pupils, some of whom may be gay,
transgender or the children of a same-sex couple. We are clear that the
existing protections for teachers are sound. However, we are, of
course, aware that these concerns exist. As the Minister for Sport and
Tourism explained in the other place, we are continuing to discuss
those concerns further with religious groups to ensure that we have
done all we can to put the position beyond doubt. The same is true for
employees generally and what they say about same-sex marriage, whether
at work or
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:24:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000080">Freedom
to express beliefs about marriage is not affected by this Bill.
Discriminating against someone because they believe, or express the
view, that marriage should be between a man and a woman only is
unlawful under the Equality Act 2010. Article 9 of the European
Convention on Human Rights also guarantees the right to freedom of
thought, conscience and
religion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:20:41"></hs_TimeCode>. At the
same time, I must make it equally clear that it is not acceptable for
an employee to act in an offensive or discriminatory way because of
someone’s sexual orientation. It is wholly wrong to persecute
someone for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. It is not
wrong for someone to say that they do not believe in same-sex
marriage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:21:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Some
people have also expressed concerns that the religious protections in
the Bill could be successfully challenged, whether before domestic
courts or the European Court of Human Rights. We are confident that the
protections are robust and effective, but rather than my talking about
this in detail now, other noble Lords far more expert than I in these
legal matters will no doubt wish to offer their views during the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the Bill and to some of the changes already made during its passage
in response to our engagement with religious organisations and others.
Part 1 allows same-sex couples to marry and provides the religious
freedoms and protections I have already mentioned. Part 2 enables an
individual to change their legal gender without having to end their
marriage. Part 2 also contains an important new clause—Clause
14—added during Commons Report stage by a government amendment.
This requires the Secretary of State to arrange for a review of the
options and future of civil partnerships in England and Wales. With the
Government’s agreement, this clause was amended to require that
the review will begin as soon as practicable and will include a full
public consultation. I am pleased to tell the House that the Government
are already preparing for this review and will publish its terms of
reference before
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:22:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000082">Other
changes made by the Government in response to issues raised include
fine-tuning the religious protections in specific areas, such as to
protect the position of chaplains employed by secular organisations and
the Church of England’s ecclesiastical law. We have clarified
the arrangements concerning Scotland and Northern Ireland and made
changes to improve fairness—for example, in relation to pension
rights where a married partner has changed legal gender. Even though
the Government have already made changes to the Bill, we continue to
listen to concerns and are, of course, willing to consider further
changes if necessary to make the protections clearer. Indeed, I should
say that I, along with my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace of
Tankerness, my noble friend Lady Northover and the Bill team officials,
with all of whom I have the pleasure of working, will be glad to listen
to the concerns of Peers and others with an interest in the

speak in support of same-sex couples who want the opportunity to marry
because, very simply, this Government consider their love and
commitment to be no different from that of opposite-sex couples. We
believe that same-sex couples should be able to marry if they want to,
and that extending that choice is the right thing to do for them and
for the future of marriage. If we want future generations to support
marriage, we need the institution to reflect our modern inclusive
society. I know that many noble Lords will also speak in support of the
Bill today and I am grateful to them, but I also respect those who
disagree with me. I understand that many who do not support same-sex
marriage do so on the grounds of religious principle. To them, I would
point to the religious freedoms which the Bill protects and promotes
and say this: no religion or faith will be required to change its
doctrines or practices because of the Bill if it chooses not

some noble Lords are unsure whether to support this measure for a range

paces when faced with change, but to those who feel unsure let me say
this: same-sex marriage is new and different from what we have known up
to now and I am not trying to say it is not. However, this
change—allowing same-sex couples to marry—will not affect
the nature or quality of existing marriages

opinion and the views of religious leaders and blind to the laws of
unintended consequences. It seeks to alter totally the concept of
marriage as we have always known it, it seeks to divide a nation with
an argument that hides behind the concept of equality when in reality
it is about sameness, and it stands on its head all considerations of

am conscious that around 90 speakers await their turn to speak today

elements of the arguments against the Bill but take, in turn, four
things: the concept of the rule of the majority; the impact of the Bill
on society; the flawed process that it has undergone so far; and, last

appropriate to vote the Bill down at Second

question of the extent to which a civilised society should accede to
the wishes or the desires of a very small minority in its midst. In the
debate on the humble Address on 9 May this year, an impassioned
reference was made to the plight of homosexuals in Uganda and in other
repressive regimes. This seemed to suggest that, if we were to defeat
the Bill, this country could quickly regress to a state something
approaching that in Uganda and elsewhere where homophobia is prevalent.
Nothing could be more fanciful and nothing could be further from the
truth. Like many other Members of your Lordships’ House, I have,
for many years, championed the extension 
<?notus-xml column=943?>and the protection of minority rights, including homosexual rights and
equality, and I have seen and applauded this country’s change of
attitude towards homosexuality, from thinly veiled intolerance 50 years
or so ago to a position of understanding and acceptance
today.</hs_para>

of civil partnerships, we have seen the legal rights of homosexual
couples put on a par with those in a conventional marriage, with all
the financial benefits available to both groupings. Indeed, those in a
homosexual civil partnership are significantly better off in that
respect than family members who live together without the benefits of
such a partnership. Doubtless, we shall hear more of that as the debate
progresses—more about the two sisters living together or the
elderly parent and the unmarried daughter in the same household. All
those are of course unable to enjoy the same financial benefits
available to those in civil partnerships. In that respect, homosexual
equality has outstripped equality for those in family
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:30:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the argument is much more about the lengths to which a society should
go in order to embrace the demands from very small minorities. The
utilitarian approach of Jeremy Bentham—the greatest good for the
greatest number, where a simple majority carries the day—was
challenged first by John Stuart Mill and then by other theological and
jurisprudential writers in the 19th century. Very sensibly, it has been
moderated over the years to a point where any society wishing to be
thought of as civilised, tolerant and mature is judged by the degree to
which it can accept minority views, even when those views fail to
accord absolutely to the norms and views of the majority. However,
there must come a point when, provided full equality for all under the
law is guaranteed—this, I suggest, is perhaps the nub of this
argument—the majority view should prevail, especially when the
minority is tiny and the overwhelming majority is affronted. It is all
a question of balance, wisely, and not least sensitively,

redefining marriage could well turn out to be counterproductive because
tolerance can be overstretched. Look to contemporary France for an
example. The similarities with this country are numerous. France has
much the same population as our own, is still coming to terms with a
revised role in the world, has an old and enduring national religion,
has financial problems, and its leadership is questioned. Same-sex
marriage has recently been forced through the French parliamentary
process, with the result that mass demonstrations, and occasionally
riots, have taken place in major cities in that country. Worse, the
incidence of serious homophobic violence has markedly increased. I do
not foresee violent street demonstrations in this country but I fear
that the Bill, should it become law, could well create such opposition
to homosexuals in general that the climate of tolerance and acceptance
in this country that we have all championed, supported and seen
flourish over the years could well be set back by
decades—certainly for a long

headline form only, let me pose a question or two. What is the impact
of the proposed legislation on society? A change in the law would
herald uncertainty in a number of areas, rather than certainty, and I
will touch only briefly on those aspects 
<?notus-xml column=944?>now, confident that the other 90 or so speakers who follow me will
explore some of these issues in much greater depth. Marriage between a
man and a woman has been a part of life for centuries, predating
nation, church and law. The lifelong commitment of a man and a woman is
part of our history and culture. Evidence abroad, for example in Spain,
shows that a redefinition of marriage actually undermines support for
marriage in the wider society. There, marriage rates have plummeted.
Noble Lords may advance their own theories as to why this has occurred
in Spain and elsewhere but the facts are there for all to see and it is
reasonable to conclude that redefining marriage is a contributory
factor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000094">In the
field of education very real fears exist that teachers who fail to
endorse same-sex marriage could be dismissed. The Minister touched on
this and other similar issues. Government reassurances that this will
not be the case have been challenged as naive by leading counsel.
Parents will not have a legal right to withdraw children from lessons
that endorse same-sex marriage in the curriculum. The effect on schools
will undoubtedly be divisive, and we should reflect on the fact that
calls have already been made for children to act out gay weddings in
class<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:34:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I have to
hand an opinion by leading counsel, prominent in employment law, who
concludes that the Bill would create a duty to promote or endorse and
not just to explain the new definition of marriage in sex education.
Furthermore, he advises that schools could discipline teachers for
failing to teach positively about same-sex marriage alongside opposite
sex

divisions exist—and they do—we should ask to what extent
the Government have considered the totality of the problem. In a matter
as fundamentally important and potentially so contentious as this, one
could reasonably have expected any Government with pretentions at
governing by consensus to have conducted deep and thoughtful research
before drafting legislation. This Bill is hallmarked by the very lack
of such an approach. A royal commission, or other similar learned
group, might have been expected to call on the very best minds from the
fields of theology, philosophy, sociology, jurisprudence and finance in
order to take a long look at all the implications, to identify the pros
and cons and to make mature recommendations.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:37:31"></hs_TimeCode> Government
did nothing of the sort. Instead, they seem to have relied on old,
often partial, research and 
<?notus-xml column=945?>opinion that give only a fragmentary picture of the problem. There was
no royal commission; no committee of inquiry; no mention of the Bill in
any party manifesto prior to the last general election; no report from
any parliamentary Select Committee. The Leader of the Conservative
Party, questioned on Sky television only three days before the general
election, declared that he had no plans for such a Bill. There was no
Green Paper, no White Paper and no pre-legislative scrutiny. It was not
included in the Queen’s Speech either last year or this year.
However, after its introduction a few months ago, the results in the
recent local elections were catastrophic. Around 450 seats were lost by
the coalition parties, with all the analysis showing that the Bill was
a significant factor in the swing of voters away from the main
parties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000098">The

consultation exercise was about how to introduce the changes and not
whether to do so. To put it bluntly, the results were rigged. The
figures given by the Government indicated a total of 228,000 responses,
with 53% said to be in agreement with the Bill and 46% against
it—about even, tilting slightly towards approval for the Bill.
However, that ignored two critical facts. First, the responses in
favour were largely collected on the internet—anonymously, with
no check as to whether the respondents were resident in the UK and no
check on multiple entries from single respondents. Secondly, the
Government accepted a signed petition collected by the Coalition for
Marriage and arbitrarily counted it as one vote, deliberately ignoring
the fact that it contained 509,000 verifiable signatures. That petition
has now grown, I am told, to 660,000 signatures, although at the time
of its closure there were, as I said, 509,000 verifiable signatures.

vote at Second Reading. Understandably, some noble Lords have queried
whether it is proper to challenge a Bill in this way at Second Reading
in your Lordships’ House. I fully understand that question and I
recognise and support the proud and long-standing tradition in this
House to take particular care over every aspect of any Bill and to give
it a full and fair examination before voting. However, that holds good
only in normal circumstances, and the circumstances that we face today
are abnormal. I am advised by the clerks that it is perfectly proper to
vote on Second Reading. The 2006 Joint Committee on Conventions
affirmed that the House of Lords retains the power to reject government
Bills in free-vote situations. Votes against a Bill at Second Reading
are unusual but they are not unknown. Examples that closely parallel
these present circumstances are the War Crimes Bill and the Sexual
Offences (Amendment) Bill, both of which occurred just over 10 years
ago but both were free-vote issues without a mandate from a manifesto.
The Health and Social Care Bill in October two years ago is the most

we can do it, and have done it, why oppose the Bill at this stage?
Quite simply, I contend that the Bill is in a mess. It is ill
thought-through, lacks support in the population as a whole and is
likely to antagonise, or even inflame, public opinion. It has nothing
to do with equality, which is already in place with civil partnerships,
and it attempts to dignify an admittedly very small minority of
partnerships with the description “marriage”—a
term that has been understood differently for
centuries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000105">If
that were not enough, there is more. This House is asked to debate and
examine a Bill that has not yet come anywhere near identifying all the
consequences of change. The official government estimate of the numbers
of amendments to existing legislation that would follow should the Bill
become law is, in their words, at least 8,000 and they are still
counting. It is no good telling me that there is provision in the Bill
to take care of that, because the experience in Argentina, where
similar legislation was passed in 2010, is chilling. In a paper
provided by Dr Ursula Basset for the Pontificia Universidad
Católica Argentina, she explains the changes now being debated
in that country, which passed legislation similar to that which is on

manuscript amendment. How can we be expected to consider turning the
law of marriage on its head without taking full account of the
implications of heterosexual civil partnerships as well? If we must

many other couples, was to grow old together and to support each other

we were married increased our resolve to make our relationship work,
and it was the framework within which we wanted to raise our children.
Of course, I have friends who are single and who are great parents, and
friends who have lived together for many years and who are wonderful

people ask why the Bill is necessary when we already have civil
partnerships—often, I have to say, the same people who opposed
those partnerships when we introduced them in 2004. Civil partnerships
were a fantastic step forward and continue to be a great source of joy
and security, but some people wish to choose marriage. It has a special
status in our society, both historically and symbolically, and it
represents a very particular value that the state has placed on the
relationship. I well understand that this Bill has caused anguish for
some people of faith who have concerns either because of the impact of
the Bill on their faith or on the grounds of faith. I respect all
genuine concerns—although clearly not those that are rooted in
homophobia—and I am sure that our consideration of this Bill
will be conducted with our usual tolerance, respecting our differences.
I have to say, however, that I simply do not understand those who say
that equal marriage can harm or undermine marriage between a man and a
woman. Surely if we value and cherish marriage, we should want all

has been much discussion about whether there are sufficient protections
for religious organisations. Just like equality, freedom of religion is
central to a human rights-based society. That is why it is vital that
the Bill does not impose an obligation on any faith group to conduct
same-sex marriages. The Minister has spoken in detail about the
quadruple lock and we are satisfied that the protections the Government
have put in place in the Bill are sufficient to ensure that no faith
group will be at risk of a human rights challenge for refusing to
solemnise same-sex marriage. Naturally, this House will carefully
scrutinise the protections contained in the Bill for religious freedom.
I welcome that, and I look forward to the contributions of the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, and my noble friend Baroness Kennedy, who were
crystal clear in their evidence to the Public Bill

that the Bishops now warmly support civil partnerships and I have read
of the Bishop of Salisbury’s endorsement of same-sex marriage.
Both are matters to be celebrated. I have also had excellent
discussions with some right reverend Prelates in which we agreed that,
from their perspective, the Bill would not result in the sky falling in

a panacea for relationships, be they gay or straight. I also take this

week, while thinking about the Second Reading, I watched “The
Times of Harvey Milk”. I wept at what one might call a chilling
reminder of the pain and suffering that gays and lesbians endured a few
short years ago—their lives blighted by society’s
attitude towards their sexuality. That was 1970s America, but in the
1960s in this country people were locked up or punished for loving
someone of the same sex. The Conservative Government introduced Section
28 in 1988 and it was not repealed until the Labour Government came to
power. We had a proud record in making progress against discrimination
and in favour of equality, 
<?notus-xml column=950?>and I am grateful for the generous comments of the noble Baroness. As
well as civil partnerships, we equalised the age of consent, ended the
ban on LGBT people serving in our Armed Forces, made homophobia a hate
crime, outlawed discrimination in the workplace and in goods and
services, and did much more. The measures were controversial at the
time but now have widespread

have come a long way, but there still needs to be a cultural shift. The
Bill is not only hugely important for same sex couples who wish to
marry, and for transgender people who are in a marriage; it can play a
critical role in driving attitudinal change. As noble Lords are aware,
20,000 homophobic crimes are still committed in this country every
year, and many children suffer homophobic bullying. They are not just
children who may be growing up to be gay, but those with lesbian or gay
parents. Ninety-five per cent of secondary-school teachers have
reported hearing anti-gay language in their schools. The Marriage (Same
Sex Couples) Bill will be a useful tool in tackling these attitudes. It

encourage society to celebrate the identity, relationships, commitment
and love that lesbian and gay people

are some outstanding issues in relation to the Bill that were raised in

we called on the Government to come forward with an immediate review
into the implications of equalising pension rights, and we will urge

importantly, I refute the noble Lord’s suggestions about support
for the Bill. The latest YouGov polling shows that 71% of people
support same-sex marriage, including three out of five people of faith.

respect of the composition of the Public Bill Committee and the

the committee’s membership represented the very heavy Commons
vote in favour of the Bill at Second Reading. In terms of e-mails and

trust that following the detailed and careful scrutiny that this House

discrimination and extending the dignity and joy of marriage to

relationship, such as that of two sisters, then existing marriage laws
are unfair. I think we all understand that relationships which adults
enter into voluntarily are wholly distinct from relationships which are
determined by consanguinity. If family members could become civil
partners, it would be really easy for a bullying parent or sibling to
force a member of their family into a relationship simply in order to
protect property. I do not think that any of us want to legislate for

according to their personal beliefs, who does and does not receive a

I and many of my colleagues retain considerable hesitations about the

of Oystermouth, showed clearly last summer in evidence to the
consultation that it contains a series of category errors. It confuses
marriage and weddings. It assumes that the rightful desire for
equality, to which I have referred supportively, must mean uniformity,
failing to 
<?notus-xml column=954?>understand that two things may be equal but different. As a result, it
does not do what it sets out to do. Schedule 4 distinguishes clearly

result is confusion. Marriage is abolished, redefined and recreated,
being different and unequal for different categories. The new marriage
of the Bill is an awkward shape, with same-gender and different-gender
categories scrunched into it, neither fitting well. The concept of
marriage as a normative place for procreation is lost. The idea of
marriage as a covenant is diminished. The family in its normal sense,
predating the state and as our base community of society, as we have
already heard, is weakened. I am sure that these points will be
expanded on by others in the debate, including those from these

these and many other reasons, those of us in the churches and faith
groups who are extremely hesitant about this Bill in many cases hold
that view because we think that traditional marriage is a cornerstone
of society, and rather than adding a new and valued institution
alongside it for same-gender relationships, which I would personally
strongly support to strengthen us all, the Bill weakens what exists and
replaces it with a less good option that is neither equal nor
effective. This is not a faith issue, although we are deeply grateful
for the attention that the Government and the other place have paid to
issues of religious freedom. However, it is not at heart a faith issue.
It is about the general social good. Therefore, with much

the noble Lord’s speech is frankly nonsense. I believe MPs have
the authority that comes from their election and which they retain as
long as they are MPs. Much is said 
<?notus-xml column=955?>about public opinion, and we have heard it already, but we should
recognise that they and they alone are answerable to the public on this
issue and not us in this House. We cannot take over that role; that is
not our position. I thought that this was exactly the case some of us
were putting a few months ago to avoid the prospect of two elected
Houses standing side by side.</hs_para>

grounds—I also strongly believe in the Bill itself. Parliament
should value people equally in the law and enabling same-sex marriage
removes a current inequity. I believe that there are many gay and
lesbian couples who want more than civil partnership, although it is
something of a wonder to me to see how civil partnerships have suddenly
become so popular among those I do not remember supporting them up
until now. We should recognise that there are many deeply religious gay
and lesbian couples, including people in the church, who want the
commitment that marriage offers. This Bill, rather than weakening the
institution of marriage, strengthens it, and our purpose as a

their contempt for gay people and violence against them is the result.
I have particularly seen equality denied in countries in sub-Saharan
Africa such as Uganda. For several years there was a popular paper
there whose sole purpose was to expose gay people, photograph them,
give their addresses and invite the violence against them that

Kennedy of The Shaws:</Member></B> My Lords, this issue raises a great
deal of passion because it touches on things that we all care about:
equality, human rights and our religious beliefs. The noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, and I were invited before the committee that examined this
Bill before its passage through the House of Commons. We were asked to
present a legal view on the likely success of any challenge to the
special protections being given to religious organisations—the
churches and so on—in the Bill. We both took the opportunity to
speak to legal organisations, to colleagues in the law and to people
who often took different positions and different sides on many issues
concerning rights. We were both firmly of the view that the protections
provided by the Bill to churches, religious organisations and church
ministers are strong and should reassure this House that there is no
real risk of a successful challenge.</hs_para>

is no obligation whatever on religious organisations to host gay
marriages if they do not wish to do so. The legal position is that it
is permissible but absolutely not required in law. Any requirement on a
church, religious organisation or minister to conduct same-sex marriage
contrary to the religious convictions of its members would violate
Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The protections
of that article are very strong and any analysis of the jurisprudence
will show that the desire to maintain those protections is strong. The
case brought by the Muslim community against the Bulgarian Government,
which went all the way to the European Court of Human Rights, laid down
an important principle: the autonomous exercise of religious freedoms,
and that exercise by religious communities, is indispensable for
pluralism in a democratic

then, is this Bill going through? It is going through because over my
lifetime as a practitioner in the law we have seen a huge change in the
position of gay people in our communities. It is interesting to note in
this House, where the average age is above 60, that people above the
age of 60 express the greatest concern about any change in the law.
People under the age of 60 by and large favour this change. You have to
ask yourself why that might be. I think it is because of the growing
tolerance in our society and the desire to see people treated as equals
regardless of race, sexuality or gender. That is something that we
should cherish and see as an enormous achievement for our

Dear<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
articulated it at the beginning of the debate. Of course, initially the
idea was that marriage was about protecting property and making claims
on children, and its purpose was to produce and provide a framework for
the protection of property and in which children could be raised in a
decent and wholesome way. That conception of marriage came into being
before we knew as much as we now do about the human condition. We have
now separated 
<?notus-xml column=957?>out the sexual act for the purposes of procreation from the sexual act

have children. We know those—there are many in this
House—who, on the death of their partner, have gone on to marry

have to ask ourselves whether some of the reasons and rationales for
maintaining something are not disguising other concerns. We have
changed the meaning of marriage. We have changed it intentionally to be
inclusive and to make it possible for people who want to make a
commitment in love to another to be able to enter into this public
declaration in the way that we do. We must also remind ourselves what
it is touching upon. It is touching upon the desire in most human
beings to love and be loved. It is part of the whole nature of our
humanity. That people, gay or straight, should want to do
that—to declare it in the presence of those they consider to be
their community and to be part of the whole that is our
society—is surely an advance on marriage as it is currently
constructed. It means that, in fact, we are enhancing rather then
diminishing the meaning of marriage.</hs_para>

these few comments I say that, having reviewed the law, Article 9 of
the European convention—which protects religions—is about
the needs of community and society, and how they have to be balanced
with individual needs. In doing that, the churches can have the
protection that they have so earnestly sought from the Secretary of
State. However, we are also strengthening our society by giving the
right to marry to those who earnestly want it and want to be able to
live openly and publicly in a declaration of love. I submit to the

support.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/769A2024467D0126F5883BC4633FED7DBDBCFDCA" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, last month it was wonderful to hear the
general acclamation in the House for the First Reading of
the Alan Turing (Statutory Pardon) Bill. It was the first time in my
brief two and a half years in your Lordships’ Chamber that I
have heard such a response to the First Reading of a Bill.
It demonstrates how societal attitudes towards
homosexuality have moved on over the past 60 years. It was brought home
to me five years ago when my husband and I celebrated our silver
wedding anniversary and two close gay friends invited us to their civil
partnership, with a date chosen to mark 25 years of their private
commitment to one another. Over that 25-year period they have been
harassed and attacked, and are so cautious still that they would rather
that I did not mention them by name. That ceremony was a moving event,
but it was not marriage; it was a legal arrangement 
<?notus-xml column=958?>that helped provide them with certain protections, but it was not the
commitment that you have with marriage. I support civil partnerships
but believe that marriage should be available to those who want to make
that greater
commitment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:30:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000158">The
core of marriage to me as a Christian—and, by the by, as a
member of the Church of England—is that the commitment made by
two people of their undying love to each other, through good times and
bad, through sickness and health, stable and faithful, as the most
reverend Primate the Archbishop mentioned, is a building block of our
society. I respect those for whom the theological arguments are core to
their beliefs and practice but, frankly, I struggle to find those
arguments expressed by Jesus himself in the New Testament. I also want
to quote from the letter of the Bishop of Salisbury, who I suspect will
be quoted frequently today. He

desire for the public acknowledgment and support of stable, faithful,
adult, loving same sex sexual relationships is not addressed by the six
Biblical passages about homosexuality which are concerned with sexual
immorality, promiscuity, idolatry, exploitation and abuse. The
theological debate is properly located in the Biblical accounts of
marriage, which is why so many Christians see marriage as essentially
heterosexual. However, Christian morality comes from the mix of Bible,
Christian tradition and our reasoned experience. Sometimes Christians
have had to rethink the priorities of the Gospel in the light of
experience”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13060312000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000220">He

Waddington:</Member></B> My Lords, surely the noble Lord,
Lord Dear, was correct to start his speech by saying, in graphic
language, that this Bill is about imposing an entirely new meaning on a
term as familiar and fundamental as “marriage”.
Throughout history, in all countries and cultures, marriage has been
the union of a man and a woman; and although not every married couple
have or want children, the core function of the
union has always been the procreation and joint care of children. Over
the years, of course, there have been changes in marriage law, but
throughout history there has been no change in the essential nature of
the institution—the union of a man with a woman. It has never
been a matter of gays being banned from marrying. It was never even
thought remotely possible that the term could be applied to two people
of the same sex. Now we are told that it is unjust to treat same-sex
and opposite-sex relationships differently, but surely it is no
disrespect to anyone, just common sense, to point out that we are
talking of two types of union which are indeed
different—entirely different. From the obligation to care for
any children, and to consummate the marriage or face a decree of
nullity, to the commitment to sexual fidelity, with the threat of
divorce on the grounds of adultery, there is no way in which the union
of a man and a woman, with all these serious implications, can be
compared with the wish of a couple to see their partnership publicly

theme which appears to drive the Bill’s opponents. The noble
Lord, Lord Dear, referred to what he described as centuries
of tradition and the concept of marriage as we have always known it,
and the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, made similar points.
This is to treat the law of marriage like the law of the Medes and the
Persians which, according to the Book of Daniel, chapter 6, verse
8—the devil can quote scripture—“altereth
not”. The reality is that the law of marriage in this country
has altereth a lot. It has altereth a lot from time to time according
to changes in social conditions and social attitudes. The noble

1907, a man could not marry his deceased wife’s sister. Prior to

prohibited degrees were removed in 1931. All of this information is in
the valuable <I>Halsbury’s Laws of England</I> edited by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. The Gender
Recognition Act 2004 allowed a transsexual to marry in his or her
acquired sex even though, I remind the noble Lord, Lord Waddington,
procreation is plainly not possible in such circumstances. The minimum
age for marriage has been altered from time to time; the law related to
the validity of non-Anglican marriages has developed over time; the law
of divorce has been amended from time to time; other incidents of
marriage have been the subject of change. Until case law in the 1990s

religious bodies to conduct same-sex marriages contrary to their

we both gave oral evidence on this subject to the House of Commons
Public Bill Committee. I explained my view that there was no realistic
possibility whatever that any court, domestic or European, would compel
a church or other religious body to conduct a same-sex marriage
ceremony contrary to the doctrines of that religious faith. The reason
is very simple: under this Bill, a same-sex couple will be able to
enter into a civil marriage. Their only reason for wanting a religious
ceremony would be to gain a religious benefit. All, and I mean all,
case law confirms that courts will leave religious bodies to decide on
the allocation of religious benefits. None of the other legal concerns
raised by the opponents of the Bill seems to have any basis

Lord Bishop of Leicester:</Member></B> My Lords, having conducted some
400 weddings as a parish priest, making the journey with couples as
they anticipate a lifelong commitment has been one of the great
privileges of the ordained life. I have witnessed personally the
stability, fulfilment and anchor for life for so many, which has been
transformational. However, I have also observed that the open and
public recognition of gay relationships that civil partnerships now
provide displays many of the very qualities for which marriage itself
is so highly celebrated. I speak as one whose respect for and
appreciation of gay clergy is deep and who recognises in them
sacrificial lives and fruitful ministries. I also recognise the need
for some humility at this moment in speaking on matters of equality
from these Benches. I add my appreciation to that of the most reverend
Primate for the way in which the Secretary of State and her colleagues
have tried to accommodate the Church of England’s concerns at
every point in this process. I entirely endorse what the noble
Baroness, Lady Kennedy, and others have said about the need to continue
to make progress on the inclusion of gay people in our society, and I
entirely accept what the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has said about
change and development in our understanding of the institution of
marriage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:51:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reasons why are shared by many who do not hold the Christian faith and

does not resolve the decades-old debate about when undeniable
differences between men and women matter and when they do not. Modern 
<?notus-xml column=963?>political discourse tends to recognise as public goods only things that
can be equally appropriated by any given individual, regardless of
difference. This involves a difficulty in entertaining notions of
public rights and obligations that might pertain to one sex rather than
the other, or to one sexual orientation rather than another. As
Professor John Milbank has written in a paper for the ResPublica think
tank:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13060312000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000232">“The
risk of this exclusive focus on individual rights is that the needs and
capacities of people in their specific differences, which may be either
naturally given or the result of cultural association, tend to be
overridden. And so it is that injustice can arise in the name of
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:53:19"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13060312000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000186">I
could not help noticing in the debate in this House on International
Women’s Day the underlying assumption that women bring a special
quality to the public square and that the complementarity of men and
women is what enriches and stabilises society. Yet, in the realm of
public discourse, assertion of sexual difference in relation to
marriage has become practically unspeakable, in spite of the fact that
it is implicitly assumed by most people in the course of everyday life.
Equal marriage will bring to an end the one major social institution
that enshrines that
complementarity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

introduced in haste, has not allowed enough time for a weighing of
gains and losses to the well-being of society. Do the gains of meeting
the need of many LGBT people for the dignity and equality that
identifying their partnerships as marriage gives outweigh the loss
entailed as society moves away from a clear understanding of marriage
as a desirable setting within which children are conceived and raised?
In traditional Christian societies, the price you pay for getting
married is, in principle, a heavy one—sexual fidelity till death
us do part and, for some, a responsibility for the socialising and
educating of children. As the ResPublica paper on this subject pointed
out:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13060312000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000233">“As
people become more and more reluctant to pay that price, so do weddings
become more and more provisional, and the distinction between the
socially endorsed union and the merely private arrangement becomes less
and less absolute and less and less

sociologists regularly observe, this gain in freedom for one generation
may imply a loss for the next. Regardless of the best intentions of
advocates of equality, if we detach the procreation of children as
being one of the core purposes of marriage, then no social institution
enshrines that purpose for the generations ahead. This is not, of
course, to say that those who cannot or do not wish to have children
are any less

as others have said, there is a difficulty here in the use of language.
Put simply, there are two competing ideas of marriage at play in this
debate. The first is perhaps traditional and conjugal, and extends
beyond the individuals who marry to the children they hope to create
and to the society they wish to shape. The second is more privative,
and is to do with a relationship abstracted from the wider concern that
marriage was originally designed to speak to. As the most reverend
Primate has pointed out, this category error lies at the heart of this
Bill as

deciding whether to give this Bill a Second Reading, I have to ask
myself several questions. Is it clear that it will produce public goods

<?notus-xml column=964?>that outweigh the loss of understanding of marriage as we have known it?
Has the debate in the country and in Parliament been conducted in a way
that will enable our society to adapt wisely to a fundamental social
change? At a time of extreme social pressure, is this innovation likely
to create a more cohesive, settled and unified society? Lastly, at this

have homosexual proclivities as it is to condemn them for having red

had through e-mail and other communications, I have identified three
clear lines of argument against the Bill. The first I can deal with
very briefly. There have been references to homophobia: I am afraid
that some of the messages I have received actually reek of homophobia.
I was reminded of some of the arguments advanced when Parliament
abolished the criminal liability for homosexual conduct between
consenting adults. There were those same dreadful arguments, deeply

second argument is one that has been referred to several times in this

referred to their anniversaries. Last year, my wife and I celebrated
our diamond wedding, and I have to say that it has been a marriage with
mutual comfort and support. Is this Bill going to redefine that
marriage? I cannot see how that could possibly happen. I was grateful
to my noble friend on the Front Bench for confirming that nothing in
this Bill will redefine our marriage or indeed those of the other 24
million married people in this country. One has to regard that argument
as really quite misconceived. As others have said, it is not irrelevant
that there is a great deal more support for the Bill among young people
who are facing marriage, are about to get married or hope to get
married than there is among the population generally. They do not see
it like that. One has only to think of the possibility of the following

<?notus-xml column=965?>happening. A young man poses the question to his intended, “Will
you marry me?” and she replies, “Oh no. This Bill has
made it all totally different. It’s for gays and

I have been rather more impressed by, and which again has been
mentioned, is the question of the potential liability and difficulties
for people, particularly in the public service, who find themselves, in
a sense, implementing the provisions of the Bill in one way or another.
A number of people, including some of those who have expressed support
for the Bill, have voiced these concerns to me, and that is
something that this House will need to look at quite carefully. I was
very much comforted by the assurance given to us by my noble friend on
the Front Bench that Ministers are considering what more might be done
to allay those anxieties. I regard that as very

the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester. I hope that he will
not feel it is unfair if I call him my “old friend”, as
indeed he is. I have come to the firm conclusion that there is nothing
to fear in gay marriage and that, indeed, it will be a positive good
not just for same-gender unions but for the institution of marriage
generally. The effect will be to put right at the centre of marriage
the concept of a stable, loving relationship. As a practising
Christian, perhaps I may make the point to the Bishops’ Benches,
including to the most reverend Primate, that there is every reason why,
in time, the Anglican Church should come to accept that, although I
recognise that it may take some time. The character of love which
marriage reflects—that it is faithful, stable, tough, unselfish
and unconditional—is the same character that most Christians see
in the love of God. Marriage is therefore holy, not because it is
ordained by God, but because it reflects that most important central
truth of our religion: the love of God for all of
us.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/AB57AED033B635A8EF3DDA3D2717D25CB1C1EA5D" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, some tend to label anyone
who opposes this Bill as part of a group of homophobic bigots. Once
that is said, the argument has stopped. As a Labour Peer, I wholly
dismiss that—I find it insulting. I note, for example, that some
key elements of the homosexual lobby, including Stonewall, have come to
support same-sex marriage only in the fairly recent past. For me, there
is a clear distinction between anti-discrimination, which I support,
and seeking an absolute equality, which I oppose. I recall that as a
young barrister I was saddened to see before the courts a trail of men
whose lives and careers had been ruined by the then law. I am also glad
that the legal discrimination which existed has been removed by the
Civil Partnership Act. If there are deficiencies, they can be met by
amendments of the Act itself to further protect same-sex
couples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000200">Today,
proponents of the Bill appear to argue on the basis of equality, but
equality is not an absolute good. I am not a Roman Catholic, but saw
this same false reasoning employed against Roman Catholic adoption
agencies. Reasonable compromises were cast 
<?notus-xml column=966?>aside by zealots in the name of equality. The juggernaut rolled on. The
result was that children lost out, as those caring agencies were forced
to
close.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000201">In
this case, the good in question is the institution of marriage, which
has never yet been changed. Of course there have been changes in the
law of marriage, but nothing as fundamental as this change to the
institution. Marriage as traditionally defined is the union between a
man and a woman. A bedrock principle, it relates to the rights of
children and their need to know their identity, and is a generational
bridge between the past and the future. Its fundamental position in our
law is well illustrated by the number of statutes that will have to be
changed if the law is now passed. The Bill seeks to make equal that
which is not equal. The relationship between a man and a woman is
unique. Same-sex relationships are different. Perhaps we should seek to
find another name for them, if same-sex couples seek dignity. Thus
there is the problem with this Bill of dealing with first, adultery,
and secondly, non-consummation. In the Bill, same-sex couples are not
required to take account of these criteria, but are still deemed to be
married.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000202">Some
argue, as we have just heard from the noble Lord, that love between any
two people is a decisive consideration: “amor vincit
omnia”. However, love is not everything. The law of marriage
discriminates on grounds of age and affinity: you cannot marry a
parent, sibling or child, or marry someone who is already married. Why
exclude these categories in the new definition? Hence, in the
Netherlands, a court has endorsed a three-way cohabiting contract. In
Brazil a three-way union has been allowed. Today, the borders are
clear. Where, then, are the new borders as one sets out on this path?
There will be increased pressures for polygamy. In short, marriage
should surely not be available for everyone, even if they love one
another. The state cannot lightly modify the meaning of words that have
stood the test of time, as with Orwellian
Newspeak.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000203">The
Government announced their proposals in March last year. There was no
manifesto commitment, Green Paper or White Paper, and very inadequate
consultation on the “how” and not the
“whether”. There is no evidence of substantial demand,
although there would be some pent-up demand at first. There is no
evidence of claims that the change would strengthen the family or the
institution of marriage. There is no evidence that the Government, in
their haste, have examined the effects of the change in other
countries. There is no evidence, either, of any serious attempt to
protect conscientious objectors, teachers, social workers, registrars,
foster parents, or churches which use public halls for
worship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000204">Why
the hurry? If the Government were so attached to the principle of
equality, they would have changed both institutions—marriage and
civil partnership—from the outset, and would not have been
forced into a messy last-minute deal to ensure the passage of the Bill.
This is not the way to deal with a hallowed institution that has been
fundamental to civilised societies from time immemorial. A French
philosopher, who was a disciple of Rousseau, once observed that our
Parliament can do anything save change a man into a 
<?notus-xml column=967?>woman. This Government appear to think otherwise—or at least that
Parliament can change traditional gender
relationships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000205">We
know that Mr Cameron likes consulting the people in referendums.
Indeed, not only has he promised an “in or out”

this proposed change is far more fundamental to our society than any
transfer of power to Brussels. Therefore, I challenge him to call a
referendum. He and his friends will put their case for yes, while many
of us—Labour, Conservative and Cross-Bench—will be on the

is the word that means a union of a man and a woman. Same-sex couples
have a yearning for equality. Initially, they want to attach their

between a man and a woman is different from a union between two women
or two men. I believe that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
communities should have the confidence to establish their own
institution. What they lack is the lexicology to establish and name
their own institution, which will be respected and accepted. I believe
that, in time, LGBT people will regret attaching their unions to
heterosexual marriage. Soon they will say, “No, we are
different. We want be different and we need to create our own
institution”. Like a flag, a motto or a name, they need to find
their own terminology, their own symbols to express their

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand very well
the unease that many of your Lordships feel about this Bill. I was

corners and any hint of its expression resulted in expulsion. Our
understanding of homosexuality is undoubtedly the biggest social change

own change and understanding came about when I realised—for
example, through reading the biographies of gay people—that
often, from a very early age, they had found themselves predominantly
attracted to members of their own sex, not just physically but as whole
persons. While some people are bisexual and there is a degree of
fluidity in the sexuality of others, we know that for a significant
minority their sexuality is not a matter of choice but as fundamental
to their identity as being male or female. That is a fact that must
bring about a decisive shift in our
understanding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000213">The
question arises as to how the church and society should respond to
this. Both have an interest in helping people live stable lives in
committed relationships. For this reason, many of us warmly welcome
civil partnerships, not just because of the legal protections that they
rightly afford to those who enter into them but because they offer the
opportunity for people to commit themselves to one another publicly.
Personally, I take a high view of civil partnerships. The idea of a
lifelong partnership is a beautiful one. I deeply regret that the
Church of England has not yet found a way of publicly affirming civil
partnerships in a Christian context. I wish that it had warmly welcomed
them from the first and provided a liturgical service in which the
couple could commit themselves to one another before God and ask for
God’s blessing upon their life together. If only the church had
made it clear that although these relationships might be different in
some respects from the union of a man and woman, they are equally valid
in the eyes of the church and, more importantly, in the eyes of
God.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000214">Sadly,
too many who now say that they accept civil partnerships have done so
only slowly, reluctantly and through gritted teeth. Today we are not in
a situation where civil partnerships are regarded as different but
equal to marriage. Rightly or wrongly, the impression 
<?notus-xml column=969?>is inevitably created that one form of relationship is inferior to the
other, and people believe that marriage is a profounder and richer form
of relationship than a civil
partnership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060312000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0001.htm#13060312000215">Most
importantly, many gay and lesbian people believe this and want to enter
not just into a civil partnership but a marriage: a lifelong commitment
of love and fidelity, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in
sickness and in health. Marriage affords legal advantages that are
denied to civil partnerships, such as their legal status in many
countries, but that is not the main point. The point is that those who
wish to enter into this most fundamental of human relationships should
be able to do so legally. I am aware that this involves a significant
change in our understanding of marriage, but marriage has never had a
fixed character. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, eloquently pointed out
that its legal meaning has changed over the years; and no less
significantly, its social meaning has changed.</hs_para>

among the upper classes, marriage was primarily a way of controlling
titles and wealth. Among all classes, it involved the radical
subservience of women. Often it went along with a very lax
attitude—by males, not females—to relationships outside
marriage. Contraception was forbidden and this resulted in many
children, and as often as not the wife dying young. Only in the 18th
century did we get a growth in emphasis on the quality of the
relationship of the couple. Now, this mutual society, help and comfort
that the one ought to have with the other, in prosperity and adversity,

start where the Statement did, with the EU summit and the conclusions

transfer pricing, tax havens and other issues, so we welcome the steps
forward on transparency. However, do the Government agree that we need
proposals for fundamental reform of the corporate tax system to prevent
profits being shifted from one country to another? Seeking
international agreement is clearly the right way forward but there are
measures, including measures on transparency, which could still be
introduced if agreement were not reached. Will the Leader of the House

turn next to the devastating violence in Syria, which continues
unabated. I share the deep concern set out in the Statement about what
is happening. The number of Syrian refugees who have fled the conflict
has now reached 1.5 million, half of whom are children. As so often
happens, the most vulnerable continue to 
<?notus-xml column=973?>pay the price for war. This is a situation where there are no good
options. The question is: which is the least worst option? Despite the
enormous obstacles, we believe that a comprehensive peace deal still
remains Syria’s best chance of ending the two years of violence,
and support American and Russian efforts to bring Syria’s
warring parties around the negotiating table this month in Geneva. The
peace conference is due to take place in the coming weeks but the
Statement did not refer to it. I would be grateful if the Leader of the

settlement, its success must not be put at risk. In light of this, can
the Leader of the House explain the Government’s view of the
risks that lifting the EU arms embargo may pose to the prospect of any
peace talks? The Government say that there are safeguards on the use of
those weapons. Can the noble Lord therefore set out to the House what
those safeguards are? However well motivated, is not the danger of this

intervention to prevent young people being radicalised? Will he also
confirm whether the task force will heed the calls from youth workers
to look more carefully at the links between violent extremism and
gang-related activity—something which was raised with my party

absolutely right to say what he said about that. With regard to
transparency on tax matters, that is one of the main issues that my
right honourable friend the Prime Minister will be pursing at the G8.
He has made it one of the three legs he is pursuing in terms of the

taxation, does this not demonstrate that, far from the European Union
involvement getting in the way of global agreement, as some people

that the EU’s role is very
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:45:16"></hs_TimeCode>. On
Syria, I echo the thrust of one of the questions from my noble friend
Lady Royall. The country is swimming in arms—coming from this
side and indeed an escalation tit-for-tat from Moscow. How is the
option of sending more arms and that degree of armed support potential
for the Syrian National Coalition squaring and compatible with us
wishing to be seen as an honest broker at the conference in Geneva?
Maybe there is a simple answer. I would be very glad to hear
it.</hs_para>

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> I am not sure I will be able to give as
simple an answer as the noble Lord would like. On his first point
though, he and I may be in agreement. The EU can certainly help to play
a part in this, as can the G8, the G20, the OECD and all the rest. With
regard to arms for Syria, I emphasise again that no decision has been
taken to send arms into the conflict. As I said to the noble Baroness,
Lady Royall, it is clearly the case that the Government’s
desired outcome, as it must be everyone’s, is that there should
be a negotiated, peaceful, diplomatic solution. Lifting the embargo, we
would argue, gives the Governments of EU member states the flexibility
to bring pressure to bear on Assad to realise that the negotiated route
is the way forward he needs to take. I agree with the noble Lord that
if it is at all possible to secure that outcome that is the one we

reassured and have a renewed sense of trust when we see the support
that has come out from all sectors of the community for the family and
also the courage of those such as Ingrid Loyau-Kennett. Does the noble

many parts of the world than it is in England. The message that the
West is against Islam is presented to the Islamic community across the
world, and this is succeeding by default. Does the Leader of the House
recall that British troops rescued Muslims from a secular regime which
invaded Kuwait, from Orthodox Christians in Kosovo and from attacks by
Orthodox Christians on Roman Catholic Christians in Croatia? Is it not
about time that Her Majesty’s Government began to say, loud and

whom are being abused by the very companies that evade taxation and
then criticise our income support projects, which are there to make up
those companies’ shortfalls? Secondly, will he join me in saying
that not only are extreme forms of Islamophobia unacceptable, but that
parents, teachers and youth workers should listen very carefully for
those children who, because of what they hear at home, or because of
prejudice or for other reasons, can be heard using the phrase
“You’re a Muslim” as a term of abuse? It is
low-level abuse but it is a problem. I remember the head of a school in
Lancashire many years ago saying, “We don’t have to deal
with this because we don’t have any of those children
here”. However, that low-level abuse can lead to an atmosphere

point, it is clearly the case that the “Prevent” strand
of work that the Government carry out is extremely important. It has

some 107,000 people have been killed and some 174,000 injured, most of
them Muslim, in many thousands of attacks, the perpetrators of which
claim Islam and the Koran as their inspiration. In my Oral Question
this afternoon, therefore, I asked the Government whether they would
encourage a gathering of great Islamic clerics—the grand muftis
and the ulema—to agree to issue a fatwa against the jihadists,
to cast them out of Islam and to declare that they are no longer
Muslim. I regret to say that the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady

what happened. I am not sure that it is within my gift, powerful though
the Leader of the House is in theory, to convene a global gathering of

Astor:</Member></B> My Lords, we come back to the Bill. This is a Bill
that divides friends, families, political parties, different faiths
and, indeed, the Church of England. The problem seems to be that there
are different views on what the word marriage means and what it stands
for. To many it is an adjective that describes an event—not
necessarily a religious event—that takes place in a registry
office, on a lawn, on a beach, in a hotel or, I am told, even in a
swimming pool. Sometimes it is a religious event in a church. Sometimes
it is the only occasion on which the couple actually go to church.
Sometimes the couple already have children or have been married before
or are of different religious faiths. Thus the word marriage is used by
many different people to describe many different types of
event.</hs_para>  
<?notus-xml column=981?><hs_para UID="13060321000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000070">There are also those who
believe that marriage is a sacred religious ceremony and that marriage
must be between a man and a woman for the procreation of children.
Therefore, we have different groups of people using the same word in
different contexts. That is the fundamental issue that divides us and
causes us concern
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000071">It
is a difficult issue. Was there a huge clamour for the Bill? No, it
came only from a few. Most affected seemed happy with civil
partnerships. Was it sensible to introduce it as a government Bill?
That will be debated, I suspect, for many months. However, we have a
Bill that has gone through another place and arrived in this House, and
we have to deal with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000072">I
understand those who have strong feelings against the Bill, but I will
make one important point. I understand and sympathise with those who
want to get married but feel excluded by their church. It happened to
me. Some 37 years ago I went to see our local vicar to arrange my
marriage. I told him that my future wife was a Roman Catholic. He said
that that did not matter and that we could go ahead. Then I then told
him that she had been married before and had two small children. He
immediately withdrew his offer of marriage and rather reluctantly
offered a service of blessing. I felt upset and excluded. The Roman
Catholic Church offered my wife an annulment, and said that it would
then be happy to conduct the marriage. It seemed odd to have an
annulment when one already had two children. Luckily, the Church of
Scotland came to our rescue and we were duly married. Now the Church of
England has changed its rules so that divorcees can marry. The church
has evolved. It has changed its view on this and on many other issues.
We now have women priests, and perhaps one day we will have women
bishops.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000073">Where
do I stand in this debate? To many the Bill is welcome. We must not
forget that there are a substantial number of children living with
same-sex couples who want their parents to have the full recognition of
marriage and the protection that that gives the family. Then we have
the contrary view. To many, this Bill is divisive and unnecessary. As a
Conservative, I believe in freedom and tolerance—two aspects not
always very relevant in many marriages. “Compromise”
might be the term most popular in my marriage, as I always seem to be
the one who is
compromising.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000074">The
churches and other faiths should be able to decide whether or not they
want to have same-sex marriage ceremonies in their church. It should be
up to them. It should not be imposed by the state. If they do not wish
to conduct the ceremony, they should not be forced to. The strong and
clear clauses in the Bill provide for that protection. I have listened
to those who claim that the European Court of Human Rights might
overrule British law. If it does, I would be delighted, as then we
could all agree to leave this outdated and flawed institution that has
allowed so many dangerous terrorists to remain in this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000075">Therefore,
I support the Second Reading of the Bill. More importantly, it would be
quite wrong and highly damaging to the reputation of the House not to
allow the Bill to proceed to Committee, where all the arguments for and
against can be fully debated. We 
<?notus-xml column=982?>are a revising Chamber. We have an absolute right to send an amended
Bill back to another place—but after debate, Report and Third
Reading. The noble Lord, Lord Dear, said the Bill would, “take
up valuable time”. I say to the noble Lord that we have the
time, and I am sorry that he has not got the time to deal with the many
complex clauses and issues in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000076">To
reject a Bill on Second Reading that has been passed by another
place—however strong the opinions—would have a grave
knock-on effect on the relationship between the two Houses. Rejection
at Second Reading has occurred occasionally, but it is against the

Bill a Second Reading. If we do not, we would be seen as undemocratic
and not as the guardian of democracy, which is how we are now often
seen. If we did not accept the Bill, we would hasten the threatened

Brooke of Alverthorpe:</Member></B> I will continue in a similar vein.
Regrettably, the noble Lord, Lord Dear, is not with us. I had a number
of letters from him seeking to persuade me to his view, that I should
vote for what I now see as his wrecking amendment to the Bill, even
though the Bill had been adopted by a very sizeable majority in the
elected Chamber and, unusually, on a cross-party basis and without the
normal, formal whipping taking
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000078">It is
true that there was not any mention of this legislation in any of the
parties’ manifestos, but that is not necessarily unusual. After
all, as the noble Lord, Lord Dear, pointed out, we recently dealt with
a major piece of legislation relating to the National Health Service
and social care. There was no mention of that in anybody’s
manifesto, but such a major change none the less came through to us. In
many respects the changes emanating from that may have an even greater
effect on society at the moment than what will emanate from the
legislation before us
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000079">I
suspect also that many of the people who may be tempted to vote with
the noble Lord, Lord Dear, voted for legislation—the Care
Bill—that had not been in any manifesto. I hope that they will
weigh those issues up in their heads before they decide whether they
move forward. Also, had the House of Lords Reform Bill come up from the
Commons, even though such an attempt to move towards a more democratic
Chamber had been in all the parties’ manifestos, I rather
suspect that there would have been a majority of noble Lords still
opposing it. Overall, we should be prepared to dismiss the argument
that this is undemocratic and has not gone through the proper
procedures, and move on to Committee and start to examine
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000080">I will be

good side, to which the most reverend Primate referred, research shows

as the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, argued, rather than

accept that equal marriage will change marriage to a degree. We would
be misleading ourselves if we thought that everything would be
precisely the same in future. It will not—it will change. But as
the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, so ably demonstrated in his contribution,
there have been many changes to marriage over the generations, and this
is just one on the route as we move forward. Overall, it will have a
positive impact on society, and it will strengthen and encourage
lifelong relationships and

noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, listed what he believed were the
ingredients for a successful marriage. I boiled down the items he
listed to two major ones. Love and tolerance are the essence, as I see
it, of a successful marriage—to which, from my own experience, I
would add faith. I was interested to hear the most reverend Primate say
at the beginning that this is not a faith issue but concerns general
social good<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:12:23"></hs_TimeCode>. I
would argue that that is not so and that the principal churches in the
country are holding back in an area where they should be moving

the totality of the population who come under God’s guidance and
leadership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000084">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>

Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:13:19"></hs_TimeCode>, as I have
studied the development of this Bill thus far, I have been profoundly
alarmed by the violations of constitutional due process that seem to
have accompanied it at every turn. I firmly believe, given the four
recent precedents for this House rejecting a Bill approved in another
place on a free vote—the two war crimes Bills, the sexual
offence Bill and Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2)
Bill)—which were backed by the 2006 Joint Committee
on Conventions report, that it is both consistent with our role as a
revising Chamber, and indeed an established expression of it, for us to
support the Motion proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Dear,
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:14:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000086">In
my brief contribution, I would like to focus on three particular
points. First, I would like to highlight how no Member of the other
place has an electoral mandate to redefine marriage. Secondly, I will
consider the shameful consultation which the Government conducted on
this issue. Thirdly, I will look at how the Bill so far has not
received effective
scrutiny<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:14:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000087">No
Member<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:14:35"></hs_TimeCode> of the
other place has an electoral mandate to redefine marriage. I do not
doubt the 
<?notus-xml column=984?>sincerity of the Prime Minister and of many Members of the other place
in supporting the redefinition of marriage, but the fact is that no
member of the Conservative Party, Liberal Democrats or Labour Party has
any mandate to introduce this change. There was no Green Paper; there
was no White Paper. It was not in the Queen’s Speech; it was not
in any party’s manifesto. In certain cases, if the change is
minor, uncontroversial, or in response to an unanticipated security
crisis, it may possibly be appropriate to bring forward a legislative
change without a mandate. That, patently, is not the case with the Bill
before us today, which proposes changing a key social definition at the
heart of our society that has been defined one way for millennia. It is
quite extraordinary to me that any Government should ever dream of
making such a change without a manifesto mandate, the denial of which
demonstrates no regard for
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:15:47"></hs_TimeCode>

of our views on same-sex marriage, I think that we would all agree that
the consultation on the introduction of same-sex marriage has been
seriously deficient. Initially, the Government said that the
consultation was about how to redefine marriage rather than whether or
not it was actually a good idea to do so. However, the consultation did
eventually include a “whether” question after an outcry
from opponents of the proposals. When the Government agreed to include
the whether question, the Coalition for Marriage asked whether petition
signatories could be counted as submissions to the consultation, as
endorsement of the petition had the effect of answering question 1 of
the consultation. It was told yes, and on this basis opponents of
redefinition were not advised that they needed to make a separate
submission to the consultation, and on this basis many thousands did
not do so.</hs_para>

published their response to the consultation, they said that, while of
course they would have regard for the petition, they would not count it
as part of the consultation, enabling them to claim a narrow majority
in favour of redefining marriage. The fact that the Government thereby
excluded the views of half a million people despite the assurance that
had been given has been a cause of real fury, completely alienating
many people from the political process. I find it remarkable that the
Government thought that it was acceptable to exclude those people from
the consultation, which would have found that more than 80% of
submissions were opposed to the plan, if they had been
included<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:17:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000090">It
is also important to highlight the fact that the Government were
absolutely firm in the consultation document that same-sex weddings
would not be allowed on religious premises. Those who actually managed
to get a response registered to the consultation, relying in good faith
on the Government’s assurances about religious premises, found
that the Government’s final proposals were radically different
to those on which they had consulted. Shortly before Christmas, the
Government announced a major policy U-turn: same-sex ceremonies will
after all be introduced in churches as well as in civil
settings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000091">Next,
we must have regard for what happened in the other place. The
Government ensured that the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill was
committed to a 
<?notus-xml column=985?>Public Bill Committee, even though the serious and contentious issues
involved in this Bill warranted a Committee on the Floor of the House.
The Public Bill Committee was made up of 15 MPs who had voted for the
legislation at Second Reading and only four who had voted against.
After about 10 hours of evidence sessions, MPs went on to consider the
details of the Bill for just less than 20 hours. In contrast, the
Hunting Bill was considered for more than 80 hours in the Public Bill
Committee. This included recommittal to a Standing Committee after one
day of Report. One could go on and on about the time given
to debate. At the conclusion of its Commons stages, the Marriage (Same
Sex Couples) Bill had received approximately 49 hours of consideration.
By contrast, the 2002-03 hunting legislation received twice as much
scrutiny, being debated for 97 hours altogether. It seems clear to me
that the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill simply has not received the
level of scrutiny in the House of Commons that is appropriate for such
contentious
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:19:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:19:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000092">Finally,
much more could be said about the lack of respect for constitutional
due process that has accompanied this Bill on its journey so far.
However, now that the Bill has reached your Lordships’
House—a Chamber that, happily, the Executive do not control to
quite the same extent—there is an opportunity for things to take
a different course. I firmly believe that the only failing to date was
the failing to have a manifesto mandate, and it is our responsibility
as a revising Chamber, in line with recent precedent and the Joint
Committee on Conventions ruling, to vote no today and ask the
Government to think again. Those parties committed to redefining
marriage can place this commitment in their 2015 manifestos and proceed
in the usual manner, if they receive the appropriate

Knight of Collingtree:</Member></B> My Lords, we have been told by many
speakers in this debate that the Bill is all about equality. People
must be treated equally and Parliament must ensure it. The first
statement is reasonable; the second is not. Certainly we are all equal
before the law, but a far higher authority than even anyone here has
already decided that people are not equal. Some are stronger, cleverer,
lazier, plainer or better-looking than others. Some people can see,
while others are blind. If anyone brings a Bill to this House to change
that, I will be the first in the Lobby to vote for it; but no Bill can

Bill ignores a fact well understood for centuries: marriage is not
about just love. Of course, homosexuals are often very delightful,
artistic and loving people. No one doubts that for one single moment.
However, marriage is not about just love. It is about a man and a
woman, themselves created to produce children, producing children. A
man can no more bear a child than a woman can produce sperm. No law on
earth can change that. This is not a homophobic view. It may be 
<?notus-xml column=986?>sad, it may be unequal, but it is true. This Bill is either trying to
pretend that it can change men into women, or vice versa, or telling us

being eroded. The Government assure us that no church and no person

disallowed any amendment that would protect the right to a conscience?

do anything that they did not want to do. However, promises of this

I support the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dear? The degree
of change envisaged in the Bill to the concepts of marriage—both
contemporary 
<?notus-xml column=987?>and historical concepts—is far more than a mere expansion of
meaning on the grounds of equality of treatment. Supportive and caring
relationships between two individuals may well be as similar in
same-sex as in opposite-sex unions and, of course, are to be welcomed.
However, there the similarity or equality ends. Part of the traditional
meaning of marriage embraces its consequences—the consequences
of sexual intercourse and of procreation, to say nothing of the
concepts of adultery or non-consummation. Marriage is far more than a
wedding day, an exchange of vows, the honeymoon and mutual support. I
know; I have been married happily for 58 years and have children and
grandchildren. So I think it is a travesty of interpretation to claim

Black of Brentwood:</Member></B> My Lords, I am a passionate supporter
of the Bill. I support it because I believe in the institution of
marriage, which is the bedrock of society and should be open to all. I
support it because I believe in the values of the family, and the Bill
will, in my view, strengthen them. I support it because I am a
Conservative. Respect for individual liberty is at the core of my being
and this is a Bill that will add to the sum of human freedom. I support
it because I am a 
<?notus-xml column=988?>Christian and I believe we are all equal in the eyes of God, and should
be so under man’s laws. I support it because I am one of those
people who I fear were rather glibly derided by the noble Lord, Lord
Dear, as being part of a tiny minority and, I think, were praised by my
noble friend Lady Knight as being delightful, in that I am gay. I am in
a civil partnership with somebody with whom I have been together for
nearly a quarter of a century. I love him very much and nothing would
give me greater pride than to marry him. I hope noble Lords will
forgive that personal pronouncement, but it seems to me that my
experience goes to the heart of this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000106">Of
course, there are strong views on both sides which I respect and the
debate today has illustrated them, but by far the most important aspect
of this debate are the thousands of our fellow citizens, of whom I am
one, who are not yet fully equal. The Bill is about human beings, not
ideology. Although some noble Lords may disagree with me when I talk
about the press, I assure noble Lords that in the main I really am
exactly the same as them, except that I happen to love a man. Why
should I be barred from taking part in a special institution that all
the rest of you can enjoy? It seems to me that that is the nub of the
matter. The speech of the noble Lord, Lord Dear, contained throughout
words such as “tolerate” and “toleration”.
Goodness me, this is 2013. Gay people do not want to be tolerated in
this society; they want to be equal in it. My noble friend Lady
Cumberlege, for whom I have most enormous respect, not least for her
Trojan work on osteoporosis, talks about gay people setting up
different institutions. We do not want different institutions; we want
the same
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:33:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Provided it passes, this law will accord me, for the first time in my
life, complete equality and respect regardless of my sexuality for what
the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in an incredibly powerful speech,
described as the character of love that I feel able to give. I hope so
much that this House, which has always valued the sanctity of the
individual, will allow that to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:33:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000107">My
personal experience aside, there are two strong reasons of principle
why I support the Bill. First, as a Conservative, I believe in human
liberty. Some words of the great liberal thinker, J S Mill, with which
I concur, are deeply relevant to this debate. He stated
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13060321000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000114">“the

self-protection”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13060321000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000110">The
state should interfere in people’s lives only where it is
preventing harm; for example, banning smoking in public places or
criminalising drugs. Marriage between two men or two women who love
each other does not produce social harm. It is not endangering anyone.
Why should the state actively stop it? That point was echoed in a
recent interview in the <I>New York Times</I> with the daughter of that
great Conservative icon, President Reagan, who was one of my heroes. As
we know, he was a social conservative to his core, but he also
respected individual liberty and, according to his daughter, would have
supported equal marriage. Why would he have done so? He would have done
so because of

is quite right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:35:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
If we respect individuality, the structure of our legal institutions
must reflect that and it does not. The Bill puts that right by removing
value judgments by the state, making the law neutral and allowing all
those who want to make a lifelong, loving commitment to each other to
marry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:35:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060321000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000108">The
second reason I support the Bill is because of the power of legislation
to change attitudes, something we have heard a little about. When I
started in politics in the late 1980s, I learnt at the feet of the
noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, for whom I have the most extraordinary
respect. At that time, most gay men had little choice but to hide their
sexuality. Noble Lords should understand how soul destroying it can be
to cover up an aspect of your life. The reason that young people can
mostly live openly gay lives today is because legislation from this
House and the House of Commons led opinion. The bold reforms of John
Major’s Government, the repeal of Section 28 and the
introduction of civil partnerships by the Labour Government were all in
advance of mainstream opinion but have created a more inclusive, more
liberal society by being so. This measure will have the same impact.
Young gay people at school or university, battling with their
consciences as well as, still too often, prejudice, will look to
Parliament and see that in the eyes of the UK’s lawmakers, they
are treated with respect, dignity and equality. As the Prime Minister
rightly put it, they will stand taller as a result of our actions. I
pay tribute to his huge courage in bringing forward the Bill in the
face of much prejudice and
misinformation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060321000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060321000109">I
conclude with this thought. The day my partner and I entered a civil
partnership in 2006 was immensely special. It produced a tangible
strengthening and deepening of our relationship in a way that I did not
believe was possible. People sometimes ask me, “Isn’t
that enough?”, and we have heard echoes of that today. Why
cannot gay people be happy with what we have already been granted? My
answer is that it was the experience of civil partnership which
convinced me of the need to go further. If a civil ceremony can produce
such a deep change in the relationship between two people, imagine what
a proper marriage, morally equal in the eyes of one’s family and
friends, could do. That is why I can put my hand on my heart and tell
noble Lords that this measure will not undermine marriage, it will
strengthen it. It will not undermine the family, it will strengthen it.
I know that to be true because I have felt it. That is why I beseech
noble Lords to join me tomorrow in voting to give the Bill a Second
Reading.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/7AF8665EBDE75DC42EC7B893993754067FB30A9B" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

because of two things. First, it is because society has moved and
changed. The attitude from an overwhelming range of our society,
especially among young people, has moved on even since eight years ago.
Secondly, the success of civil partnerships themselves has demonstrated
that where loving commitment can be made and recognised it is to be
celebrated and welcomed by
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:46:32"></hs_TimeCode>. Some of
the things that have been said in the course of public discussion by
some—though certainly by no means all—opponents of this

hurtful. This has reinforced my view that this change is sorely

brief points. First, quite simply, this is about love, commitment and
mutual respect. It is about two people wanting to commit
themselves to each other and to demonstrate the strength of that
commitment to the world. This is something to celebrate, surely, not to
reject; to welcome and endorse, not to sideline. To vote against the
Bill is, effectively, to say that two people, two members of our human
family, cannot be allowed the full flowering of the expression of their
love for each other. I ask those arguing against the Bill to think for
just a moment about the hurtfulness of what they are doing by saying
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:47:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

respects the rights of religious organisations and faiths to opt out,
if they wish, of any endorsement of lesbian or gay marriage. I regret
that some faith organisations take this view but I would not dream for
a moment of imposing on them a requirement to conduct or celebrate
something they genuinely believe to be contrary to their faith.
However, I beseech them in turn: please do not dare, by voting down
this Bill, to impose on me the impossibility of celebrating a
commitment in the fullest way that society recognises. Deny yourselves
the obligation by all means, but do not deny me the
opportunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:48:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

at heart, about a simple principle of equality and equal access to the
recognition of love and the standing of loving relationships. I was
proud to be part of the Government who brought in so many changes for
the better for lesbians and gay men and eliminated so many
discriminations and inequalities. Some hurdles remain, however, and
this is the highest of them. Voting for the Bill will right a
long-standing wrong. It will recognise the equal dignity and worth of
all our lesbian and gay citizens. It will challenge the prejudice that
is still all too prevalent in our society. It will say, quite simply,
that love matters and equally so for everyone. I urge noble Lords to

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, we have heard some very powerful and
moving speeches this afternoon. I heard every one of them and I found
this to be a rather emotionally draining debate. I greatly respect the
noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury, and my noble friend Lord Black of
Brentwood, and nobody could have listened to their powerful pleas
without being moved by them. It is therefore all the more difficult to
take a different line. I find myself very much in sympathy with much of
what the noble Lords, Lord Campbell-Savours and Lord Anderson, said
and, above all, with much of what the most reverend Primate the

is a fundamental flaw in the Bill that arises from the manner of its
introduction. Great social changes such as the abolition of the death
penalty or the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, on abortion have
generally come about as a result of public campaigns and Private
Members’ Bills in another place that have attracted the support
of government. This Bill has been imposed from on high and in a way
that has caused a degree of grief and anguish—I say this
directly to the noble Lord, Lord Smith, who also feels grief and
anguish—for many of those who believe fundamentally and
sincerely that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman.
That is not to denigrate or degrade in any way other human
relationships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000016">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:52:14"></hs_TimeCode>
admit to your Lordships that I was one of the very few people who voted
on Third Reading in another place against civil partnerships. I did so
because I wanted them to be extended according to the so-called
“sisters amendment” because I believed that any two
people who were in a loving relationship, whether sexual or otherwise,
should be able to have the benefits that civil partnerships brought to
lesbian and gay people. I have moved since those days and completely
accept that civil partnerships have proved to be a good 
<?notus-xml column=993?>thing. I welcome that, and no one could fail to be touched by what my
noble friend Lord Black said about his civil
partnership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000017">However,
true equality in a free society is an equality that protects and
asserts difference. Yes, as my noble friend Lady Knight said, we are
all equal under the law—but we are different. Acts of
Parliament—again I quote her—cannot enable a man to bear
a child or a blind man to see. There are things that we therefore have
to recognise as being different. What we have to aspire to is a society
in which all, whether they are different by the colour of their skin,
religious beliefs or sexual orientation, are not only equal in the eyes
of the law and in the sight of God, as they are, but are not
discriminated against in any way for those differences. That is the
state in which I wish to see our
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000018">I was
much taken by the powerful speech of my noble friend Lady Cumberlege,
who said that you cannot, without changing marriage beyond recognition,
have marriage between same-sex partners, but you surely can have an
institution that is the equivalent in every
sense<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:54:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I take
the point made by my noble friend Lord Black that civil partnerships
perhaps do not quite reach that point at the moment. As a Christian who
was at one stage opposed, I would welcome the blessing of a union in
the church—in my church, the Anglican Church. The most reverend
Primate did not go quite so far in his speech as to specifically
advocate that, but its logical conclusion was that that is something to
which we could and, I believe, should aspire.</hs_para>

institution of marriage as it is at the moment, we are not making those
of the same sex who become married members of an equal institution,
because they cannot be. They cannot produce children. I do not say that
in any critical sense but merely as an acceptance of the fact. There is
a danger that because we sympathise, as we rightly do, and because we
want to see the dignity of every human being on an equal footing, we
are likely to vote for something that is not in the best interests of
society. As a pamphlet I received put it, this is one of the most
profound pieces of social engineering ever to be put before Parliament.
The changing of the definition of marriage in this
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:56:34"></hs_TimeCode> should not
happen without a popular
mandate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:56:44"></hs_TimeCode>. The

people want that change. There some logic in that plea. Certainly,
there has not been any manifesto commitment, and although some brush
that aside, it is a real

vote with the noble Lord, Lord Dear, tomorrow—although I have
some misgivings about having a vote—because of the plea that
many of us received from colleagues in another place who said that
there had not been adequate preparation and that the free vote was
questionable. I know that for a fact from many who have spoken to me
personally, who were rather anguished about it. I therefore will vote
for the amendment tomorrow—with, as I say, some
misgivings—and if the Bill is carried I will try and play a
constructive part in improving it. The most reverend Primate said, just
before he sat down and with much regret, that this was not a Bill that
he could support. Nor can I.</hs_para>

was an issue that did not receive much attention in the debate in the

Church of England has no right simply to maintain the status quo in our

the clue is in Clause 1(3) of the Bill to which very little attention
has been paid. I believe it is unprecedented in statute law. The
Submission of the Clergy Act 1533 provides that the church must not
promulgate canons that are contrary to what the Explanatory Notes to
the present Bill call “general law”. Arguably, the 1533
Act also lays a certain obligation on the state not to pass laws which
are contrary to the received canon laws of the Church of England. That
is how establishment has worked, because to do so would put the Church
of England in a very difficult position. That is why Clause 1(3), on
marriage, exempts our canons from the scope of the Submission of the
Clergy Act. In effect, it creates an amendment to the Act without quite
saying so and therefore legally permits statute law and canon law on
marriage to be diametrically opposed in future on the very basic point
of who can be married to

documents there is an attempt to draw a parallel with divorce, although
that hardly applies at all because the canons of the Church of England

changes that have happened in divorce law have never come into conflict
with the canons—for the very good reason that it was always
permitted in statute law. It is also there in the Old and the New
Testament. Therefore, this clause is unprecedented in our legislative
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:04:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000031">This
helps us to understand why people feel so strongly, although this is
one of the questions that we have not really asked. Of course, the easy
answer is that they are homophobic. That is an easy dismissal than can
be made, and who am I to say that this is not sometimes part of it? I
cannot say that. However, I think the reason why people feel so
strongly lies elsewhere. There are two roots to it. One is that
marriage is given for the conception, nurture and upbringing of
children—that is what it is naturally there for, as other
speakers have said. I accept that other family arrangements can
successfully bring up children, but there is something naturally given
about marriage in relation to children. Our society has broken that
connection in many ways, 
<?notus-xml column=996?>partly through contraception, but to break it in this radical way needs
some
thought<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

people feel strongly is because, in the Bible, the marriage
relationship is the primary metaphor for how God relates to the world.
That is in the Old and New Testament, particularly in the Old, and that
is why it is a view also held strongly by Jews and Muslims, for whom
the Old Testament is a sacred book. The noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries, who is not in his place, alluded to this, but did not
pick up on the obvious fact that the relationship between God and the
world is not symmetrical. It is not a relationship of sameness, but of
difference within a deep bond of love. That is why, in that metaphor,
if you try to take away the difference between man and woman, it does
not work any more. It is partly why people of faith feel so strongly
about this
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:06:57"></hs_TimeCode>. There is
something about “vive la différence”, which the
noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, touched on so brilliantly in her
speech. There is something basic about it, something visceral, which
people feel is being undermined and changed, and that is why they react
as they do, even if they do not quite know how to articulate
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:07:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000033">How
should we proceed? I have come to the view that a more radical
reconstruction of the law on marriage would be the right way forward. I
think it would meet a lot of the issues raised in the powerful speeches
that have been made. We should consider going some way towards the
continental version, which has a legal, contractual relationship that
is the same for everyone, absolutely without question. Then we could
develop different religious understandings on top of that. That may be
a bridge too far: the Government thought so when they drew up this
rather rushed legislation. Several Members in the other place drew
attention to this as the logical outcome of what we should be doing.
Much of what we have heard today would potentially be satisfied, amid
our society’s many differences, if we separated the legal
contract of marriage, which the state establishes as being the same for
everyone, and the religious side. I fully accept that that would have
implications for establishment but there are unintended consequences of
this Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Dear, said, and that is just one of
them. It has not been thought out and if we commit this Bill to a
Committee, we are almost saying that the Bill can be improved by
tinkering: it cannot. What is wrong with it is just too basic. That is
why, with the same regrets that the noble Lord, Lord Cormack,
mentioned, I shall be with the noble Lord, Lord Dear, in the Division
Lobby.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13060324000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000064">7.09

fascinating debate with some very powerful and emotional contributions.
I cannot attempt to engage in a theological debate with the right
reverend Prelates—I fear that as a non-practising Jewish atheist
that is probably beyond me. However, treating the matter seriously, as
I do, I was interested in the idea that marriage is just one specific
type of union between a man and a women and that it is for procreation,
if I may paraphrase slightly. I cannot help feeling that the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, was right in saying that the nature of marriage has
changed fundamentally since being an institution that discriminated
abominably against women, giving them few or no rights whatever when it
came to inheritance and even no rights over their children.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060324000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000045">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:16:37"></hs_TimeCode>
cannot help but reflect that it has changed in relation to my own
experience. I have enjoyed marriage so much that I have done it
twice—and for the last time, I hope. On the second occasion, my
wife wanted our marriage to take place in church and I wanted to
respect her views. On that occasion in 1985, I met the rector and he
was a very pleasant individual, but he said, “I’m really
sorry but I cannot marry you in church because you have been
divorced”. I now notice that that is no longer the case with the
Church of England; it has changed its views. Fortunately, we
now live in a very different society from the one that
existed when marriage was first conceived. The way that society regards
homosexual relationships has changed fundamentally, and we have heard
some very powerful contributions about that. As I listened to the
speech of the noble Lord, Lord Black, I doubted whether anyone in this
Chamber would have been able to make such a contribution 10 years ago.
Going back further in time, Oscar Wilde—a particular favourite
of mine—while in jail reflected on the temerity of being forced
to admit the nature of his
relationship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:16:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with the right reverend Prelates and I would not want the Bill to
undermine their right to determine who gets married in church. However,
they seem to have great difficulty in determining some of their
attitudes, whether on homosexuality or on whether a woman should be a
bishop. They are still agonising over that with different wings of the
church, but their attitudes will no doubt change over
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:17:13"></hs_TimeCode>. I think
that we have now reached a point in our society where same-sex marriage
is right and I do not believe that it will undermine the relationship
of marriage. That is the bit of the argument that I do not understand,
and I could not put it any better than the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. I
usually find myself in opposition to him but on this occasion—I
am sorry that he is not in the Chamber—I could not have put it
any better than he
did<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:17:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

lot of talk about children in marriage. I need to remind people that
things are changing all the time. We now have gay couples with
children—something that, again, a few years ago we 
<?notus-xml column=999?>would not have thought of as being a likely occurrence. Therefore, I do
not believe that this legislation is going to undermine the nature of
marriage, although it will not be right for every person. I have a
brother who is gay. He has been in a long-term relationship over a
number of years and has never expressed to me any desire to change the
nature of that relationship. Therefore, marriage will not be for every
gay couple, but for some it will be and the question is whether we
should deny them the opportunity. I do not believe that we should.
There are genuine concerns and we should ensure that we have the right
to take the Bill through its Committee stage to examine very carefully
whether what has been referred to as the quadruple lock will cover
every eventuality. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and my noble friend
Lady Kennedy say that they have looked at that very carefully, and I
tend—initially, at least—to respect their view, although
there may of course be other views. Therefore, I support the Bill. I am
opposed to the amendment and I look forward to

Neuberger:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to support the Bill. I want to
make three discrete points in this debate, which has had so many
speakers and such high running emotion. First, despite many views to
the contrary, marriage is in fact a social construct. It was not always
one man and one woman. Indeed, polygamy was widespread in the ancient
world, and its reasons were many. To quote from the Hebrew bible, as we
call the Old Testament, Solomon was reputed to have a thousand wives. I
do not know how he managed. Many people will also know the story of
Jacob and how he got the wrong wife first, with Rachel and
Leah.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000049">I also
want to give a bit of history, which your Lordships may not know. There
was a great rabbi, Rabbenu Gershom of Mainz, who in around 1,000 CE,
which we call AD, was responsible for what is known as a takkanah, a
legal pronouncement which is technically valid for 1,000 years. The
takkanah of his that concerns us prohibited polygamy. It applied only
to Ashkenazi Jews, those in Germany, Poland and Russia and so on. The
Sephardi Jews—North African, Spanish and
Portuguese—continued to practise polygamy in some areas, and
that continued among Yemeni Jews until the 1950s and 1960s. So for us,
marriage was not always just between one man and one woman, nor was it
always for the procreation of children. When Rabbenu Gershom’s
takkanah ran out in around 2000, 13 years ago, you might have expected
a wild rush of Ashkenazi Jewish men seeking second, third and fourth
wives, but because marriage is a social construct as much as a legal
one, curiously that did not happen, and we would not have wanted it
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000050">These days
we believe in marriage between two people, not more, although serial
monogamy is commonplace. Marriage has changed dramatically over the
millennia and over recent centuries. Divorce, which we Jews have always
accepted, has become widely accepted and no longer a disgrace; married
women now have property rights, although that took its time;
infertility is no longer blamed only on women—it used to be a
reason for divorce in Judaism after 10 childless years; and so on. Why,
then, can we not change this social construct once again, while still
maintaining 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>respect for those for whom marriage is about sacrament, but cannot
accept such a change? I think it is important that we
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000051">Secondly,
I want to say something about numbers. In my congregation at the West
London Synagogue—the oldest reform synagogue in the
UK—where I am senior rabbi, we have about 3,000 members. We also
have around 30 gay couples, most—but not all—in civil
partnerships now, waiting for the day when they can marry under the
chuppah, the wedding canopy, with their parents under that canopy,
witnessing them make their vows. For me and my fellow reform and
liberal Jews, like the Unitarians and the Quakers, this is about parity
of esteem. We see no reason why gay people should not marry as
heterosexual people do. We see all human beings as made in the image of
God. That means gay and straight. We also believe that human beings are
created with the need to seek out and look for a helpmeet in life. That
person could be of the same sex, or not. Whichever it is, they deserve
the right to be able to create a life together permanently and to
celebrate it in
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060324000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060324000052">Thirdly,
as several noble Lords have said, this is about righting a wrong. It is
about accepting that social conditions and attitudes change and have
changed. I hope that noble Lords will accept that that is true. We have
heard that no court of any kind, domestic or European, would force a
religious organisation to perform such marriages against their will.
But those of us in religious organisations which are in favour of equal
marriage are longing for the day. I expect the first days after it
becomes law, as I hope it does, to consist of marriage after marriage
in my synagogue, bringing joy, equality and renewed commitment to
people who, until this point, have been denied it. It needs to happen
soon. It is a moral imperative to right this
wrong.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/3FFB55797FDBF49FF1323D0791ED2CB2ED1E9CFB" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

this matter among religious groups. Quakers, liberal Jews and
Unitarians support the measure, and my noble friend Lord Deben, in a
characteristically thoughtful article in the <I>Tablet</I>, reminded
his fellow Roman Catholics that for over a century it has been accepted
that the state has had a role in marriage and that it could and would
make its own secular rules for its
citizens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060326000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060326000007">The
Bill has been a useful vehicle for opening a discussion on humanist

was incompatible with the Human Rights Act. I understand that
subsequent discussions have ensued with the British Humanist
Association, and other issues relating, for example, to the definition
of premises need to be resolved. I suspect that it would probably add
to the challenges before us on this Bill to attempt to address those

These are things that we have had to contend with. When the Christian
church began to look in its societies and move beyond Jerusalem, it had
to come to terms with the fact that it was moving into different
cultures. There was always the question of whether to challenge the
culture or whether to adapt the faith you have received in order to
cope with the culture into which you have moved.</hs_para>

to do so, I cannot speak on behalf of the Methodist church because it
is still considering what its response will be if the Bill becomes law.
However, the Methodist church has always based its moral and ethical
values on the fourfold foundation of scripture, tradition, reason and
experience. Twenty years ago, the Methodist church committed itself to
listening attentively to the experience of those for whom a committed
heterosexual relationship would not be possible. I think that we must
listen attentively to the experience of today, listen to those for whom
a lifelong, loving, faithful, joyful and sacrificial relationship can
be achieved only in a same-sex partnership. We also have to listen to
the responses that some of us have received from those who bear
witness, from childcare and adoption agencies, to the value of same-sex
partnerships in the bringing up of children and the overwhelmingly
positive signs of good
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the experiences of people and bring to bear our scriptural
understanding to the experience which is equally valid under God. The
depth and quality of relationships that have already been achieved in
civil partnerships shows us that they are almost indistinguishable from
the relationships experienced in heterosexual marriage. We have to bear
witness to that. But we ask: why is it necessary to change if this is
already provided for in our society? The one thing that is often
missing is a deep acceptance that these relationships are equally valid
and fruitful, and that they, too, form the bedrock of our society. They
help to build up our communities. That is often missing. If it cannot
be called marriage, it is seen to be a second-class relationship; we
must address
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I also
believe that if this is addressed in society, it may be the
encouragement that the churches need in order to move into a different

physical and spiritual union: the joining together of the reproductive
organs of a man and a woman; the potential for creating new flesh in
the form of a child. Non-consummation annuls a marriage and therefore
marriage is, and can only be, between a man and a woman. Marriage in
the Jewish tradition was considered to be a blood covenant. They used
to keep the bed sheets as proof that the covenant had been satisfied.
It is a physical impossibility in a same-sex relationship for the
reproductive organs to be joined together, and therefore whatever we
seek to call it, it cannot be a marriage in the traditional sense. In
fact, it changes the nature and meaning of marriage.</hs_para>

concept of marriage was not really established by the state; it existed
well before our parliamentary democracy and is an internationally
recognised institution that crosses borders, religions and millennia. I
do not think that we should seek to change it. If this Bill were to
pass, in due course we would end up having to create a new vocabulary
for words like “father”, “mother”,
“husband” and “wife”. This has already been
flagged in other countries.</hs_para>

word “love” does not appear in the official words that

criterion, then why cannot three people love each other? In fact, some
countries already accept polygamy. This question has been asked in
Canada, while in the Netherlands and Brazil judges have legalised what
they call a polyamorous relationship, a cohabitation agreement with
multiple sexual partners.</hs_para>

reason marriage is limited to one man and one woman is that it takes no
more and no less to produce children. If we were to accept that love is
the precondition for marriage, why should we restrict it? If there is
no possibility of genetic offspring or indeed no requirement for
consummation, why should not close relatives get married? If that were
to happen, I can see all sorts of interesting possibilities for
inheritance tax planning. We would open a Pandora’s Box. I do

Bill purports to address a remaining apparent inequality, but it

couples. Couples of the same sex will have the option of civil
partnership or marriage, while at the moment heterosexuals can have
only marriage. I know that the Government have announced a consultation
on this, despite initially blocking it because of the £4 billion
price tag. Will the granting of civil partnerships to heterosexual
couples strengthen marriage? I suspect that it will not. Same sex will
have no definition of “consummation”. Heterosexuals do.
Same sex will have no definition of “adultery”.
Heterosexuals do. Same sex will not be allowed to marry in Northern
Ireland. Heterosexuals can. Same sex couples will have limited
countries in which they will be accepted and you cannot conduct
marriages in those countries without their permission. Same sex cannot
get married in the Church of England, but heterosexuals can. Instead of
equality we will have created a whole raft of

McAvoy:</Member></B> My Lords, I come to this debate with a
traditional, basic approach that marriage is between a man and a woman.
I am also informed by my life experience of having witnessed over the
years the treatment of homosexual people in society, with adult men in
jail, persecution, and all sorts of real bigotry—not just verbal
bigotry and hurtful language—against such people. This really
was persecution. Recently, I met a young gay Catholic man who was in
turmoil about his sexuality, but he still opposed what is wrongly
called “equal marriage”; it is same-sex marriage. Hurtful
language is a two-way street. To be called a homophobic bigot because
you take a traditional point of view is also

it is not free and easy now, but there has been a big change in society

Lord Cormack, mentioned, it is not on the back of a great a wave of
support for changing the agreed definition of marriage. Surely,
cultural and social change in this country comes about when the mass of
the public takes the point of view that it is time for change. Over a
number of years the public has shown that it is time for a change in
the way in which society regards homosexual people. They have been
treated disgracefully for centuries and it is time that it

like to think that the moves taken by the Labour Government, supported
by many Conservatives, changed society so that it is now acceptable.
Peter Tatchell has been mentioned. We are a long way from the

of homosexual aspiration. To many loving couples it is the beginning of
the end—the beginning of the end of an inequality that they feel
does not accord their love the same profound dignity as is given to men
and women. Since many men and women who get married have no intention
of creating children, to see marriage as instituted purely for
procreation, wonderful though that is, is to take a somewhat narrow and
blinkered view of where we now are in our society. This
House, and indeed Parliament, must now be visionary. In 50
years’ time, probably much less, I suspect that we will look
back and see gay marriage as having been as inevitable as the abolition
of slavery, the emancipation of women and the decriminalising of
homosexual acts between consenting
adults.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000011">Among
your Lordships, I would probably be among the last to have a direct
line to the thinking of the

would shine out radiantly as a presiding desire—transcending,
and regardless of, gender or the semantics and legalese of how those
attachments are formulated in contract. Finally, having admitted that I
do not have a hotline to the Almighty, I now feel slightly more that I
resemble a parrot because this has been said many times before.
However, I must end with it. The vote in the other place was a free
vote and that means, if I understand it correctly, that it has a
democratic mandate that this House normally feels it must bow before.

House. It is a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and to
have listened to so many fine speeches. Like so many others, my postbag
has overflowed. Most of the letters on paper are against the Bill,
while the vast majority of those sent by e-mail and Twitter are in

“anti” mail is clearly organised, but there is no harm in
that. It does not make the views expressed any less relevant. Putting
aside those letters that are clearly homophobic and written with green
ink in the margin, the overriding message is the appeal to support
“the traditional approach to marriage”. As a
Conservative, I am rather fond of tradition but I must admit that I am
at a loss to understand precisely what is meant by “traditional
marriage”. How traditional do you want? As traditional, perhaps,
as that well known fan of marriage, Henry VIII; or as traditional as
the approach that once decreed that marriage had to be for life, no
matter the outrages involved; or the more recent traditional approach
that denied a divorced person the privilege of remarrying in a church.
There is no traditional approach to marriage. It is an institution that
has always changed over time and does not stand frozen in a single
moment of morality. It moves; it adapts.</hs_para>

introduced this Bill at this time. There has been no great public
outcry for it, not after the successful introduction of civil
partnerships. It seems to me that the differences between a civil
partnership and a marriage are so fine as to be almost transparent and
cast no great shadow. Yet the Bill is here—the pebble in the
shoe—and it has to be dealt with before we can move on. I know
that it was not in any manifesto or in the Queen’s Speech, which
was perhaps a pity, but this issue must be dealt with on its merits and
not judged by how it got
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000015">What
should I, as a Conservative, feel about gay marriage? I do not believe
in equality—I leave that rather charming nostrum to our friends
on the Labour Benches— but in equal opportunity. That is getting
closer to it. At the heart of this matter is that we are all born
unique and different, while at the heart of my conservatism is that no
one should be discriminated against because of how they were born. I do
not know any man or woman who has found it easy being born gay. I have
not met a single one who would have actively chosen that route, with
all its discrimination and denigration, and with the embarrassments,
injustices and outright hatreds that were and still are put in the 
<?notus-xml column=1008?>way. However, we are what we are—what we have been
born—and I will not look a gay man or woman in the eye and say,
“You are inferior just because you were born different to
me”, any more than I would do that to someone who was black or
brown, or a woman or blind. We are surely way beyond that, so despite
the fact that I believe that this Bill needs more work I will be
supporting its principle and doing so as a Conservative.</hs_para>

final point, on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dear. I have
sincere personal regard for the noble Lord but on this issue I differ
with him completely. It would do great damage to this place and to the
legitimacy of this House if we were to destroy a Bill that has been
given such an overwhelming majority on a free vote in the House of
Commons. It would make this unelected House look out of touch,
irrelevant and obsolete. It would bring back from the dead all those
silly and shallow things that the Deputy Prime Minister keeps muttering
about us. Our duty in this House is to revise, not to ruin, and to
improve rather than oppose to the point of destruction. We have fought
so hard in recent months to secure the future of this House and for

Singh of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, concern for social justice
and human rights are basic to Sikh teaching, and I was
delighted when the homosexual community was given full protection and
dignity under the law through civil partnerships. It is, however,
important to remember that social equality and respect for difference
is quite different from the pursuit of uniformity and sameness and the
deliberate masking of difference by changing the accepted meaning of
language—in this case, the accepted meaning of marriage. In
this, I share the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours.</hs_para>

that we are all different. We all differ in our physical and mental
attributes, and in our dislikes and preferences. Most people form
opposite-sex partnerships, giving birth to children and nurturing them
in the family unit. This type of relationship, defined by the
parameters of declared commitment, consummation of the relationship and
social commitment for the nurture and care of the family, has long been
defined as marriage. Difference should be respected. While same-sex
partnerships are primarily for adult companionship, they do not share
the same social responsibilities and parameters that define
“marriage” in so many different religions and cultures.
What I fail to understand is the pretence that marriage, with its
clearly defined parameters and attached responsibilities, is the same
as same-sex adult companionship when everyone outside Westminster knows
there is a world of
difference.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000019">There
is no evidence of majority support for this measure, even in the gay

in a civil partnership, is implacably opposed to gay marriage. David
Starkey, the openly gay historian, is also opposed to the concept of
gay 
<?notus-xml column=1009?>marriage. The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who was the first Cabinet Minister
to enter into a civil partnership, has openly criticised the idea of
gay marriage, saying that the move to smash centuries of church
teaching is “pure politics” and not wanted by the gay
community, which has already won equality through civil
partnerships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000020">There
is no end of statistics which show that children’s life chances
are linked to stable relationships to natural parents. If marriage is
diluted to become no more than adult companionship, this will simply
add to a growing focus on adult happiness to the inevitable neglect of
our children, with more and more being taken into what we call care. If
a committed relationship is all-important, where is the logic in not
extending this to bigamous relationships? After all, there are more
Muslims in this country than gays. Why discriminate against this
particular religious community? Blind pursuit of unthinking equality
can have unforeseen consequences. In mathematics, if you want to see

came into politics initially at the time of Harold Macmillan. Harold
Macmillan believed that the duty of a Conservative was to conserve and
protect that which was good and to replace and mend only that which had
had its day or was broken. This Bill defies that principle. It is
profoundly un-Conservative. Marriage is not broken. I have not heard
anybody today suggest that it is. It is good and we should be seeking
to conserve and protect it. Instead, this Bill seeks fundamentally to
alter
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000027">Undeniably<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:05:33"></hs_TimeCode>,

lawyer. When I was called to the Bar in Scotland you could get married
across an anvil at Gretna Green. You could also get married to what was
known as your bidie-in, your long-term partner; if you had been living
with them long enough you could go to the law and say, “Can you
please now pronounce us man and wife?”. That was all that had to

fundamental thing has never altered: marriage is between a man and a

me make one thing aggressively clear. I am not in any way anti-gay.
Nobody who knows me would ever accuse me of being so. I have attended
wonderful celebrations of civil partnerships where same-sex couples who

them whether they agreed with it; they were asked only whether they
agreed with the way it was going to be taken forward. They quite

that people instinctively believe is between a man and a woman. Of
course, Parliament is sovereign. Within its own jurisdiction it can
change the legal definition of marriage. I have to accept that. This
Bill may well do so. But for all its sovereignty, what Parliament
cannot do is change the fundamental meaning of marriage any more than
King Canute, for all his sovereignty, could order and change the

suggest that the opposite is the case. We risk making marriage into a
stone idol, rather than a living, life-enhancing experience, by denying
it to same-sex couples. With a few exceptions, I have been deeply
disappointed by the contributions to the debate from the leaders of my
faith. They seem to dwell on the concept of the institution of
marriage. Institutions are often dark, dull, dusty places and none can
survive without being revisited and refreshed; maybe your

is a vocation, a response to a divine call rather than a set of dusty,

is far more than a legal contract. Marriage is a response to
God’s call to love, and I see no reason why that should be
limited to being between women and men. I believe the preface of the
Welsh marriage service teaches correctly. God calls men and women to
the married state, and that call, if it is between two men or two

Dannatt:</Member></B> My Lords, time is short and there are many
speakers in this debate. Therefore, like others, I will aim to be
concise. I have four comments to make about the Bill. In my opinion the
process of the Bill is and has been flawed; the purpose of the Bill is
misleading; the premise of the Bill is worrying; and the atmosphere
created by the tabling of the Bill is potentially divisive, and I
regret that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060330000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000045">Allow me to
substantiate those four assertions. First, the process of the Bill is
flawed. Little I can say here is new, but the facts speak for
themselves and are important and bear repetition. A Bill such as this
did not feature explicitly in any of three major parties’
manifestos at the general election. It did not appear in either of the
last two Queen’s Speeches. The formal consultation process, as
we have heard, was purely on the basis of how this redefinition of
marriage was to be conducted, not whether it should be conducted. At
least that was how it was initially. Moreover the consultation counted
only as one view the consolidated views of between half and two-thirds
of a million citizens who signed the Coalition for Marriage petition,
each giving verifiable addresses. Only a short period was allocated for
debate in the other place, where there are also doubts—and they
have been expressed today—as to how free the supposed free vote
in the other place was, not to mention the composition of the committee
that gave cursory consideration to the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000046">Secondly,
I suggest that the purpose of the Bill is misleading. It is supposed to
redefine marriage so it becomes as equal an institution between
same-sex couples as it is between a man and woman. This
purpose is a contradiction in terms. A redefinition of marriage cannot
bring equality. The defining process of marriage 
<?notus-xml column=1014?>is consummation, which is for the entirely practical purpose of bringing
children into the world—the creation of families which have been
the building block of society for centuries. The marriage of two men or
two women cannot naturally bring about the purpose of marriage; legally
perhaps, but naturally
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000047">Thirdly,
I believe the premise of the Bill is worrying. It is supposed to
promote the rights of a minority within our population by affording
that minority a supposed equality in marriage. I have already argued
that that cannot be so, but in the erroneous pursuit of that supposed
equality, a Bill that is designed to promote the interests of a
minority itself becomes a powerful piece of legislation that threatens
the traditional interests of a majority of our population. The supposed
safeguards being written into the Bill to protect the rights of many
sections of our society to express the traditional view of marriage in
private and in public will not be worth the paper they are written on.
The inexorable march of litigation will frustrate over time whatever
Parliament may, or may not, have
intended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000048">Fourthly,
I fear that the atmosphere created by the tabling of the Bill is
potentially divisive. For decades there have been vigorous debates
about the acceptability of homosexual orientation and lifestyles.
Tempers have been raised and emotions have flowed, but whatever
individuals thought about homosexual or heterosexual lifestyles, an
atmosphere of acceptance and tolerance has been established in all but
the most narrow-minded circles. The tabling of the Bill runs the risk
of driving a cart and horses through that atmosphere, which has been
carefully built up, of acceptance building on previous tolerance. In
2008, I became the first chief of staff of any of the three armed
services to give the opening address at the Armed Forces annual LGBT
conference. My theme in that address focused on one of the
Army’s six core values—respect for others. I
may not personally have understood or approved the circumstances of
those who were members of the Armed Forces LGBT community but I had an
obligation to respect them as individuals. Such respect and tolerance
are being severely challenged by this ill-thought-through
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000049">In
conclusion, I soundly oppose this Bill for the four reasons I have
given but if I had to pick one of them as my principal ground of
objection and why I shall vote with the noble Lord, Lord Dear,

has, to date, been tantamount to an abuse of process which, as a member
of the mother of Parliaments, I am deeply uncomfortable about.
Following due democratic process and procedure is a principle that I
spent the 40 years of my professional life as a soldier
upholding. We fought for the ballot box against the Armalite for 38
years in Northern Ireland; we stood for democracy against communism for
44 years in Europe; we stood for the democratic right of

been enormously privileged to spend 36 years in this building, man and

the Government really respected the faith community, as they say they

Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:24:52"></hs_TimeCode> Dobbs gave
us a very enjoyable piece about not understanding what traditional
marriage is. That got me thinking, although I have done no survey, that
most of the Members of your Lordships’ House will have been
married, probably most in church. Therefore we will all have acquiesced
to a priest, pastor or vicar saying something to the effect that what
we were going through was one man, one woman, and for this reason you
leave father and mother to become one being, exclusively for life, and
for procreation. Not everybody gets it right, but that is what was
defined as the traditional marriage. The words are the words of Jesus,
and when Jesus used them, they were the words of creation. Therefore,
as a practicing Christian, I have a problem with this legislation,
because I do not believe that it respects faith and the sincerely held
views of those in the faith community.</hs_para>

is also hard to have respect for this Bill politically. In May 2010 the
Prime Minister said that there would not be any legislation. Seventeen
months later he was cheered to the rafters by a Conservative Party
conference when he told them that he was in favour of same-sex marriage
because he was a Conservative. I will tell you something—he will
not try that again in 2013. It will not happen. It is hard to have
political respect and hard to have it off the back of what passed for a
public consultation. Those in this House who know me well will not be
surprised if I say that I was brought up on gospel stories. When I saw
the public consultation I was rather irreverently reminded of Jesus
turning water into wine. This Government turned half a million votes
into one vote in order to get 53% in favour when actually 87% were
against. Forgive me, but I cannot have respect for that sort of
behaviour.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Mawhinney, has just said. However, let us agree that the
Bill has the noblest of aims: advancing the cause of fairness and
equality to a minority absurdly disparaged and cruelly treated, not
only in centuries past but in many societies even today. However, the
Bill’s aims must be addressed with forethought and wisdom, of
which it shows an embarrassing deficiency at present. I, too, urge the
Government to withdraw this current muddled and flawed attempt. The
equality that it purports to seek is a cheapened version of spurious
uniformity in glaring defiance of reality. Our gay community, talented

looked at the Bill, whether amendments could bring it up to scratch. In
places, they clearly might. In Clause 9(7), for example, the Bill
enables the conversion of civil partnerships to marriage, but permits
such conversion to have an effective date that would be several years
before the relevant form of marriage became legally possible. There,
surely, is an absurd anomaly that could be rectified by
amendment.</hs_para>

have been said about the Bill. Nevertheless, I will repeat some of them
because I 
<?notus-xml column=1017?>want my views to be on record. The first thing I want to say is that the
Bill is an outrage to democracy. No political party had the guts to
include this measure in its manifesto. It is a measure that undermines
the concept of marriage that has lasted for centuries. The Bill, as we
have heard, was rushed through the House of Commons, ignoring the
generally accepted rule that Bills with constitutional implications
should be discussed on the Floor of the House rather than in Committee.
That point was previously raised by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby. Under
this circumstance, this House has not only the right to return the Bill
to the Commons but the duty to do so, because it does not have the
wholehearted consent of the House of Commons or, indeed, of this place
or the country as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:35:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I want it
returned to the Commons because I believe that it should reconsider its
position and either delay the Bill until the next election, when it can

it, which indeed I shall do by supporting the amendment tabled by the
noble Lord, Lord Dear. We have heard claims that the public are all for
this Bill; we have heard all sorts of figures bandied around. My
postbag and e-mails do not show that. Indeed, I well remember being
told that an overwhelming number of people in the country supported AV
and that it was more democratic. However, when we had a referendum on
it, only about one-quarter of them thought it was a good thing. We had
the same problem over regional government; when that was put to the
vote, after it had been lauded by the then Government, who presumably
believed that the people were for it, in the Prime Minister’s
own constituency they voted against it by 3.5 to one. Therefore, we
should be very careful about the claim that is being made that a large
majority of the country is in favour of this
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:38:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000064">Those
who have written to me find themselves in a situation where they feel
that they cannot be heard. Indeed, I have to say that when the three
parties agree to anything we lose our democracy. We are, in fact, in
respect of this Bill, living in a one-party state, because the
electorate can do nothing about it. Bills are rushed through. The major
political parties believe, cynically, that since they are all in favour
of it, at the next election people opposed to it will have nowhere else
to go—that all the parties are in favour of it, so people cannot
vote for an alternative. Of course, they can do 
<?notus-xml column=1018?>other things, such as abstaining or voting against all those parties and

Tebbit:</Member></B> My Lords, this Bill is promoted as a measure to
end a discrimination against homosexuals, but the present law of
marriage does not discriminate against homosexuals. The rights of a
homosexual man are identical to mine. Subject to the laws on incest and
bigamy, we are each free to marry a woman. Neither he nor I may marry
another man. Our positions are identical. If it were to be held that
the wish of a homosexual man to marry another man being thwarted by law
was proof of discrimination, then the law forbidding polygamy would
equally be proof of discrimination. Therefore, undoubtedly, we should
move, on the basis of the arguments that have been put forward in
favour of this Bill, towards making lawful the marriage of one man with
two or more women, or a woman with more than one
man<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000066">It
does not end there. The claim that the Bill merely undoes an act of
discrimination is false; it is worthless and deserves no credibility.
Those who support this Bill must find some other reason for it than
that. If the Bill were to be enacted, it would introduce a real and
novel form of discrimination. I understand that there is no definition
of how a same-sex marriage would be consummated, or of what would be
regarded as adultery in a same-sex marriage. Therefore, a heterosexual
marriage would stand liable to annulment because of non-consummation
but a homosexual marriage would
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:42:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Similarly,
a heterosexual husband or wife might be found to have committed
adultery, whereas a homosexual could not be found to have committed
adultery. That is real discrimination. Then, of course, we would have
to change the law for heterosexual marriage to bring it into line with
homosexual marriage and abolish adultery and non-consummation. That
would be
madness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:42:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000067">Then
there is the matter of the law of succession and its interaction with
this Bill. There is, I believe, no bar to a lesbian succeeding to the
Throne. It may happen. It probably will, at some stage. What, then, if
she marries and her partner bears a child by an anonymous sperm donor?
Is that child the heir to the Throne? If the Queen herself subsequently
bore a child by an anonymous donor, which child then, if either, would
inherit the Throne? The possibilities must have been discussed in the
deep consideration of this Bill in government, so the Minister must
know the answer. If she does not know it immediately, I am sure that
her officials will be able to give it to her, because it has all been

my concern for those employed in schools and churches. Would their jobs
be at risk should they question the new orthodoxy? Section 28 of the

denounced by the liberal establishment. This Bill seems to require

teaching profession. Marriage exists not just for the convenience of
couples but to stabilise society. It seems to me that this House would

of my views on this subject, to which I will come in a moment, I
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dear, on taking time and trouble, and
displaying considerable courage, in bringing forward the amendment and
arguing for it extremely well. By doing so, he has, at the very least,
ensured that today’s debate is a great deal more serious and
intense than it would have been if the result had been a foregone
conclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:47:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000072">I
may be the first speaker who has deliberately refrained from taking a
decision on how I will vote tomorrow until I have heard the debate.
Incidentally, I share the view that the Government’s conduct on
this Bill has been pretty unedifying. In my view, it should have been
brought in as a Private Member’s Bill. It has nothing to do with
party politics or the governance of the state and was not mentioned in
any manifesto. The consultation exercise was clearly perfunctory, to
say the least, and may have been dishonest and falsified if it is
true—I pray that it is not—that a petition of half a
million people was counted as the expression of one view. That is the
sort of legalistic trickery one normally associates with Putin’s
Russia, and it would be very deplorable if it has happened here.
Nevertheless, these are not the essential points on which we will
vote.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060330000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000073">I shall
certainly vote as I do not believe in abstention. I am minded to vote
for the Bill on the basis of two principles by which I always try to be
guided. One is the liberty principle, first explicitly formulated by
Mill, which was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Dear, in his
introductory speech. It states that in a free society the state does
not attempt to constrain the liberty of the citizen beyond the minimum
point required to defend the liberty of others. Therefore, if you have
two potential partners to a marriage or any other 
<?notus-xml column=1020?>ceremony and someone willing to perform the ceremony, be he or she a
priest, a minister of religion, a registrar or whoever, what right does
the state have to prevent that taking place? That is a very pertinent
and relevant
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:48:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000074">The
other principle that I always try to be guided by is the Pareto
principle, which says that in any structure of social relationships,
whether or not enshrined in the law, if a change can be made such that
even just one person is happier and no one is made less happy, that
change should automatically be made. It seems to me that if we enact
this Bill, we will make an awful lot of people very happy. Some say
that it will make some people unhappy, but I do not accept that that is
the equivalent emotion. The noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, and some other
distinguished noble Lords who have spoken this evening, disapprove of
what is going on, but disapproval is not quite the same thing. Their
own particular liberties, their own interests and their own utility are
not impacted, so I do not think that that is
relevant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000075">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:49:45"></hs_TimeCode>
am minded, broadly speaking, to vote for this Bill, but I have two very
serious reservations that I will put to the Minister. One of these,
thank God, has been raised by many noble Lords this evening, and I will
add to the list of those who have emphasised it. The other has not been
mentioned at all. The one that has been mentioned is the fate of people
who might lose their jobs as a result of this Bill being enacted. We
should all be extremely concerned about that. What about registrars,
whom no one has mentioned? As I read the Bill, registrars, unlike
priests and ministers of religion, will not have the opportunity to opt
out. Are they all going to be fired? Are they going to be compensated?
Is a decent effort going to be made to find them another decent job? We
need to know. We cannot possibly allow this Bill to go on the statute
book without having an answer to those
questions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000076">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>
about teachers? I also read the legal counsel’s opinion to which
the noble Lord, Lord Dear, referred, so I need not summarise it. It
states, very persuasively, that there is all too great a danger that
teachers will lose their jobs if they continue to express the view that
the proper concept of marriage is the traditional one, as we understand
it. The noble Baroness, Lady Stowell, went a long way to meeting
me—and, indeed, the House—on this in her remarks from the
Front Bench when she said that the Government intended that there
should be effective protections and were prepared to strengthen the
Bill to make sure that those protections were more effective. The
Government were not prepared to accept amendments in the other place,
but I took it that there would be a greater degree of flexibility,
perhaps as a result of this debate and of the reaction in the country.
If that is the case, I welcome it. If the Bill goes forward, I shall
certainly refer to the earlier assurance from the noble Baroness, Lady
Stowell, which will be very relevant to proceedings in Committee and on
Report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:51:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060330000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0002.htm#13060330000077">The
other reservation and concern on which I must be satisfied if I am
going to vote against the amendment and for Second Reading relates to
the issue of legal blackmail. It is all too possible that, even if the
law is totally robust, a teacher or a priest who has tried to opt out,
or somebody else who is, or should be, protected 
<?notus-xml column=1021?>under the Bill, may be attacked at law by a possibly aggressive gay
rights organisation. The case may go up through the courts to the
Supreme Court, even to the European Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, where ultimately the protections will prove to be robust
and effective. However, how can a poor individual citizen possibly face
a movement with millions of pounds to spend on lawyers who
would certainly not, in this case, be working on a contingency or
conditional fee basis? This thing could go on for years, running up
millions of pounds and totally disrupting the life of the
plaintiff—or defendant, depending on whether it was a civil or
criminal action, though from a practical point of view the result would
be very similar. We must be assured that would not happen. Who would
pay the legal fees in the case of a priest in the Church of England or
another church? Churches’ money should not be spent on defending
a person finding himself in that position. Someone earning
£15,000 a year cannot be expected to find millions of pounds to
pursue his own defence. I would need a robust answer to that question
before I would be prepared to support the

legislation came to your Lordships’ House, I spoke strongly in

protections or development of the legislation, I would continue to
speak very strongly and passionately for it. However, I am not speaking
from the place I normally sit as Convenor because my views about this

because many of those who have spoken, and many outside, feel very
passionately and sensitively about these things, and I have listened
carefully to my noble friend Lady Barker, the noble Lords, Lord Smith

strongly of their personal experience and their strong feelings and
sense of hurt at times. However, others have spoken crisply and I have

is important for us to consider what is being proposed. No one disputes
that it is a major change, and it is for the proponents of change to
make their argument persuasively, not the reverse. I am not opposed to
change, and the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, pointed out that there
have been many changes in the institution of marriage over the years.
At other times, she said, polygamy was possible. She could also have
said, “and currently in other places”. In our part of the
world it is illegal. The age of consent for marriage has not been the
same at all times, nor has it always moved in one direction.</hs_para>

Blair of Boughton, was not correct when he said that the tide of
history flows always in one direction—would that it were so. In 
<?notus-xml column=1022?>many parts of the world it is flowing in a very different direction and
that is one of the great dangers of which we must be aware when we
espouse social change of a major order. My noble friend Lord Lothian
made the point—and I share many of his concerns about conflict
in various parts of the world—that if one does not take the
people with one in a social change, one can actually provoke reaction
against it. I give one example: I am a member of the Presbyterian
Church in Ireland and it is clear that there is a stream against
continuing with the ordination of women, which we have had since 1927.
It is not at all impossible that it might be reversed; it was reversed
some years ago in the Presbyterian Church in Australia. Therefore, the
tide of history does not always flow in one direction, and it can be

does the community want? The electorate are often much more fickle,
saying one thing now and a very different thing a little while later.
Have the Government made the argument? My noble friend Lady Stowell of
Beeston made a thoughtful speech. I noted that she said, near the end,
that quite simply the love and relationship are the same and therefore
should be included in marriage. I had not even finished noting it down
before she said that of course the relationships were different. Both
statements cannot be entirely true. In a way, her jest—sometimes
the truth is spoken in jest, and she mentioned George
Clooney—said a lot because it pointed out that the thought of
marriage is for many people about merely a sense of attraction, the
wish to be with a person and the wish for that to be permanent. There
was not much sense of looking at the other components of marriage that
are also important but are not necessarily a part of civil partnership.
The bringing into being of children, nurturing them and bringing them
up are not things of little importance.</hs_para>

is therefore important to persuade, and I am not persuaded that the
talk of equality is not being mistaken for sameness in the minds of
some people. Yet the truth is that equality is about recognising
difference, diversity and treating people fairly, not trying to ensure
that everyone fits into the same institution. The Bill will not achieve
what it is said to achieve for gay Christians who wish to solemnise
their marriage in churches. It will not happen unless what happens is
similar to what the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury, referred to
when he talked about those who had spoken in favour of civil
partnerships having changed their minds about whether they were going
to press for same-sex marriage. Could it be that we find ourselves
returning to this issue again in this House in debate and in
legislation because, once achieved, there would be unhappiness that all
the main churches were still not prepared to accept this matter? Unless
one was a Quaker, liberal Jew or Unitarian, it still would not be
possible to solemnise a marriage in a church. Would we return to the
issue? I fear that we would do so again and again. The arguments must
be clear, thoughtful and robust. This is not the only issue of equality
whereby the notions of sameness and uniformity seem to have grasped
people and they no longer understand equality in any other
way.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060330000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#13060330000084">My time

first is a practical argument, based on my long time in business. In
2007, I resigned as CEO of BP because of the lengths I went to in order

know if those fears were justified, but they are no way to do business.
People are happier, more productive and make more money for their

is sacred, and the role that it plays in binding together families and
nurturing children is an indispensable part of the fabric of our

be contemplating or debating. The fact that we are is a very sad
indicator of just how far our country has lost its moral compass or
perhaps of just how wide now has grown the gulf between the people and
those who govern them. I feel sure that millions of people share my

question that we need to face up to. Those proposing change usually
argue, as they have done today, in terms of equality. But with respect,
we are told that those in same-sex relationships already have parity
with marriage through civil partnerships, which give them equal rights.
Equality is hardly the right term to use when comparing same-sex
couples with those who are married, not least because marriage is not,
and has never been, viewed in terms of sameness, as the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Chester mentioned earlier, but of
difference—the difference of male and female, which creates and

are resisting change are not doing so because we are cussed or bigoted,
but because of the fundamental principle that marriage can only be

will end by making this point. I have no doubt whatever that should
this Bill pass, marriage as we know it will be weakened and diminished.
I do not believe that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples
will strengthen it, as the Home Secretary has declared on several
occasions. Recent research in countries where the marriage of same-sex
couples is already a reality shows the collapse of traditional
marriages alongside same-sex marriages. When we vote on the Bill
tomorrow, we need to bear this evidence in mind. We shall all follow

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, it seems to me that one of the
difficulties we have when faced with something that appears to be so
new is that we cannot quite imagine what it must have been like when
something like this happened in the past. However, there is a direct
19th century parallel to the debate we are having here. It was the
argument about the right of a man to marry his deceased wife’s
sister. That battle was horrendous. The Table of Kindred and Affinity,
that schoolboy refuge from boring sermons, specifically forbids such a
union. It is the same chapter of Leviticus that condemns gay sex, and
it called marriage with your dead wife’s sister an abomination.
On that basis, your Lordships’ House stopped reform from 1835
right up to 1907. Last week, I reread the arguments of 
<?notus-xml column=1027?>those who scuppered the reform, and I fear that I have heard them all
again today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:16:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
Your Lordships then complained about rushed legislation. They said that
it would be the end of marriage and that it would encourage incest.
They hinted at polygamy. They said in particular that for 2,000 years
such an outrageous thing had never been contemplated, and yet, once
passed, that most controversial of Acts was wholly accepted. The Church
of England revised the Table of Kindred and Affinity so that what was
once an abomination is now holy
matrimony.</hs_para>

did it. Once we understood consanguinity, we distinguished between
relationships that were genetically dangerous and those which were
simply culturally arguable, and so it is with gay marriage.
Once we understand scientifically that some people are
solely attracted to their own sex, we realise that homosexual practice
is not heterosexuals behaving badly, but gay people behaving naturally.
That automatically means that the state can no longer
exclude this minority. As a result, in my lifetime we have moved from
criminalisation almost to equality. Today, we have the
chance to complete that journey, to accept the science, and to allow
civil marriage for
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306045000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306045000003">This is
civil marriage. State marriage has diverged from church teaching for
more than 150 years; some would even say since Henry VIII rigged the
rules to his own advantage, but that would be an embarrassment to some
Members of this noble House. As a convert Catholic, I have chosen to
accept that Christian marriage is about procreation, that it is
indissoluble, and that there is no such thing as divorce. Yet, as a
parliamentarian, I cannot demand that non-Catholics should accept that
definition. As the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey, has
reminded us on other occasions, marriage is owned neither by church nor
state. Otherwise, I have to say to the noble and right reverend Lord
that I am worried about the basis of his theology. It seems to be stuck
in an earlier age. There are no echoes of René Girard, one of
the greatest theologians of our time. There is no word from Dom
Sebastian Moore, not a touch of James Alison. It remains a theology
that has not come to terms with Freud. In that it is a precise parallel
with the 19th-century bishops who spoke here in that debate and who
like Samuel Wilberforce had a theology that could not admit of
Darwin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306045000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306045000004">There

not express their love in that way. Married for 37 years, I find that

would like to cite and pay tribute to a colleague of mine at
Loughborough University, who has been at the forefront of the battle
for equal marriage, Professor Sue Wilkinson, and to her partner, a
former colleague of mine, Professor Celia Kitzinger. They married in
Canada when Professor Wilkinson was based there, only for their
marriage to be automatically deemed a civil partnership in this country
when she returned. That for them was not equality. The noble Lord, Lord
Deben, has explained extremely well why it was not equivalent. They

marriage is open only to heterosexuals, and civil partnerships only to
lesbians and gay men, the British government is maintaining a symbolic

was one of those women who chose not to enter what I saw as a
patriarchal institution, even if the likes of George Clooney were

welcomed the possibility of a civil partnership—particularly
with Mr Clooney. The committee also questioned Ministers about the
costs argument that they had advanced. The Minister for Pensions cited
a figure of £3 billion to £4 billion, but later indicated
that this figure referred to the cost of total equality in public
service pension schemes. Of course, the Bill does not end
discrimination in pension schemes, an issue that was raised in the
Commons. Could the Minister now provide a more accurate and focused
estimate of the cost of extending civil partnerships to opposite-sex
couples?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306045000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306045000015">In

agree with the noble Baroness. Many speakers today have pointed to the
social changes of the past 50 or more years. I do not, however, believe

case to the full.</hs_para>

the fine old English and French word “gay” has, in my

population. The result is that it can no longer be used in its original
and 
<?notus-xml column=1030?>rather delightful meaning. Now, under the pretext of securing equality,
Her Majesty’s Government are proposing to change the meaning of
marriage. It is surprising that the leaders of the Conservative Party,
who might be expected to uphold traditional values, should lend
themselves to this attempt. My noble friend Lord Dear and others have
pointed out the constitutional and procedural defects of this Bill, so
I will not repeat them. I do however agree with those who have
identified unintended and unanticipated
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:29:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:29:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306045000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306045000018">After
these criticisms, I will try to be constructive. Civil partnerships are
already recognised in and defined by law. Surely the whole country

lightly but rather with the intention of permanence, as several noble
Lords have already
argued<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:30:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Why
should civil marriage be considered a second-best choice or a
“make do”, as the noble Lord, Lord Deben, put it, which
somehow must be promoted to equality with marriage? Those who are in or
who propose to enter civil partnerships have a responsibility to live
in such a way that their status deserves as much respect as that of
married

conclude that the whole matter has not been adequately considered. It

me. Why are you doing that? You’re pleading that you want this

against me because I’m saying that I’m going to vote
against it”. Then he said, “It’s not you we want,

unfair”. I said, “Look, my concern here is that this is
introducing a new division and a new disturbance into British society
at exactly a moment when we ought to be putting all of that behind us

was absolutely amazing, was from a major research organisation, stating
that homosexuality was good because it was an essential part of the
evolutionary process for the human psyche. I am still trying to work
that one out. As for the rest, everything has been a heartfelt

live in West Sussex, where we have a very strange situation. On the
border of the diocese of Chichester, we have two villages called
Eartham and Slindon. They are a case study in how the British public
reacts. Eartham is a Catholic community and Slindon is Protestant. On
one day each in the past 450 years, the populations of those two
villages have got up, presumably had a good breakfast and gone out with
the express intention of massacring the entire population of the other.
They both failed, but they had a very good go at it. The point is that
two villages can hate each other to that extent on religious principle
and do it for so

have now at last got it sorted out. The tragedy of Slindon and Eartham
is the first thing that strikes you when you walk into them: there are
no war memorials for the First World War. That is serious. If you do
not have a war memorial in a village, it means one of two things. It
usually means that somebody in that village was executed for desertion
and, therefore, the village is suffering from shame and shock and will
not put up a war memorial. In Slindon and Eartham there are no war
memorials, but not for that reason. The reason is that when you look at
the names of the people who died there—a lot died at the first
Ypres—the same names appear on the Catholic and Protestant
registers. They are not the same people. They are brothers divided by
their religion, which is shocking. That they can live together, go to
war together and die together, but not be remembered together, is an
outrage. I hope that the right reverend Prelates in front of me will
give some serious thought to the possibility that there is a wonderful
opportunity for the Church of England to commemorate the outbreak of
the First World War next year by setting about a systematic correction
of all the missing war memorials in the country to include the 304,000
people who were led out by Protestant priests to face the firing squad.

heard enough of today is “marginalisation”. There is a
real prospect of marginalisation coming in here. I am particularly
unimpressed by the story of the Australian sexual equality board, which
received a complaint from the two opening batsmen of the Australian
women’s cricket team saying that they had been dropped because
they were the only two non-lesbians on the team. They wished to
complain, whereupon the board wrote back and said, “If you think
that this board exists to look after the interests of a couple of
straights like you, you have got another think coming. We exist only
for the sake of looking after the gays”. That is
marginalisation. The board then rather spoilt the argument by saying,
“In any event, ladies, neither of you scored enough runs to be

Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> My Lords, seven years ago, this House
considered the late Lord Joffe’s Bill on assisted dying for the
terminally ill. I had been here only a couple of years and found it
quite hard to make up my mind. I could see that the key was whether the
safeguards were sufficient or whether, in the urge to be
copper-bottomed, they had become too complex. I looked forward to
Second Reading, because I expected the arguments for and against, and
the merits and inadequacies of the various safeguards to be brought out
fully. I was shocked when this House refused a Second Reading. It
seemed to me that we had refused to do our job. That is how I feel
about the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dear, as he knows; he was
kind enough to tell me in advance of his intent, and I told him that I
could not support
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:38:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

eloquently shown, the Bill arouses strong feelings on all sides of this
House, as did the assisted dying Bill. I believe that there is a
majority in this country in favour of this Bill, though a much smaller
majority than was in favour of the assisted dying Bill. I believe that
on assisted dying, the majority is now greater than it then was. I hope
that when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, presents his Bill,
we will not make the mistake we made seven years ago.</hs_para>

difference between the two Bills. This is a government Bill that has
passed through the House of Commons. In his eloquent speech, the noble
Lord, Lord Dear, made four arguments to support his thesis that the
procedures so far have been undemocratic. First, he said that the Bill
had been in nobody’s manifesto and was not in the coalition
agreement. What new doctrine is this? Would we have abolished capital
punishment if it had been a requirement that it should first be in
somebody’s manifesto? Would Lord Jenkins, in his remarkable
tenure at the Home Office, have introduced the society-changing
reforms—wholly to the benefit of society, in my view—if
they had first to be in the Labour manifesto? They were not in the
Labour Party’s manifesto. I do not think absence of a reference
in a manifesto proves that this is undemocratic and I would be
surprised if students of Burke were to think
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Dear, argued that the Public Bill Committee was
skewed in its membership and that its discussions were
curtailed. Possibly—I do not know—but it seems a very odd
reaction to such a criticism to say that we should be denied any
Committee stage. If the Committee stage was too short in the Commons,
let us put that right in this place. Thirdly, he argued that the public
consultation was inadequate or in some way defective. I do not know
about that but let us explore that in our detailed discussions on this
Bill. Fourthly, he said that Members of Parliament were under pressure
from the party hierarchies and therefore it was not truly a free vote,
to which I can say only that Members of Parliament, like Members of
this House, are grown-ups. They make up their own
minds.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306045000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306045000031">Let us
remember that in the other place they face the electorate back in their
constituencies and if they are thought to have got it wrong they may
pay for that and realising that may affect how they vote. It comes
pretty oddly from this place, where we are not exactly paragons of
democratic accountability, to accuse the other place of an undemocratic
procedure in this case. I very much hope that the noble Lord, Lord

really have struggled with this issue. At first I would have followed
the noble Lord, Lord Dear, into the Lobby, should he press his
amendment to a vote, but two further matters occurred to me. First,
your Lordships sit here in this highly privileged position to hold the
Government to account, to look at legislation and to improve it where
necessary, bearing in mind always that the convention is that the
elected House—the other place—should prevail over the
unelected Chamber. This is a matter of considerable
constitutional importance. It is the way in which we make democratic
decisions. I have personal experience of wrecking two Bills at Second
Reading—it was enormous fun—the Boxing Bill and the late
Lord Diamond’s Peerage Bill, but they were both
Private Members’ Bills and they were fair game. This is a major
government Bill. We should at least give it a Second Reading. If we do
not, we will deserve to be targeted by the critics and opponents of our
very existence and that of this House. Our task is to improve this
Bill, no matter how imperfect and unsatisfactory we believe it to be,
by amendment and balanced argument on its passage through this
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:44:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to the views of many young people, the majority of whom I believe do
not consider this Bill to be an issue. On the television programme
“Question Time” recently, support for this Bill by young
people was clearly demonstrated. Those young people are the next
generation. We should listen to them and take their views into account.
They have a completely different view of homosexuality and a high
degree of toleration for what to many of my age is the elephant in the
room. I can quite understand homosexuality as a fact of everyday life,
but I find it extremely difficult to accept it as the norm. That is the
way that I think—that is me. However, an awful lot of water has
flowed under the bridge in the many years that I have been privileged
to spend in your Lordships’ House, and things in society have
changed vastly over that time. All these matters will continue to

However, when the Prime Minister and Mr Clegg refer to this Bill as
being a move to create equality, I really object. Heterosexual couples
who choose not to be married to one another for their own reasons
should be able to join in a civil partnership, should they so wish, and
as civil partners they should be able to enjoy all the same financial

form of Whip’s punishment. However, tonight it has been a

the House and on both sides of the debate, and to arguments that cross
parties, religion, and sometimes confound pre-held expectations of
allegiance. I suspect the reason for that unpredictability is that
every one of us in this House has formed a very personal view of both
marriage and homosexuality, forged sometimes by religious beliefs or by

prison; through discrimination, social ostracism, victimisation and,

Marriage provides the strongest glue there is to hold two people

they not be permitted to use the strongest glue there is—the

people who may lose their jobs, they will be explored and, I hope,
corrected if that worry is correct. Some of the letters I have had say

Cobbold:</Member></B> My Lords, marriage between a man and a woman has
been the bedrock of society over the centuries and has proved to be a
tried and trusted way of living and rearing children. The Bill that we
are debating threatens the sanctity of marriage by the forced
acceptance of same-sex couples. There are basically two levels to the
traditional definition of marriage: the secular civil partnership and
the religious commitment. The civil partnership is the practical
relationship between two individuals who have decided that they wish to
live together. The religious and spiritual part of the marriage
contract is defined by the particular religion that is
involved.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306045000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306045000046">The
civil partnership element of marriage rights is readily available to
same-sex couples. The question underlying this debate is whether the
state has the right to require religions to accept same-sex couples.
The Bill before us, in its 52 pages, argues that it does—but I
am one of the many speakers in this debate who do not accept that the
Government have the automatic right, and who therefore believe that the

Berridge:</Member></B> My Lords, this legislation brings into sharp
focus the role of another important institution in our
society—the state. It is an actor on this stage, promoting a
view of marriage, so it has a high duty to get the statutory framework
correct so that it preserves or actually encourages dissenting views in
the national and local public square. For many years, the public square
did not allow debate on immigration; any dissenters were racists and
shut out. Such silence brings, at best, outward conformity, and led, I
think, to more people walking past my flat on Saturday for the EDL than
would have done if there had been a free debate. Any Member’s
inbox will show<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:55:53"></hs_TimeCode>
how divisive this issue has become, and how strongly held the views
are, but the public square is again in danger of being shut down.
Dissenters are often automatically bigots or homophobic—or like
the state of Alabama making 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>Rosa Parks give up her seat on the bus. That is a false
analogy—and that racism label again, but in a way that it would
take more than a soundbite to
distinguish<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:56:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000004">Many
gay people do not support same sex marriage. Are they homophobic? It is
interesting to look at the exchanges in the other place between two
highly respected Members of Parliament, Mr Burrowes and Mr Lammy, with
Mr Lammy using a slave owner analogy and the ultimately mild-mannered
Mr Burrowes saying that this argument was pernicious,
offensive and playing the race card. Clearly, we cannot leave the
average bobby to police this on our streets without further guidance,
so this House will need to consider carefully amendments on free speech
that the Government conceded were needed in the other place. Until
these concessions, the Government argued that this Bill merely concerns
the conduct of the ceremony itself. But legislation affects culture,
debate and even atmosphere. Section 28 of the Local Government Act
reflected a state view on marriage, and the gay community complained
that the effect went much further than the words of the

state should have a view, but not a required orthodoxy. Healthy

cutting edge of jurisprudence, and lawyers are lining up on either side
of this debate. The
protections<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:57:59"></hs_TimeCode> must
work, because religious people are not going away. I hope that I have
been wrong in detecting something of an attitude that soon the Church
of England and other religious groups will get with the programme and
soon just join in with all the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice,
so eloquently stated, we cannot often predict the winds of change. This
may well prove to be a moment when we look back and see that the
Anglican Church put its stake in the sand in relation to marriage, and
we do not know where the views will end up in 40 years’ time. I

is interesting to note that western Europe has been out of step over

renewed leadership of the Anglican Church, I am optimistic. But even if
the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, is correct that the Strasbourg court will
not compel a religious organisation to conduct a same sex marriage, is
that all religious groups can hope for—mere non-compulsion? If a

I will speak about my role here today. The complaint that this Bill was

improve and scrutinise legislation. The religious groups are not, I am
afraid, generally content with this Bill, as my noble friend the

who believe that now they could be in an even more vulnerable position
than the Anglican Church, need us to do our job. If this vote defeats

termination, what is allowed or prohibited and restrictions on members

own, none has been understood to constitute marriage. Indeed, each of
these worthy objectives may be found embodied in other legal
arrangements. An agreement to share goods may be a valid contract, but
it is not marriage; nor does sexual union of itself constitute
marriage. Family units with children exist and have always existed
outside the bonds that are recognised as marriage. There are many forms
of human relationship for the support and encouragement of mutual love
and comfort that are not marriage. Yet now, a commitment to love and be

Shorn of the element of complementarity of genders, all marriage will

understanding that a marriage is not completed in the marriage

consummated—completed—in the sexual union of male and
female, and is voidable if it has not been consummated. However, with
the marriage of two people of the same sex, the proposed law says that

again, does not apply to marriages between those of the same sex. Where
is the equality in that? Therefore, a Bill predicated on the claim that
marriage should be equal and gender is irrelevant has to recognise that
this logic breaks down when confronted by the reality of marriage as
hitherto universally understood. However, the proposals contain their
own logic, which is that over time the historic understanding of
marriage must in law cease to exist. Despite this huge difficulty, I
have still tried to understand the motivation for this radical reform.
Why was civil partnership insufficient? Such partnerships already allow
couples to share the legal benefits of marriage and, if there are
remaining differences, it is easy to amend the law. I struggle to hear
what is missing. I do not underestimate the power of law to change
attitudes, but the question is, which law, and what is missing that
would make such a difference? A civil partnership is an act of
registration, simply recording in law what is already deemed to exist,
whereas marriage, in law, is seen as a “performative
act”. It brings something new into being, something that until
the exchange of vows and consummation did not exist. A desire for such
a performative act, a ritual, and an opportunity publicly to commit to
mutual love seemed to be aspirations which I could appreciate, and so
the law on civil partnership could be changed without depriving
marriage of its single, central
meaning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:07:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000014">However,
Clause 9 of the Bill provides for an existing civil partnership to be
transformed into a “marriage” simply by signing a
register. If one marriage is simply a matter of civil registration
without vows, performative acts or criteria for consummation, no
provision concerning 
<?notus-xml column=1040?>adultery, or presumption of parenthood, and if the word
“marriage” is to have a single coherent meaning, then for
every other marriage it must be the same. Marriage is now civil
partnership by another name. A basic understanding of marriage, in law,
will have irrevocably changed, and with one reality now bearing two
different labels; or we will have legislated into being two very
different realities, but confusingly bearing the same name. If that
happens, it raises huge issues about social cohesion, and a move away
from common shared values. I remain profoundly uncertain about the
legal position not just as regards the personal views of teachers but
as regards what may be taught in church schools. Are they to be allowed
to teach a traditional understanding of marriage, one which until now
church and state have shared, while in non-church schools a different
understanding is to be taught? If so, what will be the implications for
social cohesion as a result? Or will church schools be forced by law to
conform to a new understanding which has no roots in the doctrines of
any of the major faith communities, which then sets an extraordinary
precedent for the state’s power to determine articles of faith,
unparalleled outside the experience in history of repressive
ideological states of the extreme right and
left<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:09:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000015">Further,
what is to prevent other multiple understandings, including recognition
of polyamorous, polygamous and polyandrous relationships, being
legislated for in due course? That is the internal logic of tackling a

Saltoun of Abernethy:</Member></B> My Lords, 60 years ago, when I was
12 years old, I was prepared for confirmation. In those days,
confirmation was taken very seriously. We had to learn the whole
catechism by heart and be able to answer the questions in it correctly,
in the words of the Book of Common Prayer, not just in our own words.
We learnt about the sacraments and what a sacrament was: an outward and
visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. We learned that the two
most important sacraments necessary for salvation, ordained by Christ
himself, were baptism and holy communion. However, there were five
other sacraments, not mentioned in the catechism but listed in article
25 of the 39 articles of religion, of which the church seems to have
forgotten the existence. They are: confirmation, penance, holy orders,
holy matrimony and unction. All these five visible ceremonies have a
spiritual
dimension<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:11:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000018">I

the marriage Bill is highly emotive and induces strong feelings. I make

allowing two gay people to marry marriage would somehow no longer be
sacrosanct. They infer that their marriage would no longer mean what it
once did. I ask noble Lords to consider how their marriage would be
undermined, subverted or devalued simply by allowing two members of the
same sex the privilege that they themselves enjoy. I have come to the
conclusion that my marriage would be just as special the day before
this Bill is passed as it would be on the day after it was passed. I
suggest that as I was married in the eyes of the Lord, I would remain

of the issues that have come before this House over the past 20 years:
Section 28, lowering the age of consent, gay adoption and civil
partnerships, among others. These issues, bitterly opposed by some at
the time, have become widely accepted today. At those difficult
moments, we as a House recognised the need for change. We accepted that
our understandings of tradition no longer resonated with the modern
world. We therefore voted to change those understandings to better
reflect the generations growing up beneath us. As we did so, the new
settlement became the new tradition. That is to say, the necessities of

Gould of Potternewton:</Member></B> My Lords, I support noble Lords who
have spoken in favour of the Bill, but I wish to speak about the small
section of it that affects trans people, which has not been covered
sufficiently this evening. I should declare an interest as chair of the

people suffer not homophobia but transphobia, which in many ways is
more insidious and difficult to deal with than homophobia. I will give
a devastating example: the case of Lucy Meadows, a trans primary school
teacher who committed suicide after being pilloried and told by some of
the parents and the press in particular that because she had transed
she was not fit to be a teacher. The coroner told the gathered
reporters, “And to you the press, I say, ‘Shame, shame on
all of you’”. He was absolutely
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000027">However,
that is only one example of the discrimination that many trans people
experience because of the fear of supposed difference and the bigotry
expressed against a person who should be recognised and treated
respectfully and equally. Two aspects of the Bill correct some of the
current anomalies and accept that recognition. It is welcome that the
legislation provides for married trans people who wish to apply for
gender recognition. It removes the requirement for them to be single at
the point of gender recognition and thereby removes the obligation to
dissolve their existing marriage or civil partnership. Equally welcome
is the Government’s concession on spouse’s survivor
pensions, which will ensure that no ongoing financial penalty will be
incurred should a trans person in an existing marriage gain gender
recognition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:19:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000028">There
are, however, other fundamental issues that continue to present major
concerns for trans people in existing marriages. Schedule 5 to the Bill
is designed to amend the Gender Recognition Act 2004, so that the
requirement for an applicant to have dissolved any existing marriage is
removed. The effect is that that the trans person’s spouse must
grant consent for the trans person’s gender recognition. If that
spouse refuses to give that consent or cannot be contacted, the trans
person cannot gain gender recognition without ending the marriage. That
seems unfair and surely a discrimination that has to be removed. It has
been said that that is not a veto. One might not use that word but, to
me, it is a way of saying no. I am not quite sure what the difference
between “veto” and “no”
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:20:58"></hs_TimeCode>. It has also

to the suggestion that this should be removed is, “Get out of

that simple. The courts would have to rely on one person’s word

I want to come to is this. I was convinced by those letters and e-mails
of the genuineness of the hurt felt by the homosexual minority in our

minority always generates tensions between the minority and the
surrounding majority in both directions. The Government have a policy
of social cohesion. Despite that, they went to their unsuspected ivory
tower, looked out of the window, saw the great misty plain of social,
political and religious affairs and said, “There is trouble
there”. They then went back in again and disappeared from our
view, 
<?notus-xml column=1044?>and we imagined that they were making a strategic plan to solve the
problem. Very soon afterwards, they emerged from the door at the bottom

inquire into the situation as it really was and produce reports before
they started to legislate? No; they came out with a Bill. There was
predictable uproar because there was no consultation. My noble friend
Lord Mawhinney dealt very ably with that, so I need not repeat it, but
I should like to add one grace note to it. In the consultation that

Bill would come back to us and it would be open to us either to reject
it or to pass it and take it through Committee. We would thus give the
Government the time in between to do some real research and real
diplomacy. They could make some real progress towards a harmonious
solution and perhaps give the Church of England and other churches time
to move a little as well. I am with the noble
Lord.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/49C93FDC39E53125295C406C31FA65B48EBB4BC8" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pathetically
open-minded about many aspects of this Bill. I have studied with great
care the arguments put forward on both sides of the debate, although
you cannot really talk in terms of a single debate with such a complex
measure. I have been immensely impressed, as I am sure we all have, by
the quality of today’s debate, and 
<?notus-xml column=1045?>the sincerity of the contributions made by all who have spoken. I have
been particularly touched and moved, intellectually and emotionally, by
the personal testimonies of my noble friend Lady Barker and the noble
Lords, Lord Smith of Finsbury, Lord Browne of Madingley and Lord Black
of Brentwood. I confess that my contribution tonight is not going to be
sharp-edged and decisive, although I do have one proposal to make. I am
going to speak very much in the hope that there may be reactions from
your Lordships to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000037">First,
however, I have to join others in saying that although the Prime
Minister has shown real courage in bringing forward this Bill, the way
in which it has been brought forward and the conduct so far have been
woefully inadequate. If there was ever a measure in which the general
public should have felt part of our debates and our deliberations, this
is it. This is not our issue. This is pre-eminently an issue for all
the people of this country, whatever their views, whatever their
background, wherever they live, whatever they do. There has been a
lamentable failure to engage them. As the noble Lord, Lord Dear, said
in his opening speech, the way in which responses have been measured,
with petitions, however large—he mentioned one of half a million
signatories—being treated as a single contribution really
beggars belief, and one wonders why it was
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000038">In the
same way, the gauging of public opinion by opinion polls is not
sufficient. We have not had a deliberative document, a Green
Paper—call it what you will—that can be distributed far
and wide in order to elicit the mature views of our fellow citizens. I
am a little suspicious of the figures that have emerged through the
opinion polls, although I accept—and indeed it is my
point—that most young people tend to think that this is a
no-brainer, that of course those of the same sex should be able to
marry; but it is possible to say that young people are not so much
tolerant as indifferent to some of these issues. The sexual mores of
our very young adults and late teenagers are staggeringly different
from those which prevailed when most of us were their age. I suspect
that many of those young people would say off the top of their heads,
“Of course, marriage for everybody”. When they actually
become married themselves they will mature into a different mindset,
but that is by the
bye.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000039">I have to
say to the noble Lord, Lord Dear, that I cannot accept his proposal,
particularly in terms of the constitutional arrangements with the other
place. I do not think it would be right for us to seek to jettison this
Bill at this stage. However, if we proceed as we are presently doing,
there is the risk of a backlash. My noble friend Lord Alderdice has
referred to this. There is a real risk that of the very many—I
would say millions—of our fellow citizens who feel strongly
about this measure, most of them feel strongly against the change. One
cannot judge this by one’s own mailbag, but from the comments
made in the debate, it seems that most noble Lords have received a
disproportionately large number of letters and e-mails from those who
are very concerned about what we are up

would rather we emerge at the end of this process with an Act of
Parliament that has general consent and does not risk a backlash in the

<?notus-xml column=1046?>manner seen in France or anywhere else. It should heal and reconcile the
differences of opinion and, in particular, the extremes of opinion.
There is some homophobia in our society, although thank goodness it is
vastly less than we experienced in our youth. At the other end there
is, I fear, a sort of phobia against those who do not take a totally
liberal view of the homosexual
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:35:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

proposal tentatively and in a genuine spirit of reconciliation. We
should think of using a different word or title for a homosexual union
from that of a heterosexual union; in effect, not to call the union of
a same-sex couple a marriage but, I suggest—it is only a
suggestion—an espousal. The noun that derives from that word is
spouse, which is gender-neutral. I think that it would lance a boil in
the public mind as to what we are seeking to do, bearing in mind that
everything else in the Bill will remain unchanged. All the rights will
be the same.</hs_para>

am tempted to say that those who talk about equality of esteem, as I
do—my goodness, if there is one thing that I live by in my
politics, it is the equal worth of every human being and the equal
esteem in which they have the right to be held—that to some
extent it is a misnomer to talk about a same-sex union in exactly the
same way as that of a different-sex union. That is because of two
fundamental, factual, inescapable and ineluctable differences which
have been referred to by other noble Lords. The first is the nature of
the union and the second is the procreative potential. It is no good
saying that lots of people who get married are too old to have
children, do not want children or whatever. The fact of the matter is
that most people who marry seek to have children and do so. Same-sex
couples in their civil marriages cannot have children except, of
course, through adoption, surrogacy or whatever. That is fundamentally
different. It is not better or worse but it is fundamentally different.
I do not see why we should not face that. It is a form of honesty that
would inure to the benefit of same-sex couples in the long
run<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T22:38:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

straw of being the last speaker this evening, and I thank all noble
Lords who are still here for being still here. I did not intend to
speak because it seemed that virtually everything there is to be said
was being said or was going to be said by someone else. However, I was
faced with an enormous volume of letters and e-mails, which I spent a
good part of the weekend reading through. I picked up from them some

point on which I think this Bill should not proceed, it is that the
nation is absolutely divided. I do not know whether it is 70% one way
or the other or if it is 50/50, but it is clear that, in the main, the
senior part of the country believes in the traditional role of marriage
and wishes to keep it, 
<?notus-xml column=1047?>while a lot of younger people think that it is all a load of hooey and
ask, basically, why anyone should get married. There is an absolute
divide, and in this sort of territory I believe that it is a mistake to

consensus.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306047000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000046">My

am not suggesting that it should take 50 years, but it has been a
sensible British tradition in social matters to legislate and change
gradually, and so keep up with public opinion. In 20 years’
time, when many of us are dead and gone, there may be some form of
consensus in the majority of the country—or even before then. It
is a great mistake to railroad this extremely unsatisfactory
legislation through. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter
brilliantly pointed out a lot of what is wrong with it. There are other
issues that are profoundly wrong and the consultation process was also
clearly less than
satisfactory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000048">This
is classic territory where it is not unreasonable for the House of
Lords to exercise its reserve powers in delaying such legislation. Our
job is to scrutinise and occasionally, when necessary, to be the
upholder of public opinion. Public opinion is not at all happy with
this legislation as it presently stands. Many have made the point that
there was no electoral mandate, but it was rather the reverse: the
Prime Minister actually stated in a pre-election television interview
that he would not be introducing same-sex marriage, and so gave a
commitment to the
contrary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000049">As
others have pointed out, I regret this issue of a 500,000-name petition
being treated as a single vote. It was telling that there was not a
single black or Asian representative invited to give evidence to the
Commons committee, and their communities are often among the most
religious in the country. Many may have noticed over the weekend that
all the faiths came together—not just the Anglican church, but
the Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist faiths sent a
letter with 53 signatures to the Prime Minister urging caution and that
he should think again before he pushed through this legislation to
rewrite the meaning of marriage. In the world of faith, this is not
just an Anglican issue; it is fundamental for all faiths, going back
into the mists of history, that whether one likes it or not marriage is
essentially about a man and woman getting together to have children and
to bring them up as securely as possible. Just redefining, like that,
what marriage means will understandably upset a large number of
people.</hs_para>

the Bill have also not been adequately considered. If the Bill
proceeds, the legal status of gay marriage will be different from that
of heterosexual marriage, as the most reverend Primate the Archbishop
of Canterbury and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter have
pointed out. It is also extraordinary that the proposed legislation
will not give equality to heterosexual couples wanting a civil
partnership, as many others have pointed
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000051">Today’s
debate has made it clear that the Bill needs more robust protection of
religious liberty. The Adrian Smith Trafford Housing Trust case was a
disgrace, but it illustrated what could happen if the Bill becomes law,
particularly for those in the public sector and the area of teaching.
John Bowers QC has opined that the Bill, combined with the existing law
on sex and relationships and the public sector duty, would create a
duty to promote and endorse such a new definition of marriage, and that
those who expressed their religious views to the contrary would be put
on the wrong side of the law. Moreover, a teacher declining to teach
same-sex marriage could be disciplined. This is entirely unsatisfactory
and not an adequate protection of religious
liberty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306047000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-0003.htm#1306047000052">Where
has all this come from? The impetus for redefining the meaning of
marriage is not largely from the gay community, many of whom are
perfectly happy with civil partnership as crafted a few years ago. It

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, in 2011 the Government
launched a consultation that examined the regulatory regime for
entertainment licensing under the Licensing Act 2003. The consultation
looked at removing any regulation that unnecessarily restricted
creativity, community expression, sporting participation and economic
growth. The Government listened carefully to the views received through
the consultation and we announced our new policy in the other place on
7 January this year and in this House on 8 January, taking
information received through the consultation into careful
account.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000004">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>
order before us today provides the first element of the reform package,

the Government’s response to the consultation, we explained that
there was a general consensus that these three areas could be
deregulated as there was nothing intrinsic to these activities that
required regulation that is not already adequately dealt with through
other legislation. The Government listened carefully to the views in
the consultation that asked for an end point to performance and that
large events were not deregulated. These two key points have been
addressed in the new policy and were set out in the Written Statement

order before us is therefore relatively straightforward. It removes the
need between 8 am and 11 pm for licences for public performances of
plays, exhibitions of dance and indoor sport up to a reasonable
audience cap of 500 people for plays and dance and 1,000 people for
indoor sport. Where any of these activities involve the supply of
alcohol, licensing requirements for such sales will continue to

performances that have been needlessly disrupted under the 2003 Act.

of a play and therefore subjected to unnecessary bureaucracy,

Minister for that introduction to the SI. As he will be aware, I am in
general a strong supporter of arts and entertainment deregulation. A
little over a year ago we were celebrating the success of a five-year
campaign to deregulate the performance of live music in small venues
under the Licensing Act, dating back to the recommendations of the Live
Music Forum of 2007 with the passing of the Live Music Act. That
success 
<?notus-xml column=117?>was a tribute to a great many individuals, and not least to the strong
co-operation between the DCMS itself and Ministers and
officials.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000014">UK

the MU published a live music kit when the Act came into force that is

live music in particular, will be able to argue that deregulating the
performance of live music has been anything but good for the

the Live Music Bill was going through, as the Minister has explained
the Government themselves published their own deregulation proposals in
September 2011. The proposal was to deregulate all regulated
entertainment of a similar description to live music, recorded music or
dance and entertainment before audiences of over 5,000, except boxing,
wrestling and adult entertainment. That meant that between 8 am and 11
pm most performances of a play, exhibitions of a film, indoor sporting
events and so on would be exempt from Licensing Act regulation. The aim

seeking to reduce the overall burden of regulation faced by smaller
organisations, the Government also wished to encourage the performance
of music, dance and sport and to encourage community creativity and
expression—all much to be desired. In most cases, as the

protections against potential problems were already provided by
existing legislation, such as the Environmental Protection Act 1990,
the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 and the Noise Act
1996<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>. As the

recognised that these were, to say the least, very radical deregulatory

in some cases unintended

glad to say that rather less radical views prevailed. Following the end
of the consultation, as my noble friend said, the Government, in
January 2013, published their response and proposals. They proposed
deregulating these events between 8 am and 11 pm for those hosted by
local authorities and educational establishments, and for others, in
the case of an audience of up to 500, except for indoor sporting

his very helpful explanation of the background to this order. I also
make it clear from the outset that we very much support the intention
set out in the order. The local licensing of community arts, sports and

no doubt at all that the Live Music Act sent a strong message of
encouragement to local artists and musicians who were finding it
impossible to find a venue to perform in and that it has gone a great
way to alleviate that problem. However, that highlights the fact that
this order tackles only a small part of a complicated local licensing
arrangement that has made life difficult for performers and community
organisations
alike.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000024">Obviously,
by its very nature, secondary legislation tends to be implemented on a
rather piecemeal basis, but it would be helpful to know how this fits
into the grander plan to update the licensing laws and the rules
governing local live performances, building perhaps on the question
asked by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. Can the Minister shed a
little more light on the review of film performances, which are not
included in this order but which I understand are still under
consideration? In other words, can the Minister clarify what further

the bigger review of the licensing arrangements and where the details

that, within the limits of their scope we believe that the proposals
strike the right balance between facilitating more live community arts
performance on the one hand and wider public safeguarding and
protection on the other. We believe that the timeframe of 8 am to 11 pm
is about right, as is the size limit of 500 people. This should more
than adequately cover the attendance expectations of most local events,
particularly those organised by volunteers, who found the existing
licensing rules particularly
onerous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000026">The
impact assessment quite rightly identifies the main areas of risk as
public safety and noise pollution, and these cannot be ignored. In
particular, outside events featuring overamplified live music could
become a real noise nuisance to local residents, so local councils and
the police will need to be alive to the separate regulations already
governing noise complaints. It is not clear from the changes how the
police and local councils would receive early warning of a proposed
event if the licensing laws are changed in the way that we have been
discussing. Without prior knowledge, it is hard to know how they would
be aware that an event is taking place so that they could police it
rather than waiting for complaints to come in after the event. Perhaps
the Minister will shed more light on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000027">I accept
the premise of the impact assessment that the worst culprits are likely
to be events selling alcohol, which remain unaffected by the relaxation

consequences within a sensible timeframe.</hs_para>

that the second phase of consideration is the best place to deregulate
the low-risk Olympic disciplines of freestyle and Greco-Roman

</B><B>Teverson</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, since I have been chair
of the External Affairs Committee and its predecessors, we have been
concerned that the committee should look at things that are practical
and where we can make a difference. I, and I am sure my fellow
committee members, like to think that we made a difference in our
report on Afghanistan EUPOL and on Somali piracy, and perhaps even in
our larger report about relations between the EU and China. We took on
as our most recent subject the European External Action Service, which
is coming up to its two-year review later this year—I think it
is expected to take off in July, the month after next—because we
wanted to ensure as a House, as one of the key institutions that looks
at European affairs in the United Kingdom, let alone as part of this
Parliament, that we could put our opinions into that process. That is
why we foreshortened our report and issued it relatively quickly to the
Government: so that it could be part of those
discussions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T15:54:01"></hs_TimeCode>.
Having said that, it is probably one of our more politically charged
reports and one in which there was a greater 
<?notus-xml column=121?>diversity of opinion within the sub-committee. That, I am
sure—and I welcome it—will come out in the debate this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000037">The
External Action Service is quite a difficult area for discussion. It is
only two years old. Sources vary over the question of when it was
started; some say it was December 2010 and others January 2011. In many
ways it was invented out of the Kissinger question, “Who do I
phone for Europe?”. The whole debate about a unified voice for
Europe is one reason why it was in the Lisbon treaty, but by that time
it was not the European Foreign Ministry that it was perhaps originally
meant to be; rather, it became the high representative and an
institution to support her in her work. I will come back to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000038">The noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, who was appointed to the EAS, is
well respected and liked within the House but was hardly known
throughout Europe and therefore had a very low-profile start. Being
British, or at least being a British commissioner because she has that
hat as well, has perhaps made her position even more nuanced and
difficult in certain areas. At its start, the EAS was trying to give
Europe its true voice all around, in Europe and in the much broader
world. Then the eurozone crisis came along and, however good and
unified we wanted to make Europe sound, the real noise at the forefront
was around Europe’s failures in many ways to make decisions
about its own currency and economy. Then there is the vagueness of the
task. Nothing in the Lisbon treaty really says what the External Action
Service should do except be of assistance to the high representative,
and even there the job description is somewhat
vague.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000039">How do
we describe the External Action Service? It is not an official
institution; it is not really a part of the Council, certainly not part
of the Commission and absolutely not part of the European Parliament.
Then we come to the question of whether Europe really has a foreign
policy worth the name. My own view is—and the work that we did
on looking at that demonstrates—that it very much does. The
European Union makes pronouncements on foreign policy that are often
joined by 11 other nation states around Europe that combine with the
European member states to make policy decisions. We have to agree,

as the Middle East perhaps, Europe does not agree at all.</hs_para>

add a number of other areas. There is the question of large versus
small state; not only Germany but France and the United Kingdom stride
the globe with our hundreds of years of diplomatic experience, and we
are very jealous of that, particularly in France and the UK. Yet we
also have small member states that have perhaps only 40 embassies
abroad at all, many of those within the European Union. It is
questionable whether they even have a foreign policy at all.</hs_para>

fact that the EAS was being set up while it was being run; that there
were three cultures among the staff who came from the Commission, from
the Council and from national diplomatic corps, which inevitably caused
turf wars, let alone culture wars; and that the high
representative’s job is often

fundamental question which this report does not really answer. At some
point someone might have to make up their mind about this. Is the
External Action Service supposed to be a world-class foreign office and
diplomatic corps of a supranational quasi-state called Europe, or is it
there just to add diplomatic value to the traditional Commission tasks
of trade and development? I leave Members to make their own choice, but
in the longer term that is what will drive not this review but reviews

give the Committee one or two facts. The EAS budget is
€500 million—nothing to be sniffed at, but that is only
0.4%, or in effect one-third of 1%, of the European
Union’s budget. The EAS has 141 delegations abroad;
it started with 136 but has combined some and opened others in places
such as South Sudan, which I am sure we would agree with in that
instance. It has about 3,400 staff
altogether.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000044">This
organisation is significant and important, but what are the headlines
in relation to what should happen in this review? I shall go through
them very quickly because other noble Lords will go through them in
detail in their speeches. Budget neutrality was supposed to be
achieved, and in times of economic difficulty in Europe we believe that
that should be maintained. The only way that can be done is by
prioritising, but that is very difficult with such a large agenda. It
should concern the emerging powers such as China, India and perhaps
Brazil, and it should concern our local neighbourhood in the east and
the south. A lot of the EAS’s time has been taken up by the Arab
spring and neighbourhood questions. It should also perhaps be a
priority in crisis management. We have seen examples of that in
Somalia, the Horn of Africa and
Mali.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306036000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000045">The turf
war between the Commission’s and the External Action
Service’s core staff, the diplomatic staff, must end. We believe
that that situation is much better, but it has to improve and be
resolved in the near future. We need to think anew. We should not be
bound by the geographical locations of existing missions. We have to
think about the future rather than the inheritance of the past. We
believe that as foreign policy is primarily intergovernmental, the
EAS’s annual report should be presented to each of the national
parliaments. Clearly, that has to be done in a sensible way so that we
can formally respond to the External Action Service’s work each
year and feed back into it as an intergovernmental area of EU
policy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306036000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000046">Over
the next few years, it is fundamental that the EAS concentrates on
adding diplomatic value to the strong work undertaken in trade and
development. At the end of the day, one of the key issues that we in
Britain have to look at is the large versus small state issue. Three
ambassadors of smaller member states—Lithuania, Slovenia and
Slovakia—were witnesses, and in those states there was a
completely different view from perhaps that of French parliamentarians
about the role of the EAS. The small member
states—this  
<?notus-xml column=123?>was confirmed to me when I was in Estonia last week—see the EAS
as part of the European deal, part of their membership, part of what
they are, and they expect it to respond to their needs. They do not
have the resources for a worldwide presence, and they see the External
Action Service as a way of having that. In a Europe where the United
Kingdom, and perhaps France these days, has to look for strong allies
among all states, I say to our Government that this is one area where
they have to take care in their views about the External Action Service
in the future. It is easier for us with larger budgets and a larger
presence to see the EAS as something that perhaps threatens certain
national representation abroad, but to smaller member states it is a
way forward and a way to a global and much more visible presence
abroad. We need to find a way to drive both of those agendas forward. I
beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1306036000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#1306036000057">4.03

not many members of the committee are present at this moment. I was
hesitant about being the first because, although I think I was the

that my views in the committee were representative of the committee as
a whole. I was certainly sceptical about the EAS at the beginning of
the inquiry, and I have to say that after all the discussions and all

Baroness, Lady Ashton, who I think has been in a difficult situation
and has done a very good job. Nor do I imply any criticism or make any
attempt to diminish the importance of the aid work that goes on through
the legations and the embassies. The focus of my scepticism and
criticism is much more on the network of offices and embassies
throughout the world. It seems to me to be a bureaucracy that has been
brought into being before anyone has decided precisely what it is meant

awful lot of the evidence that appeared before the committee seemed to
be self-justification. I should not speak for other members of the

suggest that it would have been rather better, before we decided to
spend around €500 million a year, to have decided what we wanted
it to do. As I say, a number of witnesses who appeared before the

basic problem, of course, is that there is no single foreign policy of
the EU as such. On Iraq, Syria, Libya, Cuba, Kosovo, and trade and
energy issues with Russia, despite the achievements of the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, in recent weeks, there is no agreed line. One or
two witnesses attempted to imply that Europe had been a major actor in
what had happened in Egypt. Well, it spent a lot of money in Egypt and
made a number of representations, but I have met no one from Egypt who
believes that the European Union has had a big impact there. I also
followed up on claims that were made for the extraordinary influence of
the EAS in the Yemen by asking various Yemeni people I met whether they
were aware of it. I found little awareness, if
any<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:08:24"></hs_TimeCode>. Where in
European foreign policy there is an agreed line, I cannot see why that
cannot be communicated diplomatically, if it needs to be, through the
embassies of Germany, France, Italy and other countries. I cannot see
what the European embassies can do on the ground that cannot be done by
the national embassies, certainly of the major countries.</hs_para>

a previous EU committee session, we had evidence from the prospective
EU ambassador to China. I asked him what he thought he could do that
could not be done by the German embassy, the French embassy or the
Italian embassy. He said, “We, much more than them, are going to
major on human rights and place all the emphasis on those
rights”. I do not think that will get him a long way in raising

There are 44 people in Barbados, 32 in Mozambique and 30 in Uruguay.
The EU is represented in 11 Pacific island countries, including the
Cook Islands, Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and lots
of others. A point made very clearly in the report and echoed by the
noble Lord, Lord Teverson, in his speech was that the location of
offices ought to be determined not by history but by what is in the
best interests of the European Union and what is likely to contribute
most to the solution of real problems. What the noble Lord and the

of sense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060310000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000009">The
report was, if anything, rather lenient on the failure of the EAS to
achieve budget neutrality. It is not an excuse to say that it is a
young organisation. It was set up on the strict condition that there
should be budget neutrality—you take money from one pot, and you
put it in another—but we have had a litany of all the familiar
excuses, which will be familiar to anyone who has ever been in the
Treasury, about what had been inherited and the difficulty of the
current climate. In the current climate, in which austerity and budget
cuts have been in place all over the EU, it is very regrettable that
there was a failure to achieve budget neutrality, and I strongly
endorse the report’s conclusion that there should be zero real
increases in expenditure in future.</hs_para>

the report did not go further into salaries. We had a firm statement
from Mr Shorter of the office of the Minister for Europe that salaries
are very high by national standards. Another witness described them as
outrageous profligacy, and another as a ridiculous amount of money.
Certainly, they seem to be higher than national salaries. In the
report, the argument was made that it is difficult to make precise
comparisons, but it would have been better had we looked at this rather
earlier in our inquiry and gone somewhat deeper.</hs_para>

out for criticism were the salaries of the 11 special representatives
dealing with certain crisis areas and certain geographical areas of
crisis. It was said to us that several of those special representatives
have salaries higher than that of the Secretary-General of the United
Nations. It was argued that high salaries were necessary in order to
get figures of genuine international standing, but I think that only
three out of the 11 special representatives have actually gone to
people who were not former officials. Only three have gone to people
who are former Ministers, for example. We have a lot of distinguished
people here. Perhaps they could be considered for some of the special
representatives in future.</hs_para>

my criticism is largely directed at the physical network. We heard
several witnesses, and one extremely senior one in private, say that
the delegations in Brazil and in India, the so-called strategic
partners, have had no impact on that relationship or on changing it.
The lady witness from the WTO said that the EAS had no noticeable
impact on trade negotiations and that the cards and the brass plates on
the tables had changed but the method of working and the negotiations
methods had not changed at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060310000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000013">One
justification that was put forward for the network of offices was that
one needed to see trade in a political context. I remain sceptical
about that. Of course one needs to know the political motivation and
the local context in which people have a particular view on a
particular trade issue. However, that is easily ascertainable through
national embassies, or indeed through reading newspapers. One has to
distinguish between trade policy and trade promotion. Sometimes in the
arguments that were put forward, trade promotion was confused with
trade policy. In trade policy, the EU definitely has a valuable role:
in trade promotion, I would say hardly at all, although I do not think
that that was clear in all the statements that were made before the
committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060310000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000014">The
EAS exists, and we have to make the best of it. I agree with the points
that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, made about training and secondment.
I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed by the
Government’s reply to the report, and I wonder whether it really
said what the people in the Foreign Office actually say in their heart
of hearts about the EAS. It does not explain away the number of
ambassadors—I shall not name them—who, late at night over
a glass of whiskey, have asked me “What does this thing actually
do? What is its purpose? What is it for?”. It seems to me that
the logic that we are going with is that we should actually start
considering closing down some British embassies just as we start
expanding the EAS network, but of course the Foreign Office would never
dream of agreeing to
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:05:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13060310000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000037">4.18

with Latin America is also important for the UK’s own economic

in the interests of trade, where, as the report says, the EAS can add
value with an overall strategic role to bring a diplomatic perspective,

American countries—I highlight Colombia—are in

to my second interest, part of the necessary wherewithal to build
relationships in Latin America and with most other places on the planet
is the linguistic competence to make contacts, build bridges,
understand other cultures, participate and earn respect. English, of
course, is absolutely vital, and we are very lucky to be native English
speakers, but it is not enough in a world where, surprisingly, only 6%
of people are native English speakers and 75% of the people on planet
Earth speak no English at

important recommendation that greater attention be given to training
for EAS staff, including in languages, and it notes in particular that
more Arabic speakers are needed. Professor Whitman of the University of
Kent, in his evidence to the committee, put it more strongly still,
saying that languages and regional competencies were crucial issues in
training. I want to ensure that this recommendation does not get lost
or overlooked as a small administrative detail, overshadowed by the
bigger picture of emerging powers, security and human rights, because
language skills are crucial to securing progress in all these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:22:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060310000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000021">The
report tells us that the EAS says that UK nationals are strongly
represented on the EAS staff at all levels. However, on looking at the
numbers, I am not sure that that claim is very convincing. The
proportion of UK nationals certainly does not reflect the UK population
as a proportion of the EU. There may be many reasons for this but one
significant contributory factor is the lack of language skills. The
Foreign and Commonwealth Office has noted that a shortage of 
<?notus-xml column=128?>British staff in international institutions is detrimental to the
national interest and undermines our policy influence.</hs_para>

nationals make up only 5% of the European Civil Service, although we
account for more than 12% of the population. In 2011, a mere 2.6% of
applicants were from the UK, fewer than any other member state. A key
reason for this was that English-speaking applicants must offer either
French or German as a second language. I appreciate that the Foreign
Office is now trying harder than ever before to turn this around and
has already recognised the importance of languages in diplomacy by
increasing its budget for language training and the number of posts for
which languages are now deemed to be an absolute
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:23:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060310000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000023">The
Government’s response to the committee’s report agrees
that EAS staff should be given what they call “hard language
training”. I am not sure whether that means difficult training
or training in difficult languages, but either way I ask the Minister,
in the light of this new commitment to languages, how the Government
might directly assist the EAS in achieving its language training needs
in ways that could be defined as “in kind support”,
rather than further direct budgetary contributions, which both the
report and the Government’s response agree must be
avoided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060310000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000024">The
government response says that they are working to promote the EAS as a
career option for talented UK officials. I would like to know how
language training plays a part in that effort. In particular, there is
no doubt that we need significantly to increase the number of UK
nationals who can offer Arabic and Mandarin. The few we have are like
gold dust. As I have heard anecdotally from officials at DG Translation
in London and Brussels, these few are subject to being ruthlessly
poached from agency to agency all the time, which might well add to the
turf-war mentality identified in the report, which certainly needs to
be overcome if all the relevant agencies are to be able to work and
achieve to their full
potential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:25:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060310000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060310000025">It
can be taken as read from my earlier remarks that the importance of
Spanish and Portuguese should also be taken on board by any would-be
EAS staff, and indeed any businesses with an export eye on Latin
America. Thinking about the supply chain for linguists and practical
ways in which the Government could help to implement the
recommendations of the committee’s report, will the Minister
discuss with ministerial colleagues responsible for higher education in
BIS to see what more can be done to halt the decline of applications to
university for language degrees, whether in hard or soft languages, and
to encourage more of those who graduate as linguists, or as anything
else with a language, to consider careers in the EAS and related
institutions?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/3CD0B145E7DDA058E78AC95FA3C21AAF6BF721DF" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

language, particularly some of the language developed in this world
such as “High Representative”. I know about high priests,
but high 
<?notus-xml column=129?>representative is a very interesting concept. Perhaps that is something
to be pursued, although I do not want to do that now.</hs_para>

main language point that I want to pursue now is the word
“action” in the title of the External Action Service. The
Committee might know that when the UK was thinking about a closer
relationship with Europe all those years ago, the matter was discussed
in the General Synod of the Church of England. People were in favour of
a more formal relationship, but only if it meant that Europe would be
outward-looking. Rather than a club just to preserve its own
well-being, because of historical links and commitments it would be
outward-facing to Latin America and to all kinds of other Commonwealth
contacts. That is one of the agenda issues for which presumably the EAS
was created: to help Europe to be outward-looking in an effective
way.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060320000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000004">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:27:33"></hs_TimeCode>
question is: is the EAS the right vehicle for that, and how well is it
performing? From the report, it is clear that there have been some
massive challenges. It talks about China, the Arab spring and Brazil.
The report is full of the organisational issues, as the noble Lord,
Lord Lamont, has said, and questions about its identity—what it
is and how it works—rather than action going outward. Given that
this identity crisis and all the debates about budget and salaries
coincide with the economic pressures within Europe, I suspect that
there is an enormous temptation for this particular animal to become
more and more inward-looking and to take action to order and organise
itself and get its salaries right, whereas what Europe desperately
needs is a proper structure for looking outward. The report raises the
question of whether the EAS is the right
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:28:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

one area where Europe needs to look outward with real urgency in our
present context, and I invite the Committee and the Minister to comment
on how best to achieve this and whether the EAS is the right vehicle
for this: the area of human rights and religious freedom. The noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, who is the high representative, recognises that
human rights should be like a silver thread going through the work of
the service. Members probably know from the background papers that 75%
of the world’s population now live in countries where the
expression of their religious beliefs is subject to abuse, intimidation
and sometimes imprisonment. The threat to religious freedom is becoming
more and more of a common feature in all kinds of
societies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060320000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000006">Europe
has something really powerful in its DNA: religious freedom and human
rights. Religious belief is a litmus test for how human beings
understand identity, aspiration, relationships with others and all the
things that form citizens and help citizens to shape their countries,
and it helps countries to relate to each other.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060320000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000007">There are three things
in the DNA of Europe that we need to turn outwards and offer through
diplomacy and foreign policy, which other parts of the world still have
much to learn from. The first point about our DNA is this amazing
commitment to discussion that came from the Greeks and the Romans.
European history has been marked by very radical levels of 
<?notus-xml column=130?>discussion. Sometimes it gets out of hand and people fight wars, trying
to short-circuit discussion. This very institution is part of a
movement, after a war that happened because the discussion got out of
hand, whereby we can have a forum to discuss things better and in a
more mature way. That is deep in the DNA of Europe and I think it is
one of the things that binds us.</hs_para>

Roman Christian heritage, that discussion has allowed us to identify
differences and to look at them together. That is how our politics
works and how it works in much of Europe. It is a model of which we
should be proud and want to turn out and offer to others. The extent to
which we fail to do that means that many countries look at models other
than western democracy for their hope and their shaping, whether it is
Chinese authoritarian capitalism or whatever. It is very important for
us to own what is in our DNA and to seek to turn it out and to offer it
in our foreign policy, in our diplomacy and in our trade
agreements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060320000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000009">Our
DNA is about discussion, a discussion that highlights differences.
However, the third thing in our DNA is an amazing tradition of trying
to develop together, whether it was the alliances among the Greek city
states, the amazing Roman empire that held all those different cultures
together, or Christendom across the medieval world, with all those
different nations and churches trying to develop together, through
discussion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060320000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000010">Those
things are very precious to the identity of the European peoples; I
think they are in our DNA: discussion, owning the difference and
development together. Safeguarding religious freedom allows people to
continue to work and Europe needs to get its act together to reflect on
and to see how best we can make a common witness through those things
and to bat for them through diplomacy and foreign policy and through
the various influences that we can have across the globe. We might be
losing the initiative of standing for the things that people recognise
are good and taking up other alternatives, but I think that would be to
the detriment of the human
race.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060320000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000011">I want
to make a plea for what Europe has to offer by an outward turn. The
question is: is this the right animal to do that? Could it be shaped
and revised in order to give it a high priority, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Ashton, implies with her commitment to human rights, or do we have
to be bold and try to engage and find another way of making that
witness.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060320000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000012">I
remind fellow Peers that we have that heritage and that DNA, so it is
key now that we hang on to it and do not lose our nerve. If we lose our
nerve, Europe will become more marginalised and what we hold as

Lord Lamont in his tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and to our
staff for this report. It is a good report. I particularity want to
thank publicly my noble friend Lord Teverson, who has been a very
distinguished chairman of the committee. I particularly
applaud his initiative in introducing, at 
<?notus-xml column=131?>most of our sittings, maybe an hour when people come and brief us from

noble friend Lord Lamont said that he was the first of the members of
Sub-Committee C to speak. I suppose, looking at the list, that I am the
last, because after that we come—I hope they will forgive
me—to the “heavies”, who will tell us about their
previous Brussels experience. Having thanked the noble Lord, Lord
Teverson, I think that all of us on the committee are glad to see my
noble friend Lord Tugendhat, who has such good experience with
Brussels. I suppose he is another of the heavies. He will be a very
worthy successor to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and we all welcome
him on to the committee. I was not aware that the noble Baroness was
going to join our committee until she got up. I am sure we will all
welcome her in due course, maybe in three days’ time. If she
contributes as she has contributed this afternoon, we have good things
in store. It was good to have heard what she had to

was particularly glad that the Government—the Foreign
Office—gave broad agreement to the report in their response.
There are not many things that they demur from, which is a good thing.
It is not our job to follow the government line, and I do not think
that any of us on the committee want to do that, but it is good to
know, after our deliberations, that the Government find themselves in
broad agreement with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:39:54"></hs_TimeCode>. This all
rather contrasts with the swathing criticism that came upon the head of
the EAS from the European Parliament, which was extremely critical of
the service. Reading the European Parliament’s report, I just
wondered whether it was not too much coloured by a personality conflict
with the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton. Some of its criticism was not
justified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060320000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000016">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>
have to realise that the service is only two years old. However, it is
urgent that, at this time, it comes in for a degree of reassessment and
regrouping. I am sure we shall find that coming from the current
review. Indeed, the timing of our report was very much based on
producing it in the early or middle stages of the review of the
service, so that our views could be taken into account by those who are
carrying out the current review. I hope they will ask all the right
questions. My noble friend Lord Lamont raised a good many of those
questions, as did the

this context, I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:39:54"></hs_TimeCode>
always remember the question that our old friend Lord Peyton used to
ask. I think a number of noble Lords here will remember Lord Peyton of
Yeovil, who was a somewhat abrasive character. I worked with John
Peyton in opposition many, many years ago. He used to go around places
and say to people who were doing various jobs, “Tell me, what do
you do, and who benefits?”. I hope that the review will ask
those sorts of questions and come to the sort of conclusions, which my
noble friend Lord Lamont referred to, about what we want the External
Action Service to do. I hope that they will take note in the review of
what we have had to
say.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060320000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060320000018">Clearly,
Cathy Ashton has been hugely overstretched and it is an achievement to
have got the EAS up and running within these first two years. However,
I wonder

treaty, realised what a massive task it was and what huge, varied
responsibilities were to be put upon its head. Years ago, the noble
Lord, Lord Williamson, and I were on this committee when the service
was originally mooted. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, also had a good
deal to do with this many years ago. I remember the noble
Lord, Lord Williamson—I hope he will not mind me quoting
him—pointing out what a massive and wide responsibility was
being proposed. Therefore, it is not surprising that Cathy Ashton has
been massively overfaced with the responsibilities that she has
had<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:41:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The

the United Kingdom we are familiar with the position of junior
Ministers operating within departments under the responsibility of
their political heads. In 2014, when the new Commission is appointed
and the new responsibilities are apportioned, it would be wise at the
same time to appoint deputies. These should not be the people who, as
the European Parliament has described, sit representing Cathy Ashton
“like lemons”. They need to be there as deputies, with
proper powers to represent the high representative and vice-president
of the Commission. The more I think about this the more I think it

I said, there is much to be done. The salary rates need to be reviewed
and made comparable with other diplomats. I noticed in the European
Parliament report—I quote from the <I>Daily
Telegraph</I>—that more than 100 European Union
diplomats working in the Brussels-based Diplomatic Service earn more
than William Hague, the British Foreign Secretary, and at least
50 senior officials pocket higher salaries than David
Cameron’s prime ministerial annual salary of £142,500.
The rates clearly need to be addressed, and we have put that in our

better co-operation with member states’ missions in the

is one point in the report on which I have had second thoughts. Of

those small states should be asked to pay for them. On reflection,
though, that was a dangerous thing to open the door to. The service, as
we say in our report, has no consular expertise at all, and to start
trying to provide it could easily lead to tears. In all states around
the world where there is an EEAS presence, there are other embassies
that provide consular services, and it would be far better if those
smaller countries that seek a consular presence in those countries
sought to provide it through the consular services of existing
embassies and high commissions rather than trying to start from scratch

Hannay of Chiswick:</Member></B> My Lords, trying to judge the
performance of the European External Action Service less than three
years after it was first set up, a period during which a massive amount
of time and effort necessarily went into the administrative
complexities of that teething process, given the impossibility of doing
more in advance planning while the Lisbon treaty was going through its
rather agonising ratification process, is not an exact science, nor can
it lead to any very definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, we owe a debt
of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and his colleagues for
this last in a number of really excellent reports that the committee
has brought forward in the years that he has chaired it. It is a
genuinely valuable account of a work still very much in 
progress.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060331000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000002">The
report is timely, as the noble Lord recalled, as a first review of the
EEAS is now under way in Brussels and because—this is a point
made by the noble Lord, Lord Jopling—in 2014 the process of
appointing a new Commission, including a new president, a new high
representative for common foreign and security policy and a new
president of the European Council, creates an opportunity, if it is
taken, to address some of the problems that have arisen in the early
years of the EAS’s existence.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060331000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000003">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:48:18"></hs_TimeCode>
I may be tempted by the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, to a bit of
anecdotage, I reminisce, and I find it astonishing, how that wizard of
modern diplomacy, Henry Kissinger, managed to fix the whole debate,
practically for ever it sometimes seems to me, with his remark about
which telephone number he had to ring. That was an extraordinary piece
of chutzpah, if that is an adequate word for it, since, even when Henry
Kissinger himself managed for the only time in American
history—and it will probably remain the only time—to
combine the offices of Secretary of State and National Security
Adviser, you still needed more than one telephone number to find out
what American foreign policy was: probably more than 20 or 30. It is a
pity that he somehow fixed the debate, and we should not allow
ourselves to be mesmerised by that objective of producing someone at
the end of a single telephone number. I doubt whether it is achievable,
and it certainly will not be achieved in the short term.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060331000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000004">To add to the Kissinger
stories, I add his unhappy initiative that he called the “Year
of Europe”, which caused a good deal of fracas in Brussels at
the time when he launched it. When he asked the man who I worked for at
the time, Christopher Soames, former Leader of this House, why everyone
was so upset, Christopher said to him: “Well Henry, how would
you have liked it if I had made a speech saying that next year is the
year of the United States?”. That brought the conversation to a
short and rapid conclusion, and the year of Europe came to a conclusion
rather soon after that.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=134?><hs_para UID="13060331000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000005">I will address three
main issues. First, there is the question which the noble Lord, Lord
Jopling, with whom I agreed 100% on this, spoke about: the overload on
the person holding the job of vice-president and high representative.
This really cannot be in doubt and it is likely to get worse as the EAS
and common foreign and security policy become more a part of the
international scene. It is not only that the high representative cannot
be in two places at once, particularly when those places are often
separated by thousands of miles, but that the number and complexity of
the policy issues needing to be handled exceed the capacity of one
person to do so. Because the crucial work of co-ordination in Brussels
at a political level cannot be effectively achieved by someone who is
often absent from that city, the present situation is absurd. Even
Foreign Ministers of small member states often have political deputies
to share the load. However, the Commission, where there are now 28
commissioners from 1 July onwards, which far exceeds the number of
meaningful separate tasks to be performed, cannot seem to contemplate a
system of a deputy or deputies for its
vice-president.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000006">Alternative
ways of addressing the overload problem, such as turning back to the
rotating presidency to plug a gap, would seem to me a cure that is
worse than the disease, risking recreating the confusion and dispersal
of effort that the high representative was established to remedy. It
should surely be a high priority for the 2014 process of EU
appointments and the allocation of responsibilities to address this
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000007">Secondly,
there is the problem of policy coherence. The European Union of 2013
has a wide range of policies and policy instruments that impact on the
world outside its borders, such as enlargement, neighbourhood policy,
development aid, trade, environment, transport and immigration, to name
only the most obvious ones. However, is it achieving the sort of
coherence in the operation of those policies that will maximise their
impact and maximise, too, the European Union’s influence in an
increasingly interdependent and multipolar world? The honest answer is
that it is not. One need look no further than the way in which both
Russia and China are able to divide and rule among the member states
when there is no meaningful overall policy approach towards those two
countries, or at the contradictions between the Union’s
agricultural policy and its development policy, or those built into the
handling of Turkey’s and Macedonia’s applications for
membership. The best diplomatic service in the world cannot itself
compensate for, or gloss over, such a lack of policy coherence. If the
EAS is to be more effective, that lacuna in policy coherence needs to
be
filled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000008">Thirdly,
there is the issue of turf fighting, both within and between the
various institutions in Brussels, between the Commission, the EAS, the
Council, the Parliament, and the member states. If there was a gold
medal for turf fighting, Europe would surely have won it quite a lot of
times. One of the principle objectives with the establishment of the
EAS was to reduce that turf fighting. Has it succeeded in doing so? I
rather doubt it. Those who work within the Brussels machinery tell me
that while there have been some improvements in the operations, such as
the operation of the Political  
<?notus-xml column=135?>and Security Committee and the Situation Centre, there are plenty of
other examples of time and resource-wasting infighting. There are some
member states—the UK, I fear, prominent among them—whose
lip service of support for the EAS is in sharp contrast to the
resources they devote to the task of policing the lonely frontiers of
competence creep, biting the ankles of the EAS whenever any
transgression, however minor, is
perceived.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000009">There
are plenty of other areas that need to be addressed before the EEAS can
confidently demonstrate a degree of professional excellence equal to
that of the best among its member states, which have, after all, been
in the business for an awful lot longer. Better language skills, as my
noble friend Lady Coussins said, greater effectiveness at public
diplomacy, the avoidance of cronyism in the making of senior
appointments and better co-ordination between the work of special
representatives and the EEAS heads of mission on the spot all need to
be addressed in the period ahead. Above all, the EU and the EEAS need
to spend more time and effort influencing the policymaking of the rest
of the world and less time arguing among themselves about the precise
formulation of EU positions, whose shelf life is inevitably limited.
This is work not just for three years but for as many decades.
Meanwhile, I would be grateful if the Minister replying to this debate
could give the Government’s views on the three priority issues I
have identified—deputisation, policy coherence and turf
fighting—and say what steps the Government intend to take to
make the most of the opportunities of 2013 and 2014 and the general
post appointments next year to address those
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:56:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Maclennan of Rogart:</Member></B> My Lords, from my external position,
I would like to say how very much I appreciated the work of the
committee and the Chairman in producing this thought-provoking report.
It is extremely timely, and bringing it forward in time to feed into
the review being undertaken by the vice-president and high
representative is a very skilful move. I cannot believe that there will
be another contribution from a national parliament that will have more
thought-provoking recommendations with the possibility of enabling the
new group of European leaders who will emerge in 2014 to get to grips
with this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000011">It
is a very short time since the External Action Service was set up. It
is consequently right to be cautious about it and to learn from the
experience of the past two-plus years. The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton,
deserves very high commendation for the work that she has done, not
only in shaping the structure of the institution, which is not an
institution but an agency, but in her response to crises that were not
predictable when the agency came into being. In particular, I wish to
record our admiration for the work that has been done between Kosovo
and Serbia. The European Union Select Committee heard from Serbian
parliamentarians not very long ago, who made it plain that they were
going to find it exceedingly difficult to come to any agreement with
Kosovo other than through the agency of the European Union.</hs_para>

there is some urgency in continuing this work. It is quite clear that
the global powers, the BRICs, will develop very rapidly over the next
decade, and if the European Union is to exercise its influence, and
even to protect itself, it must speak with a single voice on many of
the issues that confront us. During these early years of a common
foreign and security policy, it is evident that that has not always
been so. Our relationships with Russia have been notably very
different, Germany has spoken for itself very often in these matters,
and the Libyan intervention was not supported by Germany. We need to
treat these issues with greater coherence than has to date been
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000013">We
can be very effective, I do not doubt, if we bring our foreign stances
together. We must not seek to do this only in areas of self-centred
need. We must recognise that it is a continent of 500 million people
with a huge underlying economy. We are in a position to assist other
less developed countries that have, as the right reverend Prelate said,
less adherence and commitment to western European balance, democracy
and human rights. We have to recognise that these matters can be
effectively addressed if we come together with a common voice.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:03:09"></hs_TimeCode> have used
sanctions as a pressure in this period and they have been
effective—indeed, the committee recognised that—but
persuasion is also important.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060331000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000014">Despite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:03:36"></hs_TimeCode>
the fact that France and the United Kingdom have a long history of
extensive global participation, we ought to recognise that that is
going to diminish and that there is no way in which we can continue to
be or should wish to be an imperial power. This brings me to an issue
that was clearly discussed in the drawing together of this valuable
report: the extent to which we in the United Kingdom should hold our
own role, not only in terms of our own interest but in terms of our
Diplomatic Service. There are places in which it is quite clear that
the United Kingdom is less influential than it was. In some countries
in west Africa, for example, we do not have the kind of representation
that would carry weight. That is partly a function of prioritisation,
which of course was a theme of this report. However, as these
developments occur, the continent of Europe, with its 500 million
people, should be able to have a view about global issues right across
the world and we should not back out and deal only with matters of
crisis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:05:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000015">The
transference of power to the European Union, of course, cannot be
accomplished without a greater democratisation of the institutions. It
cannot be achieved overnight. That is a subject for further reflection,
but that we should have the ambition to do this seems to me to be
beyond
dispute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:06:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000016">I
noted with interest the committee’s comments on development,
trade and climate change. Those issues are all important. It is right
that at the beginning of this process of developing a foreign
service—for that in effect is what it is—we should not
expect too much to be taken off. However, these matters are
interlinked, and I think the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, was explicit
in and has been successful in indicating how important political
understanding is when we are making contributions to trade issues. Here
I somewhat disagree  
<?notus-xml column=137?>with the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, and his remarks about China. We have
to recognise—I have to declare an interest in regard to
China—that we cannot turn a blind eye to matters such as the
denial of human rights, even if we are seeking to extend our intimacy
in the area of
trade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:07:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:07:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000017">This
report ought to be considered very carefully by the Council in
formulating its new views, by the Commission in recognising what a
valuable role there is for this service, and by the European
Parliament. The criticisms made by some of those European
parliamentarians about the lack of political will were justified, but
what a splendid beginning has been made in these two and a half
years.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/B7DADABD1785E0B67B4CA5F998D1BC8FD05D79CC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

Williamson of Horton:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest in
that I spent a good part of my career on European affairs in the United
Kingdom Civil Service and in the European Commission. I join others in
thanking the European Union Committee for this valuable report on the
European Union’s External Action Service which I hope I shall
continue to call the EEAS for the rest of this speech, unless I get
confused with the initials. This is just the sort of report that we
need to keep us informed about what is happening within the European
Union following the Lisbon treaty. The analysis of evidence and the 49
conclusions and recommendations are very full indeed, although some of
that is necessarily provisional and speculative because the EEAS, in
its present form, is a new creation, having been formally launched in
January 2011, and being due for review in mid-2013, which is critical
timing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000019">I
am a notoriously quick reader and often complete a book in an evening.
However, this report took a little longer to digest and I therefore
decided to select only a few points for comment. First, we need always
to keep in mind that the EEAS is a genuinely new and significant
initiative. It is quite different from the extensive network of
external delegations—of which I had some
experience—which, before the Lisbon treaty, were under the
direct control of the Commission. The EEAS, on the contrary, is an
information resource on external affairs for the member states and, of
course, for the EU as a whole. The common foreign and security policy
is now a core part of the work of the European Union, but its control
and management is quite different from most aspects of the EU’s
work, because the Commission does not have the sole right of
initiative. Policy decisions are reached by consensus in the Council.
They do not require the consent of the European Parliament, although it
may try to achieve some influence on them, and are not, for the most
part, within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Some
very important consequences stem from this, most notably that the key
basis for action is the capacity of the member states in the Council to
reach agreement and, if there is no agreement, the diplomatic handling
of the situation. We have seen this markedly recently in a number of
crises, for example in Libya and Syria, to which we have already heard
references<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000020">There
are some important areas for which the European Commission continues to
have the major responsibility, notably international trade and the
EU’s humanitarian 
<?notus-xml column=138?>assistance. Under the common foreign and security policy, the member
states rule. It follows from that that I strongly endorse some
conclusions in the report. First, there is conclusion

have set ourselves on this course for the EEAS and we need to maximise
the value of this substantial resource. For me, that is the underlying
point that we have to build on in the coming period. There are 3,400
staff, to which we have also committed national diplomats—I
recall that national diplomats represent 40% of the
delegations—with a view to providing extra advantages for the
diplomacy and influence of the United Kingdom, the other member states
and the EU. However, I might be a little more cautious than the
committee in trying to draw conclusions before the review. I have some
sympathy with the comment of Mr Mats Persson from Open Europe,
summarised at paragraph 104 as saying
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13060331000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000197">“he

European Union Committee has also examined in detail a number of
practical and administrative arrangements that may affect the operation

in bringing together the three staff components from the Council
secretariat, the Commission and the member states’ diplomatic
services, and the relationship between the EU special representatives
and the heads of delegations should be clarified. The comments of the
EU Select Committee on the organisation and co-ordination within the
EEAS should be taken into account—they are useful for
that—by the Council, the Commission and the noble Baroness, Lady
Ashton, in the imminent review.</hs_para>

from the EEAS working environment, it is not too easy to take a
definitive view on some of these recommendations. For example, in
principle, I am in favour of a single set of budgets and accounts for
delegations, as recommended in the report, but we need to be careful
that there are no unintended consequences, which sometimes happen, that
could affect the Commission’s excellent record on administrative
expenditure, which has received a favourable opinion from the Court of
Auditors year after year, most recently a few months ago when the court
stated that revenue payments were free from material error and that the
examined supervisory and control systems were
effective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000025">Finally,
where the European Commission has prime responsibility for the European
Union’s humanitarian aid and international trade, the EEAS may
sometimes be able to bring a new perspective but in no way can it
substitute for the Commission. In international trade, the Commission
has made an outstanding contribution to the EU’s status as one
of the largest consumer markets in the world and also one of the most
open, including such initiatives as duty-and-quota-free access for all
exports other than arms from least-developed countries, the almost
complete reversal of the original common agricultural policy and the
almost complete removal of EU export subsidies. This report will
certainly contribute very useful material for the review. It is well
timed and should be taken into account seriously in the review. I hope
that it will be seriously studied and that a little later in the
history of the EEAS we can claim that we have influenced the way in
which it is going to

Kerr of Kinlochard:</Member></B> My Lords, speaking as a non-member of
the committee that produced this report, I join those who have paid
tribute to its chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. He has been
famous for some time for his skill in chairmanship. I had not quite
grasped how skilful he is until I heard the terms in which the noble
Lord, Lord Lamont of Lerwick, supported his report. I detected a slight
element of dissent here and there, yet, looking at the report, I
discover it is unanimous. I congratulate the chairman on his
skill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000027">I also
congratulate him on and join with him in what he said about the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland. That tribute is very well deserved.
What she has done on reconciliation between Kosovo and Serbia is quite
remarkable and puts her up in the pantheon of those Members of this
House who have made a real contribution to reconciliation and
peacemaking in the Balkans. One could mention the noble Lords, Lord
Carrington, Lord Owen and, particularly, perhaps, Lord Ashdown. We
should note that what looked like a hospital pass has resulted in
scoring a rather brilliant try. The game is not over, it is not even
half-time, but she is doing extremely
well.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/18B0A26A6A170348FD55603DC51079A4F6ABA5FE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

one has to ask oneself: is the European Parliament correct in its
criticism? Are those who carp about the External Action Service and
about the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, right? I think that they need to
ask themselves: in what situations is the Union prepared 
<?notus-xml column=140?>to allow the high representative to take the lead? First, there has to
be a degree of common policy among the member states. For example, in
Libya or Mali, she could not take the lead. The Germans even abstained
in the General Assembly on the resolution. The Union was not united.
The same, I fear, applies now in
Syria.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060331000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000028">The
report is slightly Panglossian when it suggests that the External
Action Service should focus particularly on the places that are of most
importance to us in economic and security terms. Suppose that the noble
Baroness tried to take the lead on China. The noble Lord, Lord Lamont,
is right that the member states would not be prepared to allow her to
do so. On the other hand, I think that the noble Lord is wrong when he
says that there is no role for EU diplomacy, as distinct from member
state diplomacy, on human rights. Sometimes, people find that there is
safety in numbers. When one is dealing with, say, China or Russia, as
we see, receiving the Dalai Lama can have consequences and criticising
the murder of Litvinenko in London can have consequences. Sometimes,
member states feel braver about speaking up for human rights if they
are speaking up collectively. There may well be a role for the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, there. Basically, the tasks that the Council
tends to entrust to her are the ones that it thinks are too difficult.
It is no accident that she plays a leading and very successful role on
the P3+3 process with Iran. That was seen to be too difficult for any
one of us to tackle on our own. We were very happy to put her in
charge, and we were not all rushing forward saying, “We will
handle Serbia and Kosovo”. When one accuses the service and its
head of not yet having done a great deal, one should remember the
constraints that we impose and the subjects that we pick for
her.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000029">I agree

treaty is quite clear. Any citizen of the Union may seek consular
assistance from the embassy of any Union member state. Of course, a
financial transaction will properly follow. Suppose that an independent
Scotland required consular services provided from the Foreign Office in
its posts abroad, the bill might be quite substantial. The noble Lord,
Lord Jopling, is right, and I think that the report is wrong. The
Government agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jopling; perhaps they always
do, perhaps it is the noble Lord who moves the Government on these
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000033">On
the central problem of overload addressed in the report, I think that
the committee got it completely right. It is not the case that there
was no thinking about how it would work. There was a lot of thinking
and worry in the original Convention in which the noble Lord, Lord
Maclennan of Rogart, served with such distinction. There was a text on
the External Action Service produced by the Convention which 
<?notus-xml column=141?>was deliberately not put into the treaty so that it would not be
subjected to the delays of ratification but people could start planning
and building the External Action Service so that it was ready to go on
day one. Unfortunately, they did not. However, that text did some of
the thinking about what the External Action Service should do and what
it is for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000034">As
for the job of high representative, all of us in the Convention assumed
that there would be two political deputies. The noble Lord, Lord
Joplin, is right that they are needed. We assumed that there would be a
political deputy whose job would be to chair the Council when the high
representative was on a mission, to undertake some missions for the
high representative and, particularly, to maintain contact with
national Parliaments. The report is slightly pusillanimous on the
relationship with national Parliaments. At paragraph 85 we
are told
that:</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13060331000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000198">“The
scrutiny role of the European Parliament should not go beyond its
current level, as foreign policy is primarily inter-governmental and
scrutiny should therefore be performed at the national parliamentary
level”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13060331000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000184">Yes,
by national Parliaments. Physician heal thyself. We need to devise a
way of doing it. There also has to be a docking point. There has to be
someone at the other end who is ready to talk to us. That is the
political deputy high
representative.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060331000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000035">The
problem is even greater inside the Commission. We all assumed that
there would be another commissioner who would co-ordinate external
relations dossiers, working to the vice-president external relations,
which is the other title of the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton. That has
not happened. We could not put it into the treaty because the
definition as well as the allocation of commissioner portfolios is the
prerogative of the incoming President of the Commission. However, we
all assumed that it would happen, and I am very puzzled that it has
not. I hope that in the next Commission it will happen. If people
remember that the high representative is also the vice-president of the
Commission, and if she is helped to do what used to be done by the
Relex group of external relations commissioners—this is where
the overload has shown most—the situation will improve
considerably. I hope that will
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000036">I
should like to pick up on the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord
Lamont, about the purpose of the External Action Service. I was a
convert to it before I worked for the Convention. When the noble Lord,
Lord Patten of Barnes, was commissioner in charge of external
relations, he made a good appointment to head the Commission’s
office in Washington. He appointed an Irish ex-Prime Minister, John
Bruton, and John handled the job in a way that no one had done
previously. It had been seen as a great job for a trade policy expert,
trade policy being seen as an Eleusinian mystery, with high priests
working with incense in darkened rooms.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060331000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000037">Trade policy is hugely
political. The point about trade policy, particularly in a place such
as Washington, is to be known on the Hill and to be up there all the
time, to be good on television and to be on television often, all the
things that John Bruton was extremely good at. I am very sorry that his
successor was not another political appointee. However, the External 
<?notus-xml column=142?>Action Service is supposed to be about producing secondees or breeding
its own talent, people who do not only know about the subject but have
the communication, diplomatic and lobbying skills which made Bruton so
successful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000038">When
Javier Solana, a distinguished Foreign Minister and Secretary-General
of NATO, moved from NATO to do the job of high representative, he told
me that he discovered that he was entitled when abroad to the
assistance of a small council office in New York, a council office in
Geneva and nothing more. The Commission sent out an instruction to all
its delegations around the world that no assistance was to be provided
to the high representative as he worked for the member states and was
nothing to do with it. When he went to Washington, Javier Solana would
go to call on member states’ ambassadors, but he had to book his
own hotel. That is why dual-hatting—and it may seem
eccentric—makes sense. Bringing together the two jobs of the
high representative and the vice president in charge of the external
dossiers of the Commission is, in principle, a good idea if it is put
into practice. All these budgetary problems disappear. The noble Lord,
Lord Williamson of Horton, is right, and I agree with him. There is no
need to have this nonsense because the person responsible for these
posts abroad is a vice president in the Commission as well as being a
high
representative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000039">I
do not think there is such a thing as a purely technical mission. I
think this report flirts with error when it suggests that the EAS
should have no role in purely technical missions and should back off
from where they are all trade, aid or humanitarian aid. I do not think
so at all. What matters for effective trade or development policy is
adequate access to heads of state and Governments and the ability to
project what we are trying to do in the country in ways that are
understandable—languages matter very much, as the noble Baroness
said—and acceptable to the country. We need a more professional
External Action Service, but we should not regard any of the jobs of
any of the delegations around the world as unsuitable to be done by, or
at least to be done under the guidance of, that service.</hs_para>

Government still take such a defensive approach to the build up of this
service. I hope that that will improve. I share the doubts of the noble
Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, about whether it is always wise to be so
ferocious, usually on our own, while 26 others take a different view,
on every last detail on the frontiers of
competence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000041">I

Committee because, for unavoidable personal reasons, I probably have to

Minister has concluded. I am very sorry about that, but I cannot avoid
it. I will be very brief. First, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Teverson,

I join the tributes to the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, for the role
that she has played in helping partly to settle the Serbia-Kosovo
dispute. I would like to make clear, on behalf of the Labour Party,
that we support the External Action Service and that we want to see its
role developed, obviously as a supplement to British foreign policy and
to magnify that policy’s impact.</hs_para>

is, as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, has explained, that what went before
was dysfunctional, and the EAS is a great improvement. There is one
point that I would like to ask the Minister about, and that is the role
of Britain in this service. I agree with the comments of the noble
Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Kerr, about the hope that the Government
would not be so reserved in their approach. One of the real worries
that I have is about the proportion of British officials working in the
EAS. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, raised this point. The service
gave me figures showing that only 7.6% of the people working in the
service are British, as opposed to our 12.5% share of the population.
This is particularly true of member state diplomats: British diplomats
make up only 2.3% of the numbers in the service as opposed to 4% for
France. As a lot of the national diplomats occupy senior positions in
policymaking in the service in Brussels, this is a demonstration of a
lack of adequate British influence that I would like the Minister to
address in his
reply.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/FB8C6C4004427E51DB5D79A0AEACA9624871BBA9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

was a simple mistake that my noble friend Lady Warsi was put down on
today’s list of speakers instead of me. I volunteered some weeks
ago to take this debate because I had just made a speech at a
conference for the Foreign Office on the development of the External
Action Service, had done a considerable amount of work, had had
briefings from officials and had talked to people in Brussels. It
seemed rather idiotic that, my having put in that effort, she should
then have to do the same and duplicate that work. This happens to be
one of the few subjects on which I am mildly well informed, and I find
this much more comfortable than answering questions on South Sudan,
North Korea or other things that one occasionally has to do. I also
thank the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, for his reference to the Coronation.
I was indeed rehearsing in the Abbey this morning for the very small
role that I will be playing in tomorrow’s service, but I shall

Government are extremely grateful to the committee for this report,

has set out the Government’s position on the review in a recent
letter to the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, which has been shared with
Parliament. In it, he welcomed the fact that the noble Baroness has set
up from scratch a service that has now moved beyond the initial
institutional issues to focus on a number of key foreign policy
priorities. Like many of those who have spoken in this debate, the
Government look forward to the EEAS continuing to focus on those areas
where it can really add value by complementing and supplementing the
work of member states’ diplomatic services.</hs_para>

of the valuable work on Iran. I add to what has been said in this
debate that the value of the EU is sometimes that it appears to be
slightly more neutral than individual states. In those parts of the
world, particularly the Middle East, where there is sensitivity about
the imperial past, and where echoes of the imperial past carry against
Britain, France and sometimes others, the collective weight of the EU
can therefore sometimes be more helpful. That is also true, to some
extent, of the western Balkans.</hs_para>

also noted the point made in the report about the collective weight of
the European Union’s multilateral institutions. There are now
some 28 states working together, with Croatia joining, plus a number of
others often voting with them, which amplifies the weight of states
like the UK when we all agree. The work of the E3+3, in which the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, has been playing a collective role for the
smaller states, has been very valuable in a number of ways. I note the
subtle distinction between what I read in the American press about the
P5+1 and in the British press about the E3+3. I am sure that the

the same

quite surprised not to hear Members picking up the issue of the

ways, envied the European Union in its ability to bring together aid,
humanitarian intervention and a number of military instruments in the

extent to which domestic lobbies in different countries and their
collective representatives in Brussels do their utmost to resist the
policy coherence that he and I would love to have—for example,
in trade policy toward north Africa and west Africa—so that
trade policy does not cut across what we are trying to do in terms of
development policy is something that we are stuck with as a problem of
our domestic
politics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

also spoke about the budgets. We have worked very hard to promote
budget neutrality. We note the issue of high salaries. From 
<?notus-xml column=145?>anecdotal conversations that I have had, particularly with a number of
people in the newer member states, I am conscious that if you come from
a poorer state which is a net beneficiary of the EU budget, these
issues may seem rather less important than they do to the net
contributors. For those who have struggled away in national politics
for some time, the thought of being appointed to an international post
that will pay them far more than they are paid in their national
Government has a real appeal. However, Her Majesty’s Government
will continue to battle away on this
front<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:42:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000054">A
number of people have also spoken about British representation in the
institutions. We are very concerned to promote a high level of British
representation in this new institution from the Commission, from direct
recruitment and from secondees. Of course, there are problems with
languages. The last time I was in Brussels I was talking with a senior
official in UKREP about how we could encourage more British applicants
to go through the concours to join the Commission and to gain the
language skills needed. He said that by far the best way was to get
them to marry someone from another country so that they will then
acquire the language and, furthermore, they will agree that it is
easier to live in Brussels than either of their home countries. Perhaps
that is the gospel of despair. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady
Coussins, that we all recognise that have a great deal to do in this
country on languages. The international languages, such as French,
particularly for Africa, Spanish, particularly for Latin America,
Arabic and Mandarin are extremely important and that requires a
concentrated effort in schools as well as in universities. The noble
Baroness knows as well as I do that applications to study languages at
universities have been going down in recent years and that is one of
the reasons why language departments in universities have been
shrinking. That is all part of what we need to
reverse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:43:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000055">A
number of noble Lords also spoke about turf wars. The other day I heard
from someone about the current tour of the head of the World Bank and
the United Nations Secretary General to Congo. The remark by this
international civil servant was that this was the first time they had
managed to do something on such a good note between these traditionally
deeply suspicious and uncooperative institutions. Rivalry among
institutions, sadly, is a mark of international bodies. It helps that
the new American head of the World Bank speaks Korean as his own
language and the current Secretary General of the UN is a Korean. We
have to work to reduce these turf wars.</hs_para>

takes me into the question of deputies and competencies because, as the
noble Lord, Lord Kerr, mentioned, the idea was that we would have
clusters of commissioners and that the Relex group of commissioners
would meet regularly. I regret, and the British Government regret, that
the Relex group of commissioners has not met as regularly in the
current Commission as it did in the previous Commission. Now that there
are 28 commissioners, Her Majesty’s Government would very much
like to move in the next Commission to a much greater dependence on
clusters of commissioners, with vice-presidents, in effect, as their
chair, and it seems to us entirely appropriate as part of that that one
of the 
<?notus-xml column=146?>clusters should be an active group of external commissioners working
more closely together. That would also help to reduce the element of
turf wars with different commissioners and their different
directorates-general promoting nuances of difference against each
other. It would certainly reduce some of the weight which overloads the
current high representative.</hs_para>

Teverson, spoke about the importance of understanding the difference
between large state interests and small state interests, which is
fundamental to all this. It is quite clear that for small states the
EEAS is a tremendous boon. It gives them knowledge and representation
in states which they had not covered before. For large states, that is
less essential, although, as the squeeze on our budgets persists and as
the number of member states in the UN expands beyond 190, it is not
possible for all of us to be represented in all those places. Indeed,
there are a number of places where the EEAS is represented where the UK
is not.</hs_para>

part of what we are moving towards in this area as in the common
security and defence policy. We are now co-located with the Germans in
Antananarivo in Madagascar as part of moving the British back into
resident representation there, and also in Quito, Pyongyang and
Reykjavik. I have visited the building the British and Germans have in
Reykjavik on several occasions over the past 10 years. We are
co-located with the French in Chisinau and Valetta, with the Dutch and
the Danes in Baghdad and Beirut, with the European Union, the Germans
and the Dutch for some years now in Dar-es-Salaam and with the EU, the
French and the Germans in Bishkek and in Astana, a new national
capital, jointly with the EU, the French, the Germans, the Italians,
the Dutch and the Austrians. We are working together practically where
we can and it provides greater coherence. As I have travelled around, I
have experienced generally extremely favourable comments from British
ambassadors about the utility of EU delegations on the spot,
particularly in countries some distance from the EU, and the
way in which EU embassies—often only a few EU
embassies—and the resident EU delegation have learnt to work
together. There is common political reporting—of course, you
cannot say everything because, in a group of 28 member states, not
everyone has the same attitude to confidentiality and so sometimes you
cannot put everything into a joint telegram that will be circulated
around all 28 members—common intelligence and common
representation to the host Government.</hs_para>

with the way the EEAS was set up. As the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said,
and I had some sympathy with his speech, it was brought into being
before its purposes had been entirely agreed. It is not the first time
that has happened with an international organisation or a European
institution. I am not at all sure people knew what the International
Labour Organisation was going to do when it was created after the First
World War. That is one of the reasons why we have some of these
problems with the institutions. However, now that the EEAS is there, we
have to make the best of it, and we certainly need to have as coherent
a policy as we can in all of those areas where member states can agree
a common policy.</hs_para>

the committee will now move on to look at the question of whether we
can agree a revision of the European security strategy for next

a sufficiently shared approach. That is why national Parliaments and
committees meeting together for a more coherent dialogue on foreign
policy and defence, and a common approach between national Parliaments,
is what we need to encourage. I am glad to hear that that is developing

complement the member states’ diplomatic services, not replace
them. Where there is no agreement among member states, we cannot expect
the EEAS to bring coherence that reflects the nature of EU common
foreign and security policy, but I hope that your Lordships agree that
our current Foreign Secretary has been extremely active in working,
above all, with our French and German partners and the other large,
active diplomatic states to promote common positions where possible
and, as far as we can, to carry the other, smaller member states with
us in common policies toward our eastern neighbourhood, the deeply

moving on to the detail of our report, I want to deal with a procedural
matter. We published our report in September last year. A response was
received quite promptly from the European Commission in March. Despite
repeated prompting, though, we received a response from the Government
only last Wednesday, almost seven months late, and I suspect it may
only have been the pressure of today’s debate that produced it
at all. Members will know that receipt of a government response three
working days before a debate, and during recess, does not provide ample
time for preparation for a parliamentary
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000072">We
recognise the challenges of the last few months, which have seen the
parameters of this debate shifting on a regular basis as the common
agricultural policy negotiations have progressed, but the lack of
communication from the Government during that process has been
lamentable. We trust that there will be no repeat of this disregard of
Parliament in future.</hs_para>

turn to the substance of today’s debate. The EU sugar regime
might sound like a very niche, distinct and rather arcane area.
However, it has widespread implications. The first is that sugar
remains one of the most protected sectors under a CAP that in other
respects has slowly made progress towards a more liberal regime.
Secondly, like it or not, we all consume sugar and it is our contention
that we, as consumers, pay more than we should as a direct result of EU
policy. Thirdly, the regime also has significant implications for
developing countries, and I shall come back to that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:01:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the reform of the sugar regime in 2005, we undertook an inquiry and
welcomed that reform as a necessary step, although even then we
regretted that more extensive proposals had not been pursued. Since
then there have been critical reviews of the regime, not least by the
EU’s Court of Auditors. Indeed, in 2011 the European Commission
tried to identify some of these shortcomings in its proposals to reform
the common agricultural policy. For that reason, we decided to
undertake a short inquiry into this subject last spring as part of our
contribution to the debate on the reform of the CAP, knowing that the
future of the EU’s sugar regime would be a closely fought tussle
in those negotiations. We were also keen to ensure continuity and
follow up on our earlier report.</hs_para>

The EU’s sugar policy is not something of which we can be
proud—in fact, it is not sweet, it is rather bitter. It is still
a policy that restricts both the production of beet sugar in the EU and
the import of cane sugar from third countries into the EU. Changes made
in 2006 have ensured that the EU’s minimum price is there, yet
we do not have a guaranteed minimum price. That is a rather
contradictory
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:02:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

division of opinion among our witnesses as to when, and even if,
production quotas should be abolished. Some argued for an extension of 
<?notus-xml column=150?>the system until 2020 in order to allow the sugar beet industry to
restructure further and prepare itself for the onset of the world
market. Others—quite logically, those on the receiving end of an
uncompetitive market—argued for the immediate end to quotas.
This included the industrial users of sugar, such as manufacturers and
producers of confectionery products and the
like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:03:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000077">However,
that final grouping also included the importers of raw cane into the EU
for refining, specifically Tate &amp; Lyle. Their position was that
either they should be protected against the market or both the beet and
cane sectors should be liberalised—a logical position. We took
the view that neither the cane nor the beet sectors should continue to
be protected and that this would involve both the abolition of
production quotas and the easing of import tariffs on raw cane sugar.
We acknowledged the difficulties of negotiating this, but suggested
that in the event that production quotas could not be phased out by
2020, they should certainly end at some point between 2015 and
2020<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:03:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000078">It
is pleasing to note in the Minister’s response that the
Council’s negotiating mandate extends quotas only until 2017,
although that has to be negotiated finally with the European
Parliament, which itself favours 2020. I would very much appreciate it
if the Minister could share any further intelligence with us, including
how the Government are working to ensure a positive outcome in this
respect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000079">We
also recommended that, as part of a package to assist with the
negotiation over the ending of quotas, support should be available to
remove inefficient production. Interestingly, the Government disagree,
noting that there is no justification for the spending of such money.
Let me be clear: we supported the use of such funding only as part of a
compromise package. It is unclear to me, frankly, how the Minister
expects to be able to negotiate the 2017 date without some form of
financial compensation. I would welcome clarity on that
subject<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:05:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000080">I
turn to the issue of price and competition. One consequence of the
protected sugar industry is that costs to the consumer are higher than
they should be. We were struck by the findings of the EU’s own
auditors, the European Court of Auditors, which concluded in 2010 that
changes in the EU market price for sugar were not passed on to the
consumer. Between 2006 and 2012, the average price of a kilo of
granulated sugar in the UK rose by one-third, while the market price

management, including support to help farms and groups of farms manage
their own risk, making use of private sector insurance mechanisms. This
is important; it is trying to make industries use the private sector
instead of always relying on the state to somehow mutualise the risks
that they face. This is a theme that we have referred to many times in

of the recurring themes on our committee has been that of research. We
emphasised in this case the importance of basic and applied research in
sugar, supported by adequate knowledge transfer: that is, getting the
research from the lab into the hands of farmers. We recommended that
the Government assess whether research efforts in this industry are in
line with the needs of consumers. The Government appear content that
all necessary basic and applied research is being undertaken and is
sufficiently funded. Sadly, we  
<?notus-xml column=152?>do not share the Government’s confidence on that matter. While we
agree that the industry is particularly well placed to identify its
needs, at least in terms of applied research, it is important that
science is able to feed in basic research and to be financially
supported in its efforts. It is only through this sort of research that
we will maintain in Europe the lead in technology that we need to
maintain our position in the world and in trade.

transitional measures was put together, known by the lengthy name of
Accompanying Measures for Sugar Protocol countries funding. We heard
that almost €1.2 billion had been allocated to this, yet much of
it had not reached the intended beneficiaries. This was due in part to
insufficient resourcing in the Commission’s offices in those

13 summarises the effects that the regime change has across Europe.
Here in the UK, prices for sugar beet fell, production was reduced and
a number of processing factories have closed. The anticipated rise in
raw sugar imports for refining did not happen. The beet processors
built refining capacity, and I understand that Mauritius has started a
refining industry. The outcome is a UK refining industry reportedly
running at 60% capacity. The EU reference price has been brought down
but the current market price for white sugar is some 16% higher than it
was in July
2006<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:18:36"></hs_TimeCode>. As a

the combination of sugar beet production quotas and the tariffs charged

view, that might not be a bad thing in the light of the research
findings on the damage done to our health by sugar consumption. I wish,
however, that the arguments for the retention of tariffs and quotas
were not put in a way that makes me think of the protection of EU

the question has to be how the ACP countries and the less developed

will have to stand on their own in future years. I am not quite clear
from the report, not having heard the evidence, what it really is that
is stopping the ATP countries from being able to process and develop,
or whether they are continuing just to export their raw materials. If
that is so, what steps could be put in place to help them to add value

have grown beet for many years, with 50% of the sugar that we use
coming from sugar beet that we have produced. With the CAP negotiations
well under way, I would like to add to what the noble Lord, Lord
Carter, has mentioned, that the CAP is looking at ways in which farmers
will be encouraged to spread their crop production—in 
<?notus-xml column=155?>other words, not just wheat, rape and barley. In fact, for many farmers
sugar beet is a good crop break because it puts goodness back into the
ground, so from a cereal farmer’s point of view it is an
important break. At the end of the day, however, it will be important
that whoever produces the sugar, whether beet or cane, can make
sufficient money out of it or they will not continue to grow it. In
this country and in Europe, they will grow something else. Again,
though, that is not a possibility for the ACP
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000106">I
understand that the market price for white sugar is something like
€710, which is roughly £600 per tonne or 60p per kilo.
Prices paid to farmers vary, but somewhere between £28 or
£30 per tonne should be possible to obtain. That is 3p per kilo,
and my observed off-the-shelf price to the consumer is about 79p per
kilo. Does this perhaps ring a similarity with what happens with our
dairy farmers across Europe? The question has to be: what is the reason
for the price rising so much for the consumer while the actual
producers of the cane and sugar beet have not grown? Changes to bagging
and distribution and to the retail technology should surely have
managed to counterbalance some of the rises that will have occurred,
especially perhaps within fuel. Maybe the Minister can throw some light
on the
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000107">Both
the report and the Government’s response make reference to
inefficient production. That makes my mind wonder what is inefficient.
Is it the growers, the producers or the people at the other end?

processing side, and which countries it occurs in the most, because we

considering the negotiations that are going on with the reform of the
common agricultural policy in Brussels and elsewhere. I have found it a
huge privilege to serve on the committee for a number of years. My time
is up and I have now moved on, but it has been a great pleasure working
under the noble Lord’s chairmanship. His fairness both to us as
members of the committee and to those whom we interviewed became one of
his
hallmarks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:27:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000112">One
of the other hallmarks of his chairmanship was the noticeable
improvement in Defra’s communication with the committee, which
has now come to a grinding halt with this report. It is extraordinary
that I received notification that the government reply had finally been
received, after numerous requests from our clerk and endless telephone
conversations, when I was in Romania last week. It is a wonderful
place. It used to be a communist country and grows its own sugar. I
managed to ask some of the farmers there what they considered would be
an appropriate response, and I can tell my noble friend Lord De Mauley
that his officials would all get promoted under the communist regime.
The farmers felt that the bureaucratic system that they endured was
nothing compared to what we are enduring in this country at the
moment.</hs_para>

really hope that my noble friend will get a grip on his officials. It
is treating Parliament and the committee with contempt that we did not
get a reply for nine months. Even the European Commission got its reply
in during March. Perhaps my noble friend will take the message back to
his department and ask his Secretary of State to write to the Leader of
the House and apologise for what has
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:28:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000114">Much
that I wanted to say has already been said, which is a great relief and
one of the advantages of talking in the House of Lords. I will
concentrate on two points. One is paragraph 31 in our report, where we
rowed behind the UK Government’s position that quotas must be
abolished in 2015 and import tariffs on raw cane sugar eased. However,
the game has changed. The Government have already agreed, as I
understand it, to support the Commission in relaxing the date for the
abolition of quotas from 2015 to 2017. Why did the Government do that?
Why did my noble friend’s department move the goalposts in the
middle of the CAP negotiations? What did we get for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:29:46"></hs_TimeCode>? There has
been a huge protectionist influence on the sugar regime, as was pointed
out by the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and my noble friend Lady Byford,
and yet we have already given way on this. It seems ludicrous to me; if
there is a good explanation perhaps my noble friend could tell
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:30:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Carter, on consumers, I thought that the
Commission’s reply from Vice-President Šefcovic was
perhaps a little arrogant, complacent and offhand towards the work of
the committee. He was very dismissive of some of the suggestions that
we put forward for the Commission. The noble Lord quite rightly
highlighted the fact that precious little had been done on working with
consumers, who, at the end of the day, are the ones who pay the 
<?notus-xml column=157?>bills. Have the results that were expected in February 2013 on the EEC
study come in yet, and what are
they?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:31:06"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

vice-president states that the EU will undertake that in future, when
the regime continues, the EU sugar growers and the EU sugar
undertakings should have mandatory written contracts. I would be
grateful if my noble friend could comment on that, on whether the
Government find that acceptable and in what form those contracts will
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:31:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend Lady Byford was hugely missed on the committee. It is one
of the sadnesses of the ways in which some of our rules are interpreted
that she could not take part. Her knowledge as a farmer and beet grower
would have been immensely useful. She highlighted the briefing that we
have received from the UK Industrial Sugar Users Group. I found that
particularly interesting because it updates the graph in our report at
figure 1 on page 11. It highlights how, since 2006, the EU sugar regime
has failed. In July 2006, the EU average price for white sugar was 75%
above the world market price in London and for a brief period in 2010
and 2011 they were about level. Then there was a coming and a going,
but the work that had been undertaken and the falls that occurred
started to work.</hs_para>

then, things have gone seriously wrong and the gap between the world
sugar price and the EU reference price has increased from 75% to about
90%. That surely underlines the need for comprehensive reform of the
sugar market. Unfortunately, it is already clear that that will not
happen. The protectionist elements in Europe—other member
states—are winning the battle. Employment opportunities in this
country that are currently available will be in jeopardy unless
significant reforms are undertaken. The industrial sugar market
accounts for 70,000 people, with a turnover of about £12.3
billion, and that accounts for 70% of the sugar usage in the UK. It
must be to our farmers’ advantage, to our employment advantage
and more particularly to the consumer’s advantage that sugar is
moved forward. Instead of it being a bitter pill, it should become a
sweet
pill.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/E1B1022567F21855B9C26031EFDCA447AFFD8066" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

Parminter:</Member></B> My Lords, I am another member of the
sub-committee which co-authored the report, and I, too, thank the noble
Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, for introducing this debate and for being
such an excellent chairman. When I came into the House, less than three
years ago, I was pretty much a new girl in the committee. The noble
Lord was nothing other than welcoming to me and ensured that all of us
had our voices heard—those of us who are producers and those of
us who are concerned about consumers and animal welfare. He has had a
fantastic manner throughout, which has been to the benefit of the
committee and its work. I am grateful to have the opportunity to put my
thanks for that in <I>Hansard</I>. We welcome Ros but I am very
grateful to
Patrick.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000120">A key
outcome of any sugar reform should be to ensure that consumers pay a
fair price. That is, fair in there being good reason to justify any
product support—in 
<?notus-xml column=158?>this case, by the CAP—that they pay through their taxes; fair in
terms of the price at the till; and fair in pricing and the
externalities of the product, which in sugar’s case is its
impact on human
health.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000121">I
commend our chairman for the timely production of the report, if not
the Government for their less than timely response. The report
contributes to the debate on the reform of the common agricultural
policy and, in so doing, addresses the first two of those issues about
fairness of price. It supports, as do the Government, a vision of a
more market-oriented agriculture where taxpayers’ money,
distributed through the CAP, is used for rural development and
environmental outcomes which help to build resilience to the impact of
climate change and halt biodiversity
loss.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000122">It
concludes that past reforms failed to bring the price down for the
consumer at the supermarket and that there are insufficient good
reasons to continue sugar production support. Following past reforms,
as fellow committee members have highlighted, the EU price of sugar
fell, but savings did not get into consumers’ pockets. That is
unacceptable, but nothing in the current reform process looks as though
that is set to
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000123">Like
the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, I would like to hear the
Minister’s current assessment of the likelihood of the sugar
quota slithering on, as the Secretary of State so eloquently put it
when he addressed our committee on 15 May. What are the chances of a
reasonable timeframe in which to abolish it being adopted, or will it
be dragged, aided by the European Parliament, into the next round of
CAP
reform?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000124">That
failure to deliver lower costs for consumers in a market with few
significant operators needs a spotlight shone on it. I therefore
endorse the report’s call for an investigation by the Office of
Fair Trading, in collaboration with competition regulators in other EU
member states, to assess the extent to which sugar consumers are
getting a fair deal. In the Government’s reply to the report,
they highlight what the EU competition authorities and the OFT have
been doing about suspected anti-competitive practices. I look forward
to hearing from my noble friend whether he thinks that what they are
doing is enough or whether he supports the report’s call for a
full investigation of the
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000125">The
report reflects the strong views from the health sector that sugar is a
health hazard for consumers, particularly for children, but it
concludes—rightly, I think—that the control of sugar
consumption on health grounds should be achieved by member state
taxation and regulation policies rather than justifying EU-level
continuation of market
distortion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000126">In
the face of the growing obesity challenge that this country faces,
“nudging” consumers to adopt healthier lifestyles cannot
deliver the pace of change required. The idea of the Government
intervening to change people’s behaviour will often be
controversial, but it should not be discounted when failure to do so is
having adverse societal and environmental impacts and when there is
clear evidence to show that such measures could work. The House of
Lords Science and Technology Committee report on behavioural change in
2011 made that case very strongly.</hs_para>

as sugar, which can cause health problems by contributing to our rising
obesity epidemic—which is particularly alarming among young
people—should now be actively looked at as a means to help
consumers to make more positive food and drink choices. Taxing
foodstuffs has become more prevalent in fellow European states over
recent years. France, for example, has introduced a tax on sugary
drinks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000128">Current
CAP reform discussions show that the Government may not be able to
secure support for the recommendations of the report, but it is within
their power to launch a consultation on fiscal incentives and their

sugar?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/1429ACE7B61A93A6B0CEF17B009C4BC99C22482E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 June 2013">Monday,

Having served in several Sessions on Sub-Committee D, I re-emphasise

that it is an insult to the members of the committee, knowing how much
they have to work, read papers and so on. There was one such occasion

years ago as a Common Market organisation to protect producers of

subsidising some of these farmers through rural development

then interfered with the market once, we are then locked into a spiral

response to the generous price, and to in some way control the cost,
there are then quotas to set a limit on production. Production in
excess of the quota is known as out-of-quota sugar and strict rules
then govern its use. It can be exported up to another limit, sold for
biofuel or other industrial non-food uses, or be counted against the
following year’s quota of sugar. The quotas can be varied to try

far so good, in terms of the story, but of course it does not end
there, because some of the poorest countries in the world grow sugar
cane. Although we know that those countries would be better off if they
refined it themselves, we like to import it and refine it here. Indeed,
when our beet production was limited, some of our refiners adapted to
refine cane sugar themselves as well. So, we give free access to
preferred poorer countries to fill the gap between what we allow
ourselves to produce and what we need. Fair enough— as

specific issues is that quotas are outdated measures that create
artificial shortages on the EU market, do not deliver supply to meet
demand, drive prices up, affect consumers heavily, limit the
functioning of the market and hinder farmers from adapting to market
signals. They also hamper efficient producers and stop new entrants
from joining the industry and helping to develop it. Therefore, as we
have heard from the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, they should be
abolished as soon as possible. I hope that the Government will find
some friends on the Council and reject the Parliament’s proposal
to delay from 2017 to 2020. I suspect that they will end up
compromising on 2018. If so, I guess that I can live with that,

My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord

apology for the delay in sending the Government’s response to
the 
<?notus-xml column=162?>committee. My honourable friend David Heath has written to the noble
Lord, Lord Carter, and to my noble friend Lord Boswell. However, I
would like to make clear that the delay was unsatisfactory and that we
need to do better in future. I should also emphasise that this episode
in no way reflects on the Government’s appreciation of the
committee’s work or of the report. Indeed, I find myself in the
happy position of being able to say that the Government agree with the
vast majority of the report’s

has, of course, been, as noble Lords have said, some time since the

reform negotiations have continued, albeit slowly, and it may help if I

proposal in October 2011 included very little on sugar. This reflected
the intention not to re-enact quotas when they expire under current
legislation in 2015. In fact, there was very little discussion on sugar
for the first year of the negotiations. When the EU Council of
Agriculture Ministers and the European Parliament concluded their
separate discussions on the issue in March this year, the focus was
very much on the future of beet quotas, and two different visions of
the future emerged. As the noble Lord, Lord Carter, said, the Council
took the view that quotas should be extended to 2017 but no further.
This reflected a compromise between two broad groups. In the main,
those member states that currently have a beet quota wanted to retain
it, while those without a quota supported the early abolition of
quotas. The European Parliament, too, had internal divisions, but
eventually concluded that beet quotas should be extended until
2020.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060331000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000150">The
noble Lord, Lord Carter, and my noble friends Lady Parminter and Lady
Byford asked about our view on the timing of the end of quotas, as did
the noble Lord, Lord Knight, in his final question. The Council mandate
is for quotas to end in 2017, and the European Parliament has voted to
keep quotas to 2020. Those two dates represent the starting point for
the negotiations, and we remain optimistic about which end of the range
we will end up at.</hs_para>

Carter, asked how influential we have been in the negotiations on the
CAP. Our support was key in ensuring that the Council reached agreement
on a 2017 end date. More widely, we have seen successes in stopping
excessive coupled payments and in allowing the four parts of the United
Kingdom to make their own decisions on implementing the
agreement.</hs_para>

process is the so-called trilogue negotiations between the Irish
presidency, on behalf of the Council, the European Parliament and the
Commission. Those negotiations are ongoing and any agreement between
the parties on sugar is now likely to occur in the context of an
overall agreement on CAP reform. As the committee heard when the
Secretary of State appeared before it on 15 May, much remains to be
done to secure that agreement. However, we are still optimistic that,
under the able chairmanship of the Irish Agriculture Minister, Simon
Coveney, a deal will be struck by the end of
June.</hs_para>  
<?notus-xml column=163?><hs_para UID="13060331000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000153">For
our part, the UK Government have done, and will continue to do, all
that we can to promote the liberalisation of the EU sugar regime in
respect of both beet and cane, and I thank the committee again for its
report as adding weight with the Commission to that argument. We do so
for good reason. EU market prices have consistently been at least 50%
above world market prices for the past few years, a level of distortion
not seen in any other CAP regime. That distortion arises from both
production quotas for EU beet and very high tariffs on imports of cane.
As a result, wholesale sugar prices for EU food and drink manufacturers
have been inflated by around 35%, while EU consumers have suffered a 1%
increase in the overall cost of the average food basket. At the same
time, producers in many poorer countries find it difficult to market
their sugar in Europe, as the noble Lord, Lord Knight, mentioned. That
hinders their economic development, and undermines to some extent the
EU’s own aid programmes to these
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000154">Abolishing
beet quotas would be an important step towards removing current market
distortions. It is disappointing, therefore, that the Council could not
agree with the Commission’s proposal in this respect. We do not
wish to see any further delay beyond 2017. However, even more
disappointing is that neither the Council nor the European Parliament
has addressed the need for additional measures on cane imports. The
very high tariffs that apply have an even greater distorting effect on
the market than beet quotas. The exemptions from those tariffs for
African, Caribbean and Pacific states and less developed countries are
valuable, but the supply from those sources is less than was
anticipated at the time of the last reform. That has left the market
with a shortage of sugar and idle capacity in EU refineries, which is
putting their future viability under
threat.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000155">The
abolition of beet quotas would ease the supply shortage, but would also
increase the risks to the viability of the refining sector, as market
prices are expected to drop while the cost of their raw material
remains high. Losing the refining industry would reduce competition and
introduce food security risks to the EU market. It would also lead to
job losses, including at the Tate &amp; Lyle factory in London, and
threaten the livelihood of growers of cane in developing countries that
currently supply EU
refineries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000156">The
Government will therefore continue to seek fair treatment for cane
refineries as the CAP reform negotiations progress. The focus in the
negotiations on beet quotas has also meant that there has been
relatively little discussion on inter-professional agreements, or IPAs.
As touched on during the debate, IPAs govern the contractual
relationship between beet processors and growers and have traditionally
been valued by both
parties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000157">The
Commission’s proposals contain different wording to that in
current legislation and, as indicated in the debate today, this has
caused some concern whether the intention is to change the ground
rules. We hope that the Commission’s own response to the
committee’s report will provide some reassurance that there is
no agenda to weaken the negotiating position of growers. However, this
is something that we will pay close attention to as detailed rules are
drawn up.</hs_para>

Lords’ questions to the best of my ability. To start with, in
response to the noble Lord, Lord Carter, as the Secretary of State
explained when he appeared before the Committee, a great deal of effort
has been put into developing relationships and building alliances.
Noble Lords would not expect me to go into detail about our negotiating
tactics, but every opportunity is being used to build on that
groundwork so as to make the case for further liberalisation while
accommodating other views where possible. That approach bore fruit in
securing the agreement to a 2017 end date for quotas as part of the
council mandate, and we should be defending that agreement very
strongly for the remainder of the
negotiations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000159">The
noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked how we could achieve 2017 without
financial compensation. We have strong support from some in the Council
for the end of quotas. We are optimistic that the agreement will stick.
We have not seen requests for compensation from other member states,
and do not see a case for that. Compensation for less developed
countries is another matter, and measures can be considered within the
context of the European Development
Fund.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000160">The
noble Lord, Lord Carter, and my noble friend Lady Parminter asked about
work by the competition authorities. As indicated in the
Government’s response, the EU competition authorities, supported
by the OFT, are undertaking an investigation and we would prefer to see
that completed before considering further
reviews.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000161">My
noble friend Lord Caithness suggested that we have relaxed our demand
for an end date for quotas to 2017. We argued strongly for 2015 but
there was very little support in Council. In a negotiation with
26 other member states some compromise has to be made and,
with Germany, France and others pushing for 2020, an end date of 2017
was a relative negotiation
success.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000162">The
noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked for an update on the state of play on
risk management discussions in the CAP negotiations. The past 18 months
have been very challenging for farmers, with some difficult weather
conditions such as late snow, even as recently as Easter, as noble
Lords will know. The Government are therefore considering how best to
support farmers to manage risks. The Rural Development Regulation
offers opportunities for supporting risk management. For instance, the
proposed risk management toolkit, if used, could provide subsidies for
agri-insurance and mutual funds. However, consideration should be given
as to whether subsidies in this area are permanent or temporary and to
what degree these sorts of products are needed by farmers in the United
Kingdom. As the toolkit is in Pillar 2, using it would mean there would
be less money available of course for other Pillar 2 activities and
priorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:00:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000163">The
UK is opposed to the income stabilisation tool proposed by the
Commission. We are concerned that it is unstable and unpredictable. In
any case, the countries that use such tools, such as Canada, have them
instead of direct payments, not in addition. We should not focus solely
on the risk management tools set out in the Commission’s
proposals that directly address risk management in the Rural
Development Regulation. 
<?notus-xml column=165?>There are other activities enabled by the Rural Development Regulation
that can be used to support farmers to manage their risks, for example
by enabling them to make investments in physical assets which help to
mitigate some of the risks that they may face. The development of the
next English rural development programme is under way and Defra is
building an evidence base. We will be considering the objectives and
priorities for funding through the next programme based on that
evidence and the objectives for rural development set out in the draft
EU rural development
regulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000164">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:01:33"></hs_TimeCode>
use of tools available under the rural development regulation is only
one of several options. We are working with industry, the financial

with their representatives in July to look at the impact of recent bad
weather on farming cash flows. There is a frost insurance scheme and a
private sector scheme for sugar beet. There is a market for such

noble friend Lady Byford asked how the ACP and less developed countries
could be helped to stand on their own two feet. There are a number of
factors holding less developed countries back, including economies of
scale, infrastructure and skills at both farm and processing level.
Solutions need to be tailored to the specific national problems, which
is being done under the accompanying measures for the last reform,
albeit too
slowly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:02:32"></hs_TimeCode>. My noble
friend asked which countries have received assistance and how it is
being disbursed. I think the noble Lord, Lord Carter, asked about that
too. The main beneficiaries have been Kenya, Mozambique, Ivory Coast,
Swaziland and Tanzania. My understanding is that of the £1.2
billion intended for accompanying measures, some £0.95 billion
has been awarded, of which £0.5 billion has actually been paid.
My colleagues in the Department for International Development are
pressing the Commission on that slow
disbursement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:03:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000166">My
noble friend Lady Byford and the noble Lord, Lord Carter, also asked
why, if sugar prices have declined for the producer, consumers are
paying more in real terms. Available data suggest that retail prices
did not fall in line with the cut in EU prices following the last
reform. Sugar users contend that this is attributable to generally
rising costs within the supply chain, for example, energy and labour.
However, others have questioned the extent to which sugar users have
been able to capture the price cuts and not pass them on to consumers.
As indicated in the government response, the European Commission
authorities are making inquiries into alleged anti-competitive
practices, which may throw some light on this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060331000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603-gc0001.htm#13060331000167">My
noble friend also asked whether the use of the term
“inefficient” to describe the production systems in some
countries is a reference from a grower’s or a refiner’s

Caithness also asked about mandatory written contracts. The Government
are sympathetic to the concerns that he referred to in the context of
interprofessional agreements. The issue, as I understand it, is not so
much about what is in the Commission’s proposals but about what
might be introduced in the detailed rules that will follow. While
wishing to see normal competition principles apply as far as possible,
the Government are also mindful of the need not to unbalance the legal
framework governing the relationship between growers and processors.
When it comes to negotiations on the Commission’s detailed rules
in due course, the Committee may be assured that we will consult all

food choices. We keep all evidence on the impact of taxation on
promoting healthier food choices under review. We believe that the
voluntary action that we have put in place through the public health
responsibility deal is delivering results; 33 companies have signed up
to pledge to help the population reduce their calorie consumption. I
argue that this is the right way forward, but I emphasise that we are
not complacent and we are clear that this is something for all food

conclusion, there is much that the Government and the committee can
agree upon, including support for genuine CAP reform that removes
distortions from the market and delivers real benefit to consumers and
producers, a desire to see strong, competitive beet processing and cane
refining industries in the United Kingdom and appropriate safeguards
for producers, both in the UK and in developing countries. We will

always very much appreciated. The balanced view of the noble Baroness,

eligible for care services, their ordinary residence should be assessed
to determine which local authority is responsible for the provision of
these services. The Care Bill does not make provision for how to
determine ordinary residence when a young person moves from being
eligible for children’s services to being eligible for services
under the Care Bill. Therefore, when making decisions about the
ordinary residence of young people in transition to adult services,
local authorities will have to have regard to all relevant legislation.
There is no set procedure for determining ordinary residence in this
situation because every case must be decided on an individual basis,
taking into account the circumstances of the young person and all the
facts of their
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306037000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603w0001.htm#1306037000036">Guidance

Publication of the guidance has been delayed, as it now forms part of a
wider guidance document on collecting personal data from prisoners
across all the protected characteristics in the equalities legislation.
Whilst this delay is regrettable in this specific context, it is felt
that a much greater positive impact will be achieved in the longer term
by making available comprehensive guidance on collecting the full range
of data from prisoners. It is planned that this will be rolled out
across the prison estate by the end of June
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306037000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603w0001.htm#1306037000039">In the
meantime the guidance has been piloted in six establishments, in each
of which there was an increase in the number of prisoners recorded as
identifying as Gypsy, Roma and Traveller or Irish Traveller. This,
together with the use of the 2011 codes with new prisoners entering
prison, means that the numbers recorded as identifying as Gypsy, Roma
and Traveller or Irish Traveller have increased considerably since
January. It remains the case, however, that many existing
prisoners have yet to be given the opportunity to revise their
previously stated ethnicity and that the current total of
Gypsy, Roma and Traveller or Irish Traveller prisoners is
highly likely to be an undercount. For this reason we are not in a

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
Nash):</Member> The comparative curriculum analysis undertaken by the
department on the English curriculum  focused on
jurisdictions where English is used as a mother tongue or as the
language of instruction, and where their pupils showed consistently
high performance in reading assessment. In addition, the literature
curriculum of both Anglophone and non-Anglophone jurisdictions were
examined to assess what we could learn about the specification of
reading lists, including in a number of European countries. The
department published this analysis in December
2011.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306037000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130603w0001.htm#1306037000208">I regret
that the Written Answer given to Lord Quirk on 25 April 2013
(<I>Official Report</I>, col. <I>WA</I><I> </I><I>464</I>) was
incorrect. The Hong Kong curriculum was not used to inform the English
curriculum, although it was used in the analysis of both the
mathematics and science curriculum. The reason we excluded
Hong Kong and other non-Anglophone jurisdictions in the
analysis of first language curriculum is that many language
features such as tense present different difficulties in different
languages and call for different levels of maturity. In addition, word
reading and spelling are particularly challenging in English because of
the complexity of its
orthography.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

confirm that a simple majority of member states voted in favour of the
European Commission’s proposal. We accept that, in order to be
effective, marketing standards need to operate at an EU level. The
argument we made in opposing the ban on refillable olive oil 
<?notus-xml column=118?>containers is that the burden imposed on the industry and the lack of
coherence with EU waste policies means that the measure is
disproportionate, particularly given the vague, unquantified benefits
ascribed to the new requirements. Regrettably, neither the Commission
nor a majority of member states agreed with this view at the time.
However, common sense has now prevailed; the EU Agriculture
Commissioner announced on 23 May that the proposal is being
withdrawn and that he will consult further on the issue before deciding
next

Learnt and Reconciliation Commission and wider measures on
