more than 80 FTSE companies engaged with customer services to encourage
them to communicate with their deaf and hard-of-hearing customers
through a mix of more suitable contacts, be it by e-mail, SMS, text

most encouraging. Given that some 800,000 people in the UK are severely

also that the technology exists pretty cheaply to provide the necessary

for the many people whom my noble friend has highlighted. I understand
that for between 55,000 and 70,000 people in our country British Sign
Language is their first or preferred language. The Minister for
Communications has been extremely active, working with other
departments, Ofcom, banks, service providers and voluntary
organisations. The relay services working group has been set up to
advance the potential for VRS and I would urge all service providers to
see implementation as a matter of top

Lord Bishop of Exeter:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree
that it is a question not merely of introducing helpful technology such
as video links but also of the appropriate human communication skills
to accompany it—for example the ability to speak slowly and
distinctly with an appropriate background to aid lip-reading or a
recognition that those with a hearing impairment might process material
rather more slowly, particularly when they are engaged at a distance?
What encouragement are the Government able to give to the banks to

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> I entirely endorse what the right
reverend Prelate has said. It is very important that not only the banks
but all those customer service 
<?notus-xml column=1698?>providers are aware of how their employees should be trained. Indeed,
the British Bankers’ Association is endeavouring to ensure that
these problems are resolved, particularly in terms of training for deaf
and hearing-impaired customers. Many concerns have been voiced around
faulty hearing loops, for example—about their being in place in
banks and about customers being aware of them. However, technological
advances cannot replace the most important feature of our existence,

parts of your Lordships’ House may need some assistance. In
truth, the banks recognise that they have a responsibility there, and
the Equality Act 2010 is very clear that, with reasonable
adjustments, all services should be available to all customers. With
the <I>Banking Conduct </I><I>of Business Sourceb</I><I>ook,</I> which
is the way in which the banks are looking at this, they are actively

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, Scope tells us that 63% of people with
hearing difficulties experience at least one problem compared with 37%
of all those who are disabled—so this is a very serious issue
indeed for those who are hard of hearing and disabled. It is very
encouraging that the Government are having these discussions, and it is
quite right too. However, have they set targets for the banking
profession and other financial services to bring down that number? Does

it a priority to increase our engagement with Germany. We have nearly
quadrupled the number of ministerial and senior official bilateral
visits to Germany each year compared with 2009-10. We have established
joint meetings twice a year of the British-German ministerial
committees on the European Union, in which I take part myself. The

Königswinter conference on 31 May, and the Prime Minister works

continuous process of negotiation. We are pursuing a multilateral
reform agenda and, indeed, in the past few months a number of things on
that agenda have been achieved. We were committed to containing the
growth of the European Union budget and the multiannual financial
framework agreement has achieved that. We have been committed, as
indeed were the previous Labour Government, to extensive reform of the
common fisheries policy; that has now been more or less achieved. We
were committed to an EU patent court; that is now here. There is a

one of the best ways of ensuring that great concerns are not caused by

it said that the way to proceed is through a broad, positive reform
agenda for the EU as a whole and not by devising new cut-outs for the
UK. In the effort that the Government are making to talk at all levels
with the German Government, which I strongly welcome, please do not
forget—and I hope that the Minister will say that he has not
forgotten—about the need to talk to France, too, because
unanimity is needed to get many of these

Daniel Maclise was himself a very important artist? He was important
both in Parliament and outside it, he was a friend of Charles Dickens
and he died, as I recollect from my reading, in not very propitious
circumstances and in poverty. Part of the reason for that was his

Does he accept that this report confirms that the absence of a father
figure in a child’s life results in a child being statistically
less likely to achieve higher educational outcomes, more likely to
encounter the criminal justice system, more likely to have health and
emotional problems, to have a higher chance of teenage pregnancy and to
be more likely to suffer from severe economic disadvantage? As we
approach Father’s Day this weekend, will my noble friend
reaffirm the vital role that fathers have to play alongside mothers in
raising their children? Should he be in search of an appropriate gift

too many children are growing up as victims of family breakdown and
lone-parenting households, which appears to be leading us towards a
catastrophic social meltdown unless urgent action is taken. Does my

men to become primary school teachers and role models to the thousands
of children who are growing up without any male influence in their

there will be at least 20 cases where a father has no interest whatever

a man to love, respect and be responsible for his children, it is
nevertheless a human tragedy of such immense proportions as to demand
the urgent action of Government. Is there a specific plan that the

social trends which have been going on for many decades. There are two
ways of looking at family breakdown: in some ways it is a liberation,
and in some ways it is an unnecessary tragedy when you have children
involved. Clearly, we have various prevention measures, a fund to get
counselling practitioners trained and support for people so that when
they separate, that separation is as amicable as
possible.</hs_para>

which has not happened so much in previous generations is that we have
much more complex family networks, with in-laws and step-parents

for selecting Fermanagh as the location for the G8 summit. He had
scores, if not hundreds, of possible locations throughout the United
Kingdom from which to choose, but I am sure that it was simply 
<?notus-xml column=1707?>the beauty and tranquillity of the surroundings, together with the high
quality of communication and security available, that led to the
choice. I can recommend that noble Lords go and see just how nice it
is. I must also thank the nearly 4,000 policemen from other parts of
the United Kingdom who are rendering support to the police in Northern
Ireland over the coming days. We hope that they have a pleasant and
peaceful time, but I am confident that they can cope if anybody tries
to disturb the

out that our response must be intelligent and patient, and while
military action may be necessary, it must be combined with a political
response. My own experience is that good intelligence is absolutely
essential, but it is unlikely to be obtained on the scale necessary
until we have won the ideological war and convinced the communities

Apple’s UK profits are spirited away in a similar manner and, of

comment and anger about this, not least in this House last week, but
tax avoidance is lawful and a natural instinct that government uses to
shape popular choices. Directors considering their duty to their
company may even think that it is obligatory. I think that the sensible
response is to clarify what is lawful and what unlawful—and
maybe, indeed, to extend what is unlawful. This will also need action
at international level. At least the senatorial report might result in

and money-laundering are similar threats to global and national
economic health. This is not just a third world problem. At a reception
in this House a few weeks ago to launch his book entitled <I>Fragile
Empire</I>, Ben Judah estimated that roughly one-third of public
expenditure in Russia is lost through corruption. That is an enormous
figure. Global Financial Integrity, in a report published in February,
<I>Russia: Illicit Financial Flows</I>, said that the Russian economy
had lost hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit financial outflows.
These outflows represent the proceeds of crime, corruption and tax
evasion. The report estimated the size of Russia’s underground
economy, including drug smuggling, arms and human trafficking, at no
less than 46% of GDP—another astonishing figure. In the past,
much of this was laundered through Cyprus, but I understand that now a
lot of it is laundered through the UK and its dependencies. This is the
preferred route, because money is considered safer here.</hs_para>

Account Tax Compliance Act, and 17 EU members have called
for a new global standard based on that Act. Equally important is
developing accurate registries of who really owns and controls
companies, and being clear about the beneficial ownership of companies.
This seems to be developing rapidly; there are reports in the press
that indicate that some people are reluctant to join in this scheme. I
hope that the Minister can bring us up to date on this, and touch on

turn to two issues where Russia is in a position to make a positive
contribution, one of which is Syria. It is often said of Syria that
there are no good options left, but it is not unusual for us to have to
sift out the worst from the not so bad. Leaving the Sunni majority in
Syria to be crushed by Lebanese Hezbollah, Iranian Revolutionary Guards

Iran, it looks as though the regime there will continue to accumulate
20% enriched uranium, which it has in significant quantities. That can
be taken to weapons grade in three to four months at the outside, but
it does not look as if the regime will try to do this until it suits it
to do so. Therefore, the international community needs to ensure that
it is in a position to detect such a dash and to do it in sufficient
time for action to be taken by the Security Council, so as to avoid the
possibility of others taking their own initiatives. Unfortunately,
looking back over other cases where countries went nuclear, it is

me turn to more cheerful matters. On trade, it is hoped that the G8
summit will see the launch of negotiations on a free trade area between
Europe and the United States. The prize here is enormous, but estimates
vary. It is said that a US/EU free trade area would add $60 billion or
in some cases $80 billion to US GDP, and $50 billion to $100 billion to
EU GDP, including at least $10 billion to the United Kingdom economy,
with further worldwide gains in excess of $80 billion. The figures are

US Government have indicated that they want to achieve an agreement

the less, there are some reasons for optimism. We have some economic
successes. The business editor of the <I>Times</I><I>, </I>Ian King,
pointed out last week that this year more cars will roll off
Britain’s production line than in any year since 1972, and that
four out of five of these cars will be exported—a phenomenon not
seen since 1976. Since 2010, while public sector employment has fallen
by some 420,000, 1.3 million private sector jobs have been created.
Some purchasing managers’ indices—PMIs—have been
published recently, in which a figure over 50 indicates growth and a
figure under 50 indicates contraction. This week, the <I>Financial
Times</I> gave a very interesting regional breakdown of the latest
figures. Yorkshire and Humber lead the field with 57.6, a 26-month high
for the region. Wales is second on 56.7, which is a remarkable 39-month
high for Wales. London comes third on 56.4, a 14-month high. All other
regions in the UK show growth, except for Northern Ireland, which on a
figure of 49.6 is very close but not quite in to the positive field.
However, for Northern Ireland, that is an 18-month high. We therefore
have a remarkable picture of very significant growth shown by these PMI
figures. Of course, they are only possible forerunners of actual
growth, which still has to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000082">There
are still other problems: lending to SMEs continues to shrink;
productivity, to quote Mr King, remains lousy; we are still running,
proportionately, a bigger deficit than Greece; and exports are rather
disappointing. But these weaknesses underline how right the Government
are to prioritise tax and trade. We do not expect next week’s
meeting to solve all problems, but we hope that there will be progress
on what are indubitably the priorities for the country and that this
progress will contribute to the continuing recovery of the economy. I

in 2005 was undoubtedly one of the highlights of my time as First
Minister of Scotland. Many of us will remember the incredible events in
advance of that summit: the 200,000-plus people who in Edinburgh the
weekend previously called for making poverty history; the concerts that
took place in all eight capitals, creating a global movement for
change, perhaps for the first time ever; the work by UNICEF and others
to involve young people in the G8 and its discussions in a way that had
not happened before; the horrific violence that took place in Edinburgh
in the two days before the summit; and the attempts to climb the fence

inside that fence, the discussions involved, for the first time,
leaders from Africa and around the world—not just the G8 leaders
but others, too—who came together to try to solve one of the
great problems and challenges of our age. The
next morning saw the horrific bombings in London and Tony
Blair’s departure from Gleneagles to come back here to take
charge. However, in Gleneagles there was a resolve to finish the summit
and make the decisions that were required, including the commitment to
$50 billion of new money in aid, the hope of a new agreement on trade,
perhaps not yet realised, and action on debt, education and health, all
of which contributed to a great pride in Scotland that ultimately the

are perhaps new. The threats may be slightly different but, again,
leadership is required. In my view, the agenda that has been set out to
advance trade, to ensure tax compliance and to promote greater
transparency, particularly in tax affairs, is the right one for our
time. However, on trade, although it is vital that the EU-Japan
discussions and the EU-US discussions get under way because they affect
us all, it is also vital that we do not forget that agenda of fair
trade and ensure that global trade agreements open access to markets

briefly about Caroline Muchanga, who lives in Mazabuka in Zambia. She
has two daughters and one son. On a good day, from the small market
stall that she has in her village she earns $4, which is not always
enough to feed her children or to pay the school fees for her
daughters. One of the products that Caroline sells on her stall is
White Spoon sugar, made by Associated British Foods. As estimated by
ActionAid, ABF makes about $123 million in profits in Zambia
alone every year, yet Caroline Muchanga pays more in cash in tax in
Zambia than ABF. This is immoral. ABF is not alone, and it is perhaps
wrong to single out one company, because there are companies and
individuals doing this all over the world and not just in sub-Saharan
Africa. However, that lost tax to countries such as Zambia is estimated
to be about three times the total of international aid from the
developed world to the developing world. That loss of revenue cripples
economies, it affects public services and it costs lives. Therefore,
when the G8 meets next week in Northern Ireland, it must act on these
issues.</hs_para>

as the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, already said, the global sign-up to
financial information sharing is a vital part of the agenda for this
summit. The UK can take a lead in this by insisting both that all our
European Union partners sign up to this financial information sharing,
and that the UK dependencies and territories play their part, too. I
would be interested to know what the Minister can tell us about the
discussions with the dependencies and territories that will take place
over these next few
days.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000090">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:24:23"></hs_TimeCode>,
and I think absolutely crucially, a legal register of beneficial
ownership is long, long overdue. To make progress on this agenda it is
absolutely critical to understand who owns companies and corporations,
understand who gets the profits, and understand who is moving them from
the countries where they are made to the countries where they are held
for tax purposes. I understand that some members of the
G8—perhaps including Canada, as was reported in the Canadian
press recently—may be hesitant about a legal register of
beneficial ownership. The members of the G8 need to show global
leadership on this agenda. They must be brave, be strong and ensure
that such a register is in place. It must apply not only in the G8
countries but right across the world, so that those countries that are
currently losing out on all that revenue have a chance to identify and
chase it, and ensure that their economies can benefit more successfully
in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000091">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:24:23"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is crucial that the UK’s leadership of the G8 next week does
not deal with these issues in the context of Europe or of
the strong economies of the world. The summit must also take action
really to secure the opportunity for the weakest economies in the
world, the poorest countries of the world, to make the most of any
changes that are put in place. This includes capacity building, of the
sort that Britain has supported over the years in Rwanda and elsewhere,
in order to build successful revenue authorities that can create decent
tax systems and consistently collect taxation revenues. That sort of
action to build capacity in the developing world must go hand in hand

replicate what happened at Gleneagles in 2005. Some of the promises
made then have not been fulfilled. We should be disappointed by that,
and we should continue to press those responsible to meet the
commitments that they made back then. This agenda moves that a step
forward. It talks about changing the rules, rather than just giving

Falkner of Margravine:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Lord, Lord Trimble, for securing this extremely timely debate ahead of
next week’s G8 
<?notus-xml column=1713?>meeting in Northern Ireland. I am going to concentrate on just two of
the three Ts that the Prime Minister identified as his priorities for
the meeting: tax and transparency.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:24:21"></hs_TimeCode> tax, it has
long been argued that bilateral arrangements between countries were
never going to deliver. Multinationals simply move to a different
jurisdiction, cloak their activities in opacity and pay their teams of
lawyers and accountants to devise ever more ingenious methods legally
to avoid tax—legally in law at least, if not in
spirit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000095">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:24:21"></hs_TimeCode>
is with great enthusiasm that I see the United Kingdom rising to the
challenge of tackling tax and transparency in this forum. While these
eight countries may not represent the collective might of the
world’s main economic centres today—I must say that the
presence of Italy seems a little anachronistic—the G8 is a good
place to start. Any progress here will surely lay the foundations for a
wider debate among the G20 countries, to be hosted by
Russia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000096">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:24:21"></hs_TimeCode>
subject of the tax and transparency of large corporations generates
public opprobrium like no other. A poll in <I>Prospect</I> magazine
recently found that the public hugely disapproved of large corporate
tax avoidance—some 88%—while their disapproval of wealthy
individuals who cheated to avoid tax was significantly lower at
something like 38%. Not paying VAT to the plumber or to the person who
came to do the odd job, but paying cash, resulted in only about 6% or
7% of people disagreeing. That may not be entirely rational, but the
lesson that I would draw if I were a large multinational is that the
large corporations are in the firing line, not small individuals, as
the public see
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:25:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000097">It
is a hugely ambitious agenda for the Government to take on, and the
challenge of breaking down corporate secrecy by seeking to require
companies to disclose their beneficial ownership, which is asking who
owns and controls them, is to be applauded. By setting up centralised
registers with a clear line of sight, which is the minimum available to
the law enforcement agencies—I would like public access as well,
but I recognise that that may be too much to ask for at this
point—the poorest Governments who have the greatest need will at
least have the tool with which to begin to look for their stolen
assets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:26:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000098">This
would not be comfortable for the rich developed countries, nor for
their associated tax havens. In the former category, we have the United
States where much responsibility for corporate oversight is at state
level so the Government may be less willing to act against the state of
Delaware, for example, which according to the <I>Economist</I> has more
companies numerically than its population. Small countries are the best
known tax havens and unfortunately many are UK Crown dependencies or
overseas territories. In this regard, the Commonwealth—I am
aware that the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, will speak right
after me, so I shall be careful what I say and mute my criticism as I
know well to do when he is speaking—has been rather feeble at
taking action as a forum that might have been well suited to this task.
Among its members are some of the poorest countries of the world, where
assets have been plundered and corruption is rife. The ability of these
countries is heavily circumscribed by the lack of
capacity—having sharp 
<?notus-xml column=1714?>civil servants and revenue officials, schooled in the latest techniques
of outright corruption and capable of spotting corporate tax
evasion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000099">At
the other extreme, among its members are the offshore banking
centres—the relatively rich Caribbean islands where many of
these companies are registered. We have only today heard the news that
Bermuda, among the richest islands and a strong financial services
centre, has announced that it will not sign up to the
multilateral convention on mutual tax assistance. This is particularly
frustrating as all three Crown dependencies—Jersey, Guernsey and
the Isle of Man—have come on board along with the Cayman
Islands. Perhaps the Commonwealth could embed a programme of secondment
of experts from the rich developed world. Perhaps even the architects
of these opaque tax structures might go and work with those poor
countries’ tax authorities to try to build up capacity to
retrieve those billions owed. It may be a sobering experience for the
practitioners in the City of London to see for themselves what the
effects of their work reaps in the lives of the millions who are
deprived of the benefits of their natural resources, for
example.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000100">Turning
to extractive industries, US entry along with France and Germany to the
extractive industry transparency directive is extremely positive. We
cannot continue with a system where secret deals are struck by
companies and Governments whereby huge amounts of profits disappear
into the ether. It is evident that when we require companies to say
what they have paid and Governments to disclose what they have
received, it is harder to steal. The United Kingdom is right to press
this case more vigorously despite the fight back in the US from the big
oil companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:29:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
We have also seen the public dismay caused by corporate tax avoidance
with the likes of companies such as Google and Starbucks. People often
say that when a company provides essential services it is difficult to
vote with your feet, as people have been able to do with
Starbucks—sufficiently so as to make it volunteer to pay
£20 million in tax. But volunteering is surely not good enough.
People say that we cannot take similar action against Google because
using a search engine is no longer an optional extra in our lives.
However, we know that its profits are made from selling advertising and
it should not be beyond the wit of the British public to reject the
products of those Google advertisers until the company sees that it
might need to come into line as its profits go south.</hs_para>

companies argue that it is for the United Kingdom legislatures and the
Executive to come up with laws that prevent them from their propensity
to avoid. To some extent, I have sympathy with that argument. When we
get report after report from the Public Accounts Committee, as we have
this morning, it is not entirely clear to me why the
Executive—our Government, HMRC and the Treasury—cannot
come back to Parliament with some proposals at least to attempt to get
to grips with the problem of new and more innovative structures being
developed by the financial services sector on a regular
basis.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061350000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000102">I will
use my last minute or so to talk about Syria, which is also on the
agenda. For those, like me, who believe that the civil war in Syria
will be brought to an 
<?notus-xml column=1715?>end only when the parties are prepared to come to the negotiating table,
it is axiomatic that that will inevitably be brought about by success
or failure on the battlefield. For the western world to stand aside
from supplying arms when all around them are doing so—and to the
most unfriendly groups in terms of our interests—it seems that
as a country we have become entirely isolationist. That is something
completely out of character with our history, our international
standing and our permanent membership of the United Nations Security
Council.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000103">Moreover,
we may eventually be forced to do so under our obligations in
humanitarian law. So I say with some regret that I wish we would not go
down the route on which we believe we have to ask Parliament to approve
every step in our moves to deal with the Syrian imbroglio. I do not
understand why an Executive—a Government—are appointed if
they feel they are so weak in tackling what is clearly in our
interests: ethically, morally and in humanitarian
terms.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/867CC395C854ABBA30C20F854EAD4C247DF92A89" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 June 2013">Thursday,

Howell of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, we should all be grateful
to my noble friend Lord Trimble for initiating this debate and for his
excellent opening speech. I also welcome siting this G8 conference in
Fermanagh, which is one of the most beautiful areas of our United
Kingdom. I got to know it well during my privileged time as a Minister
in Northern Ireland for two and a half years. As my noble friend Lady
Falkner has reminded us, the Prime Minister’s priorities for
this G8 are the three Ts—trade, tax compliance and transparency.
All are excellent issues which we should pursue with vigour.</hs_para>

mainly on trade, although on the tax compliance issue I merely observe
that obviously the efforts are completely commendable. However, in
dealing with the hyper-connected world of unbelievable complexity in
which we now live, it is difficult to see how Governments will ever
catch up completely on a multinational scale with all the devices for
avoiding and minimising tax liabilities. I leave your Lordships with
this thought: we should be a little uneasy about the idea that the
answer is more and more power to the tax-gathering authorities, on
almost Bourbon levels. It will not solve the problems, which are
undoubtedly there. The complexity is very
great.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000106">This
leads to my main point which I want to share with your Lordships. In
this transformed world, the character of trade has changed almost
beyond recognition. Modern trade now follows a totally different path
from anything that the world has ever seen. In today’s heavily
interconnected world, it is no longer a question of products
manufactured in one country being sold to another. The advent of the
modern supply chain means that most manufacturers use components from a
variety of different parts of the network and from different
countries.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061350000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000107">In
these novel conditions, markets are simply no longer definable in terms
of tariffs, quotas and other protections. On Europe, for instance, we
hear the current mantra that the single market must be preserved, but
the nature and meaning of the phrase “single 
<?notus-xml column=1716?>market” has been completely transformed. The common trading
platform of the world wide web is building up a new kind of
supranational single market which is highly competitive and very
transparent; it is criss-crossed by intricate supply chains and knows
no regional boundaries whatever. The often asserted
“fact” that the European Union is the world’s
largest single market is in fact no longer correct. Cybermarkets on the
world wide web are much larger. Pacific rim markets, including the vast
market of China’s new middle class, are just as large, with the
growing consumer markets of India, Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, Thailand,
Vietnam, east and west Africa and a score of other places all coming on
extremely fast
behind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000108">Not
only have old classifications such as “manufactured
goods” ceased to have any statistical meaning but the trade in
services—which 30 years ago was hardly worth
mentioning—has taken centre stage with its knowledge-intensive
products. The driving forces of international business have shifted
into a world which is only dimly understood even now. It certainly was
not at all understood all those years ago. In particular, the old idea
that the path to free trade lay through negotiating down various
tariffs and quotas has lost much of its meaning. It is the non-tariff
barriers which are woven into countless procedures, customs and
attitudes that now stand in the way. Their existence and persistence
depends not on tariffs but on deep cultural factors and processes. The
assault on them has to begin not with numbers or even with detailed
negotiating facts but with the deployment of soft power in all possible
forms.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061350000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000109">That
all, in turn, depends on the power to communicate and persuade and to
open up our economies—for which, incidentally, the modern
Commonwealth network, with its common working language, its
vast and intimate professional links and its dazzling cross-cultural
cross-pollination, is of course ideal. When listening to the Canadian
Prime Minister just a short while ago I was a little sorry that, in an
otherwise splendid speech, he did not mention that aspect. However, I
agree totally with my noble friend Lady Falkner in her remarks that the
Commonwealth, as a network, ought to be an ideal vehicle for the kind
of proposals that she put forward on improving transparency and tax
compliance.</hs_para>

in the background to all the changes I am describing, that we are
dealing with a world which is totally transformed, with 2.5 billion
people on the internet at all times. Mr Eric Schmidt of Google
estimates that there are now more mobile telephone subscribers on this
planet than there are human beings. Every morning, 300 million Chinese
go shopping online. We are doubling the data we draw out of the system
for trade and other activities every nine months. I will share one
further blinding statistic with your Lordships. Under the present
system we generate in two days more data than were generated between
the dawn of civilisation and 2003. We are, in short, in a completely
transformed atmosphere in which trade is operating in totally different
ways. That is one point that I hope will be understood by the G8
dignitaries when they gather at Enniskillen and in Fermanagh.</hs_para>

there has been a lot of talk about the G8 being the top table, but it
is not. There are many top tables today. The rioters last Sunday in the
City of London were completely deluded when they talked about this
being the power centre—the centre of wealth and riches and so
on. Not even the G20 is the top table today. There is a new alphabet
soup of organisations, alliances and networks springing up all over the
planet, and they are beginning to exert as much power and influence as
the old G8 and the other institutions of the 20th century, such as
NATO, the UN, the IMF and the European Union, all of which are
struggling to adjust. New sets of initials are swirling round in this
alphabet soup which we have to adjust to: OIC, SCO, AU, GCC, AL,
UNASUR, SAARC, ANMC, PIF and Caricom. I will not take time to spell out
what all those stand for. I can see the noble Lord, Lord Triesman,
shaking his head. Those are just a few. At the end of the list I put
the largest and densest network of all, the Commonwealth network, which
unites 2.25 billion people in a common system, as I have already
described.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000112">Procedures,
attitudes, organisations and institutions have only dimly begun to
reflect what is happening, and most of the media, with some brilliant
and insightful exceptions, have hardly done so at all. A network
world—for that is what it has really become—operates
quite differently from one of hierarchies and blocs. Relationships
emerge of a quite different quality; priorities are
reshuffled; new elements, previously ignored, come to signify.
Suddenly, in a digitalised network system, everyone has to be kept in
the loop, small nations and large. More than that, the networks become
part of the legitimising process. Agreement for international action at
the United Nations has to be supported by agreement across the
networks. All have to be consulted, won over and brought along, because
all are now instantly, and in most cases continuously,
connected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000113">I
will end by saying that I hope that at Fermanagh our colleagues and
leaders engage with these new issues, because they are entirely new,
and do so with a suitable degree of humility, fully realising that in
today’s world they are not the top table; they are only players
in a far larger and newer scheme of things. They are not the bosses;
they are the partners. They have to grasp the opportunity to understand
that status, otherwise they could well find that they are not players
at all but merely
spectators.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/4FC69CF2079EC14E6594899CC781B6ECDF0933D1" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 June 2013">Thursday,

their commitment to funding international development aid amounting to
0.7% of annual national income. Their example at a time of global

importance of strengthening transparency was brought home to me by
visits to a sub-Saharan state made with other parliamentarians and

wealth while the multitude lived in squalor. The charity Transparency
International drew attention in particular to the way that the

made with oil companies for extraction payments. British Petroleum

took part in a wonderful debate last Tuesday, initiated by the noble
Lord, Lord Empey, on overseas aid. We were on the same side in
expressing our pride and delight at what was being done and at how this

already seen the number of under-fives dying from preventable diseases
fall quite dramatically over the past 15 years, from an average of 12
million per year to just over 6 million now. Last weekend, the
Nutrition for Growth summit, which came out of the Olympic hunger
summit and which the Prime Minister has followed
along with his responsibilities on the UN high-level panel on finding
successors to the millennium development goals, agreed yet more funds
that can be directed to that task. That funding should ensure that a
further 1.7 million children under five will be saved as a result of
these initiatives by 2020. That is profound. I cannot think of anything
else that could come out of the summit that could possibly match it. I

walked from London to Dublin—with a little help from the Isle of
Man Steam Packet Company between Heysham and Douglas in the Isle of Man

connection with this initiative. It is what goes down in government
circles as an aspiration. One need only look at my physique to realise

from my noble friend Lord Howell’s fascinating speech on the
global scene to make some structural points about the G8 and to seek
some comments from the Minister, who I know is academically and
politically well informed in these areas. Any gathering that seeks to
achieve anything needs all those present to be capable of acting on
what comes out of it. I want to test that a little further. Does the G8
as presently configured meet the global challenge? The group originated
in 1975 at Rambouillet when it was convened by President Giscard
d’Estaing to bring together the world’s most powerful
industrial nations and market economies. It really followed the
collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement, which had modified
international exchange rates until then and a successor body was needed
to bring the industrialised nations together to iron out global
economic
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000127">When
it was initially convened, it was the G5, and then Canada was added the
next year. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Russia became a
member. Then the G8 was extended to the G9, with the EU being given
observer status. I want to test whether we need to look at this again.
What was right in 1975 does not necessarily reflect the world in 2013.
Of the current top 10 economies in the world, China, Brazil and India
are not present at the top table, although I accept my noble friend
Lord Howell’s point that in a network world such terms are not
entirely accurate. Is it right that the EU should have an additional
voice at the G8 when it already has four very powerful voices in
Germany, France, the UK and Italy, and yet the powerhouse of Asia has
only one representative at the table, Japan?</hs_para>

closely with the permanent members of the Security Council? Again, they
were relevant in 1946, but with the absence of Brazil, Germany, Japan
and India, the composition is limited when agreements are reached that
require political and sometimes military action. In short, it seems
entirely right that the most powerful political and economic countries
in the world should have a special relationship. The helpful briefing

Hunt of Chesterton:</Member></B> My Lords, we should be grateful to the

Ireland. Of course, the G8 is more than about just trade. As the noble
Lord, Lord
McConnell<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:57:35"></hs_TimeCode>,
reminded us, it is about people, culture and science. Ireland’s
unparalleled contribution to culture, with its great scientists and
poets, is familiar to us all. A connection between trade and culture
comes to mind. When Oscar Wilde went to New York in the 1880s, he was
asked as he went through customs whether he had anything to declare. He
replied that he had only his genius to
declare.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:58:14"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000134">Of
course, I approve of the enthusiasm expressed by the noble Lord, Lord
Trimble, for trade and the contribution of the European Commission in
those negotiations, which has a dominant role in determining non-tariff
barriers, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Howell. Without the role of
the EC, we would not be in this position of influencing and
participating in these extremely important global determinants of
trade<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:58:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000135">I
will not repeat the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Bates, about a more
realistic approach in the international world of negotiation, which I
was delighted to hear. I will say only that the extraordinary issue of
how the international framework of discussions should be changed cannot
be solved by a collection of Prime Ministers sitting around the table.
Surely it should proceed by initiating research programmes of many
think tanks and universities around the world. The first step would be
to put it on the agenda. If we could all agree that there should be an
international research programme on that, involving all the countries
the noble Lord mentioned, that would be a way forward. We cannot just
have a snap decision, obviously. So are the Government thinking about
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T13:59:39"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Howell, mentioned, we live in a highly networked world. At
the meeting in 
<?notus-xml column=1722?>Brussels on Tuesday on global systems, organised by the European
Commission, a colleague working on energy from University College put
up a slide of Buckminster Fuller’s 1939 vision of a global
electrical power network. As he commented, in fact we are now having a
transfer of electricity from the UK, Europe, Russia to China; before
long it will be India. While we are having these extraordinary
technical collaborations, which are growing consistently, our political
masters are blowing hot and cold about how we should
collaborate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000137">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:00:34"></hs_TimeCode>
was rather the same in the Cold War when, for instance, all weather
forecasts were exchanged. The only person who did not play cricket
about weather was Saddam Hussein, who turned off the weather when he
arrived in Kuwait. This was considered a very bad show. It had never
happened before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:00:49"></hs_TimeCode>.
The point is that there is a technical world and a political world.

other important point about the 2006 UK G8 meeting, which the noble
Lord, Lord McConnell, emphasised, was that despite the terrorist
bombing in London—which I heard from my office in UCL; it was
very frightening for many people in London—important commitments
were made to reducing third-world debt, increasing aid and tackling
climate change. One of the important events of that G8 meeting was that
the UK Government, with backing from many other Governments, supported
a parallel meeting of global legislators that began a sustained
programme of introducing new laws and regulations in countries to deal
with climate change. That is an absolutely necessary underpinning of
international
agreements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:01:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000139">That
work was extremely controversial when it began. For example, only in
2006, many countries regarded deforestation as a neo-colonial word to
stop people cutting down trees. It just shows how concepts have
developed and collaboration has increased. Now this kind of approach is
very much supported by the World Bank, the FCO, and UN climate
agencies. In fact, progressively the G8 has undertaken many of its
projects in conjunction with other bodies. It is no longer regarded as
just an exclusive body. In Italy in 2007, for example, I attended a
remarkable meeting of G8 and UNESCO. It was a meeting on innovation and
education which involved innovation from countries all over the world,
such as pioneering development of inexpensive medicine in India. This
progressive outreach of G8 is something we should continue. Again, this
is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell said, the notion that G8 is just
an in-group of a few leaders is not how it is working
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:03:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000140">I
also want to make the sideways comment that Canadian legislators have
taken a very strong lead in this idea of legislators working together

Government rather
forcefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000141">In
2012, the G8 under the United States chairmanship focused on the Arab
spring and the contribution of science and technology with natural
disasters. Its focus on the former has not been very successful, one
might say, but its work on the latter was a continuation and a building
on the work of the United Nations report in 2012 bringing together UN
agencies and other parts 
<?notus-xml column=1723?>of the United Nations systems in explaining the impacts connecting
natural disasters and climate change as well world population. Again,

year, as we learn from the House of Lords Library paper, to which the
noble Lord, Lord Bates, has also referred, the Government have
organised some specialised conferences to deal with specialised issues.
Some of them have only involved G8 countries—for example the G8
science meeting—but others have had a broad membership of civil
society groups in the G8 and other countries. I hope that theme will
continue. There were two separate meetings on nutrition and innovation.
However, these two themes need to be connected. For example, there are
remarkable improvements in India with people now using social media to
learn about the best use of agricultural aids as well as acquire data
about weather and climate. This is having remarkable effects. To start
with, there was some resistance to the use of social media. The idea of
giving people mobile phones in place of seed was, as it were, an issue
to be discussed. Now we realise that these two things have to go

the noble Lord, Lord Howell, about too much data, there is not enough
data in African countries. African farmers are not collecting and
measuring their rain. You must collect your rain if you want to know
how your crops will develop during the season—knowing whether
you have less or more rain. Many other areas of data are collected by
many different agencies in African countries which are simply not
exchanged. Some noble Lords will have heard me banging on about this
before, but I still find it hard to get that sharp focus on the simple
question of data exchange being accepted as an important issue by aid
agencies and even DfID. They are very keen on global computer models,
and so am I, but I am also keen on people measuring

meeting, like others, raises issues and starts initiatives. I hope that
the UK will set an example which other countries have not followed very
much: reporting on the G8 meeting during the following year, so that we
know what has happened. For example, we have our Library document,
which covers initiatives this year, but it is difficult to find out how
it connects to initiatives in previous years. That would be very

tax matters, he does not, at least to me, appear to have put a foot
wrong. As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has just said, the days prior to

Minister has sought to keep the agenda simple and taut, with its
emphasis on trade, on tax and on transparency. The critical issues
contained in the letter of 20 May to which I have just
alluded—tax, information exchange and beneficial

that we should necessarily be too optimistic about securing all we
seek. The Minister responding to this debate confessed earlier this

commend the entirety of the article to anyone who has not yet read it.
Professor Collier has been an Oxford Professor of Economics since 1993,
a fellow of St Antony’s since 1986 and he has been director of
the Centre for the Study of African Economies since 1991. The latter
shows up in particular in the rigour and comprehensiveness of his
analysis of the hazards and complexity of the solutions that these
problems will require. Happily it is, of course, to his
college’s St Antony that we pray when we have lost something and
cannot find it. Not for 
<?notus-xml column=1725?>nothing did the head of taxation at OECD aptly refer to the existing
arrangements as “double non-taxation”. In the context of
the subsequent transfer to the G20 meeting, it is a notable vindication
of the Government’s employment of Professor Collier that he was
also invited by the Russian Government, current hosts of the G20, to
address the major conference on tackling corruption in government and
business that they convened in
April.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000151">I want

haven is St Helena, where a forebear of mine was a distinguished and
gallant governor between 1787 and 1801 and where his nephew, whom he
brought out as his secretary, remained until 1834. Thus, a family
connection with the island was created that lasted not only through
Napoleon’s stay, but in all for almost half a century. However,
those British territories which are tax havens have understood our
intertwined role and, in the case of Jersey, have given leadership in

essential actions in shaping the rules that characterise a fair and
open global economy, ensuring that both developed and developing
countries
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:16:59"></hs_TimeCode>. Like

summits have sometimes been seen as places where western nations have
pointed the finger at developing countries, but this meeting is also
about the G8 countries getting their own house in order. To make a
difference to developing countries, it is vital to reach agreement on
things such as tax transparency and trade. This will allow developing
nations to know, when developed nations go into their country, what
they are paying for the contracts, what those Governments are
receiving, and what the real benefits are for the people of those
nations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000160">As
we have discussed, fairer taxation will be a key priority at the talks.
It is important that we get political support for ensuring that global
tax rules are fit for the 21st century. As the recent hoo-hah has
shown, it cannot be acceptable for companies to create shadow 
<?notus-xml column=1727?>shell companies offshore, effectively meaning that neither the developed

these companies are not paying tax on their profits, developed and
developing nations cannot provide the public services and support that
are needed. We do not underestimate the complexities and challenges,
but it must be a key part of what we are doing at the G8 to say to
companies, “You have to be transparent about who owns you, where
you are owned and what tax you are paying”. As my noble friend
Lord Brooke pointed out, research suggests that Jersey is now the
world’s largest exporter of bananas. We know that that is not

transparency of taxation must also be accompanied by greater

will be able to track funds right through the aid chain to the point of

development; health; water and sanitation; food security; governance;

Trimble, said in his opening speech, a deal between these two regions
could add—and we could discuss the figures—a huge amount
to the EU economy alone. Trade between developing countries and within
Africa is growing, and we should encourage that work further. This
means continuing to support the multilateral system, and working
through the WTO to agree a deal to sweep away trade bureaucracy. That
alone could be worth huge amounts of money—$70

Science<I>.</I> Undernutrition is a chronic lack of nutrients that can
result in death, stunted physical development, and a lower resistance
to illnesses in later life. It is the biggest underlying cause of death
in those aged under five in the world and is responsible for 8,000
child deaths each day. It stunts the growth of children, reducing their
potential, undermining their adult earnings by up to 10%, and in some
countries reducing the size of the economy by 11% as a
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000168">The
Global Nutrition for Growth Compact was endorsed by a total of 90
stakeholders, including 24 Governments and 28 business and science
organizations. It secured new funding of up to £2.7

ultimately to enhancing the lives of those most in need: improving the
nutrition of 500 million pregnant women and young children; reducing
the number of children under five who are stunted, by an additional 20
million; and saving lives of at least 1.7 million children by
preventing stunting, increasing breastfeeding, and better treatment of
severe and acute malnutrition. As the noble Lord, Lord Bates, said, if
nothing else comes out of this summit, that is a huge
achievement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000169">This

From 2008, following the sharpest decline in world trade since the

my view, the reality is that the Government are desperate for some good
news from the G8. The United Kingdom has flat-lined. It looks much more
like the long period of stagnation which the Japanese economy

to point in a direction that he appears to be unable to achieve with

make one further point on the trade priority. Some fireside corner of
this G8 must assess the consequences of the collapsed Doha round. The
G8 continues to take far greater value from trade out of Africa than we
put in. That point was made by a number of noble Lords. The mispricing
and underpricing of African commodities is a motor for African poverty,
disease and conflict. The inflated prices that the advanced world
extracts for sophisticated, not always useful products; our
unwillingness to transfer knowledge and capacity; and the willingness
of some people to renege on the G8 promises at Gleneagles are all
millstones on Africa. My noble friend Lord McConnell was right to

evasion and avoidance is, rightly, the second major priority. While the
warm-up discussions have revealed some big differences of opinion about
where tax liabilities are generated and tax can be collected, these are
key issues, and I applaud the Prime Minister’s intent on this.
Whether individuals or Google-style companies are involved in evasion
or avoidance, these matters need to be addressed. The noble Lord, Lord
Trimble was right to remind of us of the nine multi-nationals in such a
position. That is not a critique of fair tax planning, but it is a call
for opposition to what may be the Canadian and Russian objections that
could scupper the process.</hs_para>

Cameron should come back to Parliament to report that he has secured
five practical steps. First, we need a clear reform of
country-by-country reporting where multinationals publish all the key
information required to assess their tax liability—revenues,
profits and taxes in each country in which they
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:48:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, disclosure of tax avoidance schemes and 
<?notus-xml column=1735?>systems should be extended to all global transactions. Thirdly, we
should seek greater transparency in tax havens, disclosing information
on who is hidden behind front companies and trusts. The G8 should
launch a convention on tax transparency. Canada is not entitled to
block such arrangements. Fourthly, the G8 global assessment of the
impact of controlled foreign company rules with attention to developing
countries would be helpful. I note that the Government are reluctant to
get into this area but it is a global package that would strengthen
their own G8 priority. Fifthly, we should seek reform of the corporate
tax system to prevent profit shifting and the use of opaque havens. The
current system lags far behind global economic developments and the
wiles of
specialists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:49:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I
heard what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said about the perhaps
unconquerable barrier of complexity. Tax cannot be put into the

the Minister respond positively to those five suggestions, designed to
bolster the G8 priorities of the Government? The points made about the
impacts on transparency are also a priority. We support the focus on
land and extractive transparency, and progress would unquestionably be
a blow to corruption. I join in commending the African Union’s
land policy initiative and commend Kofi Annan’s reports on the
imbalances of trade which are impacting on Africa. I am tempted to
recommend an initiative on transparency and anti-corruption in
international football, but I might be straying a touch too far

general, this is the right time to push for anti-corruption agendas.
Many will advise the Prime Minister not to push too hard in case some
of those to whom he speaks recoil. Russia’s interests in Cyprus
have been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble; the noble
Baroness, Lady Falkner, has mentioned some of these matters and a quite
remarkable set of statistics from Delaware. A commitment to transparent
public registries would transform matters. It would never be easy again
for international criminals to work the way that they do and have the
freedom that they have had. We should not settle for a lesser or
cosmetic solution. I hope that the Minister will assure the House that
the Prime Minister will put on all appropriate pressure, including on

that, sadly, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Bath and Wells is
about to retire. Over the past week, I have been thinking about the
first Bishop of Bath and Wells whom I was aware of, who stood on the
right of the Queen, I think it was, as she was crowned. In some ways I
regret—though in others I am glad—that the current right
reverend Prelate has not been able to assert that privilege during his
time as a Bishop. We shall miss him, but the Bishops keep the House of

say.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000210">Before
moving to other topics in this debate, I want to answer the noble Lord,
Lord Triesman, on the coalition Government’s attitude to
international and European co-operation. I say this as a Liberal
Democrat, but what I have heard from the Prime Minister and Foreign
Secretary in recent weeks has been outstandingly clear: our national
interests rest in international co-operation and in remaining a full
and committed member of the European Union. I have heard no such clear
statement from any member of the shadow Cabinet.</hs_para>

responsible opposition, we also need a clear indication from the Labour
Party of its commitment to staying in the European Union and its
position on a referendum. We need clear cross-party support in the
national interest. I see that the noble Lord is unhappy with my
criticism, but I look forward to hearing a clear statement from the
Labour Party on those issues. I am happy with the coalition position on
European reform and with the way in which we are moving forward with
the balance of competences exercise and I reject the idea that we are
being blown about by the right-wing press and UKIP.</hs_para>

debate in terms of the G8’s broad agenda, particularly about
going to Fermanagh. To hear the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, refer to
Fermanagh as “tranquil” is an indication of just how far
Northern Ireland has moved. Enniskillen was anything but tranquil 20
years ago. Fermanagh and Tyrone were bandit country during the Irish

substance of what the G8 leaders will discuss when they meet next week
and address the question of whether the G8 is the right body to meet.
The noble Lords, Lord Bates and Lord Howell, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Falkner, raised questions about whether we should now
be going with some other body. It is of course always easier to carry
on with what you have than to carry on with something new. However, I
would stress that in many ways this is the best group we have because
it is the only group we have to focus attention on strategic global
issues, whether they are economic, political, developmental or
environmental.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000215">As
the noble Lord, Lord Bates, remarked, the G8 had its origins as the G4
in 1975, when three major European Governments were trying to bring a
then rather distracted American Government back to discussing how we
managed the global economy. It was then expanded to become the G7 with
Italy, Canada and Japan—and with the EU playing a role, because
the EU as a collective body has competence in matters of trade, which
has always been very important for the G7 and G8. Russia was added in
the mid-1990s when, as a post-communist country, it was becoming a much
more open society and moving towards a rather more open market economy.
This is a group, after all, which is committed to free institutions,
open markets and open societies. That is one reason why, as I was
saying at the Dispatch Box yesterday, we have some concerns about the
direction in which Russia is going. These eight countries are
responsible for 50% of global output and 66% of global trade, so in
many ways they are still the reliable top table at which one has to
discuss many of these matters, in a rather messy response to the need
for some form of global governance among major sovereign
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000216">There
is of course the G20 now, the larger grouping which includes the
Chinese, the Indians, the Indonesians, the Brazilians and others. The
G20 will be meeting in St Petersburg in September, under Russian
chairmanship, and many of the issues to be discussed among the G8 will
be pursued further there. We all have to recognise that in different
ways China, India, Indonesia and Brazil are still reluctant to take on
and share the full responsibilities of global leadership and that much
of the agenda for global co-operation and future global regulation thus
remains to be negotiated between European countries, the European Union
and the United States, then to be accepted by others.</hs_para>

grown more institutionalised. It has grown larger and its agenda has
grown amazingly wide. The numbers of officials attending have
mushroomed and our Prime Minister is attempting to bring back direct
conversation, intimacy, informality and a focus on getting things done.
The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, queried the outcome and the
follow-through. One of the British initiatives this time is to have an
accountability report to look back at former G8 pledges and see what
has been done. We have produced a report with checks on what we think
has been achieved, or moderately half-achieved, and what has been left
undone. It is not that bad a record, actually. Of course, as in all
negotiations between Governments, there are some things on which you
simply cannot manage to make progress, but we have made a lot of
progress, particularly on global
development.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/4BE6AF0FAE63C4B4DDDF621DD6D9714E8F13BBC2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 June 2013">Thursday,

not been particularly co-operative on a global trade agenda which is
why we are having to pursue regional trade negotiations. If we are able
to achieve a trade agreement between the United States and the European
Union to follow those with Japan, Korea and Canada, we will have made a
major contribution to global economic growth. This is about the rules

make the information available to competent authorities. The European
agenda, the global agenda and the G8 agenda overlap and complement each
other. In all of this one has to recognise that tax sovereignty and
global markets do not go easily together. That is why we have to pursue
these international negotiations on tax transparency in order to regain
a degree of our tax sovereignty. The Government have been relatively
successful over the past three years at regaining tax from
multinational companies. I am told that HMRC has collected more than
£23 billion in extra tax since 2010 through challenging large

part of bilateral or multilateral aid programmes, helping these

not wish to detain her. Secondly, my noble friend Lord Wallace of

look forward to some fascinating contributions from such a mix of
people with backgrounds in various industry and arts organisations. I
am sure that they will all come from different angles, because culture
is a 
<?notus-xml column=1742?>broad umbrella. The critic Raymond Williams suggested that it was a
“structure of feeling”. I would not dare to go into
definitions such as that, and it is probably better not to try. All I
know is that you can listen to a Beethoven symphony, which you can hear
played to perfection in this country, go to a Mozart opera, which will
be done as well as anywhere else in the world, go to an extraordinary
exhibition, whether of art at Tate Modern, antiquity at the British
Museum, or in a modern gallery—each to their own. Your
particular brand of culture may even be Coldplay or Blur, or jazz, but
you will find it all in this country, and done to perfection. We are
incredibly lucky to have that, and we have to nurture
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:15:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000240">We

however, we are not here to extol the mere beauty and enjoyment of the

Therefore, I will begin by wholeheartedly endorsing the view of Ed

said,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13061350000471" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000471">“our

wise words from our Ministers, and at such an important time,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:16:41"></hs_TimeCode>. Our arts
and culture benefit the economy in so many ways. They create jobs,
provide training and are innovative, and the innovations they make
often transfer into industry and export for the service sector. Of
course, the arts also provide an enormous stimulus for tourism. I will
give a few statistics. The numbers in tourism are huge. Inbound tourism
is the UK’s third-largest earner of foreign exchange, according
to DCMS. Tourism contributes £115 billion to UK GDP. It employs
2.6 million people, of whom 27% are under 25. We cannot overestimate
the importance of those young people having jobs. When half the youth
in Spain are now out of work, how important it is that we keep our
young people
working<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:18:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13061350000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000243">Why
do tourists come to Britain? Anyone who has been outdoors today knows
that it is not because of the weather. They come because we can offer a
unique experience. We have heritage which nobody can better, and, as I
have said, we have arts on a phenomenal scale. According to the Arts
Council, culture and the arts support a creative sector that by 2020
will have grown by 31%. The UK has the largest cultural economy in the
world as a proportion of its GDP, and that brings in the tourists. The
National Brand Index survey, which covers 20 countries, found that 57%
of respondents said that history and culture would be a motivating
factor in their decision about where they would go. Half of them said
that they would be sure to go to a live music concert if they came to
Britain, and 38% said they would go to an opera, a ballet or
the theatre. Museums and galleries were a huge draw: 48% of
international holiday visits within England include 
<?notus-xml column=1743?>visits to the museum, and 25% go to an art gallery. They come to Britain
because of the arts and culture we can offer
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000244">Museums
and galleries are the most popular visitor attractions. There are 50
million visits a year to our national museums alone. According to the
Association for Leading Visitor Attractions, more than half the
UK’s adult population—many of whom are tourists, of
course—visited a museum or a gallery during the past year. That
is a very cheering statistic. Remarkably, the cultural Mecca that is
Exhibition Road receives more visitors in a year than Venice. The
wonderful museums that we have there—the Natural History Museum,
the Science Museum, the V&amp;A—bring in tourists in numbers

yesterday, we heard of the delights of the nation’s regional
museums. There was a spirited defence of the museums that the Science
Museum is suggesting might be in danger if it sees its grant cut. Our
museums and galleries have learnt to be innovative. Look at what the
V&amp;A is exhibiting today—David Bowie’s costumes. It is
a brilliant exhibition and is bringing in a completely different
audience. Look at Tate Britain and its new hang, looking at paintings
chronologically; making more sense to a new generation of visitors. We

cash to be shared around, sometimes the more deserving cases have to be

course, many will take exception to this. They can all argue their
case, but from the statistics that I have given it is unarguably the
case that it is the major attractions in London that first of all draw
in the tourists from overseas. They can then encourage those visitors
to go elsewhere once they are here, but London is where they come
first. Those institutions in London do more than their fair share for
the regions and the economy of those
regions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0001.htm#13061350000249">As I
mentioned, I am a trustee of the British Museum. The British Museum is
an extraordinary asset for any country to have. I would argue that it
is unique in the world. It has 6 million visitors a year, with another
13 million visitors through its website. Its role is not
just to exhibit, although its primary role is of course the
conservation of that extraordinary 
<?notus-xml column=1744?>collection. It is there also to work on soft power. The museum is doing
amazing work all over the world. In Basra, it is helping to create a
national museum from the remains of one of Saddam’s many
palaces. In India, it is working with local curators to teach them, to
learn from them and to build bridges. In Abu Dhabi it is working with
the locals who are building their own museums. Wherever you go in the

every sense of the word—parties took many more children into
these museums. Family parties constitute a big part of the audience. It
is not just a select, elite group who go to these institutions. When
the museum staged its Hajj exhibition, 48% of the visitors were
Muslims, largely from this country. As I say, our arts and cultural

would argue that the opening ceremony of last year’s London
Olympics was anything other than a wonderful showcase for the energy

that history is likely to condemn us for what I believe to be our
failure to build a significant legacy off the back of that
extraordinary opportunity. Why does having the drive and determination
to capitalise on the economic contribution offered by this
nation’s creativity matter so much? It matters because other
countries are investing considerable sums of money in their own
cultural activity and they realise the impact it has on their
reputations and their economic growth. Unless we are determined
dramatically to raise our own game, we are likely to be condemning
ourselves to the status of one of the global also

I exaggerating? How about this for an example of seriousness of intent:
about a dozen years ago, the South Korean Government, including their
educational system, became concerned that while their industrial base
was growing well, the creativity, within which so much intellectual
property and value added reside, was not developing at anything like
the same rate. They decided to invest around $1 billion over a number
of years in developing and enhancing what was termed their creative
capacity. This programme has been an unqualified success, to the point
at which South Korea is now the powerhouse of the entire Asian

fantastic asset which we can draw upon to maximise our contribution to

expires at the end of 2016 and, as with the lottery, I argue that this
represents a perfect opportunity to review the way in which the
corporation supports the nation’s cultural output, and to
explore ways in which that contribution can be made even stronger and
more effective, notably by helping to invest in new talent and new
skills, both of which we are already desperately in need of. As I am
sure the noble Lord, Lord Grade, and others will affirm, unless
industry and government find ways of working together to invest in our

think that we will need to find new ways to help support the arts. As
many of you will be aware, there is enormous growth in the gambling

displacing money spent on our National Lottery. I would like to think
that the proceeds of a point of consumption tax on online gambling
could, for example, be used to supplement the nation’s
investment in arts, sport and culture. Many of the companies that
operate in the online gaming space are based offshore, therefore making
very little contribution to the overall, long-term prosperity of the
country. By finding an effective way to use the proceeds of an enhanced
tax on gambling to support arts and sport, we would be harnessing what
may well prove to be a worrying rise in gambling activity, and allow it

cannot close without reminding the House that the value of the arts and

conversations, and even policies regarding the arts and culture, were
focused almost entirely on their social and educational value. By

managed to make the case that they were also making a significant
economic contribution to the nation. The case has been made even more

I am concerned that this Government are in danger of allowing the

Important as their monetary contribution is, the value of arts and
culture can never be reduced to pounds, shillings and pence. They
represent something infinitely more valuable

will make one particular point that I regard as important and that
other noble Lords may not make. First, I will illustrate the paean I
uttered about the Arts Council with some examples of the initiatives
that I outlined. I am drawing on developments since the most recent
arts debate in which I participated, in 2010. I am thinking, for
example, of the creation of The Space in May 2012, and of the Creative
Industry Finance scheme to aid struggling exponents and creative
entrepreneurs with development loans of £5,000 to
£25,000, repayable over a maximum of three years. I am thinking
especially of the Creative employment programme and the £15
million invested in providing 6,500 apprenticeships and internships for
16 to 24 year-olds. I say “especially” because
for a quarter of a century I was a trustee of the Wordsworth Trust in
Grasmere. Its current chairman, the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury,
will speak later in the debate. The trust used its physical estate and
the benefits regime of the Thatcher years—my remark about
benefits is a technical one, not a commendation—to allow a
series of able graduates in the same kind of age group to prepare for
careers in museums while acquiring practical skills in the ordinary,
day-to-day functioning of the trust’s

Arts Council’s partnership with its colleagues in the Creative

loans over two years, similarly managed by a partner music

a longer and perhaps more traditional timescale, I am thinking of the
linkage of creative businesses to cultural organisations close by, so

use of public money to explore the potential of new ideas as a form of
creative R&amp;D, and to sustain the seemingly

the question of self-respect, I like the chief executive’s
measured clarion call about the unique ability of arts and culture to
fire our imaginations and inspire and entertain us through the
contribution that culture makes to our quality of life. Of course,
these forces go back much earlier, but it is worth reflecting that it
is only just over a quarter of a millennium since Mirabeau coined the
concept of—and thus the word—civilisation. What is deeply
impressive, in the same breath, is the ability of those involved to
afford us a utilitarian justification of the straightforward financial
return earned on this programme that can be rendered to the economy
without shame or embarrassment. The most recent CEBR report is rich in
specific and illuminating detail, and is an anvil for further
R&amp;D.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000271">The
one question I want to ask the Minister is how the sector is getting on
with the opportunity it spelt out for philanthropy back in 2010. There
are outstanding instances, like the Royal Opera House, but there are
other institutions already surprised by the less satisfactory marks
they scored in the Arts Council examination three years ago, and which
may not have yet properly remedied their rejection by fundraising
themselves, whose success is its own reward in moral as well as
financial terms. In another heritage field, the efforts of small
parishes to raise the finance to restore their listed churches are a
useful signpost towards this goal, which can astonish and invigorate
the individual stakeholders who take part in it. Is there an area here,
where the Arts Council can enlarge its positive and practical quiver,
by helping to teach people how to raise
money?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000272">Finally,
there is one particular point I wanted to single out. I have not myself
lost sight of the phrase, “We’re all in this
together”, although I appreciate that some other
people have. There are still disciplines in which we can look the world
fully in the eye, and the extension of their number lends
support to the efforts of those in other similar disciplines. When I
was in the private sector, I once had a client who always put his
international offices on the continent in cities where there
was a good opera house, not just for his own pleasure, but also for
that of his employees. Put at its simplest, beyond the ordinary tourism
statistics, those foreigners who might have the need to do business
with us on other counts, are more likely to do so if our arts, like our
fighting forces, are world class. In this regard, I was struck by the
disproportionate participation in the recent global lists of
world-class cultural institutions in the <I>Times</I> of ones that are

a country, we have always been blessed with a wealth of creative
talents, which have shaped and illuminated our history and national

from ideas, innovation and imagination, inspired and fed by the rich
tapestry of British culture and the arts. Our creative industries are
crucial in contributing to today’s global economy, where capital
and labour are mobile and goods and services can be produced almost
anywhere. This was evident on a recent trip I made to Guadalajara as
the Prime Minister’s trade envoy to Mexico. It has been
designated a digital creative city, focusing on attracting companies

home, the economic contribution of the arts and cultural sector has
grown since 2008, unlike the UK economy as a whole. Our film industry

for culture and the arts also feeds through into the economy at
regional level, so it is of great concern that in certain parts of the
country disproportionate cuts are being inflicted by local government.
It is also short-sighted; recent LGA and Arts Council research shows
that putting money into culture is an investment rather than a simple
subsidy, in that it revitalises local economies and regenerates
neighbourhoods. The idea behind the Lowry in Salford was to build a
major arts complex as a trigger for the regeneration of the area, and
it has been a resounding success in encouraging social cohesion and as
a catalyst for the regeneration of the local economy. The BBC’s
decision to relocate some of its key departments there, and the
subsequent development of MediaCity, are clear evidence of
this.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061350000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000280">If

said, the business models of arts organisations are and should be a

the mixed economy works. I pick up here on what the noble Lord, Lord
Brooke, said about philanthropy. The Government have established a
match-funding scheme with £80 million from public
funds to encourage philanthropy, but I think that there has been a
problem with success in this area, because the sector does not really
have fundraising skills. I suggest a slightly different solution to
his, which is that part of that £80 million should be used to
teach small and medium-sized organisations how to raise

1,600 donations. My favourite model has been developed by RADA.
Apparently the skills required as an actor playing a role, performing
in front of strangers and something called status adjustment are also
needed by businesspeople, who are flocking to sign on to a day of being
taught these things at the cost of £625—so the Treasury

Earl of Clancarty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Wheatcroft, for the opportunity to participate in this debate. If
the Government wish to concentrate at least part of their efforts on
maximising the arts’ economic benefits, policy making needs to
stem from an understanding of—I say this to Maria
Miller—the special nature of the arts. This is not to say that
the arts are better than any other area, it is to say that they have a
particular character.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061350000287" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000287">Cultural<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:54:22"></hs_TimeCode>
value is different, distinct, from the normal values of business, even
if the arts themselves may be economically heterogeneous, often
expressed as a spectrum, with the non-commercial at one end through to
the highly commercial at the other. This heterogeneity is not a
statement of an ideal, it is a statement of fact. The arts that we may
think of as commercial are often not wholly commercial at all, most
obviously in current West End hits like the RSC’s
“Matilda”. Most theatre and most commercial film in
Britain uses actors and directors who have worked in subsidised theatre
around the country. As has been said many times, if subsidised theatre
did not exist, we would have not only an impoverished theatre scene but
a lesser pool of talent. Barbara Broccoli joked last year that
“Skyfall” was the national theatre of
Bond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:51:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

arts are much more than a seedbed for the commercial sector. The
argument from those who would wish to have all the arts funded through
private money and philanthropy is that the arts can stand on their own
two feet; that they can become resilient. But the crucial assumption
made here is that it will be the same arts doing this. This is the part
that is not true. What is apparent to arts centres since the cuts is
that spaces or services are lost or become taken over by more
commercial productions. It is the disappearance of the innovative at
grass-roots level that will have a long-term and significant effect on
our arts economy. It is not the same arts
regrouping<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:52:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000289" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000289">Reducing
public investment means that we will lose that cultural value. To treat
the arts mainly as a commodity or a branch of
manufacturing—which I fear that this Government may intend to
do—is not to get the best out of the arts in terms of their
intrinsic or economic
value.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000290">The
uncertainty about the future departmental representation of the arts
does not help. Can the Minister throw some light on this? Rumours would
not be flying around if we had a strong department with strong
leadership, which I add is no fault of anyone’s but the
Government. If some or all of the arts got swallowed up by BIS, it
would be a disaster for the arts in Britain. It is because of that
special character of the arts that they need their own strong voice in
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000291">In
terms of the Government’s attitude towards innovation or
R&amp;D, as it is increasingly called, the trend is often towards
projects which can be bolted on 
<?notus-xml column=1752?>to existing established structures. Where they are appropriate, this
works really well—among many, one can cite
NT Live with hundreds of venues across the world as a successful
project. But project money is no substitute for the day-to-day running
of the majority of arts organisations. The furore that occurred with
Creative Scotland last year, when 49 arts organisations had their
funding entirely removed and replaced with lottery money for what were
perceived as prescribed projects, the concerted rebellion by artists
which forced out Creative Scotland’s then chief executive should
act as a strong warning that it is the right kind of
funding—core funding—which arts organisations most
desperately
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:53:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000292">The
Government have asked the arts to justify themselves in economic terms.
As Will Hutton pointed out in the <I>Observer</I> newspaper recently,
the Treasury will be awash with reports produced over the decades in
response to this repeated demand and they all say the same thing, which
is that, because of the sizeable multiplier effect, the more that the
Government subsidise the arts, the greater still will be the economic
returns to the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000293">The
other important point to make here is that this works as a macro
effect. The danger of treating every original artistic endeavour as a
discrete business, which the Arts Council is already having to do much
more than it used to, is that the arts will become micromanaged in a
way that will stultify their operation and stultify innovation. There
should be no more reports justifying the arts economically. The case is
proved many times over. It is an unnecessary waste of
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000294" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000294">So the
leading question has to be: why are the Government not increasing
subsidies to the arts instead of continuing to cut? I will say that
again: why are the Government not increasing subsidies to the arts? In
my view, there is no good reason why they are not. The Government say
that in these times every department needs to take its own share of the
pain. That is a false morality which cloaks what is in effect a
divide-and-rule strategy. The reality is that no part of society works
economically in isolation from any other. The actor-director Sam West
points out that the arts pay for hospital beds.</hs_para>

second objection that the Minister might raise is that there is no
money available to invest. That is nonsense, considering how minute in
departmental terms the arts budget actually is. If the public properly
understood that greater public investment in the arts would help to
create significant economic growth which would improve their standard
of living, they would vote for it like a
shot.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000296">Germany,
for one, is doing that. For the eighth year in a row, it has increased
its central funding of the arts—last November, by 8%—and
it is starting from a base investment which is already much higher than
ours. Germany’s Culture Minister, Bernd Neumann, says that
public funding is not a grant but,</hs_para>

other words, an awareness of both the intrinsic value of the arts and
their huge economic benefits, which, bearing in mind that Germany has a
population about a third larger than ours, amounted in 2011 to
€63 billion compared with our current £28
billion—about 
<?notus-xml column=1753?>twice as much. The main lesson to learn from Germany here is that, if we
are at all comparable to it in terms of potential for growth in the
arts, Britain has not reached any kind of
ceiling.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13061350000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000297">We
have been asked in this debate to talk about economic potential, but
that is not what is currently most at stake. For many artists, it is
their survival, and the future on 26 June looks grim. Whatever is lost
will be a loss to the cultural value which drives the arts, including
its commercial wing. Nor should we forget that on top of that are the
cuts to local government and the more than chilling prediction given by
the LGA last year that by 2020, 90% of our local cultural services will
be lost if cuts continue in the same vein. This at a time when many
local councils are becoming more switched on to the importance of their
arts and cultural industries, according to the recent report published
by the
LGA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000298">Many—Danny
Boyle is certainly one—believe that the arts and the creative

previous recession—I forget which one it was, but you get to my
age and they seem to come round so often—I was with a senior
Treasury official. The papers were full of the cuts to the arts and I
said to him, “When you look at this desperately bad publicity
for the Government that you’re serving and the fact that such a
small amount of money”—the money allocated to the
arts—“can produce so huge an outcry, what’s the
problem?”. He said, “You have to understand, Michael,
that we love the outcry because it tells the markets that we’re
serious about cuts. Of course the amount of money is pretty small but
the markets take seriously that we’re serious about
austerity”.
Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:59:12"></hs_TimeCode> said

was very pleased to hear my noble friend Lady Wheatcroft use the word
“celebration” in her introductory remarks. The arts in
this country are in an extraordinarily healthy state.
However, the situation is also somewhat topsy-turvy. The private and
public sectors seem to have got confused in my mind. At the Grange,
that crumbling ruin of a house in Hampshire, I saw a private sector
production of Poulenc’s masterpiece of an opera, “The
Carmelites”, which was a quite stunning performance. You would
expect to see that in the subsided theatre. If you want the
hottest tickets in London for the commercial theatre, you can see
“One Man, Two Guvnors”, “War Horse” or
“The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time”, all
of which emanated from the National Theatre. They are the three
hottest, biggest money-making shows on the London West End stage. So
there is cause for celebration.</hs_para>

arts sector is a peculiar one, because it is where culture clashes,
overlaps and competes with commerce, as well as embracing it. Defining
that line is always terribly difficult. As always, it is about getting
the balance right. It was a little bit depressing, I agree, to hear the
Minister talk about value for money and the balance sheet of the arts.
The arts are more important than that. Through public intervention in
the arts we get greater risk taking. I do not think “War
Horse”<I> </I>or “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the
Night-Time” would ever have been produced in the commercial
theatre. The gestation time was enormous, and the investment and the
risk so great, although the reward was
fantastic.</hs_para>

regret I sat on Alan Milburn’s social mobility committee for
many months talking about what we could do to encourage social mobility
without having understood or having the wit to push the arts. The arts
is the one area where so many of the greatest stars—whether fine
artists, conductors, performers, writers, directors, you name
it—came from such humble origins and found a way to success
through the arts, not necessarily through education. The arts have been
proven to be a fantastic driver of social
mobility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000305">Many
studies have shown that the arts have a civilising effect. Young,
troubled kids who get into music or somehow find a teacher who can show
them that they have talent in the arts are able to express themselves
and gain a feeling of self-respect and self-esteem through the arts.
You cannot measure that on a balance sheet, but we know that it is part
of what the arts
deliver.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000306">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
do not believe that the arts can be immune from the economic downturn
and the economic difficulties that we face. As we hear in this House
pretty well every day, there are so many worthwhile competing claims on
the limited amount of money available. I hope that this debate will
serve to underline this for the Government, but all we can do is ensure
that when things do get better the Government understand the priority
and the benefits of the arts. These apply not only to the economy but
also to what the arts say about this country. Obviously the economic
contribution is terribly
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000307">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

Puttnam, who is also a friend, made two points which I take very
seriously. First, I think it is time for a review of lottery
distribution. We have not had one for some time, as it was interrupted
by the Olympic contribution. The lottery is one of the great success
stories of this country, but at all times we must ensure that if there
is a review the lottery is not a substitution for government funding.
That is the fundamental that John Major set out when he established the
lottery. That could be very important.</hs_para>

I agree with the noble Lord that we must pay attention to the looming
skills shortage, particularly in the film business. The film business
is so important: there are nearly 44,000 jobs in the British film
sector at the moment. Those jobs will become fewer and fewer if we
cannot replenish skills. There are great opportunities and more social
mobility, because there are jobs at every level in the film industry.
It is open to everybody, with great opportunities. We must emphasise
skills and continue to worry about them.</hs_para>

I feel great about the arts. I think we are going through a temporary
dip. Obviously, regarding funding, the arts always want more money and
always should have more money, but there is not more money at the
moment. I hope the Minister will reassure us that this Government
understand the importance of the arts and the many contributions they
make to this country, not only in fiscal
terms.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061350000505" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000505">4.04

wander in its halls is to go on a great journey through the history of
humanity. Its collections tell us what it means to be human and confirm
that the peoples of the world are indeed one. A day in the museum
leaves you with one overriding sense: what distinguishes the human from
animal life is our creativity—our invention of things, our
thinking of things, and then our making of things. There are at the
museum displays of that incredible creativity from the earliest of
times, back to the ice age, as a recent exhibition showed. That making
of things—human creativity and invention—is a national
asset that is beyond price. Here we are a nation that is small in
size—a quarter the size of France—but which dominates the
world in the creative industries. Caroline Norbury, CEO of Creative
England, said that our inventors think the unthinkable—from
Logie Baird to Tim Berners-Lee. We have some of the world’s most
successful brands—from James Bond to Harry Potter. We have the
largest commercial theatre operation in the world with ticket revenues
of £535 million and 40 million visitors a year. It all depends
on artists, makers and
performers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000314">Why
are we so good at this? It is because we have had an environment that
has allowed for experimentation and, at times, for failure. We have in
the past invested in the science and technological research that
supports and respects artistic talent. There is a delicate
ecosystem—an interplay between science and the arts and the
cross hatching of the private and public subsidy—that has
allowed talent to flourish in this country. When people are asked to
think about the arts—theatre, 
<?notus-xml column=1756?>film, paintings—they too often think of them as an add-on that
are affordable only in times of affluence. The folly in such limited
thinking does not need rehearsing in this House. What is forgotten is
the knock-on effect on other sectors that work with the arts to create
innovative products and services. All the design elements in our lives
feed off art. Architecture looks to sculpture for form; graphic design
looks at visual art and photography for new style; advertising looks to
film. Steve Jobs was fond of saying that he did not employ geeks but
hired poets, musicians and artists who were interested in technology.
From that came Apple. However,

was invariably to the advantage of both because there was reciprocity.
People in the City loved being brought together with creatives and it
changed how they functioned in their own milieux. Creative businesses
are small and fragmented, undercapitalised and in need of constant
reinvention. They face substantial problems accessing finance and have
real problems getting banks or venture capitalists on board. It is a
problem that we should recognise. They would often be the first to
admit that they lack business skills and need good advice, but once
they get the motor running, they can become huge financial success
stories. However, we are in danger of doing what we have done in the

The sector is now bigger than the film or music industries. The United
Kingdom also leads in visual effects—all that amazing, fancy

general plea, too, for the places which nurture the ideas and the

make a plea to Government to encourage banks and investors to support
the initiatives. When Roosevelt responded to the Great Depression, he
was persuaded to sustain the arts even in the worst of times. New
projects were created, public art works for railway stations and post

Maclennan of Rogart:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a powerful
debate, delivered by those who are highly expert and experienced in the
field. I very much hope that what has been said will be taken to
heart—as well as into the heads—of those in the Treasury
who are no doubt considering future public expenditure problems.
Although my vocation has been politics, my passion has always been for
the arts. Even year when I played Hamlet and Cinderella at school and
had to consider where my future lay, I did not have the guts to pursue
what really made me tick. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft,
for her most insightful opening to this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000321" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000321">Before
I develop my thoughts, I want to draw attention to one or two people
who have, through their life’s work and what they are doing now,
contributed to a transformation of the possibilities of the arts.
Although the field is under pressure at the moment, I agree with those
who have said that we are unrivalled in our contributions and in the
creative industries. We have been and we have the basis to continue
that, but a big change has come about in my lifetime.</hs_para>

particularly to pay tribute to Denis Vaughan, the former
conductor-assistant to Thomas Beecham. He was one of those who
powerfully advocated that the lottery should be set up and he is still
making the case that the money should go more to the arts. I was glad
to hear several contributions, including those from the noble Lords,
Lord Puttnam and Lord Grade, making that point, which certainly needs
to be considered at this time. Another current contributor to the
debate is the present lord mayor of the City of London, Alderman Roger
Gifford, who decided to make arts and culture one of the central themes
of his mayoralty. He has been talking not about the threat to the City
from the European Union but about building on what we have. He has
committed to establishing the City music foundation, a new charity to
support musicians 
<?notus-xml column=1758?>in the early stages of their careers through mentoring and opportunities
to perform. It has been claimed on his behalf that the benefits derived
from the City’s arts and culture clusters generate a net
contribution of £225 million in gross value added and support
6,700 full-time equivalent jobs in the
City.</hs_para>

the past I represented a community which could scarcely be more
different. It is the least populated part of the United Kingdom: the
constituency of Caithness and Sutherland. I am currently presiding over
a charity called North Highland connections, which enjoys the patronage
of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. We set it up with a very
clear view of bringing to that remote part of the country the
opportunities for individuals to experience and enjoy the arts
themselves, to promote tourism and to encourage young artists from all
around the country to have the opportunity to display and develop their
talents. All these things have come on rather well, although we decided
to do it at a difficult time—namely, 2008. We have subsequently
demonstrated that it is difficult even for the philanthropic trusts,
which are under pressure at this time. Local and central government
have been clamping down on the arts but the benefit of such a
development is, to my mind, patently clear. I believe that this kind of
effort should be given every encouragement to grow all around our
country.</hs_para>

arts with which I have been involved was as chairman of the European
Cultural Foundation, when there was a national branch of that
Dutch-based organisation. That also, it seems to me, provided for the
modern world a huge benefit in bringing to the attention of all our
citizenry, and right across Europe, the cultural identities of people
who are sometimes developing very differently. However, it enhances the
whole and I hope very much that the Government will recognise that that
is an important part of being European.</hs_para>

by awarding grants and leading partnership programmes that support
music-sector directives. It has been invited by Arts Council England to
deliver the new Momentum Music Fund which will inject more than
£0.5 million into the music industry over the next two years by
a seed-funding investment for emerging acts to help develop the careers
of talented artists and bands. I am also impressed by the work of UK
Music which is launching Skills Academy. It has drawn my attention to a
matter of detail and, as an acknowledgement of the work that has been
done by such organisations, I would like to draw attention to what a
number of bodies have said is vital at this time and that is copyright.
Government plans to modernise copyright could have a detrimental impact
on creators, potentially jeopardising the income of British songwriters
and composers. There needs to be an exception to copyright for private
copying, but there should be a requirement for fair compensation. As it
stands, in most EU member states, private copying is legal and any loss
of income is reimbursed by systems of compensation. We must bear that
in mind and I hope that it will be brought into consideration in the
various other forums which are considering these matters.</hs_para>

Berkeley of Knighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the

will keep my speech short. I was pleased to read in recent speeches by
government Ministers a declared belief in the value of the arts and
their importance to the economy. However, by their deeds shall they be
judged for, like all good artists, we must be not simply
self-congratulatory but also self-critical. Of course, we must applaud
and highlight the returns in terms of tourism, reputation and jobs that
the arts create but, please, let us not overlook the social dividend,
as so eloquently stated by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. I will not
repeat my recent pleas in my maiden speech about those
rewards—human, educational and vocational—which are of

today the <I>Guardian</I> carries warnings that many small-scale and
regional arts companies face losing their grants altogether. This is
going to be nothing short of catastrophic for the future of culture in
this country. The cultural scene that has been built up since the end
of the Second World War is now, as the noble Baroness mentioned, the
envy of the world and that feeds, ultimately, into the success of the
big flagships—the Royal Opera House, the National Theatre,
Aldeburgh which is currently under way, the Sage and Tate Modern, for
example. Understandably, they reap the lion’s share of money
available to the arts. Probably among your Lordships I have had a
pretty unique view of the dilemma that arises since I am a composer who
was for a while on the Arts Council music panel where I would regularly
wonder how we could justify such a large slice of the cake going to so
few august centres of excellence. Then I was on the board of the Royal
Opera House where I saw that, in order to be among the best in the
world, we needed every penny of available funding. Now I see this
dilemma from a wider perspective, and I do not mean simply these
distinguished and comfortable Benches, although there are many noble
Lords who, I have discovered with great pleasure, feel passionately
about the arts, as we have heard today. I look forward to hearing my
friend the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury, who fought so valiantly
for free admission to museums, something that I profoundly

noted the point made so recently by my friend and colleague, the actor
Sam West—indeed, one noble Lord already has—who said that
in terms of the theatre it was dangerous simply to look at the return
of large-scale productions in glamorous venues, for it was in
small-scale regional theatres that many of our
Oscar winners, who are vaunted as being at the forefront of artistic
success, cut their teeth and learnt their trade. It is there
that innovation and adventure can be
tried<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:26:01"></hs_TimeCode>. The value
of small-scale investment may not be immediately obvious but in fact it
is vital. “War Horse” was mentioned, but for every war

lesson into my own field, musical composition. As a result of
devolution, a considerable commissioning cake was cut into tiny slices.
This was then compounded, from the point of view of small-scale
festivals, performing groups and composers, by the Arts
Council’s decision to hand commissioning funds to favoured
clients—the big guns, the centres of excellence—and let
them decide who to commission. That is not without merit if one wants
to keep at arm’s length from artistic policy, but there is a rub
and even a contradiction. It in fact creates a policy, an unlevel
playing field, so that smaller festivals like Cheltenham and
instrumental groups like the Nash can no longer find the funds to carry
on the vital work that they have been achieving at the coal face of
music-making. There is a disconnect that means that commissioning is
confined to a circle of well established names and, for the sake of
full disclosure, I have sometimes been among their number. However,
some really wonderful and acclaimed composers are actually on the
breadline at the moment, names that are very famous in the musical
world, and performing groups who would like to commission them find it
impossible to access funds because they are not favoured Arts Council
clients. This process really must be looked at and I urge the Minister
to relay my concerns to the DCMS and the Arts Council—always
assuming that it is still in existence in the coming months. Indeed, I
suspect that information on its current health would be of interest to

that subject, I note that a large portion of lottery money was diverted
from other areas to finance the excellent Olympic Games, in which I am

largest cultural economy in the world as a proportion of its GDP.
Businesses engaged in Britain’s heritage and arts employ several
million people and attract 14 million overseas visitors a
year, and the creative industries account for 10.6% of UK
exports<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:35:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000344" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000344">In
the competition for the world’s leading visitor destination,
London’s museums and art galleries are challenged only by Paris
for the greater number of visitors each can attract. The London theatre
is now doing too well, as the noble Lord, Lord Grade, mentioned. Due
largely to the huge number of foreign visitors to London it is almost
impossible to get tickets for plays such as “The
Audience”, “Othello” at the National, “The
Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time”,
“Once”, or the admittedly American, “The Book of
Mormon”. You have to book ahead if you want seats for the
longer-running “Matilda”, “One Man, Two
Guvnors”, or “War Horse”, while it seems that
“Les Miserables”, “The Phantom of the
Opera”, “The 39 Steps” and “The
Woman in Black” will run forever. We do not talk about
“The Mousetrap” any
more<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>. The
downside to this success story is that there are not enough theatres
available to accommodate some of the excellent productions from our
provincial cities that are looking for a venue in the West End.
However, with so many successes, I have never understood why ticket
prices need to keep going
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000345" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000345">London is
unique, and will continue to attract millions of foreign tourists for
years to come. The Government need more seriously to consider the
countryside, small towns and rural businesses. Britain’s
heritage—specifically its historic buildings, stately homes,
castles, gardens and designed landscapes—is the single most
quoted reason for foreign visitors to come to Britain. According to
VisitBritain, in 2011, 9 million foreigners visited one or more of

attract, and how much our presence benefits local hotels, shops and
pubs. According to its figures, total expenditure generated by inbound
tourist visits to privately owned historic houses is £1.6
billion per annum. Britain has more privately owned houses open to the
public than the National Trust, English Heritage and their equivalents
in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put together. Our most famous
houses—Chatsworth, Longleat, Blenheim, Arundel, Castle Howard
and Woburn Abbey, to name but a few—are still privately owned,
in the hands of their original families, who struggle to maintain them

to popular belief, the majority of those living in grand historic
houses—I speak from personal experience—are not
particularly rich. The main reason for this is because they live in
grand historic houses. They are very expensive to maintain, and to live
in them is both a privilege and a burden. It is a mystery to some
people why we struggle to hold on to buildings we have probably
inherited and in most cases have learnt to love while continuing to
lose money every year. Perhaps it is because we feel we owe it to our
ancestors—I do not

think I am right to say that no stately home open to the public
actually makes a trading profit. The ones that survive do so because
the owner has some other source of income or can resort to selling a
Titian or Van Dyck every other year to fill the gap. The income derived
from opening to the public only helps defray the costs of keeping the
house wind and watertight. On top of that, we must pay VAT on our
structural improvements or repairs, while our rich neighbours can build
themselves a brand new comfortable warm house next door completely
tax-free<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:39:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000349">Now
we hear that the Government intend to cap sideways loss relief, which
was one of the few forms of tax relief which the beleaguered owners of
historic houses could avail themselves of. In this time of austerity,
many owners of historic houses are holding on to their houses by only a
thread. Some are already having to face reality and are forced to close
by their banks. For instance, very recently Torosay Castle in Mull has
been sold to a foreign buyer. The castle is no longer open to the
public and this has put many of the small local businesses in jeopardy.
Every time that something like this happens, Britain is a poorer place.
The contents that belonged to that house are sold and spread across the
world and the value of our country as a tourist destination is
diminished. I ask the Government to take the concerns of historic house
owners seriously and recognise the important contribution that they

constantly to reiterate this simple truth. The arts bring us joy and

important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:42:45"></hs_TimeCode>. But

I became Secretary of State for Culture, I sensed that the arts were
important together with all the allied creative activities
that they generated. They were important because they mattered
economically as well as aesthetically. That is why I
established the creative industries task force served on brilliantly by
the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. It is why we published the mapping
documents in 1999 and 2001 that set out the shape and value and
significance of the creative industries. These are things that are now

and sustaining of, the creative sector of
economies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
hugely important for our economy, especially in these times of economic

leads me to four specific thoughts. First, the links between the
traditional arts sector and the more creative commercial economic
sector are fundamental. One of the reasons we are really good at the
creative industries around the world is because we have a strong arts
base, strong arts organisations and brilliant artistic activity in this
country. These lead to the economic success of the creative sector;
indeed, without the one you cannot have the other. It is people
learning their stagecraft, and learning about stage design and lighting
in regional theatres, that leads to success in film and television
around the world. It is people learning their music craft in
orchestras, in singing and playing, that leads to music that takes the
world by storm, meaning that four out of the top five selling discs in
the United States last year were from British artists. Strong,
traditional arts activity is vital for the economic benefit that comes
from the whole creative
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

There are worrying rumours bubbling around about the possibility that
the Government might be considering disbanding the department. This
absolutely must not happen. We need a strong voice for the arts and
culture in this country. It cannot come from a small offshoot of a much
larger department. 
<?notus-xml column=1765?>Indeed, I would argue for putting the whole of the creative
sector—the arts, the creative economy, the whole of
communications—under the DCMS umbrella and making it a real
champion for this vital part of our national life and
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:46:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

matters. I was pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, take up
this point. The economic value of creative activity comes from the
value of the intellectual property that is created as part of it. We
need to ensure that the creator can be guaranteed a return for their
creativity. There have been some worrying signs that the Government
seek to water down the importance and security of copyright
in recent years—most notoriously, the deeply flawed
Hargreaves report. This must not happen. The Government must reaffirm
their commitment to strong copyright protection and, along the way,
perhaps they might get on with implementing the Digital Economy
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:47:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

cultural activity and the creative economy are things which, as many
noble Lords have mentioned, we are outstandingly good at as a country.
We should be very proud of what we have achieved and are achieving in
this sector. The first 10 years of this century have been something of
a golden decade for cultural and artistic activity in this country. I
like to think that I may have played a small part in helping to
stimulate that. Please do not put all of that at risk. We currently
have warnings from the Arts Council about the possible impact of the
spending review and the danger to arts organisations up and down the
country. This would be disastrous. Some are already operating on the
margins of viability. There is no easy cut that can be made in this
sector. For the sake of our economy, our international reputation, our
tourism potential and above all for the wonderful experiences that the
arts bring for all of us, please do not cut deeply and savagely and
destroy this precious thing that we
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:48:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

rightly talking about infrastructure investment being protected and
even promoted when the spending review arrives. Investment in the arts
is investment in the infrastructure of the mind and the heart. It is
crucial seed corn for the future of our economy. That is
what I urge the Government to do, and what I urge the Minister to go
and talk with his Treasury colleagues about.</hs_para>

Eccles:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow the
noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury. Way back in 1998, when County
Durham was in trouble with the Bowes Museum, the then Secretary of
State commissioned a report. It was a very good report, and after he
received it he said that he would think about the Bowes Museum every
day in his bath. I hope that he still has a bath every
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000360" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000360">If noble
Lords will forgive me, I will take the contribution to the economy for
granted. I am much more concerned about the effect on society, the
educational potential and social mobility, which I find much more
difficult and more interesting subjects. Briefly, I will talk about the
relationship between the state—central and local
government—and arts and cultural institutions. 
<?notus-xml column=1766?>I hope that noble Lords will find that as I go along, I will at least

not seem to me that the arts can flourish without a high degree of
independence. If they are not independent, then they have problems. I
do not see how they achieve inclusion without that degree of
independence. That, of course, takes one straightaway to money because
it is a question of resources, and that has engaged your Lordships
quite a lot during this debate. However, if one agrees that a degree of
independence is a necessary condition for the arts to flourish, then
one has to look and see about the state.</hs_para>

uncomfortable with the arts, and so are local authorities. This makes
the job of the public servants in the Arts Council, as my noble friend
Lord Brooke said, and in other of the institutions such as the Heritage
Lottery Fund, quite tricky. As noble Lords will have seen, there are
spats between the Arts Council and government. This is not a political
speech; it does not matter who the government were or are. There are
spats between the Lottery Fund and government, and changes in position.
I think this is because, while the state is comfortable with and
understands expenditure, it does not understand income. It gets its own
income by a form of legalised
confiscation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000363" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000363">Furthermore,
the state and local authorities are not happy with risks. They are not
comfortable with experimentation and they worry about the
electorate’s responses to things which neither they nor their
civil servants really know about or understand. We have to remember
that 35% of the electorate do not vote, and a lot of other members of
the electorate are not too switched on by the arts. So why is the
independence
valuable?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000364" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000364">I
will refer briefly to Kew Gardens. I was fortunate enough after the
Heritage Act 1983 to be the first chairman of Kew when it came under
trustees. There was no “Friends of Kew” at that time; the
Ministry would not have thought of it. We now have more than 70,000; it
is a lot later, but that has happened. We have had enormously
successful exhibitions of, for example, Chihuly’s glass and
Henry Moore’s sculptures.</hs_para>

happened at Kew; I think it relates much more to what the public like
to go and see than it used to. Many of these things would not have
happened if it had remained under Defra. Take, for example, the
£110 million for the millennium seed bank raised by Kew. Does
anybody really think that that would have happened if Kew had still
been run directly by the department? There is a serious issue about
independence and, with it, a serious issue about why an independent
body deserves so much public money. That is a question that we all have
to answer.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061350000366" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000366">I
will finish, briefly, with the Bowes Museum. In 1998, County Durham had
a problem with the Bowes and proposed to shut it for 18 weeks over the
winter. The argument was, “We haven’t got a lot of money,
we’re subject to constraints”—goodness me, they
are subject to more constraints now even than they were
then—“we have villages down the coast where there used to
be pits, and those villages have community centres and libraries but
not much income, so what are we to do? Are we to give the money to the
Bowes and 
<?notus-xml column=1767?>Barnard Castle, next to Raby Castle, or are we to give it in grant form
to the pit villages?”. One can understand their dilemma; it was
perfectly genuine. They were not disregarding the contribution of the
Bowes or Barnard Castle to County Durham; they had a problem.
Therefore, we negotiated to take the Bowes back to being an independent
trust. Since then, we have raised money to mend the roof and we have
reorganised the collections. We now have contemporary art exhibitions,
and we have had selling exhibitions of crafts. The café is also
a great deal better than it used to be. All these things have been done
and can continue to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:56:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000367" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000367">Of
course, the basis for them all is an ability to raise money. That is
how I will finish. When you go to raise money, people are very good at
telling you, “I would have given you money yesterday, and
possibly I will give you money tomorrow, but unfortunately I
haven’t got any money today”. You have to look at them,
give them a villainous smile and say, “I will not leave until I
have the cheque”. We need to get a great deal better at raising
our own money in order to support our independence, carry out the work
of inclusion and solve many of our financial problems

My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I join
others in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, for initiating
this very important debate. I will speak about one relatively narrow
aspect of arts and culture; namely, the conservation and preservation
of our cultural heritage. I do so because some time ago I chaired a
sub-committee of the Science and Technology Committee, which looked at
the role of science in the preservation and conservation of our
cultural heritage. Since then I have retained a considerable interest
in the subject and continue to play a part. The noble Baroness, Lady
Kennedy of The Shaws, talked about the delicate ecosystem between
science and the arts, and, indeed, there

other noble Lords, I will not go into detail about the role of cultural
heritage in the economy, because others have mentioned it. The noble
Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, in particular identified the importance of
this sector for attracting tourism and £115 billion annually;
tourism is the fifth largest industry in the country. Somewhere in the
region of 70% of people who come to this country do so because they
want to visit our cultural heritage: our historic towns and villages,
castles, stately homes, museums, art galleries, theatres, and music and
other
festivals<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:58:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000370">I
will concentrate on the issue of preservation and conservation. Why do
we want to do it? One answer is that we would not reap the economic
benefit from our cultural heritage if it were not there. Further to
that, it is of course an essential part of our culture. What do we mean
by cultural heritage? Essentially, it is those parts of what we value
in our arts and artefacts, and in our ideas, that we want to pass on to
other generations. Conservation is vital—and not just of
material things such as paper and textiles. I remember the director of
the Natural History Museum, Michael Dixon, telling me, “We have
a great problem because insects eat insects, so we have to keep the
insects away from our collection of insects”.</hs_para>

stone degrades over time, as we know so well from what is happening
here to our own Palace of Westminster. That is a great problem.
Increasingly, many of the things that we create are transient. We are
corresponding, not by letter—which can be kept these
days—but by e-mail. We record notable events on YouTube or on
Facebook. We gather information from websites. The preservation of our
digital presence is an increasing part of conservation, and a great
problem posed to the British Library, which, for example, has to keep a

created.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000372" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000372">I
have an interesting example of the transience of all material things.
The noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, mentioned the David Bowie
exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum. Some time ago, the
textile conservation centre at Winchester was charged with repairing a
pair of Freddie Mercury’s pants, the bright red ones he wore at
a gig in 1979, which sadly were made out of faux leather and had begun
to wear away. Later, it was also charged with conserving his famous
yellow jacket and white trousers. On one level it was doing this
because it was preserving his memory for potentially millions of Queen
fans, but on another level, it was undertaking important work into the
longevity and vulnerability of degradation in modern materials. As one
of the conservators put
it,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13061350000475" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000475">“everyone
has this idea that modern fabrics are indestructible ... But in fact
there are some that are very unstable—and polyurethane happens
to be one of
them”.</hs_quotefo><hs_para UID="13061350000373" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000373">Conservation
and preservation help to preserve more than just memories and
artefacts. They also provide us with a great insight into attitudes and
behaviour. We learn so much about Tudor England from Shakespeare plays
or, for that matter, about Egypt 3,000 years ago from such artefacts as
the Book of the Dead, which was displayed so admirably at the British
Museum a couple of years ago. These are not only the things we enjoy
looking at and value; they are the stuff of our history and help to
explain our present. We did not inherit the past but hold it in trust
for our children and our children's children. It is therefore important
that we value these things not just because they contribute to the
economy, but because our children, and their children and their
children’s children should also be able to enjoy them.</hs_para>

plea that, while recognising the value of these assets, we do not
neglect the need to put resources—that means money—aside
for their maintenance and conservation. It is too easy in these days of
austerity to forget that, as I said earlier, even stone degrades.
Unless we are prepared to put money and effort
into conservation and into developing new methods of conservation, we
shall not be in a position to hand them on to our children. Yesterday,
my noble friend Lord Lee raised the question of the possible closure of
the Science Museum Group museums in the north of England.
The Minister himself noted that last year 19.1 million
people visited these regional museums and that they are often at the
heart of their region’s creative industries, preserving
artefacts and skills which characterise their local history. It would
be a tragedy if these museums have to shut. But if we want the Science
Museum to continue to maintain and preserve its collections, it has to
be given enough money to keep them all in good repair. I hope 
<?notus-xml column=1769?>that the cultural and economic importance of such museums will be
considered carefully in the forthcoming spending

double its filming facilities, which it says could create up to 3,000
new jobs in the industry. We are also seeing a flurry or cluster of

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:05:30"></hs_TimeCode> am concerned

exports of the film industry, is being severely constrained by a series
of savage cuts made over the past few years. Most of its funding comes
from a grant in aid direct from government, although the lottery also
contributes valuable funds. In 2010, it was announced that the
institute would have a 15% cut over four years; now it has been told
that it has another cut of 2% and another one of 1% next year. Nick
Mason Pearson, head of public affairs at the BFI, said that,</hs_para>

England, which is responsible for investment in the development of the
creative sectors in the regions, is facing a cut of over 40% of film
investment outside London. As most private investment goes to London,
we are once again seeing a move away from the regions back to London,
which seems ironic at a time when so much political attention is going
towards trying to create regional economic development in this country.
I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, that I would like the
Minister to see whether he can push for a greater allocation of lottery
funds to support film across the

Government may feel that the cuts in the BFI are fine, because they
have done a very good job in extending the film tax relief benefit
across the industry to cover film production money spent in this
country. 
<?notus-xml column=1770?>That has been rolled out this April to cover the high end of television
animation and video game production. Despite this extraordinary
support, parts of the industry are suffering. The noble Baroness, Lady
Kennedy, mentioned the visual effects industry, which is based in Soho,
in London, and after Hollywood is seen as world beating. It houses four
of the largest visual effects companies, and is trusted globally for
the ability to deliver complex sequences with cutting edge technology
for new films. However, a number of these houses are relocating to
Canada, which has extremely generous post-production incentives in
place specifically aimed at attracting their
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:07:58"></hs_TimeCode>. One
reason for this seems to be that there is an arbitrary 80% limit on the
film tax relief, which particularly affects those visual effects
houses, because they have become very much at the end of the spend on
film production. It has been imposed by the EU Commission, but it is
open for discussion in the new EU cinema communications consultation
document. I know that the Government have tried to increase the limit
but have been blocked by the EU competition commissioner; I ask them to
redouble their efforts to ensure that all the film spend in this
country is protected. It seems not to be in the interests of either
Britain or the EU that our visual effects houses are relocating to
North America, with the consequent loss to our economy and our global

arts organisations in the 1980s when they struggled with very hard
times. The one thing that is really different now is that the arts and
culture, since John Major created the Department of National Heritage,
which turned into the DCMS, have had a seat at the Cabinet table. It
would be catastrophic if it were now to lose that influence. Will the

the outset, I endorse the central proposition that we are debating. The
fact is that the arts and culture contribute enormously to the economy,

<?notus-xml column=1772?>backed up by statistics from the department and by numerous external
assessments that have been made over the

have cited statistics this afternoon and I do not want to bore the
House but I will add a couple of my own. The department itself
calculated that the creative industries account for 6.2% of
the goods and services in the economy and £16.6
billion in exports. A more recent study has estimated that the sector
accounts for 1.5 million jobs and contributes £70,000 a minute
to the UK
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:15:15"></hs_TimeCode>. A
number of noble Lords have made reference to the Arts Council report.
The most recent report on the economic impact makes a very powerful

heard, the arts are a major reason why overseas visitors come to
Britain, with our heritage sites being a major draw and nearly half of
them planning to attend a music, theatre or opera event. The noble

is also a reason why businesses globally choose to locate here, as they

on the role of arts projects in regional regeneration, we heard about
their enormous economic impact on cities—for example, Liverpool,
the European Capital of Culture, which generated £800 million
for the regional economy; the Birmingham Creative City initiative,
which aims to create 100,000 new jobs by 2020; and the Sage Gateshead,
contributing £146 million to the north-east economy. The noble

in the arts, those economic benefits have been recognised and
celebrated over many years. Indeed, when my noble friend Lord Smith
coined the phrase “the creative economy” in the early
years of the previous Government, it was precisely to emphasise that,
far from being a drain on the nation’s resources, investment in
the arts created growth, jobs and economic returns, as well as
providing a broader social dividend.</hs_para>

what are we to make of the recent speeches of Ed Vaizey and Maria
Miller acknowledging the value of the arts to the economy? First, it
might be said that they have come to the table rather late in the day,
when a considerable amount of damage to the arts has already been done.
This was, as I understand it, Maria Miller’s first speech on the
arts in seven months as Culture Secretary. Set against the backdrop of
the cuts to arts bodies made by her predecessor, there hardly seems to
be a sense that the interests of arts and culture are being driven from
the front.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000395" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000395">A
number of noble Lords rightly raised concerns about the impact of
further cuts. That point was made very powerfully by my noble friend
Lady McIntosh. It will be interesting to hear how the negotiations with
the Treasury for a further 10% or 15% cut are progressing. Perhaps the
Minister could update us on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000396" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000396">Secondly,
it would be interesting to know how successful Maria Miller has been in
persuading her colleague, Eric Pickles, the Local Government Minister, 
<?notus-xml column=1773?>that the arts are the bedrock of our future local cultural success. It
is at a local level that young people are first exposed to the
opportunities that involvement in the arts can bring. It provides
training, experience and inspiration, and, yes, provides a platform for
the next generation of Oscar winners. A number of noble Lords raised
concerns about cultural devastation already occurring locally. We heard
from the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, that the Local Government
Association has calculated that by 2020, up to 90% of local culture
budgets will have disappeared. That has to be a cause of concern for
us.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061350000397" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000397">Thirdly,
if the UK is to have a thriving cultural economy, surely it has to
start in schools. However, by any measure, Michael Gove’s tenure
in education has been a disaster for the teaching of creative arts in
schools. Thankfully, we have now seen the demise of the ill conceived
EBacc proposals, which had no place at all for arts subjects, but the
new proposals for the curriculum are similarly weak. Instead of making
space for creativity in subjects such as art, design, music and drama,
there is an emphasis on learning facts by rote, and a transmission of
knowledge from adults who possess knowledge to children who do not.
There is hardly any space for creative knowledge. Under this model,
curiosity, interest and experimentation are squeezed out, despite
evidence that those are exactly the skills that the next generation
need to be successful. What representations have been made to the
Department for Education and Skills about the ongoing need for a broad
arts education to provide the seed corn for our next generation of
artists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:20:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000398" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000398">I
said at the outset that I agreed with the central premise of the
debate. Of course, the arts have a significant role to play in the
future of our economy. However, you cannot start from that position.
The economic benefit should only ever be one driver of a successful
arts policy. If the funding of the arts is to become predicated on a
guarantee of commercial success, you inevitably end up with an inferior
product. This would be epitomised by a West End full of musical
revivals, for example. As several noble Lords have pointed out, who
would have invested in a puppet show of First World War horses if the
box office had to be guaranteed? I agree with my noble friend
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:20:48"></hs_TimeCode> Puttnam and
others who are alarmed at Maria Miller’s singular focus on
economic outcomes. New works, new blood, new thinking, irreverence and
risk-taking must be allowed to flourish if we are to maintain our place
as a global centre for arts excellence. With risk-taking there has to
be the chance of failure or, as the noble Lord,

Berkeley<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:21:08"></hs_TimeCode>, put
it, of there being ponies that do not quite make the final fence. That
is all part of the experimentation that must be at the heart of the
creative
arts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000399" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000399">There<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is something more fundamental and unquantifiable about the contribution
of the arts in the UK. As a number of noble Lords have struggled to
express, the arts are at the heart of our well-being and our quality of
life. They make us laugh, or cry. They unite us in a strong sense of
shared emotion at a concert, play or gallery. Books or
poetry can provide individual solace, inspiration or
relaxation. I could go on, but the point is that the creative arts are
a central part of our lives and identity and, yes, our 
<?notus-xml column=1774?>civilisation. As my noble
friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:21:59"></hs_TimeCode> Lord
Smith wisely put it, they are about everything that makes life worth

we need to recognise that creativity is not only the preserve of arts
and culture. It also lies at the heart of our wider business success.
This is why the CBI has been so concerned about the sidelining of arts
subjects in schools. It recognises that future global business success
will be built upon creative design, originality, communication skills
and an ability to think laterally. My noble
friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:22:38"></hs_TimeCode> Lady
Kennedy reminded us of Steve Jobs’ words about hiring artists
and designers, rather than simply programmers, to create his products.
That example is replicated time and time again across the business
sector. This<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> is
why there is concern that the arts have been left to languish in a
diminished DCMS. Their place at the heart of our economic revival
should be recognised centre stage, with business and Treasury support.
It is not surprising that commentators are beginning to speculate
whether DCMS has a future at all, given its seeming inability to fight
its corner successfully on these issues. Perhaps the Minister could
shed some light on whether there is any truth in these
rumours<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000401" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000401">We
have had a good debate today, with some very eloquent contributions.
Quite rightly, we have identified the need for balance when measuring
the contribution of the arts. Yes, they make a vast and growing
contribution to the economy, but we should equally celebrate the
contribution of the arts to our individual and collective well-being.
With that in mind, I look forward to hearing the Minister’s

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my
noble friend Lady Wheatcroft on securing this debate. On the
fundamentals, I believe that we are all united. Be it dance, opera,
theatre, museums, paintings, design, gardens, historic buildings,
sculpture, photography, heritage, film, literature or television
production, culture and the arts bring our country alive, stimulate
creativity, inspire us, develop a strong sense of community, challenge
and entertain us. They are essential to the fabric of our society.
Alongside all these important features lies their enormous contribution
to the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:24:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reaches out far beyond these shores. It attracts millions of tourists
to our country every year, forging international relations and building
trade links and greater collaboration with the rest of the world.
Culture is GREAT is one of the pillars of the Government’s
successful GREAT campaign aimed at promoting the UK internationally.
The Government’s priority is growth. Heritage, the arts, the
creative industries and tourism are essential to that success. My noble
friend Lady Bonham-Carter spoke powerfully about that. The noble Lord,
Lord Smith of Finsbury, reminded us, with all his experience and
commitment how important the creative industries are. The UK’s
cultural sector—both private and publicly funded—has a
significant role to play in local and regional economic regeneration.
In 2011, the Yorkshire Sculpture Park directly contributed to the
employment of 108 full-time jobs and was worth at least £4.68
million to the local economy. We  
<?notus-xml column=1775?>heard from my noble friend Lady Seccombe about Shakespeare and the
beneficial impact of Stratford and beyond. Margate, St Ives, Gateshead,
to name but a few, all have cultural projects making a huge
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:26:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061350000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000405">This Government, in
recognising the value of the arts and culture, increased the share of
funding from the National Lottery to the arts so that the Arts Council
England is now projected to receive £262 million of
lottery funding in 2015 compared with £151 million in 2010-11.
Many noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, and my
noble friends Lord Grade of Yarmouth and Lord Maclennan of Rogart
mentioned this. Arts and culture in the UK are supported by mixed
sources of funding. Nearly £3 billion of public and lottery
funding will go to the arts over the lifetime of this Parliament. In
the current climate, I believe that that represents a positive
settlement for the sector. Public funding of the arts remains a
cornerstone and from this many benefits flow. It encourages innovation
and that experimentalism drives creativity. Some go on to achieve huge
commercial success. My noble friend Lord Grade of Yarmouth confirmed
that. “War Horse”, which was mentioned by the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, inspired by a puppetry show at the
Battersea Arts Centre, then produced by the National Theatre, went on
to achieve numerous awards and was an Oscar-nominated
film<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:27:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000406">The
latest report published by Arts Council England earlier this week
clearly upholds this belief that public subsidy provides the space for
innovation, talent development and risk. It shows that there is a
significant amount of movement between publicly funded theatre and
purely commercial theatre. Public investment today can lead to the
blockbusters of tomorrow and the value this brings to our economy.
London theatres grossed more than £0.5 billion in sales, selling
14 million tickets last year. Furthermore, 10.6 million
people living outside London visit a theatre at least once a year. The
UK’s creative industries contribute more than £36 billion
or 2.9% to the UK economy; they export £8.9 billion and employ
more than 1.5 million people, which is around 5% of the UK
workforce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T17:28:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

goes from strength to strength with its Harry Potter films, and films
such as “Skyfall”, “The King’s
Speech” and “Les Miserables”. British Film
Institute research shows that the industry contributes £4.6
billion to the economy, as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, highlighted
There is a great history of public service broadcasting in this
country, which means that the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 can now
invest more than £3 billion a year in TV programming across
their channels. That supports the creative industries through direct
investment and provides a degree of stability in the market. They
commission innovative and culturally diverse programming, and bring the
arts and our creative industries to a much wider audience. Furthermore,
recently published research commissioned by Arts Council England shows
that the UK arts and culture sector had a turnover of £12.4
billion and contributed £5.9 billion to the UK economy in 2011.
Research suggests that for every £1 generated by
the  
<?notus-xml column=1776?>sector, an additional £1.43 is generated in the wider UK economy
through suppliers to the sector and additional spending by those who
work in the sector.</hs_para>

noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, some reassurance. The Government recognise
that public funding for the arts offers stability and
unlocks further funding. Public funding in
partnership with other funding streams is the most
advantageous for the long-term sustainability of the arts in this
country. This includes earned income from commercial activity, private
giving and philanthropy, and access to the lottery. This mixed model of
funding avoids reliance on any one form of income, allows for risk and
builds resilience. I was interested in what my noble friend Lord Eccles
said about independence and funding, and his experience of Kew and the
Bowes Museum.</hs_para>

Council England will invest £345 million into the
arts. As its chairman, Sir Peter Bazalgette, has said, this funding
acts as venture capital, giving confidence to others to invest in the
creativity and innovations of our cultural organisations. The creative
employment programme, with funding from Arts Council England until
March 2015, will provide up to 6,500 apprenticeship placements, helping
young unemployed people enter the cultural workforce. The programme
aims to approve the first 700 apprenticeships and 500 paid internships
by 31 October this year. This is something that my noble friends Lord
Grade of Yarmouth and Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville were
particularly interested
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061350000410" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-0002.htm#13061350000410">The UK is

rest of the world, be it historic ships like the “Mary

by my noble friend Lady Sharp of Guildford on science heritage,
particularly, as it is so current, about the development which has
secured the future of the “Mary Rose”. The noble
Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, mentioned science and the arts and
the importance of them riding together.</hs_para>

visitors to the UK cite heritage and culture as the primary motivation

Arts Council England estimates that £856 million per annum of
visitor spend can be directly attributed to arts and culture. It is
therefore no surprise that with more than 5.5 million visitors last
year, the British Museum is the UK’s top visitor attraction and
is ranked in the top five museums in the world. I acknowledge the great
work which my noble friend Lady Wheatcroft and the noble Baroness, Lady
Kennedy of The Shaws, have rightly highlighted. This work is, of

Heritage Lottery Fund estimates that heritage tourism's direct annual

working to build on those great successes and it is essential that we
create a lasting legacy from them. To harness all this success, we must
look at ways of increasing financial resilience, by building skills in
areas such as fundraising and ensuring our cultural sector continues to
realise its artistic and economic value. The Government have
demonstrated their commitment to the creative industries by working to
introduce tax reliefs to support film, TV, animation and videogames, as
the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, mentioned. In this
year’s Budget, the Government also announced a package of
measures to support growth and jobs in these industries through
investing in the development of skills and technology. Cultural and the
creative industries, including museums, libraries, publishing, designer
fashion, technology and architecture, have been represented on many of
the Prime Minister’s trade missions around the world. That has
promoted Britain to global partners. I hope this reassures the noble
Viscount, but I will look into the point that he made.</hs_para>

Brooke of Sutton Mandeville asked about philanthropy. The Government
have introduced initiatives to boost philanthropy, including a reduced
rate of inheritance tax for legacy giving and the recently launched
cultural gifts scheme. This saw its first major gift, one of the best
collections of Beatles lyrics and manuscripts, being made to the
British Library only last month. We have simplified gift aid, while the
Catalyst scheme has also been developed, under which £110
million has already been earmarked for arts and heritage organisations,
which will unlock at least as much again from private donors. I hope it
will also improve the fund-raising skills which my noble friend Lord
Brooke mentioned. We should also applaud the profound generosity of
those donors who have contributed almost £700 million to the
cultural sector each year.</hs_para>

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment
23, I shall speak also to Amendment 24. Amendment 23 is very
straightforward. Really, it is a question for the Minister: as regards
the new criminal penalties that apply to registered design rights, why
has Section 110 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act,
“Offence by body corporate: liability of officers”, which
ensures that company officers are liable if conniving or consenting,
not been replicated here for registered designs? I could read out the
relevant offence under the CDPA but I am sure my noble friend is
familiar with it. However, it seems odd that everything else replicates
what is contained in the CDPA for copyright but not the application
concerning the liability of company
officers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:01:21"></hs_TimeCode>.
Considering that so much business is conducted through companies, it
seems extraordinary that that provision is not included in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:01:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

now be a clause stand part debate. I am not surprised because this is
clearly a subject that needs airing. Rather more controversially,
Amendment 24 is an attempt to advocate the extension of criminal
offences for infringement of unregistered designs. As we know, Clause
13 introduces a new criminal offence of deliberate infringement of a
registered design right. While this is a welcome move, to be of any
benefit to the vast majority of designers in this country, the Bill
needs amending so that criminal sanctions also apply to the deliberate
infringement of unregistered
designs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:02:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000004">Design
is of key importance to the UK economy. There are around 350,000
designers in the UK and UK businesses spend around £35.5 billion
on design each year. The majority of the UK’s design community
are lone, micro and SMEs, with 87% having fewer than 10 employees and
60% having fewer than four. Approximately 4,000 designs are registered
annually in the UK and approximately 5,000 are registered in the EU.
However, the great majority of designers rely on unregistered
rights.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061344000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000005">Each
year, between 18,000 and 25,000 unregistered designs are lodged with
ACID—which represents designers and was mentioned at Second
Reading and in these proceedings—by its some 1,100 members.
ACID’s design data bank does not add to any intellectual
property rights but provides evidence of the date on which it received
a design. It encourages designers to keep an IP audit trail from the
seed of an idea to market reality, which provides essential evidence if
designs are copied. Extrapolating from that figure of 1,100, it is
therefore reasonable to assume that the majority of the UK’s
designers rely on unregistered design rights, and on copyright of
course<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

criminal offence limited to infringement of only registered designs?
Surely criminal sanctions need to apply to unregistered design rights
as they apply to copyright, in order to have any real and lasting
benefit for UK designers. The introduction of criminal sanctions for
deliberate infringement of registered designs is a progressive step.
This is the first time that criminal sanctions have mirrored copyright.
While I accept that registration offers designers a longer-term and
stronger right, unlike trade marks and patents, there is no extensive
examination for registration, so design registration is a very
different type of protection.</hs_para>

register a design costs £60 per design. Regrettably for most
lone and micro designers, the cost of registering every iteration of a
design would be prohibitive. ACID receives between 18,000 and 25,000
designs annually, so it is clear that informed designers take their
design audit trail seriously. However, to ask them to pay £60
would be a real barrier. The majority of ACID settlements have been
based on unregistered design rights and the ability to provide a design
audit trail held on the ACID design data bank. In its 2010 survey,
89.7% believed that design infringement was deliberate and blatant. In
a further survey in 2012, 97% believed design infringement was
deliberate and blatant. Given the cost, time and scale of opponents in
the majority of these cases, deterrence against copying is critical.
Extension of criminal sanctions to unregistered design 
<?notus-xml column=391?>rights for the majority of the UK designers would be a deterrent to
persistent copying in much the same way as it is for copyright and
trade mark
infringement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000008">Criminal
sanctions have been available for copyright infringement since 1862 and
for trade mark infringement since 1994. Criminal prosecutions have been
used sparingly, sensibly and appropriately. Copyright is a property
right. A trade mark and an unregistered design right are property
rights, as is registered design. Whereas persistent copying of the
first two constitutes a serious criminal offence, punishable by up to
10 years’ imprisonment, which exceeds the longest sentence for
ordinary theft, currently persistently copying designs is not a
criminal offence at all. This is completely anomalous. Persistently
copying a 2D drawing of a design or a design document can give rise to
criminal liability under Section 107 of the CDPA, but when this 2D work
is converted into a 3D design, unless it is protected as a work of
artistic craftsmanship, which we have previously discussed, copying
that 3D version would not be a criminal
offence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000009">I
fail to understand the policy decision behind this. Nearly all designs
are copied from the 3D original, not the 2D drawing. How do the
Government justify giving a higher level of protection to a 2D design
brought than they to the 3D manifestation of that design? A telling
point was made by designers when they gave an example of the scale of
opponent in the three latest cases involving members of ACID. This
demonstrates the inequality of arms between infringers and designers.
For instance, one ACID member had a turnover of £50,000 and two
employees, and its opponent in this infringement case a turnover of
£8.7 billion and 78,000 employees. How on earth can a lone
designer gain justice in those
circumstances?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000010">In
a second case, an ACID member with a turnover of £500,000 and 15
employees was opposed by a major retailer with a turnover of
£20.5 billion and 145,000 employees. I will not try the
Minister’s patience much further—these are difficult
cases, where members are seriously prejudiced—but in a third
case, an ACID member with a turnover of £250,000 and 10
employees was opposed by, again, a major retailer with
£3.4 billion turnover and 52,000
employees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000011">If
anything, in these circumstances, there are quite honestly stronger
reasons for imposing criminal offences for unregistered design right
infringement than there are for infringing a registered design. I hope
that the Minister can elucidate why this is not being done and perhaps
give us some assurance that this is under consideration. I beg to

24 picks up the debate where we left it on Tuesday. For most of the
time we reflected on why the Government have adopted a two-track
approach, although unfortunately in this case the tracks lead in
opposite directions. In one there is no attempt to simplify the design
rights field. The points made by 
<?notus-xml column=392?>Ian Hargreaves in his report, and picked up by many commentators, seem
to have been ignored. I know that it is difficult to eliminate
unregistered design rights; nevertheless the fact that we have five
different ways of classifying or approaching these designs is still an
irritant and source of confusion for the industry. It cannot be
effective in terms of building up the creative industries more
generally. It is something that will have to be addressed at some
point, if it is not dealt with in this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:10:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

second track is this: why should one penalise on the registered design
side but not on the unregistered design side? We will be opposing the
question that Clause 13 should stand part in the next group, so my
position on this is somewhat complex because I would not want to see
criminal penalties brought into this area at all. That is not the right
direction of travel and I will expand on that when I speak in the
clause stand part debate. Parking that for a moment, I accept
absolutely the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. There
is no substantive difference in how unregistered and registered designs
are treated. The fact that they are registered does not in any sense
imply approval or otherwise of them, or give them any status that is
different from unregistered ones. The figures are exactly what they
are. Most of the people who operate in these fast-moving areas,
particularly fashion, tend to use unregistered designs, and those who
do so have no real protection when there is a
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:11:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

struck by the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, about
the way in which the design copying process might happen. Most people
would take the 3D representation of a design, not the 2D design. As he
pointed out, the discrepancy in how such malfeasance is then approached
by the courts is obviously a stark example of how the process is not
working<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

final point about parity of arms is one that we will return to. It is
clear that there is a real danger in the creative industries these days
that those with the resources can use the system to obtain advantage in
the knowledge that people will not be able to defend their designs. Yet
we rely on these individuals and small companies to provide the design
initiative that is necessary to grow our creative industries. For all

<?notus-xml column=393?>correct a reference made in my closing speech at Second Reading. In the
context of wider points about infringement and the copying of designs,
I spoke briefly about the right to license certain intellectual
property rights. This is where rights become available to third parties
for exploitation under certain conditions. As an example, I cited a
figure of 2,097 applications to use designs in this way, but the

that that formality is out of the way, I shall turn to the substantive
points that have been debated about the Government’s proposal to
introduce a criminal sanction for the deliberate copying of a
registered design. I begin by reminding noble Lords of the purpose
behind the Bill, which is pertinent to the points that have been raised
in the debate. Our objectives, as set out in the consultation on the
designs legal framework, are: simplification; improving the services
offered by the IPO; strengthening rights, including enforcement; and
improving how disputes are resolved. There is clearly a balance to be
reached in some of these objectives. Simplification cannot be achieved
at the expense of loss of protections in the marketplace. Equally,
strengthening rights cannot be at the expense of follow-on
innovation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:10:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

was clear from the responses to the consultation that there was strong
support for the UK unregistered design right. We were told that it is
relied on when other forms of protection are impractical or
inapplicable—for example, when a design is functional or
consists of the internal shape or configuration of a product, or when a
business produces a large number of designs but only a few will go on
to make a
profit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:15:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Although
reducing the complexity of design law was a key element of the
Hargreaves review, respondents felt that this should not be at the
expense of the unregistered design right, which protects many designs
produced by business in the UK. This is why the Government have chosen
to retain the UK unregistered right.</hs_para>

the Government heard from stakeholders who made the case for ensuring

innovation. Many rely on the ability to take inspiration from existing
designs to engage in legitimate follow-on
innovation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:15:49"></hs_TimeCode>. This
is a delicate balance, which the Government had at the forefront of

Section 110 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and Section
101 of the Trade Marks Act 1994. Broadly speaking, the result achieved
under the amendment would be that where a body corporate or a
partnership has committed an offence, any of its officers or partners
involved may also be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly.</hs_para>

to my noble friend’s attention Section 35A of the Registered
Designs Act 1949, which relates to the liability of companies. This
provision reflects Section 110 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents
Act 1988 and was inserted into design law by Schedule 3 to that Act.
This provides that where a company is proven to have committed an
offence with the consent or connivance of a member of the
company’s management, then it, too, will be liable and subject
to appropriate sanctions. By accepting the amendment the Government
would in part be duplicating a provision that already exists in designs
legislation.</hs_para>

friend Lord Clement-Jones makes an interesting point with regard to
partnerships, which I understand are a common vehicle for business
today. Section 101 of the Trade Marks Act also covers business
partnerships, which is not replicated in Section 35A of the Registered
Designs Act 1949. The issue of the effect on business partnerships is
something to which the Government would want to give careful
consideration.</hs_para>

a new clause to widen the scope of the proposed criminal sanctions to
also include unregistered designs. For several reasons, the Government
consider that this would, in practice, be problematic. First, the
register represents a clear starting point for any prosecution.
Registered rights can be readily accessed from the Intellectual
Property Office and the EU designs registry websites. They include
crucial information, including the design that is protected, the date
on which protection commenced and whether it is still in force. This is
not the case with an unregistered design right. Important information,
such as what rights are claimed in an article, who owns those rights
and when they came into existence—even whether those design
rights existed in the first place—would all need to be assessed
before any consideration of whether there had been deliberate and
unlawful copying could begin. By contrast, a registration certificate
makes it far simpler for the design owner to prove if there has been
copying and for the authorities to weigh up the validity of this
claim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000026">Secondly,
the uncertainties surrounding unregistered designs, such as the
difficulty of knowing when the design right came into existence, mean
that it is more difficult for third parties to ensure that they are not
infringing that design right. Therefore, against the backdrop of a
threat of a criminal conviction, third parties are more likely to wait
longer than necessary to be sure that the design is in the public
domain before building on it, thereby extending the design right beyond
its term and delaying potential innovation. This inhibiting effect is
likely to be a particular problem in relation to functional designs,
which the UK unregistered right also protects. As a functional result
can be achieved only in a limited number of ways, the inhibiting effect
on innovation is likely to be more serious or
pronounced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:19:56"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:19:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000027">Thirdly,
because the UK unregistered right affords protection to functional
designs, this could cause difficulties in criminal proceedings where
such designs are complex, as they well might be. For example,
determining whether the interior of one alternator has been copied from
the interior of another is a highly technical issue, probably requiring
expert knowledge. 
<?notus-xml column=395?>This is not the sort of discussion the Government believe should be
dealt with in the criminal courts, especially where any element of
doubt means that the high standard of proof required is unlikely to be
met<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000028">A
number of points were raised by noble Lords. My noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones raised the issue of design application fees and said that
they could be perceived to be somewhat expensive. In respect of fees,
it is, I believe, a question of balance. By setting fees too low, we
may encourage unscrupulous businesses to register designs that they
have no intention of using in the UK, but which may be used to stifle a
competitor due to its monopoly right. Design registration must be a
considered purpose. For example, it is of no benefit to business or the
IPO to have a register of designs that will never be brought to the
market. However, we also understand the cost implications for lone
designers and SMEs, so we will be looking at the fee structure further
in the future. I hope that my noble friend is reassured to some extent
by that
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:21:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000029">My
noble friend also asked why we cannot use the date of lodging a design
from ACID. While no doubt useful, I must emphasise that the voluntary
lodging of designs with ACID is not to be taken as being the same as
formal registration under the statutory scheme, as a registered design
is. My noble friend also referred to SMEs, which do not tend to
register their designs, and asked whether they would be disadvantaged.
The answer is that those businesses that rely on unregistered design
rights will not be disadvantaged by this proposal. This offence adds to
existing protections for registered designs; it does not remove
anything. Design owners, as now, will have to consider how best to
protect their designs and in many fast-moving areas such as fashion
will continue to rely on unregistered designs, which may better suit
their business
models<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000030">My
noble friend asked: why two-dimensional and not three-dimensional? The
copying of 3D products is not the same as copying the original design
document. Competitors therefore take inspiration from existing designs.

parts of it escaped me. He gave a very helpful response to Amendment
23. It just shows that you can trawl through the Registered Designs Act
and not find what you are looking for. However, I am impressed that the
department found the relevant passages in there. I appreciate that an
overlap exists except with regard to partnerships. It is very
interesting that there is no reference to partnerships in the existing 
<?notus-xml column=396?>legislation. Partnerships are interesting bodies. Some of them have
unlimited liability whereas others are limited liability partnerships.
Therefore, some interesting drafting needs to be done in that regard
because LLPs are quite akin to corporate bodies.</hs_para>

very different kettle of fish with Amendment 24. It is
almost difficult to know where to start because the skittles of the
argument fall in almost every single case by reference to copyright. On
the problematic starting point, the registered design right is of
course quite straightforward to prosecute because of the registration
but copyright is not so easy. There are relatively few prosecutions for
breach of copyright. There would be relatively few unregistered design
right prosecutions if my amendment was
accepted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000038">The
important thing is the factual basis and establishing the facts. Of
course, those prosecuting have the burden of proof on their arguments.
That is where it starts from and it is analogous to copyright. There is
no register of copyright. There may be one in the States but there is
not one here. On the difficulty of knowing when something came into
existence, not every 2D document has the date on it saying exactly when
it was created and so on. There are matters of fact to be established.
Again, it is very similar in copyright to unregistered design
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000039">On the
point about the inhibiting effect, that is absolutely splendid but I
cannot see that that is any greater than would be the case with
copyright in 2D. In some respects, you could argue that because 2D is
more thematic than 3D, 2D has a much greater inhibiting effect because
you can extrapolate from 2D into 3D to a much greater extent. When you
spin off and think about software or things of that sort, much of which
is covered by copyright, establishing the date, genesis and all those
aspects of software creation is fraught with difficult issues but
nevertheless people are entitled to the protection of criminal law.
That means that those who cynically exploit copyright or
design—copyright certainly and trade marks sometimes—are
prosecuted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000040">The
fashion industry is not much different from that. I feel quite strongly
about this. The Minister mentioned that the fashion industry uses
unregistered design but one must think about the economic issues
associated with copying of designs in the fashion industry and the
cynical way that rip-off retailers take advantage of the original
designs by fashion houses and so on. That is an absolutely clear-cut
area where the protection and deterrent effect of the criminal law
would be extremely useful. I did not make the claim that the voluntary
register with ACID would be the killer argument but this is all about
evidence. Will it be 
<?notus-xml column=397?>possible to mount prosecutions using evidence of copied designs or
infringement of unregistered designs? The evidence of a register,
albeit a voluntary one, would still be extremely
useful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000041">Finally,
I am sure that the Minister can recognise that I am somewhat frustrated
by the rather circular argument being employed here. The Minister said
that this should not apply to unregistered 3D because 2D is not the
same, being closer to theft—that is an entirely circular
argument. I do not quite see that theft of a 3D design and theft of a
2D design are morally different. In many ways they are not different
factually. Why should either of them be closer to theft? I find that a
rather interesting argument to mount.</hs_para>

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, that was a very
interesting debate and prefigured what I am about to say about the
question of criminality in this area. The noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, has made the arguments and is correct about them, and it
is up to the Minister to make the best of if. If the industry is voting
with its feet and adopting the unregistered design right as its mode of
operation, and if it is true that there is a sense that having
criminalisation in this area will improve the quality and quantity of
our economic activity in it, it must follow logically that criminal
sanctions should apply. However, I shall devote the next few minutes to
arguing against exactly that proposition, but then, this is
Committee.</hs_para>

new section into the Registered Designs Act, creating a criminal
offence of unauthorised copying of design in course of business. It
would apply in respect of UK-registered designs and registered

this is being introduced as a criminal sanction.</hs_para>

the second offence is dealing in products that have been copied. Both
will carry sentences of up to 10 years, which, as the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, mentioned, is very high on the list of tariffs. The
arguments for and against criminal sanctions for designs have been
extensively aired over recent years, and we should bear in mind that

proponents of this move feel that the current civil enforcement is
expensive for small innovators and that current civil sanctions are not
dissuasive enough for large infringers. Opponents are concerned that
unexamined IP rights are a dangerous basis for taking criminal
sanctions and that there is a risk of stifling competition in useful
products.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061344000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000047">We
understand the Government’s aim—I have just referred
it—but we worry about whether the proposal for criminal offences
in general is the right tool for the job and, in particular, whether it
is appropriate and proportionate and would deter those pirates and
counterfeiters whose behaviour the public would, I accept, consider to
be criminal. There is rather an important discrepancy here. Those who
champion criminal sanctions are largely talking about unregistered
design rights, which we have been talking about, and, of course, the
huge preponderance of design rights are in that category, but the Bill
is about only registered design rights and registered Community
designs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000048">Registered
design rights are better defined and have a much longer lifetime but,
as we discovered, they are not in any sense better examined, so the
proposed introduction of criminal sanctions may not work, and I would
like to bring some particular problems to the attention of the
Committee. The penumbra around a design, which is to be found in the
uncertainties about how “exactly or substantially” is
defined, makes it unclear what is or is not a criminal act. Unlike
parallel trade mark or copyright offences, mere use, whatever that is,
of an infringing product, even if no copying is involved, will become a
criminal offence. Furthermore, the maximum sentence is very high for
what, in fact, could be just a mere business misjudgment without
deceptive intent.</hs_para>

the inclusion of the new section contributes to the bizarrely complex
nature of the offence. For example, if the prosecution shows that D
copies the design, and produces something exactly or substantially to
that design, D can attempt to show that the product would not produce,

design. These distinctions are hard for specialist lawyers to
comprehend, let alone lay people such as jurors or magistrates. I will
return to this point in relation to a recent
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:34:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Implied in
what I have just said, of course, is the major concern that the courts

defence that the registered design was not in fact copied raises
difficult questions, as many of the cases on copyright infringements

provision could turn into a tool to be used by unscrupulous companies,
to the detriment of UK designers. It is reasonably inexpensive to
register a design, especially as there is no effective examination, and
an unscrupulous company could apply to register designs it copied from
a UK designer and then threaten that designer with criminal sanctions
for producing his or her own 
<?notus-xml column=399?>design. The prospect of defending a criminal action might be enough to
make the designer give in. What sort of fairness does that speak

have some questions for the Minister on the thinking behind this move.
Why does the Bill not state a requirement as to where the act occurs?
On the face of it, there seems to be no reason why it should not cover
making unauthorised copies elsewhere in the EU, where the acts would
infringe an RCD, so the defence that it did not infringe the right in
the design would not
apply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000052">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:36:28"></hs_TimeCode>,
why does new Section 35ZA define “registered” designs as
including “registered Community” designs? Does this not
leave open whether the offence might not be committed by copying, or
dealing in copies of, a foreign-registered design, for example those
with a Benelux
registration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:36:28"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000053">Thirdly,
following the implementation of the designs directive, the scope of
registered design protection has been broadened. This gives rise to the
situation where registered design right is now infringed by use of the
same design in different products. Can the Minister confirm that, if a
design is registered in relation to one type of product—for
example, an image of Bugs Bunny on a mug—that design would be
infringed if the person featured it on another product such as a
pillowcase? If so, in the latter case, would criminal sanctions be
applied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:36:57"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000054">New
Section 35ZA(3) applies to dealers infringing products—both
importers and traders. One might wonder how stockists of, for example,

allegations made by Apple in respect of infringement. At that point, if
the Bill had been enacted, dealers in those products would have faced
criminal liability, and up to 10 years’ imprisonment, if they

they were attempting to sell would infringe Apple’s registered

Section 35ZA(3) includes as a criminal act the use of a product in the

vague notion for criminal prosecution? What is the Government’s
reason for removing the defence of reasonably believing that the
defendant’s design was not an infringement—that the
designs were different and would not produce in the informed user the

cases between competitors. It is worth thinking about what Judge Birss

get serious by being absolutely clear about the propositions being put
forward. I therefore do not intend to respond in great detail to the
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, who, I believe, was taking an argument out
for a trot. Earlier in Committee, I previously talked about frightening

way that the argument was put together misunderstood what happens in
court. It is about the adducing of evidence. It was reassuring that the
judge listened to the arguments and evidence and felt as a result that
he understood far more about the genesis of the design right. Of
course, in a criminal court you add mitigation to all that. It is not
worth suddenly locking up people as a result of being prosecuted for
design infringement. If you do something reasonable in the eyes of a
criminal court in such circumstances, you will be able to mitigate the
offence, even though technically you may be guilty of

unregistered design. If you have it for copyright, you should be able
to prosecute for unregistered design. If you have it for trade marks,
you should have it for unregistered design. All these intellectual

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Viscount needs to
offer us some compelling reasons for the creation of a new criminal
offence. It is undesirable in principle to create new criminal offences
unless there is a clearly demonstrable need for them. Successive
Governments over decades in this country have been promiscuous in the
creation of new criminal offences. They have been trigger-happy in this
matter. It makes 
<?notus-xml column=401?>them look as if they are being tough and it is quite popular in certain
quarters, but it has not been very good for our national life or our
culture. It tends to create a more pervasive culture of distrust,
suspicion and fear within our

practicalities to think about. If you have a criminal offence, you must
commit policing resources. You are laying another burden on the courts.
The police and the courts are already excessively burdened and their
resources are diminishing. You must consider the capacity of the
prisons, which are bursting. I hope that we will not have to anticipate
many people being incarcerated in consequence of the noble
Viscount’s measure but that is clearly what it points towards. I
do not know what thought the noble Viscount has given to the cost of
all this. We understand that the Government are intent on reducing the
deficit but he is proposing here a measure that will have clear
implications of additional public spending. I can quite understand why
the measure is popular with small and medium-sized enterprises in the
design field: the burden of the enforcement of rights will be
transferred from civil action being taken by them where necessary to
criminal prosecution by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service.
It saves SMEs troublesome, tedious and possibly expensive activities. I
can see why they like that. However, I am a bit surprised that the
Minister has been willing to gratify them in this way.</hs_para>

think of the noble Viscount as a mild and kindly man, but here he is
about to expose people to some draconian penalties. I do not know what
the maximum fines would be for people found guilty of the offence that
he is going to create, but I see that he plans to bang them up for up
to 10 years. That seems uncharacteristically harsh. One would have
thought that that scale of penalties would be more appropriate for
major fraud and expropriation. As I have suggested in earlier
proceedings on the Bill, a governing principle should be that we
protect intellectual property no more than is necessary to encourage
and reward innovation suitably. It goes too far to extend that
protection by creating offences in the criminal world. I understand
that there is a case for criminalisation in a situation in which a
powerful corporation is deliberately and systematically trawling and
appropriating the designs created by individual designers, sole
traders, and small and medium-sized enterprises. There is inequality of
power and arms

creating a criminal offence. When he spoke earlier he made his case in
terms of the desirability of simplification and presumably of
consistency with the laws that apply in the fields of 
<?notus-xml column=402?>copyright and trade marks. As I also suggested earlier, simplification
or consistency are not necessarily paramount virtues, not least in the
field of intellectual property, which is highly differentiated and
complex, and in which pragmatism and common sense are always required.
He suggested that it would be helpful in the enforcement of rights but,
as I have said, I am not clear that the state should take over the
enforcement of the maintenance of their rights from individual
designers and design companies and partnerships. The case has to be

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, my intention in contributing
to my noble friend Lord Stevenson’s debate on whether Clause 13
should stand part is to take advantage of the opportunity to ask some
very Scottish questions about the nature of this provision and the
implications for the devolution settlement in Scotland. Before I do
that, I encourage and cannot resist the temptation to engage in the
more general debate that has been conducted so far, simply because of
the curtailed response of the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, to my
noble friend’s opening
remarks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000066">I
have some significant experience of practice in the criminal courts.
This was perhaps a long time ago, but I practised in the criminal
courts at all levels in Scotland for the better part of 20 years before
I became an elected politician. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is
right. One has to have a proper sense of perspective on how courts
operate. The burden and onus of proof in criminal prosecution lie and
will continue to lie with the prosecutor. Obviously these offences,
although complicated and requiring some understanding of design and
design rights that I do not have, will require the prosecutor to
persuade the court that design rights have been infringed in the way
set out in these
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000067">However,
I say to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, with respect—and,
of course, when lawyers start talking to each other with respect, there
is a sense among others that it is last thing they have for each
other—that after 20 years of practising in part in criminal
courts, I resist the temptation to describe convictions as technical.
There is no such thing as a technical conviction. You break the law,
you are convicted and you have, except with a very few limited
exceptions, a criminal record thereafter. There is no such thing as a
technical crime. For people who are convicted in the criminal courts,
but not for lawyers who appear in them, these are life-changing events.
The people who are furthest removed from this culture are those who are
most affected by it, which is why jailing people for drink-driving has
over time been the most effective use of jails for deterrence because
that offence tends to be committed by people who would otherwise not be
near a criminal court. I make that caveat. If we are using criminal
sanctions in relation to commercial practices or commercial operations,
that is criminal law impinging on people who are not normally around
the criminal courts and who do not have the kind of relaxed attitude to
them that some of us who have practised in them sometimes
get.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061344000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000068">The
point my noble friend Lord Stevenson made was not about whether the
courts would be able to deal with the issue of mitigation, which
becomes relevant only after a conviction, because they are well capable
of doing that; I have some experience. His point was 
<?notus-xml column=403?>about whether a by-product of criminalising this sort of behaviour would
be the fear of the stigma of criminal proceedings. The stigma of
criminal proceedings can for some people be as significant as criminal
conviction. We are used to seeing in the media that people are
arrested, bailed, brought back in, charged, bailed and then, sometimes
months later, told that they are not to be prosecuted. We see that
pattern of behaviour regularly now because of the nature of some of the
public investigations that are going on as a consequence of the
interaction of the police, newspapers and other organs of our society,
including the BBC. We see that, and we see, from interviews that people
who are savvy enough to be able to move in the media give, the
life-changing effect that it can have on people.</hs_para>

friend’s concern is that the stigma of criminal proceedings, the
risk of a criminal record and the possibility of a quite swingeing
sentence—these crimes can carry up to 10 years’
imprisonment—will affect the way in which businesses conduct
themselves. If the effect is that they become risk-averse in the way
that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and those who overtly support
the sparing use of criminal prosecutions, hope, their judgment becomes
more acute and they are less likely to take the risk of doing something
that they instinctively know is wrong, that will be a good thing.
However, the risk-aversion results in the stifling of innovation
because lawyers tell people who are making management decisions that
they are running a personal and much greater risk with their liberty
and reputation than they would have been before the Bill became an Act
of Parliament. Those people might say, “It’s fine if the
business has some risk of a civil penalty, we will make a judgment here
and go with innovation as opposed to the conservative choice of not
touching this product”. However, if they say,
“It’s my head that’s on the
line”—that is, to some degree, what the Government are
trying to do—“It’s my personal reputation that is
on the line, and it may surface in the criminal courts”, that
may stifle innovation. If the balance goes the wrong way, this will not
be a correct thing to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000070">There is
one more important issue here to which we need to give some
consideration when we agree to criminalise behaviour. It is that the
rich and the powerful will threaten or imply the possibility of
criminal prosecution. Those of us who have been involved in debates and
the consideration of legislation in your Lordships’ House over
the past couple of years know about the concept of chilling effect. We
were dogged in this country, particularly in England and in the courts,
because London was the defamation capital of Europe. The rich and
powerful threatened court proceedings and had a chilling effect in
stifling free speech, publications, scientific research and other
areas. There is no question that if we add this possibility of
prosecution to what powerful people can threaten or imply then we run
the risk that they will again deploy that threat which stifles
innovation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000071">I
have not made up my mind whether adding criminal prosecution to this
armoury is a good thing. There are others in our debates who know much
more about the way this area of commerce operates. I have some sympathy
for people, particularly in the fashion industry, 
<?notus-xml column=404?>whose designs come and go. If something else is not added to this then
they must go through the same processes as they do presently. Civil
actions are of no use to them because the fashion season moves on and
the damage is done. Within minutes of unveiling their dresses or
jackets, they appear almost exactly the same in somebody else’s
cut-price window. I have not made up my mind about this area but there
are serious considerations about whether we should extend the criminal
law in this way. It would be interesting to hear what the Minister has
to say about these arguments and where the Government think the balance
will lie once the Bill becomes an Act of Parliament. How do the
Government intend to ensure that that balance stays there and is not
exploited by
others?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000072">Let me
finish by asking my Scottish questions. There is a well established
convention now—thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and what
has become known as the Sewel Motion—that we will not legislate
on matters that are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly
or Northern Ireland Assembly without their consent. The general answer
to this is that international property law is not devolved. I welcome
that, and as a unionist celebrate that there are still important parts
of commercial life that we control on a UK basis. I believe in the
union and we should make more about what we do to improve the
opportunities for commercial advantage in Scotland when we can by using
UK powers. I suggested at Second Reading that I would have liked the
Government to have made more of a presence about what was being done in
this area of law in Scotland, so that Scottish people knew the
relevance of this Parliament and this area of law in their lives,
particularly in the present circumstances. That has not been done and I
regret that. I wish it
had.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000073">In the
detail of this particular legislation, there is a provision on page 13
of the Bill for new Section 35ZD—we must find some better way of
numbering sections so we do not get these ridiculous references. It
introduces new Section 35ZA, “forfeiture of Scotland”,
which essentially amends the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995.
That legislation predates the Scottish Parliament, which started in
1999, but all amendments to that legislation since then have been in
the area of devolved law. Criminal procedure in Scotland is devolved.
We are indirectly, if not directly, amending an area of devolved law in
Scotland. I think that requires a Sewel Motion. It requires the consent
of the Scottish Parliament. I am happy to be corrected on that, but it
seems to me that it does. If it does, that implies, as far as I am
concerned, that there has been some communication between the
Government and the Scottish Government on the subject of a Motion being
laid by the Scottish Government and passed by the Scottish Parliament,
where the SNP has a majority. Therefore, there will have been some
discussions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:59:54"></hs_TimeCode> on
that matter.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061344000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000225">3

those discussions will touch on a number of issues such as the resource
implications of the Scottish law being changed in this way. Those
resource implications will impact in turn on local authority resources,
given that trading standards fall under local authority jurisdiction in
Scotland. That area of public 
<?notus-xml column=405?>life in Scotland is facing reduced resources, as are all areas of public
life across the United Kingdom. What are the Scottish Government and
the Scottish Parliament’s expectation of these implications? How
will they manage them? What will this mean for the prosecuting
authorities and their ability to understand this complex area of law?
What training will be provided for those who have to understand this
complex area of law? Listening to this debate for a short time this
afternoon and having listened to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones,
and the Minister, with their expertise, and my noble friend Lord
Stevenson, who has developed expertise in this area, I can see that
this is a very complicated area of law. It is not clear whether a
particular item will infringe somebody else’s design rights on
another item. What assessment has been made of how many prosecutions
there will be? We all hope that they will be brought sparingly as we
hope that the measure will have the effect we want it to
have—namely, of reducing
infringements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000075">I

to respond to all these questions immediately, but I would like to know
the answers in due course. I give him prior warning that if this matter
requires a Sewel Motion and it goes to the Scottish Parliament and its
committees, these are just the sort of questions that people will ask.
Therefore, it would be good to know what the answers are. I could
probably add a list of other things that Members of the Scottish

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 13 will introduce a
criminal offence for the deliberate copying of a UK or EU registered
design. This should help to reduce the scale of unlawful design copying
in the UK while increasing the level of protection that is available
for holders of registered designs. The Government believe that they
have achieved a fine balance in the substance of the clause to ensure
that the criminal offence targets only those people who deliberately
steal someone else’s ideas and creativity. As we have already
discussed today, there are a number of reasons why this clause applies
only to registered designs, and this decision forms part of the fine
balance of protection that it achieves.</hs_para>

offence being on registered designs rather than unregistered designs
also reflects the majority of responses to the designs consultation. As
with other legislative changes, the Government plan to evaluate the
impact of the change within five years of implementation. The offence
gives registered designs the same level of protection as copyright and
trade marks, creating a coherent approach to enforcement and
protection. It also brings design rights in the UK to a level with
other European design leaders such as Denmark, which noble Lords will
know is noted for design in its furniture manufacturing industry, as
well as Italy and
Germany.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000078">Criminal
sanctions already exist in these countries and are considered necessary

gain. For example, in Germany in 2011, a total of 
<?notus-xml column=406?>12 trials were held concerning a criminal charge based on
design copying. In three of the cases, the charges were dropped during
the trial. In eight out of the nine cases in which a sentence was
passed, the court issued a fine. In one case, a prison sentence of nine
months to one year was imposed. These figures show clearly that the
offence is brought forward only selectively, but that a need for the
sanction does exist. This may help to reassure the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth, in his concerns over the criminal sanctions. He alluded to the
fact that they might be a little too
draconian<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:05:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the same subject, the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, raised the issue of the
costs to this country. In their impact assessment, the Government have
estimated a cost of £8.18 million over the course of 10 years.
This figure was arrived at by estimating the costs to the police, the
Crown Prosecution Service, Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals
Service, and potential legal aid costs. However, it is difficult to
estimate the benefit of the offence to business. The organisation Anti
Copying in Design has estimated that the cost of infringement to the
design industry is around 5% of the total value of design to the UK
economy. Based on the most recent estimates from NESTA of £15.5
billion as the value of design investment in the UK, this equates to an
annual cost of infringement of £0.775

the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, also asked what the provisions are for
maximum penalties. As the noble Lord may be aware, the Ministry of
Justice is currently bringing Sections 85 to 87 of the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 into force. These
provisions will increase the fines for all intellectual property
related offences in the magistrates’ courts in England and
Wales. This work needs to be allowed time to be implemented before
further increases in penalties can be considered.</hs_para>

noble Lord also asked a plain question: can the justice system cope
with this? We do not believe that the offence will create a burden on
enforcement agencies. Trading standards departments have the resources
to pursue only a certain number of intellectual property cases each
year. As a discretionary power, it will be up to each department to
balance the importance of pursuing a design case against the other
kinds of intellectual property crime in which it is interested. This is
in keeping with many other statutory provisions under which local
authorities have no duty to enforce, but can and frequently do,
instruct trading standards departments to take action. The Crown
Prosecution Service will treat any new offence with the same approach
it does for the other forms of intellectual property, using its usual
discretion and margin of appreciation, including such factors as
evidential sufficiency and the public interest in pursuing a

Whether or not it does, the public expenditure cost of £8.18
million that is already cited is a multiple many times over that of the
expected cost of infringement per annum. We are going to spend more on

that various conditions must apply in prosecuting the offence. In
particular, it must be established that the person accused of the
offence should, first, have copied a registered design; secondly, knew
that the design they copied was a registered design; and thirdly,
copied the design without the consent of the registered design holder.
Under the clause, it is also an offence knowingly to use a copied
design in the course of business activities in order to profit from
that copying. This would include acts such as marketing, exporting,
using or stocking the design in the course of business. A prosecution
will be successful only if the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the
criminal legal burden of proof; that of being “beyond all
reasonable doubt”. This is a high standard to achieve and will
help to ensure that the offence does not affect innovation or
legitimate and competitive risk-taking within business. The offence
will not apply if the defendant can show reasonable grounds for
believing that the design in question was invalid or where the person
charged with the offence shows that there was no infringement of the
registered
design.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000085">The
clause provides that a trial may be on summary trial in a
magistrates’ court or trial on indictment in a Crown Court. Of
course, this will depend on the severity of the case. In a
magistrates’ court, conviction could result in a term of
imprisonment of up to six months in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland and 12 months in Scotland, or a fine up to the statutory
maximum, or both. In the Crown Court, conviction on indictment could
result in imprisonment for up
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:10:49"></hs_TimeCode> 10 years, or
to a fine, or both. The offence in this clause will be applicable only
to designs registered prior to infringement, not to those registered
after the copying has taken place. Under the clause, trading standards
departments will have the power to enforce registered design copying,
as they do now for trademark and copyright offences. They will also
have powers of forfeiture.</hs_para>

number of points. The noble Lords, Lord Stevenson and Lord Browne,
raised the issue of the “chilling effect” of criminal
sanctions. I reiterate that the clause is not intended to have a
chilling effect on innovation or legitimate and competitive risk-taking
within business. This is something that we were very much mindful of
during the drafting of the offence as our policy intention was to
target only those people who deliberately use somebody else’s
ideas and creativity. Further, the offence depends on the infringing
product having been made “exactly or substantially” to
the registered design, and this should catch only those who set out to
copy a registered design, not those who make distinguishable follow-on
designs. This is why the offence requires the defendant 
<?notus-xml column=408?>to have known or have
reason<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:12:05"></hs_TimeCode> to
believe that the design he or she copied was registered by someone
else. Furthermore, this will have to be shown to the criminal standard
of proof of “beyond all reasonable doubt”, which is an
exceptionally high standard for prosecutors to meet in
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000087">As I
mentioned earlier, this chilling effect has not been seen in Germany
and the assertion of a chilling effect does not appear to be borne out
by the experience of other jurisdictions that retain a criminal
sanction for design copying. Germany is renowned for having a highly
effective design system and it retains both civil and criminal
sanctions. Although it is difficult to draw direct causality between
Germany’s use of criminal sanctions and its successful system,
we know that Germany has 10 times as many registered designs as the UK
and it is unlikely that the criminal sanction has had an adverse effect
on the number of registered designs or on the strong innovation
performance of German SMEs, which is so evident to us
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000088">The noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson, asked whether it was fair to prosecute those who
unknowingly stock or sell copied designs and cited the examples of
Apple and Samsung. The innocent use of a copied design in the course of
business would not be caught by the offence; for example, a retailer
would be protected if a third party had manufactured the copies and
sold them to the retailer as their own. In this case, the retailer
would not be acting with the knowledge that the design was a copy and
would not be found guilty of committing the offence. The activities
that constitute using a design under the offence reflect the definition
for “use of a design” contained in Section 7 of the
Registered Designs Act 1949. Innocent acts are protected, therefore,
under the clause because it contains the test

whether the chilling effect may not work in another sense. As the
Minister says, there is no evidence from the German experience that the
existence of criminal sanctions has had any chilling effect on the
registration of designs. But what evidence does he have to reassure us
that people who might be uncertain as to whether the design that they
wish to develop was so close to another design that it could be proved
in court to be sufficiently similar to incur a penalty, they would
therefore decide not to bother? Given the difficulties of definition in
this field, is it not possible that the chilling effect may be to deter
innovation and enterprise on the part of people who are worried that
they would be moving too close to a design that was already

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> It is not the case that that would
never happen but overall it may be of some reassurance to the noble
Lord that much consultation has taken place on this. If there were
clear indications that the examples he gave were to lead to a chilling
effect, that would certainly have arisen during consultation. 
<?notus-xml column=409?>However, the noble Lord made a fair point and we will review the
consultation. I will write to the noble Lord again if we can furnish
him with some extra, new information. It is not the Government’s
intention to criminalise businesses that use products based on copied
designs incidentally in the course of their business but do not profit
from any trade in those particular
products.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000091">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, raised the issue of applying Bugs Bunny to
various products and how the law would work. This is probably the first
time that anybody has said that Bugs Bunny is a complex issue, but he
is and it would be best if I wrote to the noble Lord on the details of
that particular point. The noble Lord also asked why it is a proposed
offence to copy “exactly or substantially”. It is our
intention that very minor modifications—possibly imperceptible
ones—should not excuse deliberate copying and the sanctions that
would follow. The noble Lord asked if the offence was
“appropriate and proportionate”—I think he used
those words. We recognise the concerns about proportionality and that
is why the defence has been carefully crafted. We do not believe that
it will lead to countless people being placed in custody, as can be
seen by my previous references to Germany in this particular
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000092">In
fear of pouring fuel on the fire of the points made on the last
amendment by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, making comparisons
between unregistered designs and copyright and its criminalisation, I
will reiterate our position on this. A comparison to copyrighted
material, which is also unregistered but attracts criminal sanctions,
is unhelpful because the protection for copyright lasts 70 years plus
the lifetime of the author. This makes it unlikely that copyright will
have expired, and infringement is therefore much more likely to be the
result of copying. The shorter period of protection for unregistered
design, together with the difficulty of knowing when those design
rights came into existence—a point that I made
earlier—means that it is more difficult for third parties to be
sure they are not infringing. The introduction of criminal sanctions
for unregistered rights could lead to a negative effect on business and
innovation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000093">Furthermore,
copyright protection is denied to the shape and configuration of
industrial designs by Section 51 of the Copyright, Designs
and Patents Act 1988. Applying criminal sanctions to an unregistered
design right would criminalise some copying that would not be caught
under the law of copyright. I am sure that the noble Lord will have
some further points to make on this matter but I thought it wise to
raise the subject
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000094">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, asked whether the issue of criminalisation
was too complicated for magistrates and juries. Provided that it is
limited to registered designs, we believe that the criminal courts can
decide whether a design has been copied exactly or substantially.
Similar issues arise in copyright, as the noble Lord will be aware. The
noble Lord also asked why new Section 35ZA includes community designs
and asked whether this would cover designs from the European Union. It
does, because EU designs have effective rights here in the
UK.</hs_para>

Stevenson, asked whether it is right that the use of a copied design is
caught by the provision. The activities which constitute using a design

Browne of Ladyton, was particularly concerned about those he described
as “rich and powerful people” using the threat of
criminal sanctions against small businesses. That is a fair point, but
I draw on the UK’s experience in relation to other intellectual
property rights, which have also been retrospectively subject to
criminal sanctions. Although there is no quantitative evidence, the
introduction of criminal sanctions for piracy and counterfeiting
provides no indication of a chilling effect on creativity, copyright or
brand development—trade marks—in the UK. They are
generally acknowledged to be in robust health, with the number of trade
mark applications at a historic high according to unpublished figures

who have spoken on this topic, in particular my noble friends Lord
Howarth and Lord Browne. Between us, including one or two of the points
made by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, we have raised a
sufficiently significant question about the desirability of this step
being taken by the Government for us to think again before we return to
this on Report. On the one hand, there is the question about whether
the right approach to protecting the desirable 
<?notus-xml column=411?>end of making sure that those who design are able to proceed to the
manufacture and exploitation of their designs without being ripped off
by others is by some simplification of the overall system that might
arrive at a better system or whether the criminalisation element will

balanced. My noble friend Lord Browne said that he is uncertain about
which is the right way, and I join him in that. I was not taking horses
out for a trot on this point. I was, to change the metaphor, casting a
fly on the water and seeing what would come up. I went fishing last
weekend, which is why it is in my mind. I caught myself with my own fly
and fell in, which was not a very successful outcome, but I was struck
by the efforts of those with rods make to attract unwilling objects,
such as fish, to some to the surface and bite the fly. You have to be
careful what you are casting for sometimes, and my unease is that the
simplicity of the central point—whether to introduce criminal
sanctions—is becoming obscured by the complications of what
might emerge if it happens. There is the question of the cost of the
engagement of the police, trading standards and prisons and the impact
on public spending, which my noble friend Lord Howarth raised. My noble
friend Lord Browne was supportive in the sense that the criminal courts
can easily take this on, as they have taken on many other things that
Parliament has opined should be criminalised in the past several
hundred years. On the other hand, it is a real change—from a
specialist court dealing with well rehearsed topics, with practitioners
who are knowledgeable in this area, to the hurly-burly of a
magistrates’ court, or a sheriff’s court in Scotland, and
then coming up through the
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000104">This
is all quite a big step and I do not feel that the arguments have been
as well marshalled as they could have been. The Minister brought
forward some evidence but there may be more in his letters. I am
looking forward to having many of those as we proceed through this,
particularly my one on Bugs Bunny, which I can hardly wait for as the
excitement is so intense. Germany is not necessarily the right model
for this. We would have been happier if we could have seen more
evidence from right across the design community. It is not a small
community—we know the numbers, and there are lots of them. The
danger in consultations of the type the IPO has carried out is that you
hear from those who shout the loudest but do not hear from those who

this very briefly, as I shall explain. The purpose of the amendment,
along with the amendment grouped with it, is to try to make sure that
artistic works prepared before 1 June 1957 will still be protected
despite the repeal of Section 52 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents
Act 1988. I remind the Committee that we discussed this at some length
during the passage of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform

learnt that the group of manufacturers who are concerned about this
have a meeting set up with the IPO for a week today. It was suggested
to me—and I have suggested it in turn to my noble friend and
given notice to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson—that perhaps it
would be better to wait to see whether the outcome of that consultation
meets the concerns of those companies. If it does not, and the issue
turns out to be serious, we can, of course, return to this matter on
Report. On the assumption that my noble friend will share my anxiety to
let that meeting proceed first, I hope that he will be able to respond
with equal brevity. I beg to

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak very
briefly. One has a pleasant sense of déjà vu when the
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, tables an amendment in relation to
works that he is careful to label as “artistic” created
before 1957. However, he then spoke of a group of manufacturers who are
shortly to meet the Intellectual Property Office. I am a little puzzled
about the relationship of artistic property to the activities of
manufacturers. If the noble Lord were able to clarify quite what the
relevance of one is to the other, I would find that
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Jenkin of Roding" PimsId="1169" UID="13061344000256" xid="1291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000256">Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> I apologise if through brevity I omitted
some obviously important facts. We are dealing with iconic pieces of
design, many of which were created in what is known as the Bauhaus
period. These would include such things as the Corbusier chaise, the
Wagenfeld lamp and what we frequently refer to as the Eames lounge
chair. They are indisputably works of fine art and are protected by
copyright throughout the European Union. The manufacturers want to be
sure that they will continue to be protected in the UK.</hs_para>

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord for
that clarification. Given that clarification, I have to say that I find
myself profoundly opposed to what it is that I think he is seeking to
achieve. While of course it is right that designers from the Bauhaus
stable—Wagenfeld, Corbusier or Eames, although he was not from
the Bauhaus—deserve to be recognised and to enjoy the protection
of their intellectual property for a reasonable length of time, we are
talking about a period that goes back to before 1957, half a century
ago. I cannot see how it can be in the public interest 
<?notus-xml column=413?>that a monopoly should continue to be held in those designs. That is not
least because no protection is being given to the designers themselves.
The design rights have been sold on and inherited. Surely it must be
desirable to limit the term of monopoly so that more people are able to
have the benefit of iconic artefacts created according to these very
beautiful and important designs at reasonable prices. The protectionism
that the noble Lord is seeking to perpetuate through his amendment is
not in the interests of our society, of our culture or, indeed, of our
economy.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I turn now to Amendments 24A
and 24B. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Jenkin for the
constructive spirit in which he has offered them and indeed that he has
agreed to wait for the results of the meeting to which he alluded.
These amendments are related to the repeal of Section 52 of the
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 through the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Act 2013. For the benefit of the Committee, and
indeed of the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, I ask noble Lords to let me
summarise briefly the reasons for the change.</hs_para>

ensure that all categories of artistic work enjoy the full term of
copyright protection; that is, the life of the creator plus 70 years.
Some artistic works that were industrially produced had 25
years’ protection. Once the repeal comes into force, which will
take place after the consultation on the timing of the repeal and
publication of a new impact assessment, these works will have the same
term of protection. If a particular type of table is an artistic work
protected by copyright, one will not be able to make a physical replica
or reproduce an image of that table in a book without permission.
Similarly, one will need the rights owner’s consent to make
wallpaper that reproduced an artistic work, such as a print. Designers
and companies that own rights in classic design furniture have been
supportive of this change. As my noble friend Lord Jenkin said, next
week my officials are meeting representatives of one such company as
part of the Government’s ongoing dialogue with interested
parties. We shall see what comes of that.</hs_para>

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble
friend. Perhaps I may respond very briefly to the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth. A month or two ago I was approached by, as it happens, a
British company which complained bitterly about Section 52 extending
the period from 25 years to life plus 70 years. I took the matter up
with my right honourable friend and discussed it with one or two other
people. They said, “Ha ha. Yes, of course. They use nothing but
Chinese-manufactured fakes. They are simply importing imitations of
these hugely important artistic designs. Of course they are cross about
it because it is their business”. The fact is that that company
has been 
<?notus-xml column=414?>behaving rather disreputably. The repeal of Section 52 is intended to
give the designs the protection that my noble friend has indicated is
the intention of the Government. We will have to have this debate
later. In the mean time, I am grateful for what the Minister said and
beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13061344000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000297">Amendment

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I am indebted to the Chartered
Institute of Patent Attorneys for having drawn my attention to the
issues on Clause 14. Generally, the institute welcomes this proposal,
but considers that it needs to be tightened up. If a product has a
patent number or patent application number on it, it is easy for any
third party to identify the patent or application and make any such
subsequent inquiry as it needs to. If, however, all that is marked on
the product is an internet link, it could turn out to be a considerable
job even to identify the patent or application. The internet link, for
instance, could be to the home page of a company and the patent number
could then be buried deep in the sublevels of the internet site.
Alternatively, the link could be to a page where all a company’s
patents and applications are listed, but in an unsearchable format.
This proposal could provide a way for a company to conceal the
information that is supposed to be present on the product. To ensure
that the internet link provides the required information directly, I
hope that the Minister will see the virtues of this amendment. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000116"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Young of Norwood Green" PimsId="4703" UID="13061344000263" xid="1710" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000263">Lord
Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> My Lords, I know that imitation is
the sincerest form of flattery, and I doubt that the contribution of
the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is copyright-protected. However, it
would not be very good if, having found the same source, I repeated
exactly the same words. We share the sentiments of the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones. We think that the government proposal is good but, in
this age of the internet, it could be made even more effective. On

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 25 would
place a requirement on businesses to provide the complete trade
designation of the product, alongside the product’s associated
patent numbers, on their websites. It is helpful that my noble friend
has raised this issue, as it will allow me to set out some more
information about how the Government are expecting the marking of
products with the web address to
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000118">The Bill
aims to reduce burdens on patent holders by modernising the ways in
which they can provide public notice of their patent rights. Allowing
patent owners to mark their patented product with a web address will
lead to cost savings for business while making it easier for the public
to access up-to-date patent information. Under current UK legislation
if, in the event that a patent is infringed, a patent holder wishes to
be in with the best chance of being awarded damages or other financial
remedies, it must mark its product with the word “patent”
or “patented”, together with the number of the patent. It
is, therefore, in a patent holder’s interest to ensure that it
is straightforward for the public to ascertain which patent or patents
apply to a particular product. Doing so will ensure that the public is
put on notice about the patent rights, making others think twice before
infringing that
patent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000119">Clause
14 requires that, if an internet link is used, it must direct the
reader to a web page which clearly associates the product with the
number of the patent concerned, as is the case under United States
patent law. This means that providing an internet link to the home page
of a company website will not suffice unless on that home page there is
a clear association between the product and the relevant patent number.
It also means that the product must be clearly identified and
associated with the relevant
patent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000120">Just
to be frivolous, I suspect that noble Lords’ mobile phones are
switched off; I hope that they are. However, if you were to take them
apart you may find—if the manufacturer operates in the United
States—a website address with the patent details is provided. I
particularly noted that it appears on my battery. Many hundreds of
patents are likely to be associated with a single mobile phone, and
listing them on a web page rather than on the mobile phone itself is
therefore far easier for the
manufacturer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000121">Amendment
25 would add an additional requirement that the web page must provide
the “complete trade designation” of the product. I
understand this to mean an identification of the exact product
concerned, including, for example, any relevant model numbers and
variants that exist. This is entirely the intention of the clause,
which I believe already caters for this. The clause requires the
provision of a web page address
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13061344000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000219">“clearly

must therefore clearly identify the product and which patents apply to
it. Currently, the Bill allows businesses to do this in a manner that
best suits their circumstances to avoid placing an undue burden on
business. Again, I remind noble Lords that it is in the patent
holder’s interest to ensure that clear information is provided
that makes it easy for the public to ascertain which patent or patents
apply to a particular product. Doing so will ensure that they can 
<?notus-xml column=416?>benefit from the maximum protection available during any legal

service. That was responded to by a number of professional bodies. The
CIPA agreed that the opinions service could be usefully expanded in
some respects but was firmly opposed to the non-binding opinions
service being turned into a binding service in relation to the
existence of the patentee’s patent. Currently, the opinions
service can give rise to four non-binding opinions: first, where the
patent is valid; secondly, if the patent is invalid for lack of novelty
or obviousness; thirdly, if the patent is infringed; and, fourthly, if
the patent is not infringed. The Bill is proposing that one, and only
one, of those four opinions should become something more than a
non-binding opinion, while the other three retain their non-binding
status.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000125">The
Bill proposes at subsection (4) to introduce into Section 73 of the
Patents Act 1977 a power for the comptroller to revoke patents of his
own motion when an opinion is given that the patent lacks novelty or is
obvious. It is of concern that this proposal has not been fully thought
through and I ask noble Lords to reconsider whether it should be kept
in the Bill. The opinions service is very useful. It provides a
low-cost forum for obtaining a first view as to the validity or
infringement of a patent. The fact is that it is an opinions service,
and a non-binding one, meaning that a certain approach is taken to such
proceedings and costs are kept low. Moreover, the opinions are a useful
commercial tool because the requester and the patentee can enter into
negotiations regarding the patent. However, if the patentee knows that
the opinion could lead to 
<?notus-xml column=417?>revocation of the patent, it is unlikely that any negotiations will be
carried out on the same basis and it is less likely that settlement
will be

proposal in the Bill will turn requests for limited requests for
validity opinions into something quite different and deprive the
opinion service of its present advantages. One of the advantages of the
opinion service is that it takes place on paper, with opinions being
given within 12 weeks. However, the patentee is given only a few weeks
in which to file comments. Where the patentee is overseas or there are
language barriers, then such a short period is difficult. This is
manageable where there is no further impact from the opinion. However,
where there could be a knock-on to the validity of the patent, this
becomes more drastic and potentially significantly more
expensive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000127">Opinions
on validity are usually sought by third parties, so the patentee is not
a party. If there is a hearing, the patentee has no opportunity to
present oral argument, nor does the patentee have the right to
challenge evidence by cross-examination. As we discussed earlier with
regard to design rights, the opinion service is not a judicial
proceeding and there is no right of appeal to the court. In fact,
Section 74A makes it clear that the patentee has no right of appeal
against the opinion given. Although the patentee has a right to seek a
review under Section 74B, the grounds for review are limited to whether
the opinion was wrongly concluded. This falls short of being a proper
appeal, and any appeal under Section 97 is similarly limited. Paragraph

the amendment to the opinion service proposed in the Bill, it appears
that the patentee will be placed in the position of having to overturn
the presumption that the patent is invalid. Thus, the normal burden in
revocation proceedings will be reversed. Moreover, the person
requesting the opinion will, in effect, have placed a large financial
burden on the patentee to defend his patent even though the requester
has to pay only the fee for an opinion, which is comparatively
low.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000129">It is
also not clear that the patentee will have recourse to a proper
judicial procedure. It is not clear from the Bill or from the notes

nor the patentee will be able to cross-examine the requester’s
witnesses or experts during the opinion procedure and nor would such
opportunity be available during any subsequent Section 73 proceedings.
It is difficult to see how this latter would be possible in what will
essentially be ex parte proceedings. I shall not deal with the clarity
of the invalidity because that will be dealt with by the subsequent

wonder whether the IPO has considered whether the proposal is TRIPS-
compliant. Is the patentee afforded the necessary two levels of
hearing? I further wonder whether the proposal in the Bill is
future-proofed. It is likely that the unitary patent will come into
effect in due course. Can the IPO give opinions on unitary
patents? If it can, will it not be able to revoke a unitary patent?
Surely exclusive jurisdiction for the unitary patent rests with the
unified patent court. It seems odd to have a provision which will apply
to some, but not all, patents effective in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000131">I
recognise that the IPO has a fundamental role as the regulator of the
patent register. However, I do not see that the IPO has an obligation
to clear the register of invalid patents. It is against its financial
interest to do so. It does not do this for all the many patents on the
register for which opinions are not requested. Why should it do it for
patents on which opinions are requested? This is discriminatory and not
a function assigned to the IPO by any
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000132">I
recognise that the IPO also offers value-added services, such as
assistance for private applicants, mediation services and opinion
services. When offering such services, the IPO has to keep them
entirely separate from its regulatory function. It must be careful
about the advice it offers, and it has to be careful not to be both
judge and jury. In offering value-added services, the IPO has to guard
against the breakdown of the notional wall between, for example, a
non-binding opinion service and the regulatory function.
Notwithstanding the IPO’s comments in the response, this
proposal breaches that
wall.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000133">If the
patent is now to be put at risk by the opinion service, then all
patentees must respond when invited to do so. The patentee will have to
treat opinion service proceedings at the same level as patent
revocation proceedings, thereby finding and submitting full evidence
and opinions on why the requester is wrong. Although, as the IPO has
noted, many already do this, that is not the case for all
patentees—note especially my earlier comments on overseas
patentees with language barriers. It then also becomes important that
the patentee should have a greater right of redress when it does not
agree with the opinion given. That would mean changing the procedure so
that the patentee could appeal, but that is not part of the
Bill’s
proposals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000134">Allowing
there to be legal consequences to the opinion, albeit after further
proceedings, changes the nature of the opinion service and the costs
for both parties, yet there is no provision for cost recovery. This
also opens up possibilities for abuse. We have talked about the
imbalance between parties in other contexts. Here, a rich party could
target all the patents of an SME so as to remove both good and bad
patents in an SME’s portfolio by requesting opinions on all of
them. That would be at little cost to the requester but would require
significant cost from the SME to defend all its patents. Even if the
comptroller is to begin fresh proceedings under Section 73, there will
be a perception, whatever the response to the consultation says on this
topic, that the non-binding opinion would be a decision that the
patentee had to overcome, as opposed to the IPO acting as an
independent and impartial tribunal, as required by part 1 of Article 6
of the human rights convention.</hs_para>

be considered. Amendments made under Section 73 are not advertised
prior to acceptance and there is no procedure for a third party to
intervene. While that may not be an issue for the other situations
under Section 73, in this case, there is clearly a third party with an
interest, even if it has chosen not to file for revocation. Depending
on the amendments accepted, the IPO may have invented a procedure that
negates the value of the opinion already given and undermines the
decisions and settlements formed on the basis of it. The third party
may then find that its further opinion on non-infringement no longer
held water and it had to start that process all over
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000136">I
understand the IPO’s concern that, should its value-added
services give an opinion, whether binding or not, that a patent is not
valid, then it might seem strange that that patent remains on the
register. However, there are many reasons for a non-binding opinion to
be sought and many reasons why the patentee may not take part in those
proceedings or only take part to a limited level. If it is important to
the applicant for the validity opinion or to a third party that the
patent be revoked, then IPO inter partes proceedings are available
under Section 72. Where the applicant does not wish to pursue those,
the IPO can step in and take them over. Section 72 proceedings are
judicial proceedings where there is a full exchange of evidence,
disclosure, cross-examination and oral hearing. The proposed subsection
potentially turns the opinion service into a cheap form of revocation
proceedings and this will debase the value of the opinion service.
These are formidable arguments against that subsection and I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000137"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Stevenson of Balmacara" PimsId="5801" UID="13061344000268" xid="2067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000268">Lord

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 25A and
25B relate to the patent opinions service. Amendment 25A, tabled by my
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, seeks to remove the power that will
allow the Intellectual Property Office to initiate revocation
proceedings where an opinion concludes that the patent is invalid.
Amendment 25B, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Stevenson and Lord Young
of Norwood Green, seeks to insert the word “clearly” into
the clause so that revocation will be initiated only when novelty or
inventive step is clearly not satisfied.</hs_para>

limited extension of the IPO’s existing powers to initiate
revocation proceedings. It will help in particular SMEs and lone
inventors who may simply be unable to afford to bring revocation action
themselves. More broadly, it will be in the public interest to allow
the IPO to seek the removal of certain invalid patents from the patents
register. I reassure noble Lords that the IPO will only initiate such
proceedings in clear-cut cases—where there is no reasonable
argument to be made that the invention is new or not an obvious
replacement of what has gone before. However, in those cases which are
not clear cut there will be no revocation action.</hs_para>

that initiation of action will not always result in revocation. The
patentee can submit observations that may demonstrate that his patent
is valid. Alternatively, amendment may reduce the monopoly afforded by
the granted claim. The patent holder will also be able to appeal any
decision to revoke to the courts. The Explanatory Notes accompanying
the Bill make it clear that the power to revoke will be exercised only
in the most clear cut of cases. Therefore, I do not feel it is
necessary to insert the word “clearly” into the
legislation itself, as suggested by noble Lords in Amendment
25B.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000141">Inserting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:56:33"></hs_TimeCode>
the word “clearly” into the legislation may also lead to
argument about what that word means, thus adding an unnecessary further
strand to the dispute. For example, if the patent holder disagrees with
the revocation and appeals to the courts, the court should not have to
decide whether a patent is “clearly invalid” but should
instead be free to decide the core question of whether the patent is or
is not valid. The IPO is already able to seek revocation of a patent
under certain circumstances. Experience shows that its officers would
be well placed to assess whether revocation proceedings should be
initiated following an opinion that concludes that a patent is clearly
invalid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000142">Before
answering a number of questions, I will finish by sharing with you the
story of one SME which responded to the consultation in support of the
government position. Shortly after it was set up, this SME became aware
of a competitor’s patent for a similar product to that which it
intended to sell. The SME requested an opinion on the patent, which
concluded that the competitor’s patent was invalid. However,
despite this alleged invalidity, the competitor continued to contact
potential customers of the SME, warning them of possible infringement
of their patent, and as a result customers stopped placing orders with
the SME. The SME was therefore faced with the stark choice of either
closing down or bringing revocation proceedings against the patent. It
was apparently told it would cost £100,000 to bring such
proceedings, and it simply could not afford to do so. In the end, the
SME was fortunate in that it received backing from a much larger
company, which enabled it to carry on trading and, indeed, to
significantly grow the business. However, I am sure noble Lords can
appreciate that such support cannot be guaranteed for all SMEs. As the
example demonstrates, it is important that intellectual property does
not become the preserve of only those with deep pockets. The clause as
it stands, limited as it is and 
<?notus-xml column=421?>with the necessary safeguards to protect legitimate patent holders,
will, I believe, further help to ensure that does not

his usual perceptive way, my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones raised a
goodly number of questions. I will attempt to answer them all. First,
he asked whether the procedure was TRIPS-compliant. The proposed
legislation mirrors legislation already in place for revocation under
Section 73(1) of the Patents Act 1977. The process of revocation will
also mirror the process of revocation under Section 73(1). This process
means that the revocation will also be considered by a more senior
official than the examiner who issued the opinion. He will look at the
details afresh and will not be bound by the conclusions of the
examiner’s opinion when deciding whether revocation proceedings
should begin. The patentee will then have the opportunity to address
the alleged invalidity by way of amendment of his patent or by
argument. He will also be able to appeal any decision to revoke his
patent to the High Court. Further appeals are still possible, and this
ensures that the procedure is
TRIPS-compliant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Clement-Jones asked whether opinions will be provided on unitary
patents. Until the technical details of the unitary patent system and
the unified patent court are finally in place, the IPO is not in a
position to comment on whether it will issue an opinion on a unitary
patent. However, once the system is established, the IPO will consider
the requirements of stakeholders and the merits of providing an opinion
on the validity of or infringement of a unitary patent. I hope that
that goes some way to providing a reassurance for noble
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:00:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

asked whether this would change the non-binding nature of the opinion.
Giving the IPO power to initiate revocation proceedings will not alter
the non-binding nature of the patent opinions service. The decision to
initiate revocation proceedings will be made by a senior officer
independent of the opinions examiner, and that senior officer will
reassess the facts of the case and will not be bound by the conclusions
of the opinions examiner. In other words, the opinion may trigger a
further separate investigation of validity, but in itself it will
remain a non-binding opinion, which I think further emphasises the
points I made earlier.</hs_para>

more input will be required from both parties in the process. It is
always incumbent on the person requesting the opinion and the person
filing observations to provide enough information to support their
argument. Sampling observations submitted by patentees where validity
has been challenged demonstrate that the majority of patentees are
already providing a full and detailed response to the challenge. One
respondent to the consultation indicated that the amount of work put
into a patent opinion was similar to that put into proceedings before
the patents county court, but without the added costs of evidence
preparation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>. My
noble friend asked whether this will lead to increased costs for the
patent holder if he has to challenge the revocation before the courts.
By limiting revocation action to those situations where there is
clear-cut 
<?notus-xml column=422?>invalidity, we consider that the patentee will appreciate that any
appeal to the court would be unlikely to result in success. However, if
an applicant were to appeal the decision to revoke and the courts were
to find in his favour, under the UK court system, the losing party
would usually be required to pay all the

asked whether timescales are inappropriate with revocation, as are the
procedures. The timescales for revocation and the procedures are set
out with the existing procedures in Section 73 of the Copyright,
Designs and Patents Act 1988 as it stands, so they are applicable to
all. These work well and achieve the right safeguards for patentees;
the proposal follows this existing model. My noble friend asked if
users of the patent opinions service might not be interested in
revoking patents, but any invalid patent that remains in force gives an
unfair monopoly to the patentee in the commercialisation of his patent.
This will usually have a wider impact than simply on the parties
involved in any dispute as it can influence innovation and competition
in the field—that is, the wider field beyond the particular
patent. There is therefore a public interest in ensuring that clearly
invalid patents do not remain in
force<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:03:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

why we are not extending this further into other areas of invalidity,
not focusing just on novelty or inventive step. The intention is to
take action only against those patents that are clearly invalid. In
practice, that means that the invention is clearly not novel or
inventive. There are other grounds on which the validity of a patent
can be challenged, such as whether disclosure of the patent is complete
enough to allow a third party to work with the invention. Those grounds
are almost invariably much less clear cut and would require a higher
degree of input from parties than currently afforded and intended by
the opinions service.</hs_para>

my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones referred to the consultation. We
argue that the response to the IPO’s consultation was mixed,
although it did appear that some of the respondents against the
proposal assumed that a patent would be automatically revoked, yet this
is not the intention. In deciding whether to proceed with this
proposal, the IPO took on board the concerns of representative bodies,
such as CIPA, while also giving consideration to the comments of large
corporations, such as Dyson, and the needs of SMEs and lone inventors,
who supported the
proposal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000150">The
initial proposal was to initiate revocation proceedings following any
conclusion of invalidity. However, the IPO acknowledges the burden that
would be required upon a patentee to defend their patent in those areas
of validity that are not clear-cut. For this reason the proposal has

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> The noble Viscount has just
misquoted the section of the Act to which he was referring. If I heard
him correctly—I will check <I>Hansard</I>—he referred to
the comptroller issuing an opinion under Section 74A that Section
1(1)(a) or (b) is not clearly satisfied, which, indeed, was the
intention behind our amendment. I take the point that the noble 
<?notus-xml column=423?>Viscount said earlier that the notes clearly say that it is envisaged
that this additional power to strike off a patent will be exercised
only in the clearest of cases where it is indisputable that the patent
invention lacks novelty or inventive step. We are not very far apart on
this. As I and the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, the industry
argues that the current phrasing is too bland to get across the
sentiment which I think the noble Viscount is expressing—namely,
that there has to be a clear exceptionality about the nature of the
opinion. I hope that the noble Viscount will reflect on that matter and
come back to it at a later stage. We need to get across the concept
that the power will be exercised only in the clearest of cases where it
is indisputable that the patent invention lacks novelty or inventive
step. It is fine in the notes, but the notes are not the law, and the
law needs to be
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000152"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13061344000271" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000271">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> It may be helpful if I clarify for the

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the
Minister for his very full and careful response. However, the noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson, has put his finger on the point. I thought that
what the Minister said was entirely reasonable. I heard what he said
about TRIPS and two steps. However, when I read the actual wording of
the Bill, I do not see that. I see a kind of blancmange where the IPO
and the comptroller can take this over and revoke a patent after an
opinion without a very clear step between the opinion and the
revocation procedure. I am not an expert patent lawyer, and I shall
consult a number of organisations, including the Law Society and the
Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys, but it seems to me that they
are entirely right to be concerned about the Bill’s
wording.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000156">I
entirely accept that the Minister, absolutely in good faith, has read
out how he and the IPO believe that this is meant to operate. However,
we operate on the basis of the rule of law. The Minister, in a way, has
made a Pepper v Hart statement whereby, if we were to have a judicial
review of the IPO when revocation had taken place and everything had
gone pear-shaped for a patentee, the patentee could rely on the
Minister’s statement. I would much prefer to amend the Bill, and
I cannot for the life of me see why if it is the intention 
<?notus-xml column=424?>to have revocation proceedings only in clear-cut cases where a patent is
invalid for various particular reasons, it cannot be expressed in the
Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061344000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000157">The bit
of the Minister’s response that I found somewhat disingenuous
was somewhat like political jujitsu, when he said that this is all for
the benefit of SMEs. I thought that that was a cunning reversal of the
arguments because, if we are not careful, SMEs will be faced with the
power of a determined major company that wants to make sure that it
gets opinions in place. It could then bring revocation proceedings that
could be extremely threatening to some small patentees. That is not
entirely helpful to the SME.</hs_para>

the Minister’s words, but this is a very serious issue for the
professionals involved. They really understand the steps that need to
be taken. They understand, as I do not, all the intricacies of TRIPS,
they recognise novelty and they have to advise on such issues on a
daily basis. They are extremely concerned that this is a woolly area
that gives the comptroller too much power. However, we will no doubt
come back to this on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw
the amendment.</hs_para>

16 amends Section 89 of the Patents Act 1977 and expressly provides the

present, under Article 7 of the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court,
each contracting member state may request and establish one division of
the court of first instance of the unitary patent court within its
jurisdiction for every 100 patent cases in each calendar year during
three successive years prior to or subsequent to the date of entry into
force of the agreement. This is subject to a maximum number of such
divisional courts per jurisdiction of four. We note that in the event
that the UK jurisdiction as a whole has a sufficient number of patent
cases to merit more than one such divisional court within the UK, the
Secretary of State will have the power to designate other courts, which

present, the Court of Session currently has exclusive jurisdiction in
Scotland over patent cases, including UK and EU-UK patents. If it were
to lose this jurisdiction in respect of the new unitary patent, which
is of course designed to eventually supersede the current European
patent and possibly national patents, patent litigants in Scotland
would be forced to litigate their relevant patent rights elsewhere in
the United Kingdom or further afield in the EU. That would add
significantly to their costs and to their overall business burdens and
administration. We believe that at least two divisional courts might be
situated in the UK as a whole and suggest that one might be based in
Scotland. There seems to be potential to ensure that future patent
litigants who operate in the Scottish jurisdiction are not unduly
disadvantaged.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061344000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000230">4.15

amendment seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State consults HM
Courts and Tribunals Service, the Scottish Court Service, the Northern
Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service and other appropriate consultees,
and takes their views and evidence into account before conferring,
removing or varying court jurisdiction. In addition, where sufficient
numbers of patent cases in the UK allow, the Secretary of State should
confer on each legal jurisdiction throughout the United Kingdom a court
which has local divisional court status, allowing patent cases, where
appropriate, to be heard in that legal jurisdiction. This will
effectively preserve the status quo under the existing national and EU
patent regimes. Failure to confer local divisional court status may
raise access to justice concerns and increase costs and inconvenience
to all businesses and litigants, including SMEs, who may be impacted
heavily by potential additional costs in bringing or defending actions.

ensure that the Secretary of State takes account of the views of the
courts services and any other appropriate body when using 
<?notus-xml column=426?>the power to confer or amend the jurisdiction of a court. These bodies
are already closely involved in the implementation of the unified
patent court. Establishing this court is an enormous task that requires
resources and expertise from across government. It is for this reason
that the Government have set up a task force responsible for UK
implementation of the unified patent court agreement. This task force
is a joint endeavour between the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills and the Ministry of Justice, and I can assure noble Lords
that Ministers and senior officials from each department are fully
engaged in this matter.</hs_para>

Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service are leading on work to
establish the UK-based divisions and on the discussions with European

Similarly, officials from the Ministry of Justice are leading the work
for the UK on the selection and training of judges for the unified
patent court. The devolved Administrations in Scotland and Northern
Ireland and the courts services in those jurisdictions are represented
on the steering board which oversees the work of the task force. Noble
Lords may be interested to learn that the Chancellor of the High Court
and the patents judiciary in England and Wales are also involved in the
work of the task force. The judiciary is represented on the steering
board of the task force, and officials meet the judges on a regular
basis.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061344000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000167">I can
confirm that the Government are consulting the Administrations in the

wish the unified patent court agreement to apply to their territories.

seeks to ensure that local divisions of the unified patent court will
be set up in each jurisdiction of the UK. I appreciate the arguments in
favour of setting up a local division in England and Wales, Scotland
and Northern Ireland. Ensuring local access to justice is a key element
of the unified patent court, and this is why the agreement makes
provisions for setting up local divisions. Let me be clear that no
decision has yet been made about how many local divisions the UK will
host and where those divisions may be located. Contracting states of
the unified patent court agreement are not obliged to host a local
division. Local divisions can be set up and disbanded upon request by a
contracting state. These requests will be considered by the body that
will govern the administration of the unified patent court.
Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T16:19:42"></hs_TimeCode> Lords may
also be interested to learn that it will be possible for a local
division to sit in different locations as the need arises. A travelling
local division could provide an alternative to hosting more than one
division. This amendment would fix in primary legislation the number
and location of any local divisions the UK may host. It is undesirable
and unnecessary to be 
<?notus-xml column=427?>prescriptive in this case as it would restrict the UK in the
administration of any UK-based local divisions in a manner not provided
for in the unitary patent court agreement.</hs_para>

number of points. First, the amendment would require the Secretary of
State to consider the need for “reasonable” access to
courts across the United Kingdom. As I have already said, the
Government are working closely with the devolved Administrations in
Scotland and Northern Ireland to ensure that the needs of users
throughout the UK are addressed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061344000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000171">Secondly, this
amendment places a limitation on how the power may be used to require
the payment of a fee. As it stands, Clause 16 is intended to account
for various circumstances where a fee might be required. The Government
do not currently anticipate that fees for the court will be paid
directly to any government department. However, the details of the
financial arrangements of the court are still being negotiated through
the preparatory committee that has been set up by the contracting
states of the unified patent court agreement. It is anticipated that
court fees will be paid directly to the unified patent court. A change
to UK law to facilitate the payment of a fee to the court, as proposed
by Amendment 25D, is not required. The agreement sets out high-level
principles for how the unified patent court fees will be decided, but
it will be for the members of the preparatory committee, including the
UK, to agree the level of court fees. In agreeing the level of fees for
the court, the preparatory committee will need to balance the need to
ensure that the court is accessible to users with the requirement that
the system will eventually be self-financing. Ensuring the system is
accessible and eventually self-financing is a priority for the UK, and
the final details will be carefully considered before we ratify the
agreement.</hs_para>

raises the issue of how the power may be used to align UK law with
sections of the unified patent court agreement. As it stands, Clause 16
is intended to ensure that provisions of the Patents Act which relate
to national patents may be aligned with equivalent provisions in the
unified patent court agreement should this be necessary. For example,
it may be desirable to align the law on infringement so that the same
provisions apply for European bundle, unitary and national patents.
This may be necessary to avoid a situation where patents valid in the
UK will be subject to different infringement laws depending on whether
they were national patents granted by the IPO or European rights
granted by the European Patent Office. The unified patent court
agreement does not make any provisions for national patents so it is
necessary to ensure that the power conferred specifically allows for
this eventuality. This amendment would not allow such an alignment to
be made because the power would be restricted to giving effect to the
provisions of the agreement.</hs_para>

would remove the ability to use the power conferred to amend any
enactment other than the Patents Act. This would be an important
omission from the scope of the power to ensure that the UK can fully
implement the unified patent court 
<?notus-xml column=428?>agreement, which must be avoided. In light of all that I have

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 17 relates to the
exchange of information with other patent offices. The idea behind this
provision is, we suppose, to allow the exchange of search and
examination results for unpublished applications, as information about
published applications is already exchanged. The current exchanges
increase efficiency, save duplication and unnecessary work, and are in
every way admirable. Perhaps such exchanges are contemplated only with
major offices, such as the USA, Europe, Japan and Korea.</hs_para>
<?notus-xml column=429?><hs_para UID="13061344000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000176">The effect of the
proposals is much less clear. The new power given by the section is
extremely broad. Any information that the other patent office requests
may be sent subject to the working arrangements made with the other
patent offices, of which only protecting confidentiality is said to be
essential. Any patent office, which is quite broadly defined, may
request the information. Possibly in the case of smaller countries the
information provided from the UK could substitute for a local search or
examination, which is not unreasonable, unless such requests would make
too much extra work for the UK
office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000177">The
working arrangements are completely at the discretion of the
comptroller. They do not have to be approved by Parliament, unlike many
other powers proposed under this Bill. There is no limitation on the
type of information that may be exchanged or the form in which it might
be requested. For example, a request might be for details and copies of
all applications in the name of company X relating to technology Y. Our
amendment suggests that the provision should be substantially limited,
in the following ways. Information to be exchanged should be limited to
search and examination results. Information should be provided about UK
applications only, designated by a UK filing number, from which
priority has been claimed in the country of the patent office seeking
information. No information should be provided earlier than one year
from the date of the UK filing unless the applicant agrees otherwise.
The UK applicant should be informed of the request and the information
provided. Information should be provided to patent offices of countries
on an approved list only, to be added to from time to time by statutory
instrument. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000178"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13061344000279" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000279">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 17 will allow the
Intellectual Property Office to share patent information on unpublished
patent applications with patent offices outside the United Kingdom on a
confidential basis for their use in processing similar patent
applications filed with them. This will help speed up international
patent processing. I hope that noble Lords will bear with me, as I have
much to say in speaking to this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000179">Amendment
25E would place various restrictions on the circumstances in which
information may be sent to a patent office outside the United Kingdom.
First, the amendment would introduce a requirement that the other
patent office must quote the application number of a UK patent
application when it requests information. It is absolutely the
intention that information will be shared with other offices only where
they have specified what information is required and in relation to
which patent application, identified by the application number. It is
for this reason that Clause 17 applies to such information as that
office requests and only in accordance with the agreements made by the
Intellectual Property Office. This is the approach taken when the IPO
provides information to the European Patent Office in accordance with
Section 118(3)(a) of the Patents Act and the European Patent
Convention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000180">Secondly,
the amendment would restrict the arrangements so that information could
be shared only when an application had been filed abroad following 
<?notus-xml column=430?>a UK application. In practice, it is only when the other office is
dealing with an application, which follows on from a UK application,
that it will be able to gain any benefit from seeing the results of the
UK work.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061344000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000231">4.30
pm</hs_time><hs_para UID="13061344000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000181">Thirdly,
the amendment would restrict the work-sharing arrangements so that
information could be shared only 12 months after an application had
been filed at the UK office. Restricting the provision in this way is
likely to detract from the usefulness of the information to other
offices as they may not receive the information in time for the
completion of their own search and examination work on related
applications filed in that office. None the less, I can reassure noble
Lords that, in practice, the first opportunity at which useful
information can be shared is after completion of the search by the UK
office. Indeed, the existing arrangements with the European Patent
Office operate in this manner. Requests from another office will
therefore in practice not be made until after the applicant has filed a
later application in that office that follows on from the UK
application.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000182">Fourthly,
the amendment would restrict the work-sharing arrangements so that they
apply to the UK search and examination results only. Work sharing will
be of the greatest benefit if the context of the search and examination
work conducted by the UK office is also shared. It will therefore be
useful to that other office if the IPO is able to share, for example,
the claims of a patent application that define the invention. That will
enable the other office to work most efficiently with the information
provided by the UK. I can assure noble Lords present today that the
types of information to be shared extend only to that information
likely to reduce duplication. I also suggest that requirements such as
what information can be shared are far more suitable for inclusion in
the working agreements between the IPO and the other office than for
primary legislation. I have already referred to the existing
arrangements with the European Patent Office and remind noble Lords
that the details are not set out in primary
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061344000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000183">Fifthly,
the amendment would require the IPO to inform each applicant that a
request for information had been made in relation to their application
and what information was being shared. I appreciate that it is
essential that patent applicants must be provided with a full and
complete explanation along the lines of the following: what information
is being shared; from what point onwards; with which other offices it
is being shared; and what restrictions are in place on the use of that
information. That will enable patent applicants to make fully informed
decisions about their filing strategies. I reassure noble Lords that my
officials at the IPO intend to provide such information on the
IPO’s website, which will provide applicants with sufficient
notice of future plans to enable them to make fully informed decisions
about their filing strategies. For example, the website will explain to
applicants that the work-sharing arrangements will not share any
information until a search has been completed. Providing this general
information will mean that there is no need to inform applicants on an
individual basis.</hs_para>
<?notus-xml column=431?><hs_para UID="13061344000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130613-gc0001.htm#13061344000184">Finally, the amendment
would require an approved list to be created, as the noble Lord
mentioned, by statutory instrument, listing to which offices the IPO
may send information. The schedule to the Bill removes the need for the
Government to introduce secondary legislation simply to update lists of
countries. To introduce the requirement here would be inconsistent with
the aim of simplifying processes under the Bill. None the less, as I
have already explained, I appreciate that it is essential that patent
applicants must be provided with full and complete explanations of the
work-sharing arrangements as and when they are agreed so that they can
make fully informed decisions about their filing strategies. Providing
an approved list in legislation of potential countries for future
work-sharing arrangements is likely to lead to confusion for other
offices and patent applicants. A country may be included on that
approved list even though no work-sharing arrangements are yet in place
or even being considered. Users will therefore still need to refer to
the IPO’s website to confirm the details of any existing or
forthcoming work-sharing arrangements.</hs_para>

lengthy explanations have provided sufficient reassurances for noble
Lords. In the light of my comments, I ask that the noble Lord, Lord

States expressed concern about the matter and I agreed to take forward

Counter-Terrorism Coordinator (Gilles de Kerchove) provided an overview
of his recent paper on foreign fighters and urged Ministers to take
immediate action to address the potential threat to EU internal
security that jihadists travelling to Syria posed. The UK highlighted
the importance in supporting those who wanted to do all they can to
support the humanitarian effort, whilst deterring them from actually
travelling out to Syria where they are at risk of putting themselves
and innocent Syrians in danger. I expressed my disappointment that the
European Parliament had failed to adopt its report on the EU PNR
Directive. The External Action Service (Maciej Popowski) cautioned 
<?notus-xml column=144?>against viewing all those who travelled to Syria as terrorists and
reminded Member States of the need also to address
counter-proliferation. The Commission declared its intention to carry
out a risk assessment on foreign fighters and enhance the work of the

the Presidency sought views on the Commission’s proposal for a

Member States to provide Europol with information. There was a clear
consensus against the merger despite the Commission highlighting that
the Council had  a duty to follow the Common Approach on EU
Decentralised Agencies and make efficiency and cost savings. The UK
spoke out against the merger, agreeing with 18 other Member States that
it would have a negative impact on both training and operational
activities and that the Commission’s own calculations had failed
to demonstrate cost savings. The Presidency concluded that work would
begin at expert level on the assumption that the merger would not be

obligation to share information, a number of Member States expressed
opposition to the Commission’s proposals. The UK acknowledged
the importance of information sharing but said we could not accept any
proposal that made national law enforcement agencies accountable to
Europol, or that would lead to Member States losing control over
decisions on what data they share and with whom. Increased obligations
could also result in Member States overwhelming Europol with
information in order to comply with the Regulation, to the detriment of
the quality of the information. The UK also raised concerns over
obligations to carry out domestic investigations at the request of
Europol. No other Member States intervened on this point. Discussion

was a discussion on the protection of refugees from Syria. The European
External Action Service was pleased to announce that President Barroso
had secured additional aid for Syria, and hoped that the Geneva II
process, the International Peace Conference held in Geneva that
discusses the conflict in Syria, would make progress in the medium
term. According to the European Asylum Support Office, Syria remained
in the top three asylum intake for the EU Member States and anticipated
that this trend would remain. The Commission welcomed the increase in
humanitarian aid and noted that the UNHCR would shortly call for the
humanitarian admission of 10,000 refugees, with  a further
2,000 set aside for resettlement to the EU. The Commissioner welcomed
the high recognition 
<?notus-xml column=145?>rate within the EU, but remained concerned about the divergent practices
between Member States and the detention of Syrian nationals. The UK
noted an increase in Syrian asylum seekers, and pointed to increased
humanitarian aid as the most urgent short term priority for the EU; the
UK had pledged £170m to date. The medium term priority should be
the establishment of the Regional Protection Programme (RPP) to provide
support in the regions affected and the UK hoped its place on the
steering committee for the programme would be confirmed soon. Finally,
the UK welcomed work by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) to
develop an accurate picture of asylum claims and in coordination of any
special support that would be required as a result. The Presidency

Ministers discussed free movement an issue the UK has been working hard
to get the Council to consider. Although there was a divergence of
views on how to deal with this issue, all Ministers agreed that free
movement was a core right that should be protected and expressed a wish
to work together to look at possible abuse of free movement. The UK,
supported by a number of other Member States, stressed the need to
tackle abuse to ensure continued public confidence in the principle,
and called for follow up work in the Council with a report back to JHA
Ministers. However, led by the Commission, a number of Member States
resisted, arguing that the discussion should be led by the Commission
with a focus on the evidence of the problem. The Presidency asked a
Commission-led group to investigate the issue to provide an interim
report to the October JHA Council and a final report in December. It
was decided that the EPSCO Ministers would also be given the
opportunity to feed into the report. The UK thanked the Presidency for
the discussion and for the recognition that there should be follow up
work at EU level and indicated that the UK, Germany and a number of
other Member States would also be progressing work on ways of dealing
with the abuse of free movement.</hs_para>

Regulation 562 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation 539 (visa
requirements for nationals of non-EU countries). The Presidency also
provided updates on the three legal migration Directives. It called for
Member States’ flexibility on the files on Seasonal Workers and
Intra-Corporate Transferees (ICTs) as they hoped to reach first reading
deals. Negotiations for the Students  and Researchers proposal
would continue under the Lithuanian Presidency. The Commission
emphasised the importance of the instruments in making the

before the European Parliament elections, so there would be a concerted
effort to conclude all outstanding negotiations. In addition, Lithuania
had put Europol and cyber security high on the agenda and a debate on
the latter would be a focus for the Informal Council in July, alongside
a review of the Stockholm Programme, a discussion on Syria, and the
Annual Report on Immigration and Asylum. The Eastern Partnership would

presented its Communication on migration and development in preparation

driving the behaviour of asylum seekers, including their choice of

observations of the experience of EU partners is that where the balance
is wrong the number of unfounded claims goes up. We did not think that
the recast European Directive on Reception Conditions achieved a

into force from April 2016. From that time, any dog that comes to the
attention of the authorities, either because its behaviour is a concern
or because it has strayed, can be scanned to see if it has a microchip.
If the dog does not have a microchip the owner will be asked to rectify
this or face a costly fine. Means testing for the cost of fitting a
microchip is not necessary. Many of the animal welfare charities are
currently offering free microchipping at all their centres, and where a
charge is incurred by others, this is very small compared to the cost
of keeping a
