of a package of measures to tackle bovine TB. Two pilots will be
undertaken this summer to assess the methodology for delivering an
effective cull. This year there will be intensive monitoring of the
effectiveness and humaneness of controlled shooting. A panel of
independent experts will review the resulting report once the pilots
have concluded. Only then will Ministers decide whether the policy
should be rolled out more

the problem that we seek to tackle and the difficulty of using the
various measures that we have. That is why we are using a range of
measures. The open season dates take account of the breeding season, so
the assessment could happen any time from the beginning of this month
on. Operators will be required to follow best practice guidelines, and
it will be very carefully monitored. A number of organisations are

highlight this. Last year 28,000 cattle had to be put down. Through
this cull, we are looking at reducing the number of badgers by 5,000,
so noble Lords can see the scale of this. The cost to the taxpayer over
the last decade was £500 million for the cattle destroyed, and
that could reach £1 billion in the next

scientific assessment published on Defra’s website—I
declare an interest as I was part of the

has a modest effect in reducing the incidence of TB in cattle; it is
estimated to be 16%. Does the Minister agree that rolling out culling
as a national policy to control TB in cattle is not really credible?
Furthermore, will she tell us what assessment Defra has made of the
reasons why 40% of farms in the highest-risk areas of the country do

having been such a power behind the earlier, randomised controlled
trials into this, which established the 16% figure that he has just
talked about. That is why, faced with this enormous challenge, we are
taking a range of measures, including more cattle testing, greater
biosecurity and investing in research in vaccines. I noted his point
about the herds that do not seem to be suffering from TB yet are in TB
hotspots. I point him to the £250 million fund for new
vaccination projects. It is undersubscribed. I suggest that he directs

following what is now known as

it is quite clear that alternate approaches are now necessary. What are
some of these alternate approaches to controlling tuberculosis in
wildlife and domestic livestock? This country is well known for its
ability to sedate wildlife, take samples and all the rest of it. An
approach based on the sedation of badgers, for example, would be a good
way in which to approach this issue. One could take samples, vaccinate
and all the rest of it. Has the Minister considered any of the

have considered all approaches, welcome all suggestions and welcome
research. Cattle measures are the foundation of our control programme, 
<?notus-xml column=133?>and ultimately we wish to be able to use vaccination
for cattle and badgers. As I mentioned, there is much investment into
research. The problems lie in the challenges with the vaccinations; the

Knight of Weymouth:</Member></B> My Lords, it is vital that we find a
workable solution to the spread of TB from badgers to cattle. The
science strongly suggests that a cull is not workable, even if this
pilot to test whether a cull is humane is successful. In Wales,
an intensive effort to vaccinate badgers looks more hopeful, because
vaccination does not risk spreading the disease through the
perturbation effect of culling. Given that the vaccination trials in
Gloucestershire are being carried out at a third of the cost of
vaccination in Wales, is it not time for Defra to reduce the cost of
mandatory training for vaccination, so that it is at least as cheap as
the training needed to shoot
badgers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T14:45:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000016"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13061896000315" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000315">Baroness

answer. There is an injectable badger vaccine, to which the noble Lord
has referred, which is being used in Wales. He will also know that this
has a lot of practical difficulties. It has no effect on already
infected badgers, it requires the annual trapping of new cubs to
vaccinate them, and so on. We therefore look with interest at what the
Welsh Government are doing. We note the enormous cost of that and are
aware that an oral badger vaccine, if there was one, would indeed be
quicker and easier to use. I therefore refer back to the noble Lord,
Lord Krebs, and his students and hope that there will be further

that reply. I am sure that we all share the growing alarm at the
evidence of young people using illegal internet pornography sites to
learn about sex and then attempting to replicate it, including using
social media, to put pressure on young girls to act out those roles,
sometimes with absolutely devastating consequences. Obviously, this
needs a cross-departmental approach in, for example, persuading the
internet providers to behave more responsibly. However, does the
Minister accept that the department needs to give more urgent
leadership to schools on this matter? Does he, for example, accept that
sensitive and personal issues around internet safety cannot be taught
effectively in IT classes and that it needs specifically trained
teachers? Does he also accept the need for all young people, from an
early age, to learn about peer pressure and how to resist it, as well
as how to have a positive body image, and to understand what makes a
healthy relationship so that they can avoid exploitation and abuse in
the future?</hs_para>

for the relationship to move on. We have a huge amount of bilateral
interest, including our commitment to regional security. Kenya is, of
course, a vital partner for us on Somalia, providing both 
<?notus-xml column=140?>troops and a home for refugees from Somalia. In terms of development, we
have a relationship that will probably amount to about £143
million this year. Some 20,000 Brits live in Kenya and 200,000 Brits
travel to Kenya. We have a broad relationship and it is important that
we can now focus on

Lords, this Energy Bill comes at a critical time for the country.
Electricity demand is expected to double over the next 40 years, but
around a fifth of the generation capacity that was available to us in
2011 is set to close over the coming decade, because power plants are
either too old or too polluting. At the same time, we 
<?notus-xml column=142?>need to meet our obligations to reduce carbon emissions, as agreed in

2008.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000068">To
achieve both security of supply and decarbonisation, we need to attract
substantial investment in our energy infrastructure, particularly in
low-carbon technology such as renewables, nuclear and low-carbon fossil

Energy Bill will enable us to do this. It is a Bill for growth, and one
that will support as many 250,000 jobs in the energy sector

consumers need. It will help to reduce electricity demand and to
deliver affordable energy for consumers, with fewer, simpler domestic
tariffs. It will ensure that we meet the ambitious climate and
renewable targets set out in the Climate Change Act 2008, enabling the

the main proposals in the following areas. First, on decarbonisation,
we are bound by law to cut emissions across the whole UK economy by 50%

for difference framework will offer long-term contracts for low-carbon
technologies, giving investors confidence, and will enable renewables,
nuclear and carbon capture and storage the chance to compete against
conventional power stations. Importantly, this will be backed by the
tripling in support for clean energy technologies by

know that there are differing views in the setting of a 2030
decarbonisation target range for the power sector, and I would like to
explain the Government’s position. By legislating now to enable
us to set a decarbonisation target in 2016, we will be able to take
into account the level of economy-wide emissions reductions that will
have to be achieved by 2030 under the fifth carbon budget. We want to
ensure that we are considering the pathway of the whole economy towards
our 2050 target, rather than setting a sector-specific target in
isolation, making sure that we minimise costs to both the economy as a
whole and the bill

most ambitious position of any member state. It is therefore important
that we consider the wider European context as well as the level of UK
economy-wide emission reductions to ensure that we do not pre-empt
decision-making and agreements in the EU. However, it is important that

me turn now to the proposals for electricity market reform. Electricity

introduction of provisions for contracts for difference and a capacity

they need. I will therefore spend a little time outlining how these
important mechanisms will operate. First, the contracts for
difference—CFDs—will give long-term electricity price
stability, providing developers and investors with increased revenue
certainty. Generators will receive a fixed price level—or strike
price—for the low-carbon electricity they produce. When the
market reference price is below the strike price, the generator will
receive a top-up payment from suppliers. When it is above the strike
price, the generator must pay back the difference, meaning that
consumers are

single counterparty to these contracts will sign and manage the
contracts over their lifetime and collect money from suppliers to meet
the payments due to generators under the contract. Subject to Royal
Assent, we intend to publish final strike prices for renewable projects
in December 2013 and to issue the first contracts for difference in
2014. I know

also introduces provisions for a capacity market to ensure that there
is sufficient reliable electricity capacity to meet peak demand. This
will provide all capacity providers with an upfront steady
payment to ensure that demand is met. Operators will not be
dependent on volatile revenue from the energy-only market and consumers
will be safe in the knowledge that there is a secure energy supply. At
the Report stage in the Commons, we introduced provisions to enable
electricity demand reduction to be part of the proposed capacity
market, as well as the powers to take forward a pilot. Greater energy

reduction provisions in this Bill will incentivise the industry to
deliver these benefits. Working through the capacity market will allow
energy-saving projects to compete with power stations for new
investment for the very first time. The Bill can incentivise permanent
reductions when demand is at its peak, allowing for a more direct
trade-off between generation capacity and demand reduction. It will
also bring permanent demand-reduction projects into the same mechanism
as shorter-term demand-side response measures to enable more effective,
joined-up delivery.</hs_para>

affordability of energy for many generations to come. Nevertheless, we
are also presented with a significant opportunity to help
Britain’s economic recovery through the creation of jobs and the
delivery of a more stable and predictable energy market, as well as
reinforcing our position as a world leader in tackling climate change.

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for addressing
us today and for introducing the Second Reading of the Energy Bill. I
have been working in climate and energy policy for well over a
decade—at UK and EU level. Energy is a fascinating
subject. Much like the Mandelbrot set, its many layers of
complexity seem completely endless. I keep uncovering whole new areas
of mind-bending detail to get my head around, most recently
in relation to nuclear fusion after an engrossing visit to Culham in
Oxfordshire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000095">I
have studied energy policy in a number of different roles: for an
environmental NGO, for a power company, and as a civil servant. Over
the years, I have come to the firm conclusion that energy policy is an
area where we need the creativity and drive of markets governed 
<?notus-xml column=147?>by careful and well-designed regulation to guide
market forces.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:26:40"></hs_TimeCode> we do not
want is for energy to become a political football, confusing and
destabilising the market. We also do not want civil servants trying to
second-guess what an economically optimised energy system should look
like. Sadly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:27:08"></hs_TimeCode>, we
begin this discussion of the Energy Bill with exactly those two sets of
circumstances dominating—policy is becoming highly politicised
and civil servants are set to start micromanaging almost every
aspect.</hs_para>

is a public spat going on between two different factions of the
coalition Government, between those who believe that climate change is
either not real, or that tackling it is too expensive to be
bothered about, and those who believe that the vast majority of
scientists are correct and that we have a moral duty to do
something urgently to address the problem in ways that boost rather
than damage the economy.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:27:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>
schism is so apparent that our new part-time Energy Minister, Michael
Fallon, in an interview with <I>The House</I> magazine,
refused to answer a simple question about his views on climate change,
dismissing it as “theology”. There is a moral aspect to
climate change and we will hear today from two eminent theologians.
However, I have met many climate scientists, most recently the noted
Oxford academic Myles Allen. Theirs is not a profession of faith or
belief, but the careful study of facts and evidence and the
articulation of future scenarios that accord with those
facts.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061896000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000097">Here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:28:04"></hs_TimeCode>
are a few of them. The concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere, at
around 400 parts per million, are higher than at any other time over
the past 3 million years. Already our world has warmed on average by
0.8 degrees since the 1900s. A global average of this much equates to
far higher levels of warming at the poles. The impacts of these levels,
on, for example, the melting of the arctic sea ice, match the most
pessimistic forecasts. They are happening at the fastest rate that has
been predicted. Land-based temperature recordings, which some may cite
today as evidence that we do not need to act, have levelled off for the
best part of the past decade. However, ocean temperatures have not. The
ocean is likely to dump part of its increased heat out on to land
during the next large El Nino effect, which has occurred
roughly once every decade and which could happen again at any time.
Then land-based temperatures will once again rise.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:29:08"></hs_TimeCode> would be
reckless and arrogant for this Government—or indeed this
Parliament—to ignore the scientific evidence and to try to
change direction in terms of what is one of the over-ridingly important
goals of energy policy today.</hs_para>

solely about climate change; it is a Bill about our energy future. It
is about how we maintain our energy security, now that North Sea oil
and gas, just four decades after their discovery, are now rapidly
declining. It is about the role nuclear power can play in the future
and how confidence in the industry can be restored today. It should
also be, first and foremost, about consumers and helping to ensure that
they are protected through regulation that maximises competition and
transparency in the market.</hs_para>

trilemma of energy policy—how to keep the lights on without
destroying our environment but making sure we can afford it—the
Government 
<?notus-xml column=148?>could do one of two things. They could set clearly
defined outcomes that the market must deliver or attempt to
renationalise energy policy with almost every aspect dictated by
government. Strange though it may sound coming from a Labour Front
Bench, I strongly believe that it is the former we must do and that
this Government are about to do the latter.</hs_para>

is a curious mixture of excessively wide enabling powers that enable
the Secretary of State to do virtually anything he or she wants with
anyone, at any price; or, if he or she so chooses, to do absolutely
nothing. If this were not political enough, there are now some extra
provisions to allow for even more finely grained politicisation.
Targets can be set for particular technologies and for particular
geographic locations. If you do not like wind farms, you can either
ensure that the negotiations on the contracts are so protracted that
they never get signed or, it seems, and to be on the safe side, set
targets determining where they will or will not be accepted.</hs_para>

detail, when the powers to be taken are not enabling, they are
disabling. The Secretary of State must not set a decarbonisation target
until at least 2016, while the energy performance standard levels are
fixed until at least 2044. The mix of sweeping generalisations with
occasional restrictive detail results in an inelegant and potentially
dangerous Bill, for which it is impossible to predict all the
consequences, intended and unintended.</hs_para>

cannot agree on the overall purpose of this Bill, they have been
incapable of presenting clear and concise legislation that can guide
the market. They propose instead to take the reins of almost every
aspect of investment decisions in the coming years. My great fear is
that those seeking to take control are not up to the task. I imagine
that the department is now realising, as I have, that the energy market
is so complex that a single Secretary of State, overseeing a small
department with a small number of civil servants, who are necessarily
divorced from the real world, cannot and should not be deciding who
builds what, when and on what terms—even if they enjoy the
oversight of the great minds of the Treasury. The question I am sure
that your Lordships are all formulating is: if this is the case, what
would Labour do differently?</hs_para>

unequivocal about the fact that, in keeping with the advice of the
Committee on Climate Change, we would seek to decarbonise the
electricity generation sector within the next two decades. We would set
clear targets to achieve that outcome—targets that we know have
the support of industry and civil society. Such targets need not
dictate precisely how this outcome is achieved but give the market
confidence that this is the path we are on and that we intend to stick
to it. Secondly, to keep prices affordable, we would legislate to
require greater liquidity and competition in electricity generation and
create a new energy regulator with real teeth. Thirdly, to keep the
lights on, we would focus on providing incentives to encourage more
active participation in the management of demand, reducing peak demand
and helping to soak up excess electricity in times of high supply. If
necessary, we would also take powers to enable interventions that
support National Grid in managing supply and demand.</hs_para>

have done; it is not what the Government are doing. This is
primarily because the impetus for this Bill was not to solve the energy
trilemma. It was to provide EDF Energy with what it believed it needed
in order to build Hinkley Point power station. Having decided on that
outcome, the department has now had to concoct ever more complex layers
of interventions to try to square the reality of the privatised market
and state aid rules. A new reactor at Hinkley, if it can be delivered
at reasonable cost, is a good idea. I am not disputing that. I am,
however, deeply concerned about the contortions and complexities we are
now having to add to an already complicated market in order to lure one
company into building one project—a project that will not be
ready until the middle of the next decade and that cannot help to
address any security of supply concerns in the interim.</hs_para>

would not be starting from here, but here we are and we must make the
best of it. During the Commons stages we raised other important issues
that we will continue to press in this House, such as the need to
ensure adequate competition in the generation market so that
independent generators can gain access. I was encouraged to hear the
words of the noble Baroness today in that respect. We need to encourage
community ownership of energy projects, which I am again very grateful
for having received mention today. We also need much clearer regulation
of existing fossil fuel stations, giving clarity about their closure
schedule to spur investment in carbon capture and storage.</hs_para>

irony<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:34:58"></hs_TimeCode> is that
this Energy Bill has helped to exacerbate the investment hiatus that
the Government have created and that they should have been
seeking to address. If, in the future, the Government will be
paying everyone to build or operate plant then no company can risk
moving ahead with plans until the details of these payments are clear.
As a result, investment in our energy infrastructure has plummeted
under this Government. This cannot be allowed to continue and Royal
Assent must be achieved by the end of this year.</hs_para>

signing into law something that creates stability in the market, so
that we can stop the almost yearly cycle of energy Bills appearing

challenges now inherent in providing us with energy.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:35:39"></hs_TimeCode> we come to
consider this Bill in Committee, some of the much sought-after detail
should emerge from the department and we will be in a much better place
to try to assess the impact of its many provisions in totality. The
draft delivery plan, for instance, which is due to be published in
mid-July, will include more details of strike prices for renewables,
though regrettably not for nuclear or CCS, and much needed information
about the Treasury’s levy control framework which
will interact with provisions in the Bill in a very important way. It
may sound like a lot of money but unless anyone wants to invest it will
merely be a promissory note that actually may restrict investment in
certain sectors and
technologies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000108">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:36:19"></hs_TimeCode>
hope the Minister will agree that the more detail we have in front of
us the better placed we will be to provide proper input. Can she give
us an assurance that the department will release further information in

<?notus-xml column=150?>good time so that it will inform our discussions? I am hopeful that we
might be able to agree to consider relevant clauses in the Bill at the
end of Committee stage rather than at the beginning. This will enable
us to consider those clauses with the information in the draft delivery
plan in front of
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>. This puts a
lot of emphasis on to the department issuing its information before the
Commons rises on 18 July. I hope that that will be in the public domain
before 18 July.</hs_para>

not like in the Bill, things we would have done differently, and things
we would like to have seen given a higher priority; but we are not
opposed to the broad objectives. Although lots of the detail is still
missing, we are committed to restarting and increasing investment in
low-carbon generation and, on those grounds, we do not seek to oppose
the Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000110">We

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister
for all the work that she, together with the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh,
has undertaken in preparing us for the moment when the Bill finally
arrives in this House, and for all the teach-ins and the work that we
have had to get here. One of the things that strikes me most is how
great it is that this Bill has arrived. It was December 2010 when the
original consultation paper on electricity market reform was published.
Over the two and a half years since then, queues of industry suppliers,
generators, NGOs and trade associations have tried to bend the ears of
a large number of Members of the House to give us their views on this
very complex legislation. We are here, and we can start this process in
the
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000112">The
reasons why this Bill is here are important, and they are important to
go through. They include the future capacity to generate electricity
for our economy and our homes and the security of supply, which is made
more difficult by our own resources running out within our own
geographical area. They also include keeping down costs. So often you
hear about the subsidies for green energy adding to costs, yet we know
that over the years 2004-12 the price of gas for households doubled
from £400 to £800, and that was a sector that had no levy
control framework. Electricity also went up by a huge amount, although
by much less than gas, because of fossil fuels.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=151?><hs_para UID="13061896000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000113">It
is very difficult to see the future, but I am certain that with
renewable energy, and in the longer term maybe even with new nuclear,
with its low marginal fuel costs—zero, in fact, for wind and
solar—we will ensure that our prices are far less dependent on
unpredictable and expensive fossil fuels in future. The Department of
Energy and Climate Change suggests that by 2020 energy prices will be
just under £100 less than they would have been afterwards. To
me, given the past performance of energy prices, that is absolutely
credible because it is based on historical evidence. That is important
for us to understand.</hs_para>

Bill is climate change. I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, on her description and her attack in that area. She is
right that a major part of the Bill is to ensure that our electricity
supply industry is not dependent on unabated fossil fuels into the
distant future. It is of great concern to me that it is often not
realised more broadly that coal now produces 42% of our energy
generation. Once again it has replaced gas as the major fuel for
electricity generation, yet it is a fuel that produces something like
double the carbon emissions for every unit of energy than the cleanest
gas generation. We have gone through the limit of 400 parts per million
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and, as the noble Baroness well
described, we still have all the symptoms of climate change, whether
that be rising ocean levels at 3 millimetres a year, shrinking icecaps
or retreating glaciers—not all of them, but the vast
majority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:42:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

debates that there will be on decarbonisation and decarbonisation
targets. I welcome the fact that there is provision in the Bill for a
decarbonisation target. That was not there in the original
draft Bill; it has been added. As for whether the year should be 2014
or 2016, maybe we are moving towards theology

are repeatedly mentioned to me are the risk of investment in
the industry and future generating capacity. We know that the whole
industry will look for less and less risk, and indeed those who provide
finance will do the same in order to protect their investments, so,
whatever they are given, I am sure they will ask for more. I spent a
lot of years in the private sector, so I can ask what other industry is
given a guaranteed price, index-linked, over several decades. No other
industry gets anything like that—it would be heaven on earth for
most industrialists—yet that is what we are offering electricity
generators as part of the Bill. Frankly, you can start to become a
little too greedy about the risk that you want to reduce if you go
beyond that

agreements in that area. I see a tension within the Government.
We have a £7.6 billion levy control framework
commitment. That is a great win. It is substantial and it will ensure
that in practice a low-carbon economy and a low-carbon network can
actually be delivered.</hs_para>

feel that there are certain things in this Bill that still need to be
done. I am sure that the Minister will agree with me on the vast
majority of these. As for demand management, I suspect that this Bill
was originally drafted by DECC officials who love shiny new power
plants that impress their friends, look good when built and are great
for press releases. However, 
<?notus-xml column=152?>we do not have such a demand. The UK electricity industry operates, on
average, at 50% utilisation of capacity. To me, that is not good
enough. We need to look at the demand side as well as the supply. I
very much welcome the Secretary of State bringing forward demand-side
factors into the capacity market, and hopefully beyond that broader
demand reduction. I know that we will flesh out some of those
opportunities in Committee. I welcome the Government’s very
strong move in that
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:45:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000119">On
emission performance standards, I am not quite so confident about the
long-term nature of grandfather rights. I also question, and want to
explore in Committee, whether there is still opportunity for coal to
continue long term as a generating source of electricity under the Bill
in its current state. Coal is so much cheaper at the moment, largely
because of changes in the United States, along with other factors, that
it may still be commercially possible to generate long term by paying
the carbon floor price and re-engineering plants so that they are able
to stop their sulphur emissions. I am not sure whether that is possible
in this Bill as it stands, but I want to make sure that it is not. We
need to take coal out of the generating

am sure Members from all around the House will be particularly
concerned about, is the route to market for smaller producers. If there
is one thing about the energy market that is similar to banking, it is
its oligopolistic nature. That is what makes some of the strike price
negotiations difficult. We need to ensure that the smaller producers,
and indeed the smaller suppliers, within the market are able to have
much greater access to a greater share of that pie. It is through that
competition that we will ensure that price increases are far less than

are no new power stations being built? Everyone has known for a long

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:49:36"></hs_TimeCode> main aim of
EMR is to use market mechanisms to achieve a secure, decarbonised
electricity supply at the lowest possible cost. That might have been
possible if this Bill had been presented two or three years ago. Then
there would have been time for the contracts for difference and the
capacity payments—central elements of the new market—to
be thoroughly considered and properly auctioned. Today, Ministers make
decisions by administrative means when they should have been the
outcome of strategically planned competitions. These fundamental
infrastructure decisions will determine how we generate electricity for
decades to come and how much we pay for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:50:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
Nevertheless, recognising our present vulnerability, Ministers must
move as fast as possible to seek bids for contracts to guarantee
generating capacity. If they act rapidly, there should be just enough
time to bring in new capacity for when it is needed.</hs_para>

kind of electricity generation do we need? In this debate we shall
certainly hear from proponents and opponents of different technologies,
as if they alone could satisfy our requirements. There will be wind
enthusiasts and wind-haters, and nuclear enthusiasts and
nuclear-haters. In reality, every means of generation has its own cost
structure and its own operational limitations that have to be taken
into account in building a generation
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000127">For
example, most of the cost for both nuclear and wind is fixed up front
at the time of construction. Their costs of generation should therefore
change little over time and they should offer something of a hedge
against inflation. Both have low carbon footprints. However, the
weakness of both is in their operational inflexibility. Nuclear is not
able to ramp up and down fast enough to match the daily variation in
demand, and wind is completely insensitive to demand. This is
not fatal for either; it simply means that if they are used they have
to be part of a system that takes advantage of their strengths and
compensates for their weaknesses. By comparison, fossil fuel is
dispatchable—it can be turned up or down relatively quickly to
meet changes in demand. On the other hand, it is both exposed to the
vagaries of international fuel prices and, unless abated by carbon
capture and storage, carries a substantial carbon penalty. Other key
elements of energy systems have their own costs and
limitations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000128">The
requirements of our system can be met in many ways with different
technology combinations. However, the addition or removal of one
component has consequences for all the others and for the system as a
whole, including for transmission. A workable system will have a number
of complementary elements that play different roles, add to its
robustness through their diversity and have different implications for
cost. With the powers that it is assuming in the Bill, central
government takes full responsibility for the shape of our system. This
is not necessarily bad, but we should certainly recognise that it is
happening. The Government’s decisions over what CFDs and CPs to
offer will determine 
<?notus-xml column=154?>whether we achieve an affordable and workable system that also meets its
stated policy objectives. It is very easy to get this
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000129">What,
therefore, needs to be done in this House? I emphasised at the outset
that the highest priority must be to secure investment in new plant.
Investors have choice over not only what kinds of project they invest
in but in which country to do so. The Government’s stated
strategy is to achieve a massive decarbonisation of UK electricity
generation. In the short term, this is not the path of lowest cost.
Given the long-term nature of energy investments, investors have to be
confident that the Government will stick to this path and continue to
reward low carbon in the future. For these reasons, the
Government’s vigorous opposition to the cross-party amendment
tabled in the other place, which would have included a reference to the
2030 emissions reduction target of the climate change committee, was
particularly unhelpful. It has certainly been read externally as a
weakening of government resolve. To make our energy system investable,
we have to consider the reintroduction of that amendment in this
House.</hs_para>

to scrutinise the details of the CFDs and CPs, some of which have not
yet been fully worked out. Consideration of the Bill in the other place
had to be completed without this detail. The workings of the present
electricity system are complex and in some respects less than
transparent. We are promised more of this detail during the passage of
the Bill through the House and this will need to be discussed as it
becomes known. In parallel—as has been pointed out—there
are important proposals from Ofgem for changes in regulating the
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000131">There
are two important elements of any energy system on which the Bill is
silent and which will have to be considered alongside the generation
mix: namely, the interconnectors through which we can import and export
electricity to our neighbours, which is always a possibility if we
cannot generate ourselves; and secondly, our national provision for gas
storage. This House has discussed gas storage on a number of occasions
in the past, primarily in the context of security of supply in the face
of declining North Sea production. We have noted that while our
domestic gas storage is measured in days, our neighbours measure theirs
in months. This concern has been alleviated—but only
somewhat—by the construction of UK terminals to receive
liquefied natural gas bought on the international
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000132">Today,
however, storage can help UK consumers in another way. Storage would
make it possible to buy gas in summer when prices are low and use it in
winter when prices rise. This is a benefit primarily to consumers
rather than suppliers. Suppliers simply pass on increased gas costs to
the consumer, who has no choice but to pay them. The Government should
carefully consider whether this potential consumer benefit can be
captured, possibly by offering a capacity payment for gas supply at a
guaranteed price and guaranteed
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000133">Finally,
we also need to consider whether in future we can avoid the acute
energy difficulties in which we now find ourselves. These are entirely
attributable to successive Governments’ culpable neglect of
energy and the absence of any overarching strategic energy
policy. 
<?notus-xml column=155?>Energy capability and competence within the Civil
Service was over the years run down. The responsibility for energy was
shuffled between government departments, and folk memory and experience

we get the very important matter of electricity reform to deliver a
decarbonised source of energy for us? We cannot do all the things that
we need to do to meet our statutory requirement of reducing our
emissions by 80% by 2050 if we are not able, for example, to use
electricity in a pure and clean form for motorcars and the like.
Therefore, electricity decarbonisation is an essential part of what we
are doing and the Bill paves the way for that. It does so by giving
sufficient security to private investors to invest, but I warn the
House that many other people are seeking to do the same.</hs_para>

International, of which I am president, recently produced an
independent report with the London School of Economics showing that
more than 33 countries are dealing with this issue, some of them more
extremely and better than we are doing. China, for example, has made a
huge investment in making itself increasingly the centre of renewable
energy. Mexico, South Africa and Korea are other examples. All around
the world people are encouraging others to invest in order that they
may achieve those ends. Therefore, if we want investment here, we have
to recognise that we are in a competitive market. I say to my noble

say to my noble friend that the very sensible proposal of the Committee
on Climate Change that we should have a carbon intensity target for
2030 is essential not for climate change but so that we get the
investment for Britain plc. If we want to show people that there is a
continuum of support, that it will not drop over the precipice in 2020
and then arrive again in 2050, we have to have some kind of assurance.
The beauty of the assurance that we have suggested is that it is not
prescriptive. It does not say how we should do it; it merely
says  
<?notus-xml column=159?>that there will be a clear indication that we want decarbonisation of
electricity and that the carbon intensity target that we set will have
to be reached by whatever means we wish. It might be achieved by
advancing CCS, by having more nuclear or by producing more offshore or
onshore wind, but we know where we are trying to do it, and we know
that we are doing it so that all of us in this country can see the

background, I suggest that there is another issue which the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of London did not refer to but which I know
is close to his heart. We are arguing this case in a world that will
have 9 billion people. The idea that we will have cheap energy with the
pressures of 1.5 billion more middle-class people demanding the sort of
lives that we live, or the idea that there is some mysterious and
magical world around the corner with cheap gas, seems beyond any sane
measurement. Of course we have to use our fracked gas, of course we
have to make sure that we use what resources we have, and of course we
need carbon capture and storage to make that gas as low in its
emissions as possible. At the same time as paying this very small
amount to give us insurance against climate change, exactly those same
efforts are giving us insurance against ever-higher gas prices. After
all, the International Energy Agency has made it clear that gas prices
are likely to rise—to double in the United States—over
the next 10 years.</hs_para>

I will finish on that point. I do not want my children to be in the

create our own energy here, we are not only protecting ourselves
against climate change and taking insurance against high gas prices but
ensuring that, by having a portfolio of energy resources, we in this
country control this crucial element in our future. I therefore
congratulate the Government on bringing the Bill forward. It needs one
or two tweaks, and I shall be pressing for those tweaks—and I
know that many will join me. It is the first time that we have had so
far-reaching and far-looking a Bill before this House on a subject that

Roper:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a particular pleasure to follow my
noble friend Lord Deben, who is a very effective advocate for this
Bill, even if the levy-controlled framework is, I think, a little more
complex than he described. Given the complexities and the length of 
<?notus-xml column=160?>this Bill, I have begun to regret that just over a year ago, when I
ceased to be chairman of the European Union Committee and I decided to
take up a new subject from scratch, I chose energy. Given what we have
come to, I think it may have been a problem, but I am extremely
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and to the DECC officials,
who, in the informal group that has met on the draft Bill and more
recently on this Bill, provided particularly useful tutorials in
helping me to understand a pretty complex subject. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Worthington, said, each time one thinks one understands
it, one discovers yet another twist to the
complexity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000159">Before
giving this Bill a Second Reading, we have to agree that there is a
need to decarbonise our electricity industry and, if that is the case,
whether the principal elements of the electricity market reform set out
in Part 2, the contracts for difference, strike prices and the capacity
mechanism, are the right way to achieve such reform. On the first
issue, over the past year, I have tried to follow the debate on global
warming. Indeed, there are those who argue against it, sometimes
—we may well hear them later—fairly effectively. But
although there are significant arguments against the scientific
consensus, I have reached the judgment that in applying the
precautionary principle there is no case at all to resile from the
commitments which this country took under the Climate Change Act
2008<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:20:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Deben, the argument is also developed that our
efforts are of little relevance given the absence of comparable actions
elsewhere in the world, with the statistic of three coal-based stations
being built a week in China perhaps being most frequently cited. In
fact, as we have heard this week—indeed, he referred to the work
done on climate change in China—China is rolling out an emission
trading system starting in Shenzhen and then extending elsewhere in the
country. It has been carrying out a significant programme of work on
carbon capture and storage which compares favourably with what we have
done in this country. Therefore, the argument that there is no point in
doing anything because things will go wrong elsewhere does not seem to
hold very much
strength<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000161">Given
the case to move to a low-carbon generating technology and to encourage
the necessary investment, what are the policy instruments which can do
that most effectively? Sitting on these Benches and having been taught

carefully at any attempt to intervene in markets. That often causes
more harm than good. I was very glad therefore that my noble friend the
Minister in her opening remarks was able to assure us that the
contracts for difference and strike prices are transitory measures,
particularly that they will be set on an administered basis for this
transitional
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>. My noble

very useful impact assessment published with the Bill shows that the
market failures and imperfections justify the proposals for electricity
market reform in Part 2. Contracts for difference are the means of
providing revenue certainty for low-carbon generators and thereby the
incentive for investment in nuclear and renewable generators. They
would enable development of such projects to obtain the finance for
their investments and the impact assessment shows a significant net
present value. As we have heard, the capacity market is the mechanism
for ensuring security of supply and although the impact assessment in
this case shows that there could be small net costs compared with a
perfectly functioning energy market, it is very difficult to accept
that we have a perfectly operating energy market. It seems a rather
useful insurance mechanism to avoid loss of

question of the nature of the energy market is, as we have already
heard, central to our consideration of the Bill. There has been much
discussion on the illiquidity of the market, and Ofgem’s
announcement last week is therefore of great importance. We shall need
to consider it when we come to consider Chapter 6 of Part 2 of the
Bill. The asymmetry of the market between the larger generators and
suppliers and the smaller ones have led to many reports of illiquidity
and difficulties for small developers of renewable projects in
accessing the market. In the Commons, consideration was given to a
green power auction market. This was resisted by the Government. Others
have suggested an off-taker of last resort. It will be essential for us
to return to this in Committee as energy market reform will not succeed
unless we provide a satisfactory route to market for independent
generators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000164">There
have been difficulties in the recent past for such generators to get
satisfactory power purchase agreements with large suppliers, and the
nature of PPAs will themselves change with the introduction of
contracts for difference. How do the Government intend to ensure a
satisfactory development of PPAs after EMR? As my noble friend Lord
Teverson and the right reverend Prelate said, Clause 37 is extremely
important. It is the amendment which was introduced on Report in the
Commons to deal with demand management. Although the reference is to a
pilot scheme, I think that if I remember rightly, in moving the report,
the Minister referred to several options within this pilot, so perhaps
it is not quite as narrow as was suggested by the right reverend
Prelate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000165">I
also find some confusion, probably it is my ignorance, between

the fact that Part 1 gives the Secretary of State a power to set a
decarbonisation target range for 2030 and implicitly prevents him from
setting it before 2016. As we have already heard, there will no doubt
be discussion in Committee on the date. However, I hope that as well as
the date, it will be possible to consider whether the Bill should be
amended to require him to set a target rather than to give him the
power to set a target, which is an important distinction.</hs_para>

There will be a huge worldwide market for CCS if we can create a safe
and reliable system. I sympathise with the Government over
decarbonisation targets. There is a lot of uncertainty about where our
power sector could go over the next 15 to 20 years. Will we have a
shale gas revolution? Will nuclear become too expensive to replace?
Will the only practical source of power be gas and will CCS fail? Will
the gas lock-in, which I spoke about, become an accepted feature of our
energy landscape? Can we burn cheap coal-bed methane or will algae be
the solution to the world’s energy problems? Will the economy
soar and increase demand, or will it plummet and make cheap electricity
the overriding need? It is hard to know which will be the safest road.

are tempted to hold back their billions until they see which way the

UK? What is going to happen to the levy control framework after 2020?
It is all very well the Government relying on the Climate Change Act,
but that is about general targets across the board. What
sector-specific commitments are the Government giving within the
electricity industry? Why should investors commit their money if
politicians cannot commit their and their successors’
reputations? In my view, the Government should provide certainty to
investors. The target need not be as low as 50 grammes per
kilowatt-hour, but a target is needed. Then the investment that follows
will, in my view, bring down the cost of power, boost our employment
and economy, and raise the certainty and security of power, which is

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, like other noble Lords who have
spoken, I begin by declaring an interest. It is a non-remunerated and
non-pecuniary interest, unlike some noble Lords’ interests. It
is the chairmanship of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. While I am
about interests, perhaps I should declare two past interests, which I
think are slightly more relevant to this debate: one which was
remunerated, not particularly well, Secretary of State for Energy, and
the other, president for a very long time—indeed I am the
immediate past president—of the British Institute of Energy
Economics. I have been tilling this soil for quite a long time. I am
glad to say that next to me here is my successor as president, my noble
friend Lord Howell, who was my predecessor as Secretary of State for
Energy. Unfortunately, his other commitments prevent him from speaking
in this Second Reading debate but I hope he will bring his great wisdom

friend the Minister in the slightest for the fact that this is the
worst Energy Bill in living memory and, indeed, probably the worst Bill
of any kind that the present Government have brought forward. That may
to some extent explain why it is so 
<?notus-xml column=165?>enthusiastically welcomed by the party opposite. It has, as the Minister
made clear, one purpose and one purpose only: to reach the very
demanding—that is an understatement—and radical
decarbonisation targets in the Climate Change Act, which, as she
rightly said, is something on which no other country has embarked. She
seemed to think that was a good thing. In my opinion, it is just
because no other country is so stupid.</hs_para>

particular characteristic. It has been characterised by our leading
energy economist, Professor Dieter Helm of Oxford, as the Gosplan
approach—his word, not mine. The noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, had a similar critique of this Bill. It is a curious,
arbitrary form of nationalisation with much greater discretion for
Ministers and officials than any of the old-fashioned nationalisations.
The noble Baroness developed a powerful critique. It was probably the
only aspect of her speech with which I agreed, but nevertheless she
made a very important point. The other claims for the Bill are, of
course,
poppycock<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:40:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000187">As
my noble friend Lord Teverson pointed out, this is not a new Bill. It
was first published in draft in 2010, and in gestation, it inevitably
goes back beyond that. Since then, absolutely everything of importance
in the energy field has changed. Incidentally, we need to distinguish
between the climate change issue and the energy issue. For example,
Professor Helm, to whom I referred and who I have known for many years,
is, on the climate change issue, at the alarmist end of the spectrum,
yet he has produced the most devastating critique of the Bill because
he is, among other things, unlike some noble Lords who have spoken, a
highly competent
economist<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:41:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000188">Anyhow,
since the Bill first came forward, everything of significance on the
energy scene has changed. On climate change, too, it is now agreed even
by the Met Office that there has been no further recorded global
warming for the past 16 years or so. That has led to a great debate
among scientists as to whether, as seems likely, they exaggerated in
the past what is known in the jargon as the climate sensitivity of
carbon. There is an emerging consensus among scientists that
the climate sensitivity of carbon is probably less than they thought.
That means, importantly, that any dangers from warming, if they occur,
are postponed well into the next century. It means that there is no
urgency to go ahead in this way, not only because the uncertainties are
in the distant future but because we have no idea what technologies
will develop over the next 100 years. All we know is that there will be
technological development, because there always has been and always
will
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000189">Again, the
Kyoto agreement has collapsed with no successor. The whole of the Bill
was predicated on the idea of a global agreement, but we now know that
there is no global agreement and that there will not be a global
agreement on mandatory carbon emission controls. In the European Union,
which is the closest to us in going in this direction—although
it has no Climate Change Act as it is not so stupid—the
renewables industry is in meltdown. Over the past five years, the share
price of the renewables companies has fallen  
<?notus-xml column=166?>by at least 80%. The countries concerned are busy withdrawing their
subsidies and one renewable company after another is going
bankrupt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000190">The
final thing, to which allusion has already been made and which is
probably the most important, is the shale gas revolution. The
development of fracking, as many noble Lords know, means that it is now
possible economically to win gas from shale on a massive scale. Indeed,
the United States, which was first in the field, is already doing it
for oil as well. It is getting oil from shale. That has transformed the
picture economically. The price of gas has collapsed in the United
States, the price of coal has collapsed in accordance and
even the oil price is looking a bit shaky. That also has an
important geopolitical consequence as shale is in abundance throughout
the world. In this country, we have large deposits in the north-west,
in Lancashire—in the Blackpool region—and in other
places. That means that we no longer need to have any fear of being
beholden either to an unstable Middle East or to an unreliable Mr
Putin. There is an abundance of fossil fuels throughout the world.
Everything has changed. We have an abundant supply and a prospect of
lower prices. As other speakers have said, on the old forecasts it was
thought that prices of fossil fuels were likely to increase. Even the
International Energy Agency now thinks—although obviously it is
all very uncertain—that they are just as likely to fall as they
are to rise in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:45:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Yet
despite these revolutionary changes, the Government’s policy and
the Bill itself are completely unchanged from when they first came
forward. They are ploughing on as if nothing had happened, despite the
fact that the whole energy scene has totally

understanding contained in this Bill because it 
<?notus-xml column=168?>is of considerable complexity, and within that
complexity there is the opportunity for a considerable mistake.
However, the Bill is needed, although it may not be in the right shape.
Also like the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, I am concerned about the lack of
impact on fuel poverty, which I will come back to in my section on
demand reduction. I am not going to say much about decarbonisation, but
when you put those issues alongside the decommissioning of existing

we need more detail on the setting of the strike prices and the need
for secondary legislation to support the Bill. We have a considerable
difficulty here around uncertainty. If I may give just one example,
Ernst &amp; Young has recently done some research on the international

challenge for the scientists and engineers who, for as long as I have

talking about the Office for Nuclear Regulation, but in a situation
where EDF is in a monopoly position in negotiations with the
Government, where are these discussions? What conclusions will we come
to? The Committee on Climate Change has said that at least 16 gigawatts
of future supply should come from nuclear, but it is difficult to see
how that is going to come on stream in time to impact on the
insecurity of supply that we have to deal with.</hs_para>

best ways of ensuring a robust energy market is to ensure energy
efficiency. I ask the Minister to answer this in her summing up: if I

a damp council house with inadequate insulation, possibly a
post-war house with no upgrading since, how will that affect my fuel

realised that if a home was properly insulated it cost a fraction of

I was teaching English at the time to old-age pensioners, that they did
not die in the winter because they were living in cold and damp homes,
and that there was no such thing as fuel poverty. Shortly after that we
had the world oil crisis, which brought home to me the need to not be
wasteful with our global natural resources. Whatever we believe about

of.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061896000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000211">In the

trying to introduce recycling in the city. At one point, three
colleagues and I held the balance of power on the council and we
managed to set up an environment committee. Not everyone at that time
was a dinosaur and one of the colleagues that I worked with—we
worked across party lines—was the honourable Member for
Southampton Test, Alan Whitehead, who has played quite an important
part in this Bill’s passage in another place. At that time we
managed, using some geothermal energy, to set up a district heating

wild dream that Liberals would be in government and that we might see a
Liberal Minister leading a Bill of this nature. So I am particularly

Davey, has been spearheading this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000214">Given
my background, I think that it is not surprising that the two things
that I have chosen to concentrate on in this Bill are electricity
demand reduction and help for consumers, particularly with fuel
poverty. Several other noble Lords have mentioned electricity demand
reduction. A major criticism of the Bill has been that, in its original
form, it did not contain measures on electricity demand reduction.
During the passage of the Bill in another place, the Government
introduced amendments, which have been spoken about, to enable
electricity demand reform to form part of the capacity market and for
there to be pilot schemes. However, among many of
those—including me—who are pleased to see this step,
there are concerns about how capacity market measures will operate and
whether they will actually achieve substantial reduction in demand,
particularly permanent reduction. There are also concerns about the
nature of “a pilot”, rather than several pilots, and what
actions might follow as a result of such
pilots<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:07:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000215">Following
the initial criticisms, there was a consultation from DECC to explore
the options to encourage electricity demand reduction. Of the options
put forward, a majority of respondents favoured a system of
electricity-efficiency premium payments which would provide electricity
users with a payment on top of the savings that result from reduced
electricity usage. I strongly support something of this nature. During
the time that I lived in Stockholm in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
most of the electricity used in Sweden was hydroelectricity. However,
they had had two or three very dry summers and there was a shortage of
electricity. There was a huge campaign about how to save electricity
and measures were advertised, from how many times 
<?notus-xml column=172?>you should open your fridge to persuading you and those you lived with
to sit around one light when you were in your flat in the evening. It
resulted in huge savings of electricity. There were no blackouts. The
area that saved the most got their bills reduced. So there is evidence
that this is something that
works<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:09:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000216">As
to the role of the capacity markets, there is evidence that a capacity
market is of limited use in rewarding energy savings—I believe
that experiences in America have shown that to be the case. Payments
from capacity markets are uncertain and it is not yet clear when or if
a capacity auction will be triggered here. Could the Minister, when she
replies to this debate, address this issue? As energy efficiency and
demand reduction reduce the risk of capacity shortage, it is rather
perverse to make support for them dependent on those shortages
occurring. I hope that we will address this during the passage of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:09:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000217">Capacity
markets are not suitable for delivering energy saving for households or
small businesses. The complex design of the capacity market means that
only large energy suppliers and other specialist companies are likely
to participate. It is vital that we have mechanisms to capture savings

electricity-saving potential that the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:10:25"></hs_TimeCode> have
identified. A capacity market is primarily designed to ensure capacity
during troughs in supply, so it rewards energy efficiency for only its

<?notus-xml column=173?>breath. I am always shocked by the way in which they
try to follow whatever they have been asked to do. They recently began
to try to explain to customers, partly because it is in the Bill, how
much electricity and gas the customers have been using and how much
they can save on one tariff. I usually pay my bill by cheque when it
comes. I received a bill—I will not mention from which
company—which said on the front that if I paid it by
direct debit, I could save X amount of money. On the next page it told
me that if I paid it by direct debit I would save 10p. On the front of
the bill the figure was several hundred pounds. That does not give me

also consult the current president of the Royal Society, Sir Paul
Nurse, and Sir Brian Hoskins of Imperial College, who leads for the
Royal Society on climate change. If any noble Lords have new results
that can overturn 200 years of research, dating from the great French
mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier in the 1820s, and can
contradict the 98% of peer-reviewed papers that identify
anthropomorphic climate change, they should immediately publish them in

serious science. Taking the long-term view, the world is warming and
the only plausible explanation is human activity. We cannot predict the

risks are more severe and will come earlier to the poorest among us,
but we all face them, whichever country we live in and however well-off
we are. Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, has just claimed,
the broad estimates of climate sensitivity are fairly stable. If he
wants a discussion about those estimates, I again refer him to those
who know about these issues and study them professionally. I have
discussed them intensively with Professor Myles Allen, of Oxford
University, who has already been referred to, with Sir Brian
Hoskins, whom I mentioned and leads on climate for the Royal Society,
or with Julia Slingo, the chief scientist at the Met Office. We are all
confident that the IPPC report, looking across the whole waterfront of
the evidence and reporting this autumn, will say exactly
that—the estimates of climate sensitivity are broadly
stable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000228">Let me
turn to where other countries are going. It is all too easy to say that
we are small—accounting for perhaps 2% of global
emissions—and to claim that other countries are doing little.
That is not correct. I have worked on China as a professional economist
and as chief economist to the World Bank for more than 25 years,
including intense discussion over the recent 12th five-year plan. China
is midway through that plan, which contains strong emissions reduction
programmes. Its carbon intensity reduction target to 2020,
relative to 2005, is 45%—considerably more ambitious than our
own 30%. China is ranked third on the Climate Institute’s
low-carbon index. China plans to peak coal use during this plan
period—that is, within three years—and is considering
peaking annual emissions by
2025.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061896000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0001.htm#13061896000229">Why is
China doing this? I certainly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
that it is not because it studied the United Kingdom with great
precision. It is doing it because it understands the grave risks of
climate change and because it realises that there is a green race,
which it intends to win, or at least compete in very strongly. That is
the kind of race that we should seek. The US is now reducing emissions
rapidly and energy-related CO2 emissions are back to the levels of the
mid-1990s—achieved by a combination of substituting gas for coal
and regulatory standards. They could meet their 17% 2005 to 2020
reduction targets without national legislation. Brazil is targeting 40%

about costs to consumers? Energy bills have increased by around
£400 for the typical household since 2004, from £600 to
roughly £1,000. Of this increase, 80% was unrelated to carbon
policies and was due largely to the increased price of gas, together
with some increase due to investment in networks. Much of the remaining
20% was associated with investment in energy efficiency, which will
bring its returns. In future, low-carbon policies aimed at supporting
investment in clean power generation technologies will add £100
to the energy bill per annum of the typical household by
2020—around a 10% increase. There are opportunities to more than
off-set this through energy efficiency improvements, particularly
through more efficient boilers and appliances. The low-carbon policies

naive faith in market ideology has been allowed all too much to blind
us to common sense. Muscular, tough, pinpointed accountability is not
always there. We of course recognise that to leave the management of
such a fundamental necessity for society as energy to market
forces alone would be unforgivable irresponsibility. We therefore have
before us a scheme devised by very clever and dedicated experts which
is intended to guide, restrain and police the market. However, I
suggest that it is a scheme which is prepared within the context of
market fatalism and which, as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
London said, is beyond the comprehension of all but a small number of
mandarins, politicians and academics—a scheme which has already

achieved by this, especially for households and small businesses.
Taking into account the experience of the US, where only a tiny
percentage of capacity payments have in practice gone to demand
reduction projects while the overwhelming majority have gone to fossil
fuel generation, there is clearly a lot of hard work still to be done

need to be confident that there will be a minimum level of delivered
energy savings. It would be tragic to miss a great opportunity of being
among the world leaders in engineering and manufacturing capacity on
all this. There are the dangers of a dash for gas and the need to

it seems to me that to have phased targets would be a benefit. There
has been debate about even the 2030 target, but that is many years
away. Given our five-year electoral cycles, I would have more
confidence that we would address seriously the 2030 target, let alone
the 2050 target, if we were to give ourselves graded and stepwise
targets along the way, and certainly a requirement that there be at
least a 2030

the focus on decarbonisation, I am surprised that there is not more
emphasis in the Bill on nuclear. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, has just
referred to it in relation to waste products and some of the
risks—I will say something about those in a moment. It saddens
me that the newly suggested body, the Office for Nuclear Regulation, is
to be given tasks focusing only on safety and security. Those are, of
course, crucial, and nobody questions that. However, it leaves aside
many of the other dimensions of the nuclear option that I think we so
greatly need. We need, not least, more money for research and
development, and we need government investment. There has been a great
deal of talk from other noble Lords who know far more about the
economics than me, and about the way in which a decarbonisation target
would itself help to lever in private investment. If we are to have
investment in nuclear energy, with further middle and longer-term
aspirations, it seems that without a government commitment, private
money is less likely to
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:45:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is worth reflecting, perhaps, when we consider nuclear energy in
relation to our decarbonisation targets, that to produce 1 gigawatt of
electricity, which would power a city of about 1 million people, would
take 3.2 million tonnes of coal, which itself would produce
8.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide—to say nothing of 900,000
cubic feet of toxic waste. Noble Lords will not be surprised to hear
that, by contrast, those 3.2 million tonnes of carbon could
be produced by 200 tonnes of uranium or 1 tonne of thorium. The green
arithmetic is not too difficult for us to understand. That alone,
notwithstanding what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, should surely
justify putting more money into our nuclear

fission research and development received about £450 million a
year. The figure reduced a bit in 1980, and I believe that the current
levels of investment are only 7% or 8% of the 1980 levels, let alone
the 1975 heyday. Sir John Beddington, until recently, as Members of the
House will be all too well aware, our government Chief Scientific
Adviser, said that he could not see a future for UK energy without
nuclear energy. It is currently producing about 18% of our energy
needs, and he anticipated, as others have, that it could rise to well
over the 80% that we are already seeing in France. It may be
86% here but, of course, this cannot be achieved without research and
development funding. It needs the Government to lead on that. It needs
a joined-up approach, not just in government money but in our national
nuclear laboratories, which I would love to see become national again.
It also needs a joined-up approach involving the NNL, as
well as our universities, and the encouragement of our own industry in
its development and research, both here and indeed

decommissioning, which, I understand, takes currently about 69% of

decommissioning is remarkably negative in that we see all the waste
products, to which the noble Lord referred, only as waste. I do not
think we have enough confidence yet to see them also as an
asset—as a fuel. It will be quite possible to use some of the
plutonium in MOX reactors, with both uranium and thorium reactors, to
make the waste into a fuel and make it an asset rather than a
liability. Exploration of that is urgently needed. I understand that
this is happening in Canada and certainly in China, to which much
reference has been made. Indeed, India, to which little reference has
yet been made, is also investing huge sums of money in precisely these
routes and these options. I ask again whether the Minister would give
consideration to that, and whether a wider brief could be given to the

Lords have also spoken about fuel poverty. I want to close by saying
that I regret that this legislation is not bolder in addressing the
inequality of domestic energy tariffs. The Government go some way
towards addressing the complex and impenetrable tariffs that consumers
face today, which is to be commended. However, I am not confident that
this sufficiently addresses issues of fuel poverty. Members of the
House are well aware that those who pay the most for their domestic
energy are often the poorest in our communities. Many of those in fuel
poverty pay inflated prices through the meters in their homes or are
paying for other types of fuel, which are not addressed in this
legislation. Is the Minister able to assure the House that the
Government will address these wider issues, so that those currently
experiencing fuel poverty can pay a fair price for their

recently said that it will have one domestic tariff if other energy
companies follow suit. I understand that Ofgem does not recommend this
as a way forward. It may be right. As we debate this legislation in
this House, I hope that we will take the opportunity to send a clear
message to Ofgem and the energy providers that the pricing structure
needs to be fairer, more transparent and clearer. I wonder whether this
debate also offers the opportunity to discuss again the possibility of
setting a legal framework that requires domestic customers to pay more
the more energy that they use. The current position whereby the more
energy I use at home, the more likely my tariff is to reduce, is surely
unsustainable. There is a cost to the earth and to the poor of the
world who are most impacted by climate change as a result of our energy

assumption that the Government’s primary objective for energy
must be to ensure that it is available and 
<?notus-xml column=183?>affordable. Self-sufficiency, sustainability, energy
security and green energy are equally admirable aims but they are in my
opinion secondary to the primary objective. It is no good achieving any

is an ambitious Bill and I wish for a successful outcome but I have
three areas of concern. My first, shared by the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of Hereford, is the alarming number of households in fuel
poverty: 4.5 million, or nearly one in five households. This is
appalling, if not embarrassing, for one of the richest countries in the
world. We are being told constantly that there is no easy solution
because if the present tariff system is changed it may put vulnerable
households in a worse position. So, nothing is done. I would
say, “Where there’s a will, there’s a way”.
Unfortunately, there does not seem to be the
will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000014">High<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>
fuel poverty probably has something to do with the fact that fuel
prices have doubled in the past seven or eight years. That brings me to
my second concern. If fuel prices have doubled in the past seven or
eight years, what will happen to them over the next seven or eight
years? Some experts have argued that they expect them to double again,
which no doubt would exacerbate fuel poverty. I hope that the
department has done its sums and that the Minister can reassure me that
prices will not double. I am quite sure that prices will go up but the
question is, by how
much?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000015">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:56:12"></hs_TimeCode>
Government’s aim is that our energy will come from nuclear and
renewables, predominantly wind turbines, with gas as the back-up.
Energy from wind is more expensive than that from fossil fuels, and
offshore wind generation is more expensive than onshore wind. Also, the
cost of building nuclear power stations is enormous but the Liberal
Democrats will allow them to be built only if they receive no subsidy
from the taxpayer. Therefore, this huge cost of construction will no
doubt be passed on to the consumer.
Two<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:56:57"></hs_TimeCode> of
our coal-fired power stations have already closed and the Government

here that I do not understand. We are taxing our coal-fired power
stations out of existence—admittedly they are quite
old—no doubt because of an EU directive, while India and China

has huge investment in nuclear and renewables but, all the same, it is
still a huge investment in coal when we are scrapping ours. If it is
because of a directive from the EU, why is it that Germany is to build
20 new coal-fired powered stations? Will Germany’s 20 new
coal-fired power stations be required to have carbon capture and
storage built in, or not? If not, why are we taxing ours out of

increase, which will further pile on the agony for those already in

Government, have the Minister and her department done the sums to
ensure that there will be sufficient power available for all our needs
until such time as all the new proposed power stations are up and

concerns me is that the Government are relying on nuclear to be a major
part of the new mix, but the Government have yet to agree any contract

take at least eight years, if not more, before the first is

be taxing our existing coal-fired power stations out of existence
before we have secured any deal with EDF? If agreement with EDF cannot
be reached, is there a plan B? I am sure that some of these
topics—fuel poverty, energy prices over the next seven or eight

Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, along with many other noble Lords I
welcome this Bill and think it needs support, but there does appear to
be quite a lot wrong with it. It is going to be difficult to
scrutinise. It seems that every clause refers to regulations yet to be
identified. I have checked the Bill and its schedules, and the word
“regulations” appears 403 times. I do not know whether
that is a record, but it is not going to be easy to scrutinise this
legislation if it has 403 regulations. However, it demonstrates the
need for us to be given a lot more detail if we are going to do our job
properly. My noble friend Lady Worthington asked for some details
before we get to Committee, but it would be useful if the Minister
could tell us when we are going to get information about the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000020">I
am going to concentrate my remarks on the industry structure, but
before I do so, it is important to support my noble friend Lord Judd,
the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford, and many others who
have emphasised the need for greater support and encouragement for
reducing energy consumption. We seem to have incentives to meet demand
with supply; I think that is wrong. We should have incentives
to reduce demand. It is the same with water. Why are the water
companies not installing meters to reduce consumption and plugging the
leaks? London is one of the worst offenders but, of course, they make
more 
<?notus-xml column=185?>money that way. We really need to change our policies because there are
good environmental reasons for reducing the supply of both water and
electricity, and thus reduce
demand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000021">I am
both interested in and worried about the negotiations with EDF on
nuclear power stations because we have a single supplier looking for
some kind of firm contract for 20 or 30 years. I wonder whether these
are what one might call balanced commercial negotiations: a single
supplier and a single customer in the Government. The Government are up
against probably the best international negotiators in the world. I
compare that with what went wrong a year or so ago with the West Coast
Main Line negotiations on the franchise when Virgin exposed a
number of serious mistakes in the Government’s handling
of them. It is probably true to say that one of the causes was that
soon after the general election, the then Secretary of State announced
with glee that 30% of the civil servants were to be sacked and that
they were not allowed to take any external advice, particularly legal
advice. Therefore, it was a contract—rather larger than the
contract to build one of our aircraft carriers, which I think is taking
place at the moment—between a civil service that had lost a
large number of its best staff and was not allowed to take external
advice, and an international company that probably has some of the best
lawyers in the world. I hope that that does not happen this time, but I
do not have much confidence that it will not. If we do not get it
right, the customers are, quite frankly, going to be screwed for the
next five, 10 or 30
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000022">I turn
now to biomass. I have been looking into this quite a lot because it
seems to be the short-term solution to the energy problem which the
Government are proposing, and certainly before the nuclear power
station gets up and running in 10 years’ time—if we get
it. As noble Lords will know, biomass requires a large investment. For
Drax and Eggborough, two of the power stations doing it, it has
certainly been a big investment: there is the plant, the special
handling facilities and the trains—I was involved as chairman of
the Rail Freight Group. One possibility is to import biomass from north
America into Milford Haven, which has some of the deepest water in the
UK, and that will need 42 trains a day. That is a big investment, plus
all the handling equipment at both ends and, of course, the
ships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000023">I
understand that Drax and Eggborough together will produce somewhere
between 8% and 10% of our capacity. If the agreement with the
Government on the selling price for electricity which is contained in
this Bill does not go ahead, the investment will not go ahead. I also
understand that this biomass negotiation cannot be completed until the
nuclear one is completed. What is going to happen next winter and the
one after that? According to Ofgem, last winter we had 15% spare
capacity over demand, but apparently this coming winter it is going to
go down to 3%. If Drax and Eggborough do not go ahead, I think we will
need some candles; it is going to be quite serious. I hope that the
Minister can tell me what the timescale is for the nuclear negotiations
and for any relating to biomass because I think we ought to know. These
companies 
<?notus-xml column=186?>are not going to hang on waiting for a decision for
ever. Whether it is in this Bill or elsewhere I do not know, but it
needs to be done
soon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000024">The
real problem is that the market structure that we seem to have ended up
with is wrong. The big six generators also have retail ability. The
Government policy is to deliver somewhere between 35% and 50% of
generating capacity by independent renewals, which entrenches the
dependency of the independent renewal energy generators on the large
vertically-integrated utilities through long-term power purchase
contracts. That is the big six. My understanding is that the problem
for the independent retailers is that the big six will buy from the
independent generators only if they cannot supply themselves.
Therefore, the big six retailers always buy from their own generators
as long as they have the capacity; otherwise, they buy from the
independents. Apparently it has very little to do with prices. Perhaps
the Minister can put me right on this, but I am not sure how the
independent generators have the comfort of an open market, which they
need to attract
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000025">The

total separation of the train operators and the infrastructure manager.

not much competition at the consumer end, although it depends on which
part of Germany you live in. However, the big four do very nicely and
prices are high. It is interesting that the German Government are doing
their best to make sure that that the vertical integration model still
applies to the railways across Europe, so they clearly know
something<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:11:07"></hs_TimeCode>, but I
hope we do not have to continue with it in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:11:11"></hs_TimeCode>. There is a
serious risk to investment by the independents, as the noble Lord, Lord
Teverson, said, and I question what Ofgem is doing about it. I thought
Ofgem had a duty to protect consumer interests but, as it stands, this
seems to be a Bill to allow the big six to print money, which I am sure
they will love. I do not see much competition. I see higher prices than
there would need to be if there was a functioning
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:11:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000027">In
the course of scrutinising the Bill, I hope that we will
discuss how to break the dependency of the independent generators on
the large, vertically-integrated utilities for long-term contracts.
That would send a clear price signal to the market that would encourage
as many new entrants as possible to participate. It would enable them
to sell their power in an open market rather than coming second to the
big six once they have got rid of their own electricity at whatever
price. Otherwise, the independents will not be able to invest and we
will be looking at such a reduction in supply that I suggest we all go
out and buy candles for next
winter.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/769D89AF08BD03FBA5D81573B73E3485A7575048" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 June 2013">Tuesday,

Parminter:</Member></B> My Lords, like others, I welcome the Bill. It
is critical that investment in the energy sector is procured and any
policy inertia or uncertainty now will have a crippling effect on
delivering that, securing the energy we need and meeting our legally

help keep energy affordable for hard-pressed

have heard today from some climate sceptics—one particularly
vocal noble Lord is no longer in his place—but they are in a
minority in this House and around the globe. It is interesting that in
the United States some of the strongest climate sceptics, including
Karl Rove, support government initiatives for renewable projects, such
as wind energy credits, given that wind power generates well paying,
desirable jobs in rural areas. It is also seen as a cost-effective
insurance against the growing number of climate change disasters.
Insurers said that last year was the second most expensive in American
history for disasters related to climate change, costing them $139
billion. However, private insurance paid only a quarter of those costs,
leaving taxpayers to cover the rest. As the <I>Economist</I>
highlighted last week, by comparison, funding renewable energy properly
seems rather cheap. That was the point that my noble friend Lord Deben,
who is not in his place, made earlier in stating that this Bill is UK

majority of us accept that the Bill is right to introduce a capacity
mechanism that seeks to ensure domestic security of energy supply. It
is also clear around the House that there is a majority in favour of
demand side response measures. Like others, I am pleased that that
issue was addressed on Report in the other place through the
introduction of an amendment for a pilot scheme for electricity demand
management. However, given the limited opportunity to scrutinise these
demand management proposals, I add my voice to the near unanimous
number in this House who have called for a close scrutiny of the
proposals in Committee. I support the call made by a number of my
noble friends and noble Lords on the other side of the
Chamber for more than one pilot scheme to be a critical part
of the

is one difference between myself and my noble friend Lord Deben, who is
not in his place, in that I would not say that sovereignty is the only
means of ensuring energy security. Yes, it is important, but it is not
the only means. Measures better to exploit the benefits of co-operation
with our European neighbours through interconnection are omitted from
the Bill. Greater interconnection could help with the reduction 
<?notus-xml column=188?>of costs, particularly by making more efficient use of renewable energy.
This view was strongly endorsed by the recent report of the
House of Lords EU Sub-Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries, Environment
and Energy on European energy
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000034">Levels
of interconnection between the UK and mainland Europe are much more
limited than, for example, the 20-30% of interconnection between
Belgium and the Netherlands. I applaud the Secretary of State for the
recent memorandum of understanding with the Irish Government to trade
renewable energy but there are outstanding barriers to better
interconnection. Ofgem has highlighted the problem of congestion in the
south of England which would require the existing onshore grid to be
strengthened to accommodate major trade

full benefit of interconnection can be delivered only from greater
deployment of high voltage direct current lines which allow electricity
to be transported over long distances economically. The Bill does not
say anything about the potential of interconnection, or how necessary
grid strengthening can be financed or, as crucially, how public support
can be gained for significantly higher pylons than are currently used.
I hope that in Committee we seek clarification from the Government on
their policy intentions on interconnection, on overcoming the barriers
to building up the European electricity grid and on enabling Britain to
benefit from increased security of

is much to be welcomed in the Bill but I am disappointed that it is a
vehicle to provide public subsidy for the nuclear industry. Nuclear may
be low carbon but that fact cannot hide the astronomical costs of
building—and, indeed, decommissioning, as the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Hereford ably pointed out—nuclear sites or
the failure, after 60 years, to find solutions to storing
high-level radioactive waste. All this on top of the fact that the
British taxpayer is liable for any clean up of a major nuclear
accident. Corporate liability for any nuclear accident is capped at
around £1 billion—a derisory sum given that the estimated
total clean-up costs for the Fukushima nuclear accident are likely to
top £160
billion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000037">I
wish the Bill well, but as we are not an energy island a strong
European energy policy framework is critical. I commend the Secretary
of State for his leadership in Europe and for arguing strongly for a
binding emissions reductions target of 50% on 1990 levels by 2030 in
the context of an ambitious global climate deal. Such leadership will
be aided by the successful passage of this Bill and help move

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, I always listen to the noble
Baroness, Lady Parminter, on these subjects with great interest and
respect. She has great command of the subject. I think what she said

this Bill to provide the country with a diversified and secure basis
for future energy supplies on the one hand and to achieve our
international obligations on decarbonisation on the other. I totally
support both objectives and I certainly will be voting for the Bill on
Second Reading in the very unlikely event that there is a

least four respects in which I very much disagree with the
Government’s approach to energy, and I rather think that the
noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, has persuaded me to add a fifth to my
list: the need for greater investment in interconnection. First, this
Bill does not require the Minister to produce a decarbonisation target.
In this respect, I totally agree with the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Hereford and others who have said that this Bill should be
prescriptive and not permissive on this point.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:21:10"></hs_TimeCode>, I am
very disappointed that the Bill says nothing about demand
reduction. I have yet to hear the Government set out their strategy
quite clearly on that. Certainly I cannot find such a strategy in this
Bill and we definitely need
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618112000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000042">My third problem with
the Government’s energy policy is that we have made a probably
excessive commitment to wind power, certainly to offshore wind power.
It seems to me that the Government, under pressure from their
Back-Benchers, are using the planning system to stop more developments
of onshore wind power and are pushing it all offshore. However,
offshore is an extremely expensive form of energy and it does not make
any sense at all. The usual comparisons are that the cost of nuclear
energy is somewhere between 6p and 10p per kilowatt-hour and offshore
wind power is somewhere between 11p and 16p, which is about twice as
great. However, you are not comparing two comparable things. Wind
energy is not base load. It is not even a reliable peak load that you
can turn on and off as you require, which you can with a
combined-cycle, natural-gas-fired, thermal power station. It is
extremely expensive for something that is not that valuable.
I think we have gone perhaps too far in that
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:22:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government is about nuclear power. What they propose is not in any
way adequate. I would not go quite so far as the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of Hereford who wants to see 80% of our electricity
generated by nuclear fission. That is, as he rightly said, the case in
France. That is going quite far and would deprive us of the potential
quite considerable advantage of benefiting from shale oil fracking to
produce gas in the future. It looks as though gas prices are going to
come down quite dramatically as a result of that. We have large
reserves in this country and it would be a pity to give up that
bonanza.</hs_para>

is more, for the reasons I have just mentioned, there are advantages in
flexibility in having in your portfolio a considerable degree of
capacity from combined-cycle natural gas generation as well as nuclear.
It is very alarming that the proportion of our electricity produced by
nuclear fission has now fallen to below 
<?notus-xml column=190?>20%. It was 25% a few years ago. If the proportion does not go up to
80%, as the right reverend Prelate would like, I would certainly want
to see it above 25% very rapidly and it should be 30% or 40%.</hs_para>

Government why we do not build 20 new 1.6 gigawatt nuclear
stations rather than 10—they have not got round to signing a
contract for one yet—they would probably give two answers. I
have never asked them so I am probably putting words into their mouths.
First, they would say that it would be inordinately expensive and,
secondly, that there is very limited appetite in the private sector for
this type of risk. This has been demonstrated by the difficulty they
have had in getting people to bid for their business in this context
already. The two German potential partners, E.ON and RWE, have walked
away<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:24:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000046">The
Government have produced this situation by their own errors. They have
adopted the wrong model for nuclear generation—one that is based
on misallocation of risk and which consequently is unnecessarily and
excessively expensive and deters potential private sector investors.
The risk of design, construction and operation should be borne by
private sector investors and contractors. It is vital that the same
partner is responsible for all three so that design and construction
are informed at every stage by the need for maximally safe and
efficient operation. That is clearly a role for a contractor, but the
Government are quite wrong to think that it is better for the private
sector contractor to manage the commercial risks involved.</hs_para>

already retreated and accept now that the counterparty for contracts
for differences must be a single counterparty backed by the state.
Previously they were saying that the generators could just deal with
the suppliers in an open market. They got that completely wrong. They
have realised now that they have to take back that risk for the
Government, so they have already accepted the logic of my argument.
However, there are many other respects in which commercial risks are
better handled by the Government. For example, anything to do with
network risk, the failure of the system, and difficulties with
suppliers or distributors or anything of that sort is probably better
handled by the Government as they have the means to
intervene.</hs_para>

there were a shortage of uranium in the world—very unlikely at
present but we are talking 60 or 70 years ahead—the Government
are much better able than a private sector contractor to deal with
that. We have our own sources of uranium. I speak as the former
Minister responsible for the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment. We
have international agreements and so forth. There are many respects in

already been mentioned. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, referred to
one of them, which the taxpayer or the energy consumer cannot walk away
from anyway. For example, there are the risks of an accident costing
beyond £1 billion and the risks of decommissioning. It is all
very well to say that a contractor has to make provisions. Under the
contracts that have now been negotiated he will have to provide for the
costs of decommissioning, but who knows 
<?notus-xml column=191?>what they are going to be in 60 or 70 years time, or what the value of
the fund accumulated in EDF Energy or any other contractor
will be by that time. Again, in practice the state will be standing
behind those risks and reinsuring them. There will be a contingent
liability on the
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:27:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

mean? If you construct a model on that basis, you are passing to the
private sector risks that it can less efficiently manage than you can
yourself. Therefore they are going to cost more by definition. You are
passing to the private sector risks, some of which remain with you
anyway, so you are paying double for them. It is not a very intelligent
policy. The private sector contractor will factor in those risks in his
costing, which will be very expensive. What is more, because of the
lack of competition in this business he will expect a very high profit
and get away with a very high return, so the cost of capital is going
to be extremely high.</hs_para>

time in constructing nuclear power stations, the cost of capital will
be a major factor, if not the most important factor, in the total cost.
The Government have created the problem of the extreme cost of
this business. I will give a simple example so that noble Lords can do
their own calculation. The impact assessment predicts a cost of capital
of 10% for nuclear power stations. I think that might be a little less
than the likely level. The cost of equity is vastly more than that, I
would have thought twice that at least. What the weighted average cost
of capital will end up being I do not know. Take the 10%—do not
take any figures that I might suggest—that is used in the impact
assessment. That 10% is four times the Government’s cost of
capital—2.5% is the 10-year gilt rate at the moment. The
Government are paying four times more than they need. I think that is
bad Government. It is a great mistake and they have gone for the wrong
model<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:29:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

put that to the Government or to the Treasury, they will say that they
could not have the state owning the stations and raising the finance
from the gilt market because that would mean an increase in our total
debt ratio, our debt to GDP ratio, and cause us problems in the
markets. That is very naïve. First, it means that we are paying
a very considerable price in economic terms for purely presentational
advantage; and, secondly, that argument depends on the markets being so
stupid that they cannot look through the presentation for the reality
and do not actually know what is happening.</hs_para>

are perfectly capable of doing that. The markets will factor in the
contingent liabilities of the state for the environmental risk that I
mentioned. They will factor in the contingent liability that the

Browne of Madingley:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my very extensive
financial and non-financial interests in the energy sector, which are
all set out in the <I>Register of Lords’ Interests</I>. I
particularly draw your Lordships’ attention to my position as
partner and managing director at Riverstone Holdings, which manages
several energy-focused private investment funds with stakes in a range
of UK-based and international companies. Those companies operate at all
stages of the supply chain and in almost all energy
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000056">When
the Bill was first published, I wrote that it was complex and that it
introduced a range of new risks into the market, threatening to deter
planned investment. Since then, some of my concerns have been
satisfied. For example, the move to a single counterparty CFD is
particularly welcome, and lends the financial instrument at the heart
of the Bill a creditworthiness that it was
lacking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>. There
remain risks in the Bill, such as the danger that the new regime will
make it more difficult for smaller, independent generators to sell
their power in a market dominated by large, vertically integrated
utilities. Risks such as that must be assessed carefully and
adjustments made if
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:32:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000057">I
want to make two further points about the Bill. The first
concerns any amendment to add a decarbonisation target. In my
experience as a businessman and investor, a decarbonisation target for
2030 would have little impact. Decarbonisation is just a means to the
essential and, indeed, existentially important end of reducing carbon
dioxide emissions. Companies do not listen or react to long-term
political aspirations, because there are too many technological,
economic and political unknowns for them to be taken
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000058">The
incentive structures contained in the Bill are far more important than
targets or aspirations, because they are the mechanism for action. Only
credible, consistent and creditworthy incentive structures can unlock
the investment needed. Take carbon capture and storage, for example.
CCS is a young technology which requires the state to underwrite some
risk so that it is developed here in Britain. That will enable us to
benefit in an even more environmentally sustainable way from our
abundant domestic gas reserves, which, in any case, have a lower carbon
footprint than imported
gas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:33:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000059">However,
investment in CCS, gas or renewables will not come from a
decarbonisation target. It will come from simple incentive structures
which allow different energy technologies to compete on a level playing
field, with their full set of externalities taken into account, and
which are implemented reliably, transparently and quickly. It is
therefore critical that the Bill is not subject to yet more delay from
wrangling over a decarbonisation target. Uncertainty about the
direction and speed of travel has been far more damaging to investment
than questions about the detail of
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:34:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=193?><hs_para UID="130618112000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000060">My
second point concerns the broader strategic framework within which the
Bill sits. Decisions on energy policy and public investment in
energy infrastructure are based on criteria which change frequently,
depending on the people in charge and the priorities they decide to
pursue. That has proven to be inefficient and damaging to investment in
the North Sea, for example, which has seen cycles of windfall taxes
followed by tax breaks followed by more windfall taxes. There is no
need to reinvent the context every time an investment or policy
decision is made. It would be sensible to set an overall strategy just
once and then make subsequent decisions with those long-term strategic
goals in
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:33:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000061">The
London School of Economics Growth Commission, of which I was a member
with the noble Lord, Lord Stern, proposed an infrastructure strategy
board to provide independent advice to policy-makers about strategic
priorities. That would not be a radical innovation. It is the model
followed by NICE, the healthcare body, and the Monetary Policy
Committee. A panel of independent experts with knowledge, expertise and
experience of the industry could consistently check everyday decisions
against the long-term strategy set by the Government. That would be
enormously helpful in the energy sector, where different technologies
and fuels cannot be assessed in isolation. They are part of a
system. Independent and expert advice could help to turn a set
of disparate and often conflicting energy policy decisions into
a real energy strategy. In this regard, I support the comments of the
noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and I hope that the Minister will
consider in her
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:36:17"></hs_TimeCode> whether
that will deliver
strategy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:36:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000062">We
must judge the efficacy of the Bill by its results. Success will come
from higher quality investment from a diverse set of investors;
investment in a greater range of energy sources, including hydrocarbons
used for power, such as gas and the encouragement of CCS; respecting
existing commitments, such as the phasing out of coal; and an
electricity price that maintains the competitive nature of
British
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:36:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Those
are the tests against which the Bill should be judged. We have spent
almost three years debating the structure of this reform
package. I believe that it is now time for implementation and
action.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130618112000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000106">6.37

Ridley:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by declaring an interest in
coal-mining on my family’s property, as detailed in the

prominent rival, gas, in which I have no
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000064">I
thank my noble friend the Minister for her courtesy in discussing the
Bill and welcome the fact that the Government have grasped the nettle
of energy policy, especially on the issue of nuclear power, after the
deplorable vacuum left by the previous Government. However, I am
concerned that we are being asked in the Bill to spend £200
billion, mainly on the wrong technologies, and that we will come to
regret that. We are being asked to put in place a system that will
guarantee far into the future rich rewards for landowners and
capitalists, while eventually doubling the price of 
<?notus-xml column=194?>electricity and asking people to replace gas with electric space
heating. That can only drive more people into fuel poverty.</hs_para>

have heard a lot about the needs of energy investors and producers. We
have not heard enough about consumers. If the industry gets an 8%
return on the £200 billion to be spent, just two offshore wind
farms or one nuclear plant would be declaring profits similar to what
British Gas declares today. That will be an uncomfortable
position for the Government of the
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000066">The Bill
is a dash for wood and wind—two medieval technologies—and
it is twice as big as the dash for gas of the 1990s. Between 6 and 9
gigawatts will have to be built a year for the next 16 years,
compared with 2 gigawatts a year during the dash for gas. I am
not sure it can be done, let alone affordably. In the case of biomass,
the only way we can source enough is by felling trees overseas. As the
noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, said, Drax will soon be taking more than 40
trains a day of wood pellets from North America. That is not energy
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:39:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000067">Under

of Humpty Dumpty: a word means just what I choose it to mean. We are
being asked to pretend that the most carbon rich fuel of all, wood, is
not a source of carbon. According to Princeton University, trees used
for biomass electricity generation increase carbon dioxide emissions by
79% compared with coal over 20 years and by 49% over 40 years,
even if you replant the forest. We are through the looking
glass<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:39:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130618112000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000068">Offshore
wind, meanwhile, is a risky technology with a track record of
engineering problems, sky- high costs, disappointing lifespan
and problems of decommissioning. At the moment, we generate less than
1% of total energy, or 6% of electricity, from wind, despite all the
damage it has already done to our countryside and economy. We are to
increase that to something like 30% in just a decade or so, may
be more if nuclear is delayed. It is a huge gamble, and if it fails,
the only fallback is carbon capture and storage, a technology that has
repeatedly failed to meet its promises at all, let alone affordably, a
point made earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady
Liddell<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:40:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000069">Even
if this wood and wind dash is possible, under the contract for a
different system proposed in this Bill, while better than the renewable
obligations that preceded it, the subsidy to renewable energy will
quadruple by 2020. That is only the start. On top of that, there are
system costs for balancing the unpredictability of wind; transmission
costs for getting wind from remote areas to where it is needed; VAT;
the carbon floor price; not to mention the cost of subsiding renewable
heat and renewable transport fuels. Hence, at a conservative estimate,
the Renewable Energy Foundation thinks that we will be imposing costs
of £16 billion a year on our hard-pressed economy for several
decades.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618112000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000070">Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>
are we doing this? We are doing this because of four assumptions that
were valid in 2010 but, as my noble friend Lord Lawson pointed out, are
no longer valid to the same extent. First, we assumed we would 
<?notus-xml column=195?>not be acting alone, so we would not damage our
competitiveness. Instead, not only is there no longer a Kyoto treaty,
but China is planning to build 363 coal- fired power stations; India
455. On top of that, the European trading system has collapsed to less
than €5 a tonne of carbon. Our carbon floor price is
more than three times that: £16 a tonne, rising to £32 a
tonne in 2020 and £76 a tonne in 2030. Acting unilaterally in
this way does not save carbon emissions. It merely exports them
and the jobs go with them. Northumberland’s largest employer,
the aluminium smelter at Lynemouth, has closed with the loss
of 500 jobs, almost entirely because of carbon
policies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000071">The
second assumption behind the Bill was that the cost of gas would rise,
thus making the cost of energy rise anyway. The Committee on Climate
Change said recently in a report
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130618112000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000097">“Consensus

future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:42:41"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="130618112000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000095">This
remark has been described by the utilities team at Liberum Capital as
“genuinely amazing” in the light of recent
events<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:42:48"></hs_TimeCode>. Now that
we know that gas prices have plummeted in the United States to roughly
one-quarter of ours, thanks to shale gas; now that we know that Britain
probably has many decades worth of shale gas itself; now that we know
that enormous reserves of offshore gas near Israel, Brazil and parts of
Africa are going to come on line in years to come; now that we know
that conventional gas producers such as Russia and Qatar are facing
increasing competition from unconventional and offshore gas; now that
we know that methane hydrates on the ocean floor are more abundant than
all other fossil fuels put together and that the Japanese are planning
to explore them; in short, now that we know we are nowhere near peak
gas, it is surely folly to hold our economy hostage to an assumption
that gas prices must
rise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:43:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130618112000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000072">We
will need the gas anyway. The intermittent nature of wind means that we
will require increasing back-up and we cannot get it from nuclear
because it is not responsive enough to fill the lulls when the wind
drops. Far from replacing fossil fuels, a dash for wood and wind means
a dash for gas too, only this time we will have to subsidise it because
the plants will stand idle for most of the time and pay a rising carbon
floor price when they do operate. Having distorted the markets to
disastrous effect with subsidies to renewables, we are now being asked,
under the capacity market mechanism, to introduce compensating
countersubsidies to fossil
fuels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:44:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000073">The
third assumption was that the cost of renewables would fall rapidly as
we rolled them out. This has proved untrue and, indeed, as the Oxford
Institute of Energy Studies has shown, the cost curve for renewables
inevitably rises as the best sites are used up, not least in the North
Sea. I am told by those who work in the offshore wind industry that, at
the moment, the industry has every incentive to keep its costs up not
down, as it sets out to strike a contract with the Government. They
will not have to try very hard. Even at low estimates, offshore wind is
stratospherically
expensive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:44:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000074">The
fourth assumption on which this Bill is based was that the climate
would change dangerously and soon. Once again, this assumption is
looking much shakier than it did five years ago. The slow rate at which
the temperature has been changing over the 
<?notus-xml column=196?>past 50 years and the best evidence from the
top-of-the-atmosphere radiation about climate sensitivity are both very
clearly pointing to carbon dioxide having its full greenhouse effect
but without significant net positive feedback of the kind on which all
the alarm is based. The noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, and the noble
Lord, Lord Stern, both mentioned Professor Myles Allen and they will be
aware, therefore, of his recent paper, which found significantly
reduced climate sensitivity. If that is the case, the dash to wind and
biomass may well continue to do more harm to the environment as well as
to the economy for many decades than climate change itself will
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:45:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000075">However,
leaving that on one side, as my noble friend Lord Lawson said, the
argument against subsidising wind and biomass does not depend on a
benign view of climate change. It stands powerfully on its own merits,
even if you think dangerous climate change is imminent. In
1981, my noble friend Lord Lawson, ignoring the prevailing wisdom of
the day, as he sometimes does, decided against the predict-and-provide
central planning philosophy and instead embraced the idea of letting
the market discover the best way to provide electricity. The result was
the cheapest and most flexible energy sector of any western
country.</hs_para>

have progressively turned our backs on that. Under this Bill, the
location, the technology and the price of each power source is
determined by one person—the omniscient Secretary of State.
Recent occupants of that position have an unhappy history of not making
wise decisions. Remember ground source heat pumps? They do not work as
advertised. Remember electric vehicles? They have been a flop. Remember
biofuels? They have caused rainforest destruction and hunger. Remember
the Green Deal? Must we go on making these
mistakes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:46:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000077">We
have returned to a philosophy of picking winners, or rather, from the
point of view of the consumer, of picking losers. Not even just picking
losers, but hobbling winners, because of the obstacles we have put in
the way of shale gas. America has cut its carbon emissions by far more
than we have, almost entirely because of shale gas displacing coal. By
pursuing a strategy that encouraged unabated gas, we could halve
emissions and cut bills at the same time. Instead, I very much fear we
will find we have spent a fortune to achieve
neither.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/93F6A11D3F574075CC8D57B5D38E77B89F5D4946" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 June 2013">Tuesday,

Hanworth:</Member></B> My Lords, this Energy Bill is the product of
economic doctrines that have misled a generation of
Conservative politicians and have penetrated deeply into the Civil
Service. For a while, they also strongly affected the thinking of
Labour politicians. The project of energy market reform, which the Bill
promotes, is an ongoing attempt to subject the circumstances of energy
production and supply to the nostrums of free market
economics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000079">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:48:06"></hs_TimeCode>
project is being pursued in circumstances that have been strongly
influenced by a previous ideologically motivated reform, namely the
privatisation of the country’s electricity industry that
occurred in the closing years of the Thatcher Administration. The
doctrines in question derive from the ideology of neoclassical
economics, which envisages a world composed of perfectly 
<?notus-xml column=197?>competitive agents operating in free markets, which are devoid of
government interference and regulation and have been purged of state
monopolies. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:48:29"></hs_TimeCode>
this world, efficient financial markets operate in such a way as to
ensure that investment projects, with very different profiles of costs
and benefits, can be placed on an equal footing. In effect, future
costs and benefits are to be discounted by a factor that declines as
one advances into the future and is directly related to the market rate
of interest, which is the reward for lending
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000080">The
resulting discount factor may be equated, in theory, to the marginal
social rate of discount—if one is prepared to postulate such a
thing—but some believers are keen to assert that there is no
such thing as society. However, a basic proposition of the doctrine,
which must surely be rejected in the context of a national energy
policy, is that public investment can and ought to be evaluated
according to the desiderata that govern private and commercial
investment. By adhering to this proposition, one is bound to favour
short-term commercial gain at the expense of long-term social benefit.
The actual world is not the ideal world that neoclassical economics
envisages—and it never will be—but the proponents of the
ideology pay scant attention to realities. When the opportunity arises
and whenever they are in a position to do so, they are liable to
attempt to make the reality conform to their idealistic
visions.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130618112000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000081">The
free market ideology suffuses the Bill but, as time has passed, some of
the more implausible aspects of its original design have been amended
and obscured. I shall begin my critique by looking at its central
concept, which is a contract for differences to be applied to the price
of electricity. This terminology has been borrowed from financial
markets, where a contract for differences is a financial derivative
designed to indemnify the party who has purchased it against the
effects of fluctuations in the price of a financial asset, measured as
departures from a so-called strike price. The writer of the contract is
described as the counterparty.</hs_para>

envisaged a multitude of counterparties, constituting a free market. In
that case, the terms of the contracts for differences would be
discovered or revealed by the market; and, given that markets are
deemed to be efficient, it was imagined that this would create an
optimal outcome. The idea has gone into abeyance. The critics have
asserted that, in reality, such a market would be beset by risks of
confusion and by dangers of default and bankruptcy. The outcome is that
there will now be a single government-owned counterparty and that the
terms of the contracts will be set through an administrative
process.</hs_para>

the Government’s intention that the strike price will eventually
be set through a competitive free market process. An expectation of the
designers of the Bill appears to have been that a competitive
environment would generate a single strike price that would be
applicable to all electricity generators, regardless of the technology.
The beautiful idea here was that there would be no need for strategic
decisions regarding the appropriate technology mix of our future 
<?notus-xml column=198?>power generation. This mix would be discovered by
the market, as if by the operation of a hidden hand, and the outcome,
according to the theory, would be an optimal one. In my opinion, this
is an absurd idea. The costs and benefits of the various technologies
in question have very different profiles through time. Notwithstanding
the hypothesis of efficient markets, these incommensurable futures
cannot be mediated solely by commercial and financial transactions.
Instead, they should be determined in the light of some careful
strategic planning. Indeed, the markets have no perception of the
future, other than as an aggregate of the dim perceptions of the
majority of their agents.</hs_para>

electricity generation has the shortest of the time horizons and, for
that reason, it accords best with the short-term preferences of
financial and commercial markets. Its capital costs are the lowest and
its running costs are the highest. However, an imponderable aspect of
this option is the future price of the fuel. There are some highly
contradictory predictions of what will eventuate. There are anxieties
about the security of supply given that, at present, the principal
sources are in Russia and the Middle East. There is also an expectation
of rapidly rising prices in the face of an increasing world demand. On
the other hand, it is observed that gas prices in the US have been
falling in consequence of fracking. The optimists imagine that an ample
supply of shale gas can somehow be magicked out of the ground on which
this nation stands to replace the depleted supplies of North Sea
gas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130618112000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000085">Those
sceptical of the reality of climate change, who include the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, also envisage the exploitation of Arctic oil and
methane, the supplies of which are presently uncharted and
undiscovered. For them, the discovery and exploitation of ample
supplies of hydrocarbons is an exciting prospect. For the rest of us,
who constitute the majority, this is a terrifying prospect.</hs_para>

to be reviewed is that of wind-powered electricity generation. Here,
the capital costs are high, but the energy that drives the windmills is
free. However, the power supply of windmills is intermittent and must
be balanced by a compensatory supply, which is liable to be
gas-powered. The intermittency implies that a very large renewables
capacity is required to guarantee a minimum level of supply. The costs
of wind-powered electricity cannot be assessed in isolation and the
severity of the problem of intermittency will be a function of the
proportion of electricity supplied, on average, by the windmills. To
propose that mindless markets should be capable, on their own, of
adjudicating these matters so as to determine the optimal proportion
seems absurd.</hs_para>

that needs to be considered is nuclear power generation. Here, the
capital costs come in large indivisible lumps and the stations are of
such longevity that we should be considering 60 years of operation
following a period of as long as 10 years for their planning,
construction and commissioning. Once the nuclear power stations are in
place, their operating costs are the lowest of all. The outstanding
difficulty affecting a nuclear project is the size of the lumps of the
capital costs. In one way or another, national Governments have
hitherto been involved in 
<?notus-xml column=199?>the construction of every nuclear power station. For
a variety of reasons, which are a mixture of ideological
predispositions and budgetary restrictions, the present Government have
resolved that the capital costs of nuclear power should be borne
entirely by commercial suppliers. There are few suppliers willing to
bear such costs, and the majority of those who originally expressed an
interest have withdrawn.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618112000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000088">We are left with one
major potential contractor, which is a French nationalised industry in
commercial disguise. This is EDF, or Électricité de
France. It is an outstanding irony that their pursuit of a free market
ideology has brought the Government face to face with a foreign
state-owned monopolist. This supplier is expecting to assess the future
costs and benefits according to the criteria of a short-term commercial
investment appraisal that envisages a rate of return in double figures.
In such an appraisal, the future benefits of a nuclear power station,
which are delayed in time and subject to a heavy discount, must be
weighed against the current up-front costs. In order that the benefits
should outweigh the costs in such a calculation, an exorbitant rate of
return is demanded. Moreover, this return is being demanded for an
extended period. We believe that a contract for differences, designed
to provide secure revenue, would be extended over 35 years.
This would be a perilous commitment for any Government to
make.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000089">There
is an obvious recourse that should be available to any Government who
are not blinded by their ideology or hamstrung by their fiscal
anxieties. It is that the Government should, at their own expense,
commission the building of nuclear power stations which should then be
owned by the nation. If need be, the stations could be leased out to
commercial operators but, given their low operating costs, such
arrangements would be a matter of minor detail. In assessing the
benefits of nuclear power, a marginal rate of social discount should be
used that is considerably below both the commercial rate of discount
and the 10% that has been used by the Department of Energy and Climate
Change in its calculations of the so-called comparative levelised costs
of electricity
generation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618112000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618112000090">I
am an ardent protagonist of nuclear power generation and of the yet to
be realised superior nuclear technologies that would be available to us
if we were actively to pursue their research and development, as the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Hereford so eloquently enjoined us

the way in which the Government are approaching our nuclear future and
our energy future in

overwhelmingly positive Bill with overwhelming but not—as we
have seen clearly today—unanimous support across the political
parties and, indeed, the Cross Benches. Many positive
changes have been made to the detail of the Bill and much of
that detail is now absolutely correct. Some of the changes—for
example in relation to the counterparty—have been referenced
already. Having the Government underwrite the counterparty role is
vital. The proposal to move 
<?notus-xml column=200?>the feed-in tariff limit from 5 megawatts to 10
megawatts is very welcome, while the early release next month of the
draft EMR delivery plan, with the information on the strike price for
the contracts for difference, will be crucial. In the short to
medium term, the capacity market for gas will be crucial in keeping the
lights on. The capacity market has not been an issue of huge political
debate. It does not get hearts racing in the other place or on the
Floor of this House, but it is very important to get it right. The
first thing to happen will not be a switching-off of the lights; it
will be instructions to major industrial users to stop using
electricity. That will be very serious for our economy and for the
messages that it sends
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000004">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:02:07"></hs_TimeCode>
those are good points in relation to the detail. In relation to the
capacity market, I would be very pleased if more were being
said—particularly in the medium to long term—to encourage
the storage of renewable power. That is crucial to the credibility
of the renewable sector. More could start to be done in the
Bill to encourage
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:00:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000005">All
of this represents a huge opportunity to the UK economy. The
Minister said that there will be £110 billion of investment this
decade and £7.6 billion per year by 2020. However, it has not
happened yet. There needs to be real industry confidence.
That confidence has been severely dented by delay and by the DECC
versus the Treasury battle—the Conservative-Liberal Democrat
battle—that we have witnessed over recent months and has been
played out in the media. That sort of squabbling has done real damage.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:02:07"></hs_TimeCode> is crucial to
get not only a confirmed strike price but also EU clearance and
political harmony on all of this.</hs_para>

worry about EU clearance. It would be straightforward to get state aid
clearance if this were only about renewables but it is not only about
renewables, it is about nuclear as well. I worry about the potential
delay and the impact that that could have on final investment decisions
in the renewables sector. It is crucial to have continuity,
consistency, clarity of political purpose and political support. In too
many aspects of the industry, investment is stalled right
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:01:46"></hs_TimeCode>. Major
international investors are voting with their feet and going elsewhere.
I would predict that some of the big announcements that have been
made—for example by turbine manufacturers—about inward
investments into the UK will not happen due to the lack of continuity
and the lack of clear political commitment. That is a real cause for
worry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:02:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000007">Tackling
climate change is urgent. It cannot wait. There is overwhelming
evidence and overwhelming agreement about that among the scientists,
the economists and other experts. We have heard it from the very good
contributions made by the noble Lords, Lord Stern and Lord Deben.
Global warming and climate change is perhaps an inconvenient truth but
it is a truth nevertheless—and it is one that must be tackled
now. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:09:35"></hs_TimeCode> climate

incontrovertible, infallible evidence on their side? To that I would

high even if electricity prices rise. Consumers’ money can
therefore be very 
<?notus-xml column=201?>considerably wasted. It was a pretty complex and
very British—solely British—solution. However, ROCs did
at least create certainty and confidence in the industry. Contracts for
difference are theoretically better, but the change has to be well
handled to maintain confidence. So far that has not happened.
Squabbling, as I mentioned, has led to a loss of confidence and the
delay has created the sort of uncertainty that no industrial sector

is also a degree of illogicality in those who talk about being
anti-onshore wind but in favour of offshore wind. If you want to

for nuclear, I still have very serious concerns. It is slow to deliver.
It is expensive. More than 60% of DECC’s budget is currently
spent on nuclear. The nuclear waste is toxic and dangerous. It has a
very long half-life. The nuclear sector relies on a depleting uranium
supply from uncertain sources in politically unstable nations. Fusion
would be a wholly different thing but we are far from there yet.
Perhaps most importantly, investment in nuclear tends to reduce the
urgency of the investment in renewables. As I have already mentioned,
it could also lead to a delay in state aid clearance for contracts for
difference, and clearly a huge amount of government resource has been
taken up in the negotiations with EDF on the whole nuclear
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000011">We

decarbonisation. I would far rather see a decarbonisation target coming
sooner. It is another area of coalition dispute—another Treasury
versus DECC battle. There was no target in the original Bill, however,
and I am very pleased that there is now provision for a decarbonisation
target. Although I would be prepared to wait until 2016, the acid test
will be the response and the attitude of others. Major investors,
manufacturers of turbines, those involved in the renewable sector,
those who make the final investment decisions, have made it very clear
that they are looking for a strong decarbonisation target to support
their
investments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:06:28"></hs_TimeCode>. I
certainly believe that it should not be an enabling or an optional

want to make two final points. The first is on energy efficiency and
demand reduction. There is huge potential in these areas, which
are vital. They have been neglected areas of energy policy for too
long. However, switching from fossil fuel—not just for
electricity but also for our heating and our transport—will
require very significant amounts of electric energy. That always has to

renewable schemes are vital. The Bill rightly encourages them and will
do more to support them. However, in the real world—in the 
<?notus-xml column=202?>practical world of finance—the current
problems with the Co-operative Bank could be very damaging to many
community projects. I believe that a great deal will have to be done to
keep these projects alive. A Bill on its own will not be

summary, we need to get on with it. Let us have no more delays or
divisions but instead show political clarity and unity in order to
deliver the confidence needed to create thousands of jobs and billions
of pounds of new investment and cleaner, greener and more secure energy
for everyone in the UK—for business and for consumers. There are
many other countries investing in renewable energy where the sort of
political divisions that we have witnessed this afternoon simply do not
happen. They are going for it and doing so with absolute determination,
conviction and commitment. The Bill can help us to do that in the
United Kingdom, and it must do exactly that. It should therefore be
supported.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/859027A66DE3A7FA39F2B9589A1611CE53FAC5D7" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 June 2013">Tuesday,

complex structure. With great trepidation, I have to disagree with the
noble Lord, Lord Lawson of Blaby, who exempted me
today—extraordinarily—from his strictures on everybody
else in the House, the Bill, the Government and the Opposition. I was
very grateful for what he said, but when he said that Dieter Helm was
right to describe this as the Gosplan solution, he was wrong. I spent
some time in Moscow as a young man and used to read a lot of Gosplan
texts. They were clear, straightforward, decisive, precise and
detailed. They were all wrong, of course, but it was all there with
tremendous clarity. This text, and indeed the whole structure, seems to
be a sort of magic toyshop with something for everyone, and a sometimes
awkward balance between environmental aspiration and traces of the
market here and there. It seems sometimes to put a little more emphasis
on the greening of the economy than on cutting costs and keeping the
lights on.</hs_para>

of studying. Nevertheless, I welcome it because at least the long
period of investment hiatus may be about to end. Companies cannot spend
shareholders’ money unless the rules of the game are clear.
Although I may not agree with all the rules of the game as proposed,
clarity will be important. Without substantial investment soon, the
lights will indeed go out. If and when the Bill passes, as I hope it
will, a modicum of clarity will exist. It is not in the Bill now
because the details on capacity mechanism and contracts for difference
are apparently to be set out in subordinate 
<?notus-xml column=203?>legislation that we have not yet seen. I understand
that the detail on CFDs, including draft strike prices, may appear in a
draft delivery plan next month. Getting this right will be crucial to
ensuring that investment in low-cost generation is cost-effective, and
it is very important that this work should not be based on aspiration
but should be founded on evidence-based analysis.</hs_para>

mechanism, I understand that the consultation on its design and the
draft legislation is planned for the autumn and that the first auction
will be next year, but that the first delivery year will not be until
2018-19, which puzzles me. Why the delay? Presumably, the Government
are thinking about the construction of new capacity. However, the
lights could go out well before 2018, and companies need to consider
whether to run on or phase out existing plant. I hope that in Committee
we will learn a bit more about how the auction system is to
work and its
timing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000021">Three
points arise from the debate. First, I agree with virtually everything
that the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, says on this subject but, again with
great trepidation, I need to register a note of dissent from what he
and the noble Lord, Lord Stephen, have said about the 2030
decarbonisation target and the absence of such a target in the new
Clause 1 in Part 1 of the Bill. Here I agree 100% with the noble
Lord, Lord Browne of Madingley. With all due respect to the
argument advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, from
these Benches, companies like Siemens are not impressed by 2030
targets. Such companies make their decisions on what capacity they need
and where they should site their plant on the basis of clear
commitments. They are pretty cynical about targets, as am I about the
idea of a legally binding target 16 or 17 years out. Bindings fray, and
no Parliament can bind its successor. What matters for
investors, as the noble Lord, Lord Stephen, says, is certainty
and continuity. They need to see the underpinning of any targets by
credible costings and a credible commitment to meet those costs.
Realistically, that would not be attainable by 1 April 2014, and I do
not think we are foolish to have failed to add to the Bill a
requirement by 2014 to set a 2030 target. If that arises in Committee,
I will be arguing against including such a target

I disagree with what the noble Lord, Lord Deben, said about carbon
capture and storage, and here I am disagreeing also with the noble
Lord, Lord Browne of Madingley. I am sure they are right that CCS is
the technology of the future. A number of great companies have
already spent a long time and large sums of money in trying to
make it work economically, but no one has succeeded. I am sure that in
10 years’ time CCS will have a very important role to play, and
I am as sure of that as I was 10 years ago when I first said it. It is
the technology of the future and it may stay that way for a very long
time into the future—alas, because it looks like a marvellous
solution, but it is extremely hard to make it
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:16:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000023">Thirdly—this
is very daring because here I am disagreeing with my old
boss—the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, was kind enough to exempt me
from his strictures on my old department and DECC for what sounded like
rather absurd language about how the 
<?notus-xml column=204?>United Kingdom would influence the energy and
environmental policy of China. I agree that there is a fly-on-the-wheel
problem that one sees from time to time in such language. But the
Chinese, too, deserve the Lawson lash because they seem to believe in
climate change and to believe that it is at least partly man-made. They
are building one nuclear plant every month, and investing hugely in
LNG. They, like the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, are strong advocates of
shale, and they have a huge exploration programme across China now; it
is at an early stage but they clearly believe, like the noble Lord,
that it too is the technology of the future. They have invested
massively in solar power and have wiped out the European industry. They
have a massive investment in wind power, and of course they are still
burning enormous amounts of coal. They believe that the exponential
increase in their demand, and the need to try to avoid dustbowls and
desertification in northern China and poor air quality in the great
Chinese cities force them to be as green as possible, and they would
like to reduce their reliance on coal. Unlike us, they do not hang
around. Like us, they think that they need to use every available
source of supply. I hope that we will not hang around much longer and I
look forward to the progress of the Bill in Committee and an end to the
investment
hiatus.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/2DABB694218CE41301C67CF019BD4DF82074ED4E" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 June 2013">Tuesday,

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I start with a word of thanks
to my noble friend Lady Verma and the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, for the
several extremely useful meetings that we have had about the Bill over
the past couple of months. I have found it invaluable to see what the
departmental view is. We have had the opportunity of talking to many of
the Minister’s officials.</hs_para>

source of advice. I try to talk as much as I can with the companies
that would actually have to make this system work. At a breakfast
meeting chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, it emerged in our
discussions with the wind industry, the CCS people and the nuclear
industry that the Bill is essential if there is to be any hope of
attracting the capital that is needed for the huge investment that many
noble Lords have talked about. Somebody went on to ask a rather awkward
question: if we get the Bill in the form that the industry would
like—and there is plenty of evidence that they like much of what
they see—will we get the investment? The noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, will remember that there was a long pause, then all the
parties said, “No, we cannot guarantee that”. We have to
have the Bill because without it there is no hope of getting the
investment, but even with it, there is still no guarantee. I endorse
totally what has been said by a number of noble Lords during the course
of this debate, that the greatest danger is uncertainty. People, firms
and companies will not invest when they are faced with uncertainty. We
have been going through quite a period of uncertainty in this country
and it has resulted in a considerable downturn in investment in the
generation of energy. Somebody said a moment ago that they hope that
that period is now ending. We shall have to wait and see.</hs_para>

certainly support the principle that we have to get this Bill through.
I hope that we will be able to finish the Committee stage before the
long Recess. I foresee 
<?notus-xml column=205?>four or five weeks of pretty hard work. I have tried to cancel as many
of my other engagements as I can to make room for it. I have been

Baroness, Lady Worthington, that I very much support is that this is in
some ways a skeleton Bill that eventually will be filled in with
various things, including a large number of regulations. I make a very
firm plea: we may not get these regulations in Committee, but we must
know what they are by the time we reach Report in the autumn. It will
be impossible for the House to debate this in any meaningful way if we
do not have a greater degree of certainty as to what is actually going
to

my noble friend Lady Verma. Having listened to the speeches, I do not
envy her the problem of having to wind up this debate. It is a task
that I did for various things over a number of years, and it is very
difficult to do. After having listened to so many diverse views, often
based on great experience and expertise, I do not envy her.</hs_para>

is a general view that we face a very considerable problem. There is
likely to be a 40% increase in demand for electricity by 2050, but we
are facing the closure of about 30% of our existing generating capacity
by 2025. Wind power is becoming more intermittent. In the opposite
direction, the nuclear programme is less flexible. However, it is
equally essential and we must have it. I believe that we are bound to
face higher electricity prices for a variety of reasons. I do not think
that we are going to find ourselves imitating the Americans. Even if we
are able to develop our shale gas deposits, nobody knows how much is
recoverable. We also have our environmental obligations, so these are
very great challenges.</hs_para>

find myself increasingly worried about security of supply for the next
four or five years. Somebody mentioned the closure of power stations. I
have been given a list of power stations that were running
on 12 December 2012, but all of which are now closed: Didcot
A—a huge one, Fawley, Littlebrook, Cockenzie, Kingsnorth,
Uskmouth and Tilbury. That is a huge reduction in our generating
capacity. Some have talked about a number of plants being put into
mothballs. The problem with mothballing is that it takes time to start
up again. The figures I have been given suggest that of 9.2 gigawatts
of UK gas capacity that is now mothballed, 2.6 gigawatts are unlikely
ever to operate again because they have been effectively dismantled. Of
the rest, it will take anything from three to 18 months
before they can become operational, because one has dispersed the
labour force. The thing has been wound down, and it takes time to start
up again. I have anxieties about this and I hope that my noble friend
may be able to offer us some
reassurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:25:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

gracious Speech, I raised the question of the future competitiveness of
our energy industries. In particular, I asked about the Ofgem letter
that had been sent out in February to all the bodies concerned—a
very wide distribution—proposing what it called “future
trading arrangements”. The answer came in a paragraph of that
long letter written by my noble friend Earl Howe after he had wound up 
<?notus-xml column=206?>that day’s debate. I have no doubt, however, that this particular
paragraph was drafted by my noble friend’s department. I quote
this letter of 3
June:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130618120000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000053">“The

may not feel like it, but we are nearly there. However, perhaps we have
had a decision on this—I will come back to that. I am puzzled

am not sure how much wiser that leaves me. I prefer to look at this in
terms of competition. If there is a market—and much of this Bill
is based on the proposition that there will be markets operating,
albeit in the future—then we start from the position, as many
noble Lords have already mentioned, of having the big six. They have a
98% share of the domestic retail market, a 78% share of the industrial
retail market and a 93% share of the commercial retail market.
Estimates typically show that the big six have a market share of 65% to
70%. They are an enormously dominant force in our electricity industry.
I have had a number of meetings with the independents and those who
support them, and they constantly complain about how difficult it is to
break into this market. These big vertically integrated companies have
enormous
power.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130618120000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000032">However,
it may be that help is on the way. Many noble Lords will have seen the
announcement by Ofgem less than a week ago opening up the electricity
market to effective competition. I quote from the Ofgem
press
release:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130618120000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000054">“Ofgem

suppliers can compete effectively with the big six … Big six
suppliers and largest independent generators must trade fairly with
small suppliers or face financial penalties … Wholesale energy

years in advance … Ofgem’s proposed reforms build on
progress made by the industry, but seek to increase competition and
address issues of fairness and transparency”.</hs_quote>

hope in an otherwise quite difficult situation. Will the Government
support it? They always talk about having more competition in the
industry. If they support it, will that require further amendment of
the Bill or will it be covered by the powers that were added in the
other place—now Clauses 43 to 45? I think that something more is
required: a requirement to promote competition actually needs to be
written into the Bill. I give my noble friend notice that I am
contemplating an amendment to the clauses on the capacity market to add
a requirement; in addition to the objectives of the capacity
market set out in Clause 21 they should have an objective to promote
and encourage competition in the generating

to establish a framework for delivering secure, affordable and
low-carbon
energy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:32:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I
also thank the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, for his chairing of the

are vital moments for the transformation of Britain’s energy
market. At the core of the Bill is the necessity, as older power plants
become obsolete, for Britain to have enough power at a competitive
price, with new infrastructure that could cost more than £100
billion, while mitigating the effects of climate change. It is always
difficult to meet more than one target at once. All elements
must therefore be taken into account in a multifaceted market where all
technologies will be needed. While these supply-side solutions
necessarily take up much debate, efficiency measures, together with
management and reduction of demand, must not be allowed to slip from
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000037">The
main players for 2050 are well known. I will first address
nuclear. As my noble friend Lady Worthington said in her opening
remarks, the Energy Bill has been characterised as a nuclear-led Bill.
Nuclear has huge up-front costs, which are then fixed for life.
However, on the negative side, it can be undercut by gas. By nature it
is a base-load player, as it is not very flexible. I am concerned about
the lack of detail in the Bill and the wide-ranging enabling powers it
gives to the Secretary of State. How will a strike price be set that is
fair in the long term—measured in decades—strikes a
balance between risk and reward, and is a good deal for future
citizens? We do not know, because the Bill is silent on power/price
comparability, between price reductions from the progress in renewable
technologies, with set returns to be guaranteed to nuclear.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618120000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000038">Into this mix comes
the impact of shale gas. We have yet to determine the extent of
possible supplies and its environmental sustainability, which must be
strictly adhered to with regulation. It can be safely said that falling
prices are a long way off. At best, it seems that shale gas may achieve
only a delay in price rises, rather than being a game-changer. The
effect of shale gas in the US is to provide excess coal for export that
is now being used as base load. Industrial emissions targets for coal
and gas have resulted in the energy performance standard. However,
there are a number of concerns about these proposals. First, the level
proposed is very generous and would not require gas stations to
constrain their emissions until 2044—the last possible moment
that could be compatible with the UK’s legally binding target.
Large amounts of unabated gas would not be compatible with the kind of
decarbonisation targets the Committee on Climate Change suggests are
necessary to take the country on a cost-efficient path to the
target.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=208?><hs_para UID="130618120000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000039">Secondly,
it does not apply to old coal-powered stations that decide to fit new
filtration equipment to allow them to operate post-2023. Old,
inefficient coal stations may remain indefinitely on the system,
unconstrained. That could not be compatible with carbon budgets or
decarbonisation targets. A similar backstop to the one now proposed for
new coal is needed for old coal. The Government may well look at this
for marginal back-up, as peaking plant, and may provide capacity
payment via the capacity mechanism, rather than being able to
base-load. Thirdly, in support of the Carbon Capture and Storage
Association, CCS plant may need a three-year exemption from the EPS
while CCS equipment is being commissioned.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618120000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000040">The further challenge
concerns the position of renewables by 2050 and how they can be
encouraged to be a rightful part of the UK’s energy mix. We can
have renewable power only when we have them. Some say they are largely
useless because of their inherent unreliability. However, they are
vital because the resource is there and free. Will all technologies in
the Bill be equal on the starting line? Indeed, should the Bill get all
renewable technologies to the starting
line?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000041">There
is widespread agreement that the Energy Bill must empower a wide range
of new entrants to enter the electricity sector. If a more competitive,
innovative and diversified electricity sector is to be part of the
energy mix, all contributions must be encouraged to take part. However,
the Bill delivers top-down solutions that favour centralised
generation, reinforcing current patterns of ownership. Yet in Germany,
myriad new types of investor are entering the market, often for lower
returns than large utilities expect. In Britain, however, independent
generators find themselves challenged to ensure that the Energy Bill is
viable for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000042">Solar
power currently finds itself in a very difficult position. Investment
has stalled following the EU-China trade dispute. Furthermore, all
solar projects of more than 50 kilowatts are severely constrained by
the very modest capacity limits. When these modest limits are exceeded,
support reduces. The Energy Bill requires support for solar to be
either through feed-in tariffs or contracts for difference. Given the
severe constraints on FITs, this needs to be looked at again. The
generation profile of wind and solar is very complimentary. If taken
together, there are fewer extremes in capacity; intermittency need not
be an unmanageable problem. A multifaceted energy mix must not end up
in a mentality of silo solutions. A more inclusive approach, whereby
everybody is aware of their energy needs and is encouraged to
participate, could encourage up to 30% of the UK’s energy needs
to be met by community schemes and small businesses; for example,
farming and rural enterprises. That could be necessary for their own
long-term survival.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618120000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000043">An important aspect of
how the Bill will bring forward different technologies is contained in
the levy control framework, a cap on the total amount of
additional charges that can be added to consumer bills. The limit to
this spending review period is £7.6 billion, which
dictates the total value of CFD contracts that the Department of Energy
and Climate Change can enter into. Yet the Bill is unclear about how
the control framework and CFDs will work together. For example, 
<?notus-xml column=209?>when will the projects that have assigned contracts
start to be counted towards a control framework? How equal and rigid is
the allocation of support to different technologies and what will
happen in the event of underallocation in one
technology?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000044">Will
money be carried forward into future spending rounds or will it be lost
if it is not spent? The existence of a cap encourages early
application, yet what happens when a technology’s allocation is
used up? Lastly, renewable projects can apply either for the renewable
obligation or the CFD. Will projects essentially be forced to opt for
the CFD, for fear of the cut-off deadline in the RO and being at the
back of the CFD queue with no guarantee of funding? The Treasury
appears to be trying to control low-carbon spending, while allowing
uncapped spending on new centralised capacity on the grounds of
security of supply, since money allocated under the capacity market
mechanism is proposed to be outside the control
framework.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618120000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618120000045">There
are concerns that the complex design of the capacity market means that
only the large energy suppliers are likely to participate. To achieve
the full potential electricity savings identified by the
Minister’s department, it is vital that savings from SMEs and
homes are captured too. The capacity market rewards energy efficiency
only for its security benefits, not for other, much larger benefits. A
variety of policy instruments is vital to encourage innovative
solutions to all the targets. An additional policy is required to
ensure access to market, where funding for payments is decoupled from
the capacity auctions and sits outside the control framework.</hs_para>

energy efficiency would reduce the level of capacity payments needed

ideas for more technology-neutral policies, in order to set clear

am therefore pleased that the Government eventually brought forward
measures on demand-side reduction, through amendments on Report in
another place. However, as with much of the Bill, the new clauses leave
us little clearer on the Government’s plans in this area,
amounting to no more than an order-making power for the Secretary of
State to embark on pilot projects. However, the idea to allow
“negawatts” to compete against traditional megawatts is
welcome. There are concerns, though, that the capacity
market will remain the only solution to access to market. It
would be vital for the department to undertake a number of pilots using
other mechanisms to allow diversity and innovation. So far there has
been little opportunity to debate these proposals, but they can now be
peer-reviewed in your Lordships’ House in Committee.</hs_para>

welcomed the previous Energy Bill, which had energy efficiency at its

demand. It is a great concern that investment has not been forthcoming,
leading to a massive drop in jobs in the sector. The figures expected
on the situation on 27 June underline the work that needs to be done.
On Report in the other place, the key element of interconnectors to and
from the European market was introduced. This will enable a strategic
rethink of the levels and efficiency of supply-side generation. It will
have the benefit of increasing the geographical spread of balancing
energy, as so well argued by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh. As before,
much detail has to come forward for assessment of how this can be made
effective.</hs_para>

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, some time ago I had the opportunity to be
Energy Minister in Northern Ireland for three years. Although it was
only one part of my enterprise portfolio, it took up an amazing amount
of time. Many noble Lords here today have served as Ministers and will
be familiar with receiving a first-day brief from the Civil Service. In
my case, I was advised that because energy was largely privatised,
there would be little call on my time, merely a few
regulatory functions to perform. How wrong that turned out
to be.</hs_para>

vital economic as well as a national security consideration, and this
has become an even greater governmental responsibility in recent years.
We read stories that the UK nearly ran out of gas during a recent cold
spell that coincided with a breakdown in some part of the distribution

a secure and affordable energy supply is one of the key requirements of
good government.</hs_para>

Government insist that this Bill is about establishing a framework for
delivering secure, affordable and low-carbon energy. This is a
sentiment that I am sure we all share. However, there needs to be a
close examination of some of the aims and targets that we as a nation
are being asked to sign up to. I know from our experience in Ulster
that those same sentiments were shared in the 1980s and 1990s when the
then Government signed us up to availability contracts, which have
stifled competitiveness and kept energy prices unnecessarily high in
Northern Ireland for nearly two decades.</hs_para>

us stand back for a moment from the complicated clauses in the Bill and
look at what we should be doing and why. As a nation, the UK already
suffers from a lack of economic competitiveness. We have to charge out
to our customers the cost of our growing debt burden as well as our
expensive welfare system. Despite the rhetoric of the Government and
all parties, the export-led recovery has not yet happened. This is
because we no longer produce enough manufactures and services at prices
that international customers are prepared to pay. In this regard,
therefore, what does this Bill do to our international
competitiveness? Does it 
<?notus-xml column=211?>help us or hinder us? What does it do to reduce the
overall amount of carbons pumped into the world’s
atmosphere?</hs_para>

contention is that the Bill leads to a reduction in the one and merely
to redistribution of the other. I shall explain.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
competitiveness and the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
are inextricably linked. I believe that unilaterally adding cost to our
energy supply for the genuine and admirable purposes of reducing carbon
emissions here in the UK merely transfers the carbon emissions to China
and other parts of Asia and the world. By making our already high cost
base higher, it could be said that we will produce more of our energy
from clean sources. That may be right. But the net effect is that,
unless it is done simultaneously and universally by the major
manufacturing nations, we reduce the amount of manufactures we produce
and transfer that production to other places. While strides are being
made in China to control emissions, there will be increased emissions,
because China will be making the goods that we are no longer
competitively making and in addition it will take a lot of energy to
get those products to our shores from the other side of the
world.</hs_para>

addressed only internationally and the EU and UK cannot allow
themselves to get too far ahead of other nations. Otherwise, they will
merely make themselves uncompetitive for no valid purpose. I believe
that the climate is changing and that man is contributing to that

to judge. Nevertheless, I do not accept the idea that it is purely
manmade. Climate change is natural, but I believe that we are
accelerating it. We can make a difference, and we already have. For
instance, we took lead out of petrol, which has reduced dramatically
the amount of lead in the atmosphere throughout the world. So we can
make a difference, but let us keep it in

the generation of renewable energy as well as nuclear, we are talking
about adding a charge to consumers’ energy bills to subsidise
the cost of renewables and nuclear-generated electricity. This is not a
new idea, but we have to enable generators to produce electricity at a
price that will allow them to borrow the money to provide the service.
There is nothing wrong with that in principle, but the cut-in and
cut-out points on the subsidy are critical. There is a lot of widely
inaccurate speculation about what can be achieved by all this. The
truth is that no alternative sources of energy come anywhere near the
point where they could provide the UK with a constant and reliable
source of energy. Wind is currently the major alternative, whether
onshore or offshore. There is no doubt that it has a part to play, as
do other forms of renewables, but let us not exaggerate its potential.
In this country, energy demand rises during cold spells, which often
coincide with high pressure in the atmosphere. High pressure usually
means little or no wind. The classic example of this was in the winter
of 2010-11 when we had five weeks of freezing weather and little wind.
Without the traditional source of generation, we would effectively have
been out of
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:51:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000008">I
agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, who is no longer in
his place. I cannot understand the difficulty in people
grasping the fact that, even if 
<?notus-xml column=212?>we increase the amount of renewable energy from wind
and other sources, we will still have to maintain every single megawatt
of traditionally produced electricity, plus an amount to allow for
breakdowns. We know that wind does not survive high pressure and that
the other sources of renewables are vastly underdeveloped. Wind
generation will reduce the amount of energy that is produced by
traditional sources when it is functioning, but, when it is not
functioning, you need to have the back-up. Therefore, the amount of
generating capacity from traditional sources, whether fossil or
nuclear, is not going to be amended significantly in the foreseeable
future for that
reason.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000009">People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>
are not going to tolerate the electricity supply going off. I often
joke with colleagues that if the electricity went off during cup final
people would be prepared to burn Chippendale furniture in the power
stations to keep their lights
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:53:19"></hs_TimeCode>. The more
wind that you have, the less efficient become the
traditional sources of fossil fuel and nuclear supply, because that
reserve, whether it is spinning or not spinning, will become less
competitive. So the irony is that we will vastly increase the amount of
electricity capacity in this country from renewables and
non-renewables, but we still have to have the back-up. There could be
five weeks of bad weather coming down the road and, if you have a
series of breakdowns, you have to have power stations spinning, and
they are spinning as we debate this Bill today. I do not see that
people grasp that
fact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000010">Energy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:54:29"></hs_TimeCode>
from wind is great. In my own city, Harland and Wolff does not build
ships any more—it builds windmills, and that is great. But the
fact is that you have to have them backed up. Unfortunately, in a
relatively small geographic area such as the British Isles, you have
these weather patterns. Yes, we can do a certain amount with
interconnection. I pioneered the gas and electric interconnectors with
the Irish Republic, and we have an interconnector with Scotland. I
am all for that, but the electricity interconnector has two 250
megawatt cables, and one of them is bust. So nothing is totally
reliable; you have to have redundancy built in whatever the source, and
you cannot have enough of it. That is the experience we all
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:55:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000011">In
economies like India, the lights go on and off, and all the major
universities and hospitals have huge amounts of generator back-up. In

affordable
prices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:55:31"></hs_TimeCode>. I fully
support the concept of reducing our carbon footprint as best we
can—but we all know that it is vehicles that produce most carbon

mentioned. At home in Northern Ireland we have vast resources of
lignite from Lough Neagh right up through County Antrim. An Australian
mining company came to me a few years ago to say, “We could
open-cast mine it, because it is high-quality and low sulphur. We could
build a big trench up the centre of County Antrim from Lough Neagh up
to Ballymoney. We would put in an 800 megawatt power station and fill
the hole in as we go along”. You can imagine the
amount of interest that that had from the local
community, 
<?notus-xml column=213?>who saw their towns, farms and everything
disappearing into this great hole. Campaigns were launched, and I have
to say that I took a far-sighted and courageous decision as Energy
Minister to do nothing. I took the view that it should mature in the
ground and that it was there if we needed it. But

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an ambitious and
important Bill. It is ambitious in that it is trying to achieve a
unique objective—the establishment of a monitored and regulated
market, which would incorporate carbon emission reduction and
environmental sustainability by harnessing a variety of seemingly
incompatible technologies—baseload generation involving nuclear
and gas-fired CCGTs, along with biomass-adapted coal stations and
smaller renewable thermals. Alongside that there will be interruptible
renewables<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:58:43"></hs_TimeCode>, such
as on and offshore wind, hydro and small-scale, and probably as yet
unproven, technologies, claiming to be renewable—and, of course,
if you claim to be renewable, that is acceptable. Renewable is cuddly,
small and nice. It is akin to WC Fields’ snake oil. There is
basically no illness that it cannot cure. It can create jobs and reduce
unemployment; it can increase productivity—it can do almost
anything. The only thing that it cannot do is to produce electricity on
a reliable basis in great amounts. The basic amount of electricity that
we require has to come from baseload
generation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:59:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T19:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>.

substitute.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000015">It
is fair to say, however, before we go any further, that all these
different technologies have inconveniently different timescales for
development or for the life of the stations involved. Each different
form of investment will require a different form of reassurance. This
is the fundamental challenge in the creation of a new
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000016">Utilities
have been seen historically as a fairly safe form of investment. You
get a return of 7% to 9% one year after another. They can be long term.
They can be pretty safe. Demand is likely to be constant. Today,
technical uncertainty, because of the relative newness of some of the
equipment, raises questions about the possibilities of a dependence on
unproven technology, or questions of access and the interruptability of
one technology against another. We do not really know about the
maintenance of a lot of the technologies that we are talking about. We
might therefore have unreliability of a technical character that we
have not yet experienced.</hs_para>

these reasons, the business of reassuring investors is a far greater
challenge than we have had before. We have been told that we are going
to get the grand design in July—we will have the delivery plan,
the strike prices and the accommodation of capacity payments. We would
like to have most of those things before the House rises. I take the
point that this is to be incorporated within a market system. Perhaps
not all of us have been students of the United Kingdom energy markets
over the past 20 years but this is the fourth attempt that we have made
at having a market. It is by far the most challenging one. We have had
the pool system, NETA and BETTA, the three predecessors, each of which
tried to correct something that was wrong with the other one. There was
gaming or it was pooled; the next one was not quite good enough
but the one after that would be better. This is the first
arrangement that is actively seeking to incorporate within the market
system questions of climate sustainability and emission
reduction.</hs_para>

a consequence of this and European decisions, we have to reject the
coal option until such time as we have carbon capture and storage. Like
fusion, that is always going to be 15 or 25 years away, depending on
how optimistic you are. Coal is not an option, so we have hydrocarbons,
nuclear and a range of as yet, in many instances, interruptable or
unproven renewables. I am happy to have a mixture of gas and nuclear as
the main components. I am not sure that we really want to change the
character of this Bill to have, at the top, competition at all costs.
That was part of the philosophy of the privatisers in the 1980s and
early 1990s. We had a system then that, had it been taken to its
logical conclusion, would have produced electricity generation along
the lines of pre-Cavour Italy, when there was a succession of city
states all running little power
stations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000019">Our
system never quite got to that state, but it created entities that were
easy to absorb and take over. Now we rail against—or some people
rail against—the fact that there are six utilities, six big
players, which pretty well dictate everything. It is an oligopoly but
it is a regulated oligopoly, and it could be better regulated. We could
have clearer bills. We could have better tariffs. We could
have systems with greater transparency. In some respects it is the
toothlessness of Ofgem over the years which has allowed a number of
these excesses to take place. We have to recognise that we are trying
to keep many more balls in the air with our new market system than we
have attempted before. That will carry risks. If we can get it,
however, we will be able to secure the assurance that a
number of investors are waiting
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000020">I am not
totally pessimistic about the investment situation. When E.ON and RWE,
in the shape of Horizon, its nuclear company, decided to get out of
nuclear, they found a buyer, Hitachi, which was prepared to pay rather
a lot of money, albeit at this stage for real estate. Nevertheless, it
was prepared to buy access to the sites and the possibilities that
those offered. As far as nuclear is concerned, people are not totally
pessimistic and running away from it all the time. It is essential,
however, that by July we get a clear indication of the strike price,
the capacity payments and the nature of what the market structure will
be. If we can get those with clarity and transparency we will get the
beginnings of the investment that we require.</hs_para>

is a large Bill. It covers a lot of areas. There is one point about the
nuclear industry that has not really been made, although the Minister
did refer to the establishment of the new nuclear regulatory authority.
This is long overdue. When I was the chairman of the Nuclear Industry
Association, I argued that it was frightening that we were seeing the
departure of so many nuclear inspectors from the regulatory body to the
potential players in the British nuclear industry. We now have a body
that will allow the regulatory functions to be carried out in an

Mike Weightman, the chief executive, this body has achieved an
international standing that not a lot of people fully appreciate. Mike
Weightman went to Japan after Fukushima and produced a report that did
not necessarily give consolation, but it was of a rigour and authority
that established once again the very important position that the
British nuclear industry has in the world. We talk about quangos and
government bodies, but this is one that will be going out to bat for
Britain in a variety of circumstances when other countries are getting
into the nuclear business in a big
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000023">It would
be churlish of me, before I finish my remarks, not to thank the
Minister and her staff for the briefings that they have given us. I
have to say, however, that I am reminded of F.E. Smith’s words
when he said, “I may not be much the wiser but at least
I’m a lot better informed by the process”. We know that
there will be a lot of complexity in the Bill. For that reason the
Committee stage will be exciting and interesting. However, I reiterate
a point that has been made by colleagues this evening. We want to see a
lot more of the flesh that there should be on the skeleton of the Bill
before we get to Report. In Committee it may not be in quite the form
that we want, but we can look at it carefully. If we can get a market
settlement with the delivery plan in the public domain before the
recess, we will have an interesting time in Committee and at Report. I
wish the Bill
well.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/1C6AF53FD15611444FA5DEBCB14B259E74860161" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 June 2013">Tuesday,

the UK has seriously lost its way with infrastructure. As my noble
friend Lord Kerr reminded us a little while ago, unlike the Chinese, we
do hang around. We have the least developed road and rail networks of
any major country, we have struggled to expand our strategic airport
capacity, and we have been slow to create an electricity grid and
generation system fit for modern circumstances. This latter task is not
easy. As we have heard during this long debate, we have to migrate from
an era of plentiful but high-emitting coal and gas in the UK to a power
system that balances three equally valid but competing objectives:
security and reliability of supply; a substantial reduction in carbon
emissions; and the need for economically priced electricity both for
business and for consumers. The task may not be easy but we have
addressed it with too little
dispatch<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:10:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

renewables, far from being world leaders, we currently languish just
above Malta in the relegation zone of the EU nations league for the
proportion of national power produced from renewable sources. Many
other EU countries, large and small, produce getting on for 10 times
the proportion that we do in the UK. On nuclear, we overcame our
temporary reluctance in 2005, but eight years later we have yet to
contract a new generation of nuclear plants. Our storage capacity for
gas, as others have mentioned, is notably low, especially by comparison
with other countries, such as Germany. And we have failed, too, to
build sufficient interconnectors with other electricity markets
overseas, which would enable us to import more power, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Parminter, mentioned
earlier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000028">The
well flagged consequence of those shortcomings is that the UK faces
potential blackouts in the mid term and possibly even in the short
term. If they happened, that would be a terrible indictment of our
system of government—our ability to think and to plan ahead.
Indeed, it would be a national shame. Will this Energy Bill put us on
the right
track?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000029">The
Bill sets out a new approach to the operation of the electricity
market. Its cornerstones are tight emission standards, greater
certainty over the long term on carbon pricing, more revenue assurance
for low-carbon generation, and a mechanism to encourage reserve
generating capacity. The Bill, as I think most have observed, is
directionally sound but, by itself, will not meet the stiff challenges
that the UK
faces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000030">I have
long supported the value of market mechanisms in both the public and
private sectors, and I have long belonged to a consensus that is wary
of the state picking winners, of state-owned and state-run enterprises,
and of a strong directive role for government—of the kind that
we still see, for instance, across the channel in France. However, the
complexity of our national energy goals, embracing security and climate
change, as well as economic efficiency, obliges us to find the right
blend of market mechanisms and government direction, and that is very
difficult to do. We need to see real and speedy progress
towards nuclear commissioning, towards renewable rollout, towards
greater interconnection and towards improved storage capacity and
stand-by
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000031">Government
will have to ascertain that the measures in the Bill do in practice
give investors confidence, as the noble Lord, Lord Stephen, and
others have emphasised. This is critical because modernising our power
infrastructure probably requires—I suspect that the figure is
far higher than the Government have so far estimated—something
of the order of £250 billion to £300 billion of private
sector capital over the next 10 to 15 years, most of which will come
from outside the UK and from investors who, as others have noted, have
other choices, not least as worldwide investment in this sector simply
mushrooms the world
over.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000032">The
risk is that the new construct of CFD and capacity payments, which is
difficult to understand, as the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, mentioned
earlier—it is a construct designed to incentivise both
nuclear and renewables—will prove, on the one hand,
overcomplex for renewables, yet, on the other, insufficient to
encourage the replacement of our existing fleet of
nuclear plants. With the intermittency of renewables, about 
<?notus-xml column=217?>which many have spoken, and the uncertainty of gas supply in a volatile
world, which I think has been underemphasised, a substantial
contribution from nuclear is necessary to help manage national risk. Of
course, I entirely acknowledge the challenge and difficulty of doing
that.</hs_para>

forward, our politicians will have to be brave, as well as wise, and
hold their nerve, for this transformation will be expensive, as the
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned earlier. Power prices will rise,
even though the cost of some technologies—some renewables, for
instance—is reducing very rapidly and is converging on parity
with hydrocarbon technologies. Therefore, much beyond the passage of
this Bill remains to be settled, and there is many a slip ‘twixt
cup and lip.</hs_para>

Dixon-Smith:</Member></B> My Lords, it is many years since the late
Lord Flowers, who knew a great deal about the nuclear industry, said to
me that mankind had only one source of energy, and that was nuclear.
However, mankind had a choice, which was to have his nuclear power
station here or 98 million miles away. Lord Flowers knew which he
preferred. I often wonder, when I get up in the morning, how many
years’ worth of geologically stored solar energy mankind burns
off every day to enable us to live the lives that we do. Carbon dioxide
was locked in in such a way that it ultimately enabled the evolution of
mankind. We need to think about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000036">In
the Bill before us this evening, we are discussing how to provide what
I would call the procedural infrastructure to enable us to renew and
refresh the electricity and energy generating industry after
15 years of what can be described only as gross neglect.
However, that time was not totally wasted because it gave us the
Climate Change Act, which establishes a CO<Sub>2 </Sub>target for 2050.
We have to be extremely careful about what we do because everything we
do must be consistent with that target. That target is 80% of our 1990
emissions. It is the amount of emissions that this country was
producing in the 1850s, when the population was 22 million. Today we
have three times the population and it is five times the energy
consumption that keeps modern society going. It is quite an
interesting
comparison<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:20:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000037">Energy
investments by their nature are long-term, and 2050 is less than half
my lifetime away now. We heard lifetimes discussed in political terms a
little while ago, but I prefer the calendar. What we do, therefore,
must be consistent with that target. We need to think through what that
target means. I have not seen that done, so I will suggest some
conclusions. We need to determine what industries we have at present 
<?notus-xml column=218?>that give carbon emissions, or carbon-equivalent
emissions, that are so essential that they will have to continue beyond
that date.</hs_para>

list of industries is as follows. First, there is metal smelting; I
cannot envisage how we will survive without that. Next, there is cement
manufacture; again, I cannot envisage how we will survive without it.
Next, there is agriculture, particularly with regard to livestock. I
declare an interest as a farmer, but I have no livestock other than two
children and seven grandchildren. Agriculture, of course, is a
surprisingly large creator of carbon-equivalent emissions. Next, there
is aviation. There is a great problem of energy density, and I rule out
biofuels because we cannot today feed our existing population on this
planet properly, and by 2050 there will be 2 billion more of us to deal
with. Therefore, I do not think biofuels will be a viable
alternative. I include shipping for a similar reason. Energy density is
very important to those in that industry because ships carry cargo, so
the less space that is taken up by fuel tanks the
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:22:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

you have gone through that list, you are a very long way towards the
20% target that we have set. If that is the case, everything else we do
must become zero. All land-based transport, all our buildings and all
our industries must have zero emissions. That is fundamentally
important.
Encouragingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:22:52"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is already a basket of technologies that could make that
possible, but we do not know what technologies will win the economic
race, as opposed to the calendar

brings me back to the Bill for a moment. The contracts for difference
established by the Bill, it seems to me, are designed to guarantee a
return to investors for investing in new nuclear power stations in
particular. In addition, there are safeguards in the contracts for
difference to provide some protection for consumers—as far as I
am concerned, consumers and taxpayers are one and the same—as
regards long-term price increases. I do not envy those who are
responsible for negotiating those contracts. An apparently high price
today could appear to be a very reasonable price in the
longer term.</hs_para>

should explain that my view is coloured by my lifetime in farming. I
shall use the example of farm tractor red diesel because its duty is
heavily taken away. I began by paying one shilling and three and
three-eighths pence for a gallon of farm tractor red diesel. That price
was equivalent to about 1.3p. At present, the price is between 77p and
78p per litre. Those with quick minds will realise that we are talking
about a price increase of several thousand per cent for energy, and we
have been worrying about whether it might go up by 10% or 20%. Frankly,
I find that quite difficult. In fact, we do not pay society a
sufficient compliment for adaptability. I am not saying that we should
be complacent because we should do everything to keep prices
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:25:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Returning
to the contracts, a price that looks unreasonably high today might,
in 20 years’ time, be an extremely good deal for the
consumer. Therefore, it adds to the burden of responsibility on those
responsible for
negotiations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:25:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000042">The
other thing that has happened, which could not have been imagined
during the passage of the Climate Change Bill, was the advent of shale
gas, and shale oil in the United States. We know now that we have large
quantities in this country. They have not yet 
<?notus-xml column=219?>been totally confirmed and defined but they are there. We know that they
exist in large parts of mainland Europe and under the eastern
Mediterranean. We know also that there are considerable quantities in
China. One way or another, if we can overcome the problems of providing
that, it may be a very useful interim energy
source<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:26:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000043">Shale
is much cleaner than coal. More importantly, using combined-cycle gas
generators, it would be possible to use carbon capture and storage and
to make it virtually emission-free. In addition, because you could
produce clean smaller-scale power stations, you could site them near
communities so that the waste heat could be used and they would become
combined heat and power stations. That would be a revolution in power
generation. At present, most of our power stations release nearly the
same amount of energy to the atmosphere in the form of waste heat as
they supply to the customer in the form of electricity. We really need
to find a way around that

that may be daydreaming but the point is that we do not need more
interim targets for carbon emissions because that final target already
rules everything we do. It is not simply that that determines it; I am
sure that there are still unknown technologies, which we will have to
learn about and adapt to. Some of them may be more helpful than
anything we yet

Prescott:</Member></B> My Lords, I feel most inadequate as I have no
commercial interests to record either in the register or anywhere else,
except perhaps one: I was the UK and European negotiator at Kyoto.
Therefore, my interest is to continue to argue the case for climate
change—the scientific argument and the connection between carbon
and the increase in climate change. This very good debate has reflected
the different interests and the division between those who believe in
the climate change argument and those who say, “No, it is a
nonsense and we should not take any notice of it”. That was
probably very much reflected in the evidence and clash of views between
the noble Lords, Lord Lawson and Lord Stern. I think that the noble
Lord, Lord Stern, well won that argument, but I am in that school of
thought. I am an admirer of the comprehensive work that the noble Lord,
Lord Stern, has done and the major contribution he has made to the
climate change
argument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:29:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000046">The
noble Lord, Lord Lawson, was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Deben,
not as a sceptic but as a denier. You could tell from his speech that
there is no doubt that he is a denier. Perhaps I could add the noble
Viscount, Lord Ridley, to that argument. The noble Viscount is
indicating that he is not and I take his correction. However,
basically, they believe in leaving it to the market. I did not hear an
alternative from either of them. There is a great deal of rejection
about the science, what we should be doing, how it should be cheaper
and how much more efficient it should be. I must say to him that the
coal industry and perhaps a number of the banks are not the most
perfect examples of the operation of the perfect market. At the end of
the day, the state comes in and has to find the money for
them.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=220?><hs_para UID="130618130000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000047">Leaving that aside,
what we have in the powerful argument of the noble Lord, Lord Stern, is
what he actually said and what we all know: that thousands of
scientists have come to a view about the connection with climate
change. One can say that they are all wrong, but the odd voice against
them does not lead me to think, “Which side of the argument
should I take?”. I am for the connection. I think the evidence
of the weather is there, but that debate is ongoing. However, there is
quite clearly a connection. If the connection between the level of
greenhouse gases and carbon is accepted, and if we want to prevent an
increase in global temperatures, then it has to be kept at that level.
As the noble Lord, Lord Stern, has constantly pointed out, we are at a
dangerous level. One can reject the argument; once that is done, it is
easy to do anything. They can attack every proposal around because they
want to leave it to the market to decide. Evidence shows us that the
market cannot determine everything in these matters, and it often means
that a regulated framework has to be
found.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000048">Much
of this debate is about the balance of the regulated framework of the
market and government. There are many examples. I remember when I was
in Government and we convinced the industry of the need for a climate
change levy. I remember Tony Blair, the Prime Minister, ringing me up
when I was abroad and telling me that we were going to introduce a
climate levy. I said, “Oh, you mean an energy tax”.
“We don’t call it an energy tax”, he said. That
may be so, but the important point was that industry administered that
climate change. The levy that was imposed actually helped to make
industries more efficient, and that was what was proved by it. I
understand that there is a balance in the regulatory form between what
governments might do and what the private sector might do and I am
prepared to concede that there may well be something in the way that
the market
operates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000049">The
criticisms have been genuine and informative, and I am sure that in
Committee there will be good debates on serious issues. No one is
actually speaking out against the Bill. Those who criticised parts of
it were saying, “I support the Bill, but there are some things
that I don’t like”. I will not go into all the details
because they have been mentioned in an excellent manner. However, I
suppose I find myself in the same boat. I agree with a lot of the
criticism. It is not as good as it could be, but it is a Bill worth
supporting and I want to say why that is
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000050">One of my
criticisms is that there is no balance of energy policy; there is doubt
in all the areas. We do not know what is going to happen with nuclear
and we are in separate negotiations with a French state company as to
whether we are prepared to give them sufficient money to provide us
with nuclear energy in about 20 years’ time, even though
the energy gap is coming in the next 10 years. For wind turbines we
have Siemens, who want to put massive investment into my industry and

rather agree with the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, that there is a role
for coal. It might mean that a lot of money has to go into carbon
capture, but we should be prepared to recognise the role that coal
plays. Some 
<?notus-xml column=221?>40% of the energy in this country comes from coal. It might not come
from our own coal fields, but it is certainly coming from somewhere.
There is going to be a lot more about as the Asian countries
begin to develop their demand for oil and coal because
it is where 60% of their energy will come from, and that will
lead to increased prices. This Bill is not going to prevent an increase
in prices; that is one of the realities that we are going to have to
live
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000052">Biomass
has also been criticised. It is all right not to believe in it and to
attack every kind of industry for every kind of reason, but the reality
is that if you do not accept the argument about carbon, then you can
forget about the increase in carbon and just talk about price,
production and security. But if you do believe in carbon, you have got
to adjust the whole system, not only in this country but globally. That
is what Kyoto is all about: to find an agreement to reduce the amount
of greenhouse gases so that we can reduce carbon. There are challenges
coming with climate change and the horrific circumstances that people
are telling us about will come if we fail to achieve
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000053">The
uncertainty produces real problems. In my area of Humberside we have
27% of the UK’s oil refinery capacity, 20% of its natural gas,
38% of its imported coal and 17% of UK electricity generation. All of
those are an important part of the industrial base. Of course, the
Siemens investment, which is now considering coming into this area, is
plagued with uncertainty. Are we still going to have an energy policy?
Are we going into wind turbines? I think the nimbys have more
influence—and this Government gives them more—to actually
turn against wind turbines. Whatever the arguments, whether or not they
blow all the time, if you are prepared to accept that carbon is one of
the limitations in the balance of your policy, you will end up with a
different policy and leave it to the market. I know
from<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:35:05"></hs_TimeCode> historical
experience that leaving it to the market will not provide a global
solution to global problems. Why is that? Because when I was at Kyoto 1
there were only 46 nations; now there are 190 nations.</hs_para>

politicians’ role in these matters, but getting a global
solution to a clearly global problem requires a framework of consensus
that is not easy to achieve. We have to recognise that developing
countries which are looking to develop their riches, as we did in our
industrial past, will have a high carbon growth. They depend on coal
and oil and will go through our process of high carbon production. We
poisoned the world and moved on, and now we want to continue doing it

Siemens investment, which will bring billions of pounds into our area,

this Bill will achieve the kinds of things it seeks to achieve. Perhaps
it will change in Committee. I am not sure that it will secure our
energy or that it will reduce prices—I hope that it
will—but in Committee we can discuss the process and find out

the same argument, I can remember people saying that targets are not
important. I believe that they are important, but we should not depend
on targets because what we need is certainty. The noble Lord, Lord
Browne, and others have said that we should have more certainty than
targets. However, I still believe that we need the targets we set at
Kyoto. By the way, many countries have achieved them. In the United
Kingdom, not only did we achieve twice the levels set for us at Kyoto,
but a million more jobs, growth in the economy and a reduction in
gases. The argument that somehow Kyoto was a threat to employment and
growth is not borne out by the facts in Europe, which is an important
part of it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:37:10"></hs_TimeCode>. That

difference between Obama and Bush on this matter, although Obama puts
it in different words. They are still not co-operating on getting an
agreement. The international negotiations are a challenge for

Kyoto in 1997 and we set up the climate change levy in 2001. In 2006 we
introduced the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act, and the
Climate Change Act in 2008. In 2006, EU emissions trading was
established, which was copied from us—it was not as good, but
that is life—and the current Government have continued with

have followed the lead, in different forms, that Britain has given.
They can see that a statutory framework is essential if you are to
get a global solution. It is coming from the back benches, not
the Governments, because Governments are caught up with their civil

this Government are following the same framework. The criticisms I have
of this Bill are similar to the ones I have of other legislation, but
at least Britain continues to lead the way on the most essential and
difficult problem of how to deal with climate change. We need a
regulatory framework. Britain is leading the way on that and I am glad

Redesdale:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very honoured to take part in
this debate because it shows how unique the House of Lords is. I do a
lot of discussions about energy and climate change and I have not been
in a debate recently where the fundamental basis of climate change has
been questioned. Almost everybody believes that climate change is
taking place. We had more than 
<?notus-xml column=223?>200% of our normal rainfall last year. We are facing climate change and
its consequences. How do we deal with that and how do we deal with
energy generation, which is one of the biggest emitters of greenhouse
gases?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000061">We are
acting as if the Energy Bill will solve the problem. It does not matter
how well drafted this Bill is, it will not solve the problem. We have
not built enough generating capacity for a long time. I was trying to
explain this to a business audience. Politicians will not bite the
bullet and build generating capacity because a power station lasts 50
years. The decision has to be made, the money has to be found and
planning permission has to be obtained. It has to be built, it is used
and then it is decommissioned. A Government with a maximum life of five
years have to make that decision. They have to explain it to a press
running a 24-hour news cycle, which has to explain to its readers, who
are worried about last month’s bill not next
year’s.</hs_para>

culmination of that is that we have not built any power stations. There
has been great talk about it but we are going to face a generating gap.
Brownouts and blackouts are round the corner, as has been mentioned by
a number of noble Lords. I declare an interest as chief executive of
the Energy Managers’ Association. My interests are set out in
the register. At a recent conference I put up a slide and asked whether
people thought there would be an energy brownout in 2015, 2016 or 2017.
We all had those clickers and more than 80% answered 2015. British
business is beginning to get very worried about our ability to supply
power and investors in British industry see it as a major financial
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000063">There
is no panacea. Many noble Lords have raised the issue of fracking as if
it is going to solve our energy needs. The original estimate for our
reserves of shale gas was that, if we used it all, we would be energy
independent for a whole six months. Recently a report re-estimated the
amount of shale gas at between seven and 10 years’ worth. It is
an estimate, so let us take the lower figure. If we use fracking and
get shale gas, that is fantastic. We are independent until 2020 for
gas, after which it might all be gone. We just do not
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:42:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government have not been so worried about the environmental
constraints, they have been looking at pushing ahead with fracking but
they have found that the gas is unrecoverable economically in the form
it is in. America has an enormous amount of shale gas but it is in
geological fields above shale oil. It was previously seen as a waste
product and the difficulty of getting the oil out was that the gas was
in the way. Now they are going after the gas. We do not have the same
geology and we cannot claim that we are going to have a sudden bonanza.
There may well be shale gas but in its present form it is more
expensive to get out than would be economic at the
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000065">It
might be the panacea for the future but it probably will not be. To get
the shale gas out we have to drill 140 test wells and we do not
have the planning permission to do that. To recover the gas we need to
drill 1,000 wells in the north-west. Members of Greenpeace
will have a field day at all those planning permission hearings unless
we change the law on planning permission.</hs_para>

is the reality of what we are facing. We are very dependent on our
generating capacity at the moment. Many noble Lords said that Europe is
going to close down our coal-fired power stations. That is not the
case. We have not built any for a very long time. The existing ones are
very old, they are at the end of their run cycle and, in fact, we are
increasing the rate at which they are shutting. The price of American
coal has fallen as it has been displaced by shale gas so we have been
firing up a lot of coal-fired power stations to run that generating
capacity cheaply. This reduces the life-cycle of the coal-fired power
stations we had in reserve in moth
balls.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000067">We
will be reliant on natural gas. That is why I have an issue about
decarbonising the electricity grid, because if you are doing it through
natural gas, 70% of the energy is being thrown up the chimney of the
power stations producing electricity. It is far better to put it in the
grid and burn it in condensing boilers, which are about 94% efficient
and are at the point of use. There is only about a 0.5% loss on the gas
grid compared with the transmission loss on the electricity
wires.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000068">I am
not certain that contract for difference will even work. I know that
that probably puts me in a minority on this side of the House, where we
are saying that it will work. Before everyone gets excited, I remember
discussing the EMR years ago. The policy started before this Government
were in power. That is the problem with energy policy. Even though it
might not work, it is still coming through. I know that there are a
number of
reservations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000069">I
do not think that anyone will object to the Bill as we need to push
forward with the investment and the regulatory framework that means
that people will invest in generating capacity. It has been the
constant call of those who want to invest enormous amounts of money in
the industry that we have a secure regulatory framework and security
for
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000070">The
Bill must address the difference that we are facing in society today.
The concept is that energy prices will remain at the historic low of
the past 20 years. That will probably not be the case. We
will probably go back to a position where energy is a far greater
proportion of take-home pay than it has been in recent times. An
opportunity arises from the rise in energy prices. A recent report
stated that 44% of all energy used in this country is wasted. The
simplest way to reduce the cost of energy is not efficiency but demand
management at every level. We need to change the way that we view
energy and instead of saying that we need to provide more and more
energy at ever cheaper prices, we should start to pay realistic prices.
It does not matter that there may be more finds of gas. Our problem is
that China and India are starting to consider converting their
coal-fired power stations to gas, and they are closer to the
gas fields than we
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000071">I am
secretary of the All-Party Qatar Group, and had a meeting with the
Emir. I am not saying that just to drop names, although I am a very
important person, of course. This was a while back. As I went in, he
had a smile on his face because a Japanese delegation was leaving. He
said, “Do you know what is really amusing? You are coming to
talk to me about gas, but they just wanted to try to steal all your
gas”. That was after 
<?notus-xml column=225?>Fukushima and the Japanese delegation was trying to
get as much LNG as it could because they had to run their power
stations. He was laughing. I found that quite scary, because it sent
the price of gas up. Many areas will be looking for large supplies.
There are not enormous supplies of gas out there that we can go to buy
easily without political
consequences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000072">The
Bill is important. An important aspect of it should not be overlooked.
The Government have said that they will be tabling amendments to
address electricity demand reduction. Instead of just talking about one
pilot, we should be looking at how we get the whole of the population
to start changing the way that they use electricity. The place to start
is business. The organisation that I run will start by introducing a
concept called low-energy companies, where it trains a proportion of
all staff up to energy management level 1 or 2, which involves the
awareness of energy managers, and then starts to introduce energy
managers. The importance of that is that very few businesses have
energy managers. The last time we started hiring energy managers
was in the 1970s, when the oil shock hit and prices were
rising<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:49:21"></hs_TimeCode>. We can
create a vast numbers of energy managers who can massively reduce the
amount of energy that we use in British industry. That is very
attractive to large companies, and we are launching it in London Zoo,
in front of the penguin pool. We are launching it there because the
penguin pool has a problem, which is that the penguins tend to defecate
in the water. There are 100,000 litres of water in the penguin pool.
The pool has to be filtered three times a day, which has a massive
energy cost. You have to understand how to keep the animals fit and
healthy, but if you are running a business, you also have to understand
where the cost of the energy is. That is quite an interesting
one.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618130000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000073">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T20:54:34"></hs_TimeCode>
are bringing companies with more than 2 million employees who want to
do it with their employers and they want then to push it on to their
supply companies. The very real reason is financial risk. A number of
these companies have been told by their suppliers that energy prices
will probably rise by 20% a year for the next four years. That is quite
a frightening statistic. Most people are talking about much smaller
rises, but the energy companies have started to say that these larger
price rises are coming down the line. If that is the case, British
industry is going to have to do a vast amount more to make itself
efficient, or it is going to go out of business. However, the other
aspect of this is, of course, that it is not just a British problem.
Other countries around the world are facing rising energy prices.

hope this Bill is a success. I obviously believe that it will not be
held up a great deal as there are incredibly important elements in it.

source available following the Kyoto treaty. It is, as we have heard,
an expensive and unpredictable way of generating power and the
installation of offshore wind farms is considerably more expensive than
that of onshore ones. That expense will increase as the future planned
farms move further offshore into deeper waters. The industry is aware
of this and is now looking to develop floating turbines to reduce the
installation costs. Speaking as a mariner who has witnessed the odd
storm in his time—I am sure one or two other noble Lords may
have done so as well—I have grave doubts about floating wind
turbines surviving a major storm at sea, particularly in deeper water.
My doubts also extend to the development of wave power, where the same
situation applies. To be really effective, wave power has to be some
way offshore, where the waves are largest. A major Atlantic storm off
the south-west would simply blow the whole thing away.</hs_para>

side-effects of the proliferation of offshore wind farms relates to
navigation. This has certainly been exercising Trinity House,
which is responsible for the provision and maintenance of aids to
navigation. I declare a non-pecuniary interest as an Elder
Brother of that organisation, which will be celebrating its 500th
anniversary next year. Initially, the Crown Estate and the developers
of offshore wind farms had little knowledge of where ships went and
proposed sites that cut right across well used shipping lanes. I am
happy to say that things have moved on since then, and that Trinity
House and the other two general lighthouse authorities are now properly
consulted 
<?notus-xml column=227?>beforehand. However, the positioning of some
offshore wind farms has meant that shipping has often had to make
considerable deviations around them, which of course leads to greater
use of fuel and therefore greater emissions from ships.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618130000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0002.htm#130618130000081">In other cases,
shipping is squeezed into comparatively narrow channels between wind
farms. It is estimated that at these choke points, the risk of
collision is increased by more than 400%. I have said on a number of
occasions in this House that if you place an object in the sea, either
a fixed structure or a floating one, sooner or later a ship is bound to
hit it. Thankfully, many of the wind farms in the Thames Estuary are
built on sandbanks, so a ship would run aground long before it ran into
one of the turbines. However, as these wind farms move further offshore
that will not be the case, so there is a danger that two large ships
could collide and drift out of control through a wind farm, which would
be rather akin to two large balls rolling through a skittle
alley.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="130618130000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618130000082">Great
play has been made of the production of jobs but I see no real evidence
of it, certainly not in offshore wind. Once the farm is built, it
requires only 100 or so people to maintain it. As one noble Lord
mentioned, maintenance is a problem. It is not often mentioned but in
offshore wind, between 20% and 30% of the time people are unable to get
out and do the maintenance because it is too rough. They are either
sick or unable to climb the ladders if the swell is too big. I can only
hesitate at what it would be like if you had a floating wind turbine,
which would be moving. Anybody who has tried to get from one ship to
another at sea will know the problem of getting on to that turbine from
a moving ship.</hs_para>

power, which has received only a brief mention; I think it was from the
noble Lord, Lord Judd. We are blessed with a fairly good tidal range in
this country. In two areas, the Bristol Channel and the Channel
Islands, we enjoy tidal ranges of around 40 feet at spring tides, which
are second in the world only to the Bay of Fundy. There is enormous
potential for tidal power generation. Unlike wind, tides are
predictable for many years ahead and there are effectively four
movements a day—two flood tides and two ebb tides.</hs_para>

noble Lord has mentioned the proposed Severn barrage, about which we
had a debate a few weeks back, which may be because the Select
Committee in another place rubbished the idea rather effectively a week
or so ago. I have never been in favour of a fixed barrier but there are
alternatives. I understand that other developers are now looking at
alternatives such as tidal lagoons or tidal fences, as I believe they
are called. Tidal generation is proven. We know that the technology
works; the Strangford Lough installation has been working for around
four years. That, however, is a column-based installation. These suffer
from the same problems as offshore wind turbines, in that they are very
expensive to
install.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618130000085">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:04:31"></hs_TimeCode>
my mind, floating structures, which are being developed at the moment,
are better propositions. These vary but one example is that being
developed by Scotrenewables of Orkney. This is essentially a floating
tube with two extending arms, each of which has a propeller in it.
Systems such as this have great potential 
<?notus-xml column=228?>for fast-flowing estuaries such as the Severn,
Thames, Humber and Mersey—areas where, as we heard from the
noble Lord, Lord Prescott, power demand is already large and where
existing power stations would enable relatively easy connection to the
national grid. They would have the additional benefits of operating
near the surface, where the tidal flow is strongest, and would be
comparatively easy to install and
maintain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618130000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618130000086">I

tidal power. I am sure that the Government are only too well aware of

is a radical Bill. It needs to be a radical Bill because we have a
serious problem. However, it is also a flawed Bill. Many noble Lords
have pointed to some of the flaws and suggested ways of addressing
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:02:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618136000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000004">Going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:03:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:02:20"></hs_TimeCode>
back to first principles, there are three reasons why we need the Bill
so urgently. The first reason—and the one that has been the most
remarked on—is that it should be a means of achieving our
decarbonisation targets. To decarbonise our economy we need to
decarbonise electricity supply first. Without that, we cannot
decarbonise transport and we cannot decarbonise building
heating.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618136000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000005">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:00:45"></hs_TimeCode>
was pleased that my noble friend Lady Worthington, followed by other
noble Lords including the noble Lords, Lord Teverson, Lord Stern and
Lord Deben, and latterly by my noble friend Lord Prescott, set out the
case for us to take climate change seriously. It was a minority
view within this House that argued against
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:03:04"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Lord, Lord Lawson, and the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, did not express
a general view in the House. However, I would caution the Government
that that does not necessarily reflect the degree of difficulty in
explaining our commitment to decarbonisation targets to the country.
There is some scepticism there. While most of us may disagree with the
noble Lord, Lord Lawson, that does not mean that there is not a
resonance out there, and a political problem for the Government in
providing a narrative that can take consumers and business along with
them in delivering the objectives of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:03:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618136000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000006">The
second main reason, which is connected, is that a very large amount of
investment is needed regardless of whether we are meeting
decarbonisation targets— £110 billion is the
figure that has been referred to. We 
<?notus-xml column=229?>need to ensure that it is brought here. To get it,
as many noble Lords have said, we need greater certainty in what the
regulatory framework will be, or at least significantly less
uncertainty. We need that to keep the lights on and to provide for our
longer-term energy
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:04:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618136000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000007">The
third reason goes back to those who use the electricity—to
household consumers and to British business. As it stands, and I cannot
see any other way of doing it, the Bill places the whole burden of
paying for the investment that is needed on consumers. That needs to be
done in a way that does not damage British industrial competitiveness,
that is fair to domestic individual consumers and, in particular, that
will not worsen the terrible situation with regard to fuel poverty. I
am afraid that there is virtually nothing in the Bill that provides a
new regulatory framework to achieve that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618136000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000008">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:05:07"></hs_TimeCode>
therefore want to start on Part 2 of the Bill, which is the most
important part, on the issue of consumers. The provisions on consumers
in Part 5 of the Bill are, frankly, woefully inadequate. The
Government, the industry and the regulator are all under scrutiny by
consumers, and the Government need that credible narrative in
explaining their Bills, their choices and their need for energy
efficiency measures. A number of noble Lords, particularly the noble
Baroness, Lady Maddock, referred to this issue. It is not only a
question of energy efficiency but a question of fuel poverty.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618136000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000009">We could have used the
Bill to greatly strengthen the regulatory framework for the tariffs
that we charge to domestic consumers, but it was very late in the
proceedings in another place that we introduced Clauses 127
to 130, I think it is, on simplified tariffs. The Bill is still pretty
vague about how they are going to work. I appreciate that there are
political problems. The Prime Minister committed himself rather rashly
a few months ago to simplifying tariffs, and Ofgem and DECC have been
struggling to find a way of delivering that ever since. As yet, the
Bill does not actually deliver that. The late addition regarding
simplified tariffs is welcome, obviously. We all welcome
simplification, but simplification in itself does not improve either
fairness or effectiveness in driving consumers to better choices with
regard to how they use their electricity.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618136000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000010">At present, and the
noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Hereford particularly emphasised this, we have a tariff structure that
is illogical in that it both encourages the use of electricity, since
the marginal cost of electricity falls as you use more, and is socially
unjust as it hits the poor more than it does the better off. That needs
to be changed but the Bill does nothing to change it. As I understand
it, the Ofgem activity to try to deliver the simplified tariff
structure does not do anything either.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618136000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000011">Nor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:07:21"></hs_TimeCode>
does the structure ensure that the ECO mechanism, which is still in its
infancy, performs in a way to reduce fuel poverty. At the moment there
are fewer resources being devoted to fuel poverty than there were under
the old system if you combine EEC, CERT and expenditure on Warm Front.
They are also being used inefficiently. Unit costs for cavity
walls, for example, are going up. At the same time,
there are installers and workers in that area who cannot 
<?notus-xml column=230?>actually get work. That is aggravated because of the slow take-up of the
Green Deal, but it would have applied in any case. At the moment the
ECO is not quite a poll tax but it is close to one, and it is deeply
regretted. It also disproportionately falls on electricity consumers as
against gas consumers. There is no real logic in that. If we are
discussing tariff reform, these issues also need to be
tackled.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618136000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000012">Tackling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:08:20"></hs_TimeCode>
fuel poverty and providing for improved domestic energy efficiency need
to be a central part of the energy strategy, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Maddock, and my noble friend Lord Judd emphasised. The original
part of the Bill concerned with consumers, when it first went to the
House of Commons, was timely and related to redress. Indeed, we need to
do something about redress; my noble friend Lady Liddell was pointing
to the number of cases where there are problems of mis-selling to
consumers. However, the provisions are pretty weak, as is the
enforcement. For example, I do not understand why mis-selling redress
is limited to five years. That is not the situation with financial
services; a lot of the PPI claims that are going on go back years and
years, so I do not understand why energy should be restricted in this
way. There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:09:13"></hs_TimeCode> is
also no provision for collective redress, which would be the most
effective way of dealing with past problems.</hs_para>

pretty heavily on these consumer matters. My general approach is very
similar to that of my noble friend Lord O’Neill, who has
regarded, as I have, Ofgem as being pretty toothless in this area over
many

turn to a couple of other parts of the Bill that have been less
remarked on. On nuclear regulation, again I agree with my noble friend
Lord O’Neill that we need the ONR to be set up and that all
parties are key to that. However, I do not understand why we have 50
clauses setting up the ONR when it is essentially a simple task of
transferring the responsibilities from what was an agency of the HSE
and putting it on to a statutory basis. We have 50 clauses and, I
think, 60 pages of schedule setting up the ONR. Before we
come to that part of the Bill in Committee, I think that the Minister
and her officials need to set out where the responsibilities, duties
and resources are actually different from those of the HSE and the ONR
acting in shadow form within the HSE. Obviously there are advantages in
having an independent quango of a new sort with new governance, as it
can escape some of the restrictions on civil service pay and attract
nuclear inspectors and others with expertise at rates which the market
is now throwing up. This would keep it out of the restraints that are
being imposed by the Treasury. I do not suppose that that was greatly
remarked upon in Treasury circles, but it is the main and most
immediate advantage of having the ONR put on a new basis. I largely
approve of that. However, does it require all this
superstructure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:11:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

ask whether the Minister can point out where these requirements on
provisions for strategy and policy statements differ from the
requirement on national policy statements that we already have on
energy matters. I am not sure whether this is a step forwards or a step
backwards in terms of the transparency of the Government’s
strategic
thinking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:11:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

go back to Part 2 and energy market reform. Contracts for difference is
a bold innovation, as has been pointed out, and in this exact form it
has no parallel anywhere else in the world. When first proposed, it was
greeted with scepticism by supply companies and others, but we have
moved on and seem to be accepting that this is the only show in town. I
agree with that. However, we have to recognise that it is, in some
ways, a very odd proposition—particularly, if I may say so,
coming from what is supposed to be a free market oriented
Government.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618136000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000017">It<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is neither a free market nor, of course, a command economy, but it has
aspects of both. At the moment, it is all about the Government
providing very long-term contracts that are technology-specific and, in
many cases, location-specific, to large individual oligopolistic
companies, effectively giving them a price guarantee for 10, 25 or 35
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>. While
that is not quite Gosplan, it is, shall we say, a little more Vladimir
Putin than Milton Friedman. It is a partially centrally controlled
system operated through an oligopoly. During the course of the Bill and
once we have seen the draft delivery plan, we hope to be able to insert
a little more competition and choice into this process, and
a little more ability to have break points in
the contracts where we can review, in the light of economic,
technological and environmental change, whether they are still
appropriate. However, that depends on a proper regulatory framework. I,
like many other Lords, hope that the Minister can guarantee that if we
get to Report stage in the autumn, we will have at least some of the
major pieces of draft secondary legislation before us so that we can
see what we are
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618136000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000018">Probably
all I can do now is put to the Minister the questions that have largely
already been asked and ensure that she covers all these points. On
CFDs, that includes whether she can give us an indication of the likely
length of the contracts, whether there will be a break point and what
exactly is the role of this rather shadowy counter body. Is it correct
that it will be a public body now and that there will be only one of
them? I believe that is the case, but we need to be quite clear what
the nature of the body is and whether, even if it is a semi-private
body, it clearly has the backing of the Government, as my noble friend
Lord Davies

independent generators easily access this system and bring different

community and other one-off generation schemes? Other noble Lords
pointed to a potentially damaging hiatus between the ending of the ROCs
system and the full effects of CFDs coming into play. Are the
Government prepared to envisage extending the demise of ROCs beyond
2017? If not, a number of serious investment projects will be stalled.

Government have to answer a lot of questions on CFDs, as well as some
on the capacity mechanism. A major improvement appears to be the
recognition by the Government in Clause 37 that energy demand reduction
and energy efficiency in general should be part of the approach of the
capacity mechanism. The provision of energy demand reduction within the
electricity distribution system itself—as distinct from action
at the user end—must surely be a standard part of the capacity
mechanism procedure. We therefore do not want just one, two or three
pilot projects, but to work towards a situation where that is part of
the capacity mechanism as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

regulations on the capacity mechanism. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson,
and my noble friend Lord Grantchester said that we need to clarify the
position of unabated coal-fired power stations that are extending their
lives beyond 2023, when the EPS does not apply to them. They could
benefit from the capacity mechanism if they made their capacity

asked questions relating to interconnection. I asked whether the
capacity mechanism would be capable of being delivered via arrangements
on interconnections with the French nuclear system or Irish
wind farms. If so, would they be treated as available energy or
capacity in roughly the same way as domestic-based generation? The
noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, also asked about storage, which is a part of
the availability of

Government have a number of questions to answer. Colleagues will be
pleased to hear that I have not gone through my full list and that I do
not intend to do so. However, I will return in part to one of the most
contentious issues: the decarbonisation target. I am in favour of
strengthening the commitment to a decarbonisation target. The very weak
provision in Clause 1(5) which simply allows the possibility of a 2030
target but does not require it, and in any case not before 2016, has
already had a detrimental effect on confidence and understanding.
Investors need to know that we are on a clear trajectory on this. Most
of the investment decisions that will be contemplated in the next two
or three years will relate to a period beyond the current target of
2020. If the House alters nothing else in the Bill, assuredly we must
alter
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/80EFA16D3435BB270E51296A3BEBF76391F42B22" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 June 2013">Tuesday,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy
and Climate Change (Baroness Verma):</Member></B> My Lords, I start by
thanking all noble Lords for their contributions in this debate. They
have been wide-ranging but very informative. I particularly thank noble
Lords who worked with me through the informal scrutiny
group. Overall, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that there
seems to be an overall sense of support for the Bill. Of course, there
will be plenty of opportunity to scrutinise it thoroughly in

debate, I emphasised how vital this Bill is, not just for the
UK’s growth and jobs but, as noble Lords have said, for
consumers across the country. This legislation marks a significant
reform of the electricity market and it is important for industry,
investors and consumers that we get it right. With that in mind, I look
forward to debating the Bill in the spirit of collaboration. A large
number of questions have been raised today and I will cover as many as
I can in the time given, but I am sure that in the coming days I will
have many opportunities to answer in more detail the questions that may
not be answered
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618136000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000027">I
thank the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, for her overall support for
the Bill, but I was slightly surprised and perhaps a little
disappointed that she made a political point and overlooked the absence
of investment and forward planning under the previous Government. The
noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, made the point that the Bill is not a
panacea but goes a long way to building long-term certainty for
investment and energy security. As I listened to the noble Lord, Lord
Prescott, I thought that this was perhaps the only Bill on which he and
I will have so much in common. He is absolutely right. Without
political will we cannot build political consensus. Globally, we have
become the leaders in this area because we have gone out to build
political
consensus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618136000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000028">Beginning
with the decarbonisation target range, a number of noble Lords asked
why we do not set it now. As I said in my opening speech, the Bill
enables the Secretary of State to set a legally binding decarbonisation
target range for the power sector in Great Britain. This should be in
2016, when we are due to set in law the level of our economy-wide fifth
carbon budget, covering the corresponding period. At that point, we
will receive advice from the Committee on Climate Change on the level
of the fifth carbon budget.</hs_para>

important that we do not set a target range in isolation. It must be
done in the context of considering the pathway of the whole economy
towards our 2050 target. It will also make sure that we do it in a way
that minimises costs both to the economy and to taxpayers as a whole.
Noble Lords said that it would be detrimental to investor certainty. I
agree that investor certainty is absolutely essential to delivering our
energy and climate goals at least cost, and considering investor
certainty must be a fundamental part of our policy. We will continue to
take practical steps to decarbonise the economy, while ensuring
security of supply at the least cost to the consumer.</hs_para>

to electricity demand reduction, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of London and others asked about the prepayment schemes. I want to put
on 
<?notus-xml column=234?>record that both prepayment and a capacity market approach are similar,
in that they provide a payment for proving efficiency savings and are
agnostic about where those savings are delivered. However, on balance,
a capacity market was preferred, as it enables you to target reduction
during valuable peak periods, and allows electricity demand reduction
to compete against supply, ensuring that EDR is rewarded for the value
that it provides to the system. It also avoids the need to create an
additional delivery mechanism for electricity demand
reduction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:25:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618136000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-0003.htm#130618136000032">The
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London and others asked about the
flexibility to run more than one type of pilot for EDR. The spending
power set out in Clause 37 allows the Government flexibility to run a
pilot to test different approaches to incentivise electricity demand
reduction. The Government will provide further detail on the pilot
proposals as soon as

noble Lords are concerned about putting the interests of consumers at
the heart of what we are doing, and I agree completely that it is
crucially important. That is why we have other measures alongside the
Energy Bill that put consumers at the heart of being able to control
their energy usage. That is why we are rolling out the smart meter
programme alongside other measures such as the Green Deal, enabling
people to change behaviour, which will assist in ensuring that we
reduce our energy use. We have to inform consumers about how their

turn to climate change, and noble Lords who are slightly sceptical
about global warming and climate change. I am not a scientist, and I
suspect that many in this Chamber today are not scientists, but
renowned scientists are showing us that much is going on that is
evidence of climate change. The summer extent of Arctic sea ice has
declined by a staggering 40%. The Antarctic peninsula has warmed by
more than 3 degrees centigrade. Glaciers in the high Canadian Arctic
lost 580 gigatons of ice between 2004 and 2011 alone. These are serious
figures, and we need to ensure that we take seriously climate science

number of noble Lords talked about fuel poverty, among them my noble
friend Lord Cathcart, the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, and my noble
friend Lady
Maddock<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:28:06"></hs_TimeCode>. The
coalition is committed to doing all that is reasonably practical to end
fuel poverty in England by 2016 and to helping people, especially
low-income, vulnerable households, to heat their homes more affordably.
The number of households in fuel poverty reduced in 2010 and again in
2011, although fuel poverty remains a huge challenge. A combination of
rising wholesale energy prices and poor quality housing stock in
Britain has meant that, despite significant investment, a large number
of households are still in 
<?notus-xml column=235?>fuel poverty. I congratulate the previous Government for trying very
hard to tackle that issue, and we are working and building on that.
However, with energy prices projected to continue to rise, improving
the thermal efficiency of Britain’s housing stock is key to
addressing that urgent issue. That is why the Green Deal and the energy
company obligation are flagship policies for improving the energy
efficiency of our nation’s housing stock.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T21:29:12"></hs_TimeCode> addition, the
Government have a range of policies to address other contributing
factors of fuel poverty, including the one-house discount, which helps

that customers are on the cheapest tariff in line with their
preference, the payment method that they have chosen and whether they
have opted for standard variable rate tariffs, or a fixed-term or
fixed-price tariff. The power in the Bill will allow us to require
customers on poor, value-dead tariffs to be moved on to the cheapest
standard variable rate tariff that the supplier offers. It will also
require customers on fixed-price tariffs to be moved to the cheapest
standard variable rate tariff that the supplier offers if they do not

continues to work closely with me, and if any other noble Lord wishes
to raise a concern, my doors are always open. I encourage noble Lords
to use either or both of these avenues in order that the Bill might
make progress to Royal Assent without delay. I am sure that noble Lords
will concur with the statement that I have made, and on that
note I urge the House to support this Bill and give it a Second

all relate to the proposed reporting duty placed on the Secretary of
State in Clause 20 in relation to the creative industries. We welcome
this proposal but the amendments, taken collectively, do two things:

Lordships will recall that the seeds of this debate are to be found in
the discussions held on the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill last
Session, in particular the amendments put down to the Bill in Committee
by the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin of Roding and Lord Clement-Jones, and
others, which led the Minister to convene various meetings and, after
discussion, to agree to introduce this proposal. Discussions of this
type always make for better legislation, do they not? However,
rereading the debate reminds me that then, as now, our aspirations were
for a rather more expansive report than is currently
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:31:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000005">Like
the Government, our amendments start from the position that IP is a
hugely important component of this country’s economy. As the

we heard during the discussion of the ERR Bill, IP is at the heart of
our economic success in this sector. The creative industries support
around 1.5 million  
<?notus-xml column=42?>jobs and create more than £36 billion annually to UK GVA,
calculated by the DCMS creative industries group. As a result of our
belief in the importance of the creative industries, we believe that
the annual report should not be limited, as the Government propose, to
a view from the IPO, interesting though that undoubtedly would be.
Surely the effect of the annual report should be a much broader review
of the state of the copyright industries in the United Kingdom. The
test is whether such a report will provide sufficient material to
provide a discussion of how we are doing as a nation. It is not
sufficient merely to hear how the IPO is doing in relation to its role
of balancing the interests of intellectual property holders with the
wider interests that the public may have in the extensive benefit that
can be received from the early dissemination of information, knowledge
and material.</hs_para>

our view, it will be necessary for the annual report to cover plans for
changes to legislation relating to IP and copyright; details of the
expected impact on job creation; progress in supporting innovation; the
impact of policy on economic growth more generally in the United
Kingdom; engagement with other related government departments;
engagement with stakeholders and details of lobbyists who have been in
contact with the IPO; information concerning consumer behaviour and
habits regarding the use of and access to copyright-infringing material
and the subsequent economic impact; information containing manipulation
of the internet search market; the impact of voluntary and
non-voluntary action in tackling copyright infringement; and
information about cross-border co-operation between our own
jurisdiction and jurisdictions in the European Union and elsewhere.
That is a long list, but it makes the point that what is needed is not
so much a single point of view from the IPO but a broader conspectus of
the current and future situation in this vital sector of our
economy.</hs_para>

it does expose one of the difficulties we face and which was faced to

has contributed to growth and innovation. If it is not protected, if
there are too many exceptions, the incentive for people to do the work

and depend on its inventions and innovation to keep ahead of the rest
of the world—in some cases I fear that we need to be catching up
with the rest of the world, but that is very much part of this
Government’s whole approach to these matters—we must
recognise the very important role that IP plays in all this. The issues

will deal with the other two amendments rather more briefly. The clause
says that the Secretary of State should lay the report before
Parliament. I do not think that that is enough. The legislation should
call for a Statement, including the findings of the report and the
action the Government intend to take. It should not just be lost in the
tangled undergrowth of the huge tide—sorry, I am mixing my
metaphors—of written reports to Parliament, of which there
appear to be an increasing number. This is sufficiently important that
we should require a Statement by a Minister in the House, which can of
course be subject to question and answer. It will be open then to
individual Members to decide if they wish to take steps to have the
report

28 seeks to demonstrate the link between the role in promoting
innovation and economic growth and the protection and promotion of IP;
otherwise, one may find that intellectual property and rights
owners’ ability to protect and monetise their rights will be
seriously weakened in what it appears will be presented in the guise of
pursuing economic growth. The Government are consulting on how they
define and measure the creative industries in such a way that digital
and tech companies will be classified as creative industries. I look
forward to my noble friend correcting me, but I am concerned that,
taken together, these two things could mean that the relaxation of IP
rights, particularly copyright, would actually benefit the creative
industries, when in truth they would benefit US-based and,
increasingly, China-based global tech companies to the detriment of the
UK creatives. Therefore, this amendment is intended as a safeguard for
UK creatives and to ensure that the IPO takes into account how its

inventions and techniques have improved lives again and again,
particularly since the Industrial Revolution. Intellectual property
laws and their intelligent enforcement are essential for the
stimulation of innovation. As my noble friend Lord Stevenson said, we
need a robust system of intellectual property legislation. However, I
contend that it is not always the case that strong intellectual
property rights—and their strong assertion—improve
economic performance or are an unmixed benefit to society. Incentives
and rewards to inventors, innovators, creative people and investors
need to be balanced against the public benefit of wider and quicker
diffusion of knowledge, and the lower prices that may result from early
competition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000025">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T15:46:30"></hs_TimeCode>

costs and benefits of monopoly, and, where monopoly is mitigated, of
licensing. It has to be made on the appropriate length and breadth of a
particular patent. It has to be made on whether the price in economic
inefficiency of restricting the diffusion and use of knowledge is
outweighed by the benefit of increased innovation. The appropriate

research and innovation have been discouraged. Research efforts can be
distorted where patents exist. A competitor business may be more
attracted to coming as close as it can to copying an existing patent
that is seen to be a money-spinner than to developing a new product or
embarking on innovation in a new area. We have seen that in the

will say a word about genes. I was Minister for Science between 1990
and 1992. The most difficult decision I had to take as a Minister in
government was whether we should allow gene patenting in this country.
All my instincts and values were against it, but I was driven to take
the view that we had to do it. We had unfortunately had poor funding
settlements for science from the Treasury in recent years and it was
difficult to see how British scientists would be able to stay in the
game of the human genome project. At the same time, the US Supreme
Court and subsequently the US Patent and Trademark Office had made it

“discovery of genes”? It was not the invention of genes;
it was precisely discovery. It seemed to me wrong that natural genes
should be patentable. Knowledge of that kind ought to be disseminated
as rapidly as possible for the benefit of humanity. There were vast
potential benefits, obviously, in the field of health. Of course, when
patenting became established, there was a headlong rush to patent.
Among the companies that were successful in that competition, Myriad
Genetics patented two human gene mutations that affect the
susceptibility of people to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Having
secured those patents, they demanded licence fees even from
not-for-profit laboratories. In that way, the existence of patents
discouraged screening and discouraged the search for improved screening
technologies. The medical benefits arising from the human genome
project were restricted.</hs_para>

computers, and super-strong and super-light composite materials.
Graphene is hardly yet commercially viable, but the race is on to
patent in the area of graphene. I understand that, in May, UK
businesses and universities held 54 patents in relation to graphene; US
businesses and universities held 1,754; and Chinese businesses and
universities held 2,204. What intellectual property regime in relation
to graphene will be in Britain’s and in the world’s

projections. We should not deprive the developing world of the
knowledge that will enable its economies to grow and allow them to be
rescued from poverty. If billions and billions of people are to live in
poverty unnecessarily, because of the restriction of knowledge to the

shouts loudest. I believe that Amendment 28ZA would strengthen the IPO

direct relationship between intellectual property and job creation is

Committee an example. Last year, the Government consulted on proposals
to amend Section 60(5) of the Patents Act 1977 to provide an exception
to patent infringement for activities involved in preparing or running
clinical or field trials, which use innovative drugs. This change would
allow third 
<?notus-xml column=51?>parties to carry out a limited set of activities using another
person’s patent-protected product in order to develop and assess
the safety and efficacy of new pharmaceuticals. Responses to the
consultation suggested that current UK legislation makes the UK a less
attractive location to carry out this work compared with countries with
broader exceptions. This may have economic implications for the
pharmaceutical and clinical trials sectors, including loss of skills
and expertise if trials are run abroad. The report will need to
consider examples such as these where the use of intellectual property
may help stimulate growth in the economy as a whole. I can assure noble
Lords that in such cases it will indicate how the Intellectual Property
Office has sought to balance the interests of rights holders and
users.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000049">Amendment

the noble Lord has defined this phrase to be not just UK-focused but
global in scope. I entirely agree with what I believe is the principle
behind the noble Lord’s amendment, that the wider interests of
society are important in the context of IP rights. I can assure the
noble Lord that the report will indicate where other policy objectives
have been taken into account, alongside economic

public health, or international development considerations have taken

26C, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara and Lord
Young of Norwood Green, seeks to place some requirements on the
detailed contents of the report. Before responding directly, I should
like to take the opportunity give the Committee some detail on what the
report will contain. I will add that, as with all government agencies,
the IPO already produces an annual report and accounts, containing an
assessment of the development and performance of the organisation
throughout the year, together with financial accounts. The IPO’s
future plans are contained in the corporate plan published in spring
each year and agreed with me as IP Minister on behalf of the Secretary
of State. This plan also contains the targets that I set for the IPO
and by which its performance is to be judged.</hs_para>

the report will provide information on legislative changes and any
pre-legislative work such as consultations. Economic estimates will be
taken from impact assessments. Looking back to the previous financial
year, as an illustration, this would include the copyright
measures  
<?notus-xml column=52?>in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act and the designs consultation

the report will address the Intellectual Property Office’s
activities in international negotiations and cross-border co-operation.
An example is the work that is being done to deliver a unitary patent

the report will discuss policy development work that has been
undertaken to address the challenges facing the intellectual property
system. These will change as time passes, but copyright licensing in
the digital age is a good example of a current challenge that the IPO
has been working on and which, therefore, the annual report would cover
next year and for as long as it remains
relevant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000055">Fourthly,
the report will highlight the main outputs of the Intellectual Property
Office’s economic research programme and how they relate to
innovation and growth. Recent studies, for example, have examined the
incentives provided by patents and the use of alternative methods of
protecting innovation. The report will also summarise the findings of
evaluation exercises. The first of these was published last month and
concerns the Lambert toolkit, which contains model
agreements and a framework for university and business collaborations.
The toolkit was developed by a working group of interested parties,
supported by the IPO. The research showed that the toolkit has had a
positive influence on some innovative research partnerships between UK
universities and

the report will provide an assessment of the IPO’s activities
that support businesses and raise awareness of the importance of
protecting intellectual property. Through its seminars, exhibitions and
workshops, the IPO reaches over 25,000 businesses per year, including
around 18,000 direct contacts. The report will include information on
the work the office has undertaken in partnership with other
organisations, such as the MusicBiz competition for young people, run
with UK Music, and IP audits provided to small and medium-sized
enterprises and funded by the IPO. When data are available, it will
provide an assessment of the impact that such work has had. The report
will also contain data that support the assessment made in the report.
This will include statistics on the number of IP rights granted by the
office, the use of international systems, such as those run by the
World Intellectual Property Organisation, and any relevant evidence on
enforcement and
infringement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000057">Amendment
26C would specify particular issues to be reported on. Where the IPO
has acted on those issues, I assure noble Lords that they will be
included in the report. However, as I have already noted, the
challenges facing the intellectual property system will change from
year to year. It is for this reason that the clause does not specify
individual issues that will be considered. For example, 10 years ago,
the proposed European directive on software patents was a matter of
great topical interest. If the IPO had at that time produced a report
on the impact of its activities on innovation and growth, these
negotiations would have 
<?notus-xml column=53?>been discussed. However, the directive was rejected by the European
Parliament in 2005 and debates have moved on. If we had passed
legislation at that time that stipulated specific items on which to
report, the Government would have been required to report on its
activities in this area every following year, even when no such
activities took place. Alternatively, the Government would have needed
to return to Parliament to make changes through primary legislation to
ensure that the report remained
relevant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000058">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:19:41"></hs_TimeCode>
26C would also require the report to set out the plans for legislative
change for the next 12 months. The purpose of the clause is
to create a duty to report, not to set the forward programme of
activities for this or any future Government’s IP policies.
Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:17:33"></hs_TimeCode> Lords will
of course be aware that the Government cannot pre-empt the gracious
Speech in any year, but following the publication of the legislative
programme each year, plans for primary legislation, as well as any
secondary legislation, are set out in the Intellectual Property
Office’s corporate plan. It is therefore neither appropriate nor
necessary to include these details in the annual report on innovation
and
growth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000059">Amendment
27 would require the Secretary of State to make a statement detailing
the findings of the report and the actions he intends to take as a
result. The clause already commits the Secretary of State to lay the
report before Parliament. So it will be a Written Statement to
Parliament by the Secretary of State and, each year, the report will be
placed in the Libraries of both Houses. I have already referred to the
IPO’s corporate plan, which sets out its future programme of
work and priorities. The annual report on innovation and growth will be
one of a number of pieces of evidence that feed into the business
planning process leading to publication of the corporate
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000060">Amendment
28 concerns the information that should be considered in producing the
report. It would require that the Intellectual Property Office carry
out consultations and investigations to inform the production of the
report. It would also require the Government to consider any responses
collected by the IPO in response to any consultations or investigations
carried out for the purpose of producing the report. In particular, the
amendment refers to any assessment the Government might make of the
effective operation and protection of IP rights licensing in promoting
economic growth. The report will focus on the activities of the
Intellectual Property Office during the financial year under review and
is not intended to be a Hargreaves-like review of the effectiveness of
the intellectual property system. If research has been commissioned to
measure the impact of the IPO’s activities on IP rights
licensing, then I can assure noble Lords that the results of that
research would be taken into account as part of that year’s
report. At present, the Government have no plans to run consultations
for the sole purpose of producing the report, but if consultations of
this nature are conducted, I assure noble Lords that any responses will
be
considered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000061">Finally,
I turn to Amendment 28ZA, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of
Newport, which would require the report to include information
detailing approaches made to the Government and the Intellectual 
<?notus-xml column=54?>Property Office by interested parties. The noble Lord has raised an
important issue. The Government are committed to transparency, as I
said earlier, and I have therefore considered how information on the
IPO’s engagement with interested parties can be provided in a
way that is proportionate. I have therefore asked the chief executive
of the IPO to publish on a quarterly basis the names of external
organisations with whom he has had meetings. I already disclose details
of my meetings on the government website, as do all Ministers, special
advisers and Permanent Secretaries. The extension of this practice to
the chief executive of the IPO is at the forefront of efforts to
increase transparency in policy

will now address some of the questions raised in the debate. The noble
Lord, Lord Stevenson, asked whether the annual report was not just a
view about the Intellectual Property Office. He argued that it should
be wider and suggested that it should be a report on how we are doing
as a nation. The report will be the view of the Secretary of State,
taking into account the extensive wider relationship that the IPO has
with the creative and innovative industries. I hope that the earlier
answers that I gave clarified and provided an answer to that general
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:22:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000065">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, made a number of references to the
importance of the creative industries. He was right to do that. As I
said during the passage of the ERR Act, the Government fully recognise
the importance of the creative industries. They have also done much for
UK creators, and are doing more, including supporting the design sector
through the Bill. We are pressing ahead with the anti-piracy measures
of the Digital Economy Act. We are also supporting the creative
industries abroad through our growing IPO attaché network, which
provides practical support to UK businesses by building relations with
intellectual property agencies in host countries and improving the
influence of the UK overseas. The UK now has attachés in China,
India and Brazil, and is recruiting a fourth attaché for
south-east Asia. However, the intellectual property system is not there
to support just one sector. It is right that we look across the economy
to its impact on a range of sectors. To that extent the noble Lord
makes a fair
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:23:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000066">My
noble friend Lord Jenkin suggested that it was not enough to report
facts to Parliament, but that the report should set out proposed
actions in a statement. 
<?notus-xml column=55?>As I said earlier, the report will be laid before Parliament, and
publication announced by Written Ministerial Statement. I always
welcome the opportunity to debate intellectual property issues with
Members of the House, and it is of course open to any noble Lord to
call a debate. Therefore I do not consider it necessary that we put
this requirement in the

noble friend Lord Jenkin also questioned whether exceptions would
weaken the incentive to invest in intellectual property. However,
exceptions can create opportunities for others, with little or no harm
to the owners of rights. How does it harm an author if someone copies
extracts of her work in the course of non-commercial research into it,
or if blind people can read it in accessible form? The Government are
introducing exceptions to create growth and value; not to transfer it
between one interest group and another. The Government are looking for
the right balance between many interests, as I am sure my noble friend

Howarth, asked how we would define what is new and what is original. In
many cases, it is easier to know originality when one sees it rather
than to attempt to define it. The noble Lord makes a fair point but the
courts have a fairly settled approach to this so I hope that he will
accept that they have the ultimate sanction on making decisions on that

noble Lord commented that strong intellectual property rights are not
always beneficial. The Government agree with the noble Lord that a
balance needs to be struck between IP rights holders and users. I know

an interesting point about graphene and whether the annual report would
mention it. I am interested in this particular invention because when I
last visited the Intellectual Property Office I was given an
interesting briefing on this matter. It is one of the issues that the
IPO is taking extremely seriously. However, we cannot say in advance
what the report might say on individual issues, including graphene, or
on particular technologies. The report will focus on the activities of

development would take place through patent thickets and he cited the
example of the pharmaceutical sector. The IPO has published a report

further research from academics to understand if there is a particular
impact on small and medium-sized businesses. The annual report will

the restriction of knowledge in the developing world. Our vision is
that it must cover both incentives to invest in, for example, new

The noble Lord also commented on the impact of international treaties,

a further issue concerning patents and asked whether patents were

that the IPO only grants patents with a high presumption of validity.
Its patent-granting process, the first in the world to achieve ISO

take a significant enough step forward and are capable of industrial
application are deemed to be worthy of patent protections. I hope that

noble friend Lord Clement-Jones asked how we will ensure that the
report is evidence-based. That is a fair point. The IPO has established
an ambitious programme of research to improve the evidence base on
which to develop policy. This will be a significant contribution to the
report. All research carried out by the IPO is conducted in an open and
transparent way. It works closely with industry stakeholders and
academics to ensure that the research programme is relevant and

Howarth, asked whether the Government can go further when providing
information on meetings with stakeholders and commit to providing
details of the discussions that take place. He asked about that on a
previous occasion and I gave an answer. I reiterate that the current
practice is to record the main topic for discussion—for example,
when the chief executive meets whoever to discuss copyright. The IPO,
like any government agency, is subject to the FOI Act. If a request
were received for more information, it would be considered in light of
the requirements under the FOI Act.</hs_para>

addressed nearly all the questions raised. It has certainly been a
wide-ranging debate. I have explained the Government’s
intentions behind the report and provided noble Lords with details of
what it will contain. Including such details in the legislation would
reduce the ability of the report to adapt to reflect new challenges.
Instead, we could be faced with a report that provided information on
issues that were less topical unless we returned to Parliament to amend
the law through primary legislation. I hope that this will provide
sufficient reassurances for noble Lords. I ask them to withdraw or not

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all speakers in
this shortish debate. It was of high quality and we covered a lot of
ground. It was particularly good that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was
able to stay for it. My noble friend Lord Young quipped that in these
modern times perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, given his skills,
might clone himself and appear in two places at once. I quipped back
immediately that that would almost certainly be, if it is not already,
a crime under the intellectual property Act. It probably will be
shortly and he could go to prison for trying it. We decided that that
was not worth pursuing. I am sorry about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:33:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618116000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000083">The debate raised a
lot of issues. I thank the Minister very much indeed for his
response—it was one of the best that I have heard in this
Committee or in many others. He covered the ground extremely well,
picked up every point and answered most of our questions in a very
satisfactory way. In terms of what we are doing—trying to probe
and get a sense of where the report will be coming from—I think
that we are well
satisfied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:33:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618116000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000084">However, the point is
that the legislation does not quite say what the Minister said in his
response. In the Explanatory Notes are simply two lines on the report
in paragraph 91, which
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130618116000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000119">“The
report will cover new legislation and policy developments, including
those related to copyright licensing, as well as the services delivered
by the IPO”.</hs_quote> 
<?notus-xml column=58?><hs_parafo UID="130618116000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000108">Given that the
Minister spoke for some 10 minutes about what the report also
contained, I wonder whether there is a bit of a gap between the written
word and what we have heard. It may be possible to come up with a
better formulation in the Bill, and we may want to come back and work
further on that on Report. However, we are not far apart on this and,
clearly, if the report does cover all the issues that the Minister
listed, we would be well satisfied with that, in so far as it
goes.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130618116000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000085">However,
underlying the response was the nagging doubt about authorship. Who
holds the pen in this report? That is the question we have to look at.
The Minister, several times, said that it was okay because the
Secretary of State would respond, not the noble Lord himself—as
the Minister responsible for IP—or even the chief executive of
the IPO. Later on, he changed that and said that it was
“a” Secretary of State. However, there is not only one
Secretary of State in the Cabinet and the Government. There is another
Secretary of State, who currently has responsibility for the
DCMS—although, if the rumours are to be believed, not for much
longer—and who of course speaks for creators, appears at
meetings speaking on intellectual property and sometimes appears with
the Minister when the Minister is in his guise as intellectual property
tsar. It is fairly obvious from those who attend these meetings, and I
have heard a number of reports of them, that a differential approach
comes across. It is impossible for the Government to have a single
voice on this when the responsibilities are split. One point that has
come through, in all the presentations that we have had this afternoon,
is that the Government are not currently speaking for the balance of
the two aspects. There is a sense here of an uncompleted need to
address this issue. We might well come back to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:36:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000086">The
second point is that, within our debate, we picked up on a theme that
has emerged in all our Committee sessions and which may run through to
the end of this Bill. There is a growing unease about the way the
balance is struck between the needs and rights of creators against
those of wider society and between the rights of creators and of those
who wish to exploit that creativity. I do not think we have settled it.
I do not think it is possible to settle it in this Bill or without a
lot more thought. I simply log that as being something about which we
all hoped more would maybe come out in the report. This is an issue
that we will have to address—if not now, then very
quickly—in order to make the best of the way in which any future
Government deal with intellectual property as an important sector of
our
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:37:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000087">As
my noble friend Lord Howarth said, the most difficult question is about
what our approach will be in terms of the economic return that can be
earned by inventors, such that it does not squeeze out the benefits
that will flow to those who wish to use and exploit those inventions.
Are we thinking about intellectual enclosures or about commons? That is
a very good formulation for a very complex problem, which I know that
my noble friend has been dealing with for some
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:37:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000088">A
third point comes out of this short debate. I apologise for going on at
length but it is important to get it on the record. We are now
satisfied that the sort 
<?notus-xml column=59?>of report that the Minister talked about would document very well what
has happened in the Intellectual Property Office work over the year.
But will it be sufficient for us to be able to address the issues of
what it should be doing in future years? In other words, we have a
simple written report and Written Statement—as the noble Lord,
Lord Jenkin, said—simply landing in Parliament. Without the
opportunity to interrogate, question and come up with ideas about what
further work it might stimulate, the job will not be complete. Might
the Minister think again about the point raised in the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the need not just for a
report but for a Statement that could be debated? I know it is true
that we can, as ordinary Members of your Lordships’ House, ask
for a debate, but that is not the same as having a proper timetabled
slot to look forward to, where we can consult with those outside, bring
forward thoughts and events, and discuss the issue
properly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000089">Finally,
the question about how intellectual property is dealt with is so firmly
in our minds that we need to think hard as we go through the rest of
the Bill how we can better secure the debates that will be necessary
around the wider context for this. It is true, as the Minister said,
that BIS has the lead on this matter. However, without the wider
community of Ministers also being engaged in it, that will not be
sufficient. These are very important points to
consider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000090"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:39:12"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="130618116000150" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000150">Viscount

with the long-standing problem of lookalikes: products that are
designed to look like well known branded products, with the
intention—certainly the effect—of confusing the customer.
For me, this is a very familiar problem. Many years ago I worked for
what was then the Distillers Company, which had a number of very famous
brands of spirits. It had a museum of lookalikes containing literally
hundreds of bottles from all over the world that had been specifically
designed to make them look like some of the Distillers Company’s
well known brands, on which of course it had spent a great deal of
money on advertising and had built up a very strong brand loyalty. One
that I always remember looked exactly like a bottle of White Horse
whisky until you looked very closely and saw that it was not a horse
but an elephant. But from the other side of the bar you could not have
possibly told the difference. There was another bottle of whisky that
had “Scotland” in very large words on it and if you
looked at it very closely, it said, “Label printed in
Scotland”. There were hundreds of
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000094">This
is not the first occasion that this subject has been raised in this
House. On 24 February 1994, my late friend Lord Reay tabled an
amendment during the passage of the Trade Marks Act about what he
called unfair competition. I spoke in that debate, as did a number of
other noble Lords. My noble friend Lord Strathclyde, who was then the
Minister, recognised the problem but proposed no action. On 17 March
2000, we had the Second Reading of a Private Member’s Bill
presented by my noble friend Lord McNally, the Copyright, etc. and
Trade Marks (Offences and Enforcement) Bill, which was specifically
directed at this problem of lookalikes. In the end he was persuaded to
withdraw the Bill so nothing was
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618116000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000095">I have
here—and I have no doubt other noble Lords will have seen
similar things—a whole collection of what is sometimes called
parasitic copying. Brands of margarine have a different word on the top
but they look exactly like the very well known brands that are
advertised by companies. There are shampoos, shower creams and
lotions—all these things are well known. There is plenty of
evidence that they do mislead consumers. My wife is a very careful
shopper but on one or two occasions in the past few years she has been
misled and come back home and said, “Oh, that is not what I
meant to buy”, but it looked exactly like the one that she did
mean
to.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130618116000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000109"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>4.45

question of misleading consumers is at the heart of this. These
products are simply cashing in on the branded product’s
reputation and selling the copycat product at a lower price. The
professional word that is used for that is “parasitic”
copying. Why does it persist? It is, in fact, a form of cheating, yet
it is widespread 
<?notus-xml column=61?>and this country does not seem to be as good at dealing with it as some
of our neighbours. Why is it that successive Governments in this
country have signally failed to deal with it? Why does it appear that
the branded product owners have no remedy and can take no action? I
will explain that in a

the consumer protection regulations, which implemented the directive,
were introduced in 2008. However, despite strong lobbying from the
interests representing brand owners, enforcement of the directive was
restricted entirely to the Office of Fair Trading and trading
standards. There was no remedy for those who had been wronged.
Companies were not granted civil rights of action. What about the OFT
and trading standards? They had a pretty regular answer: they argued
that they did not have the resources to enforce the consumer protection
regulations and that the matter did not have sufficient priority. One
can understand that given their duties in relation to childcare,
adultcare, education and all the rest of it, and the priorities they
must establish in those areas. This situation arose despite the
Government telling brand owners that the Government had a duty of
enforcement. When I studied law at Cambridge a long time ago, I
discovered a very good Latin slogan, which I shall repeat although it
may be out of order to do so. The slogan was “ubi remedium ibi
jus”: where there is a remedy, that is where the law is. If
there is no remedy, there is absolutely no use having a law. The
regulations constitute the law, but nobody enforces
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T16:47:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130618116000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618116000098">The
previous Government promised a review after two years. However, there
has been, as yet, no review. The regulations have so far proven
singularly ineffective in tackling the copying of package designs and
all the rest, which is why I and my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones

in support of Amendment 28A. My noble friend Lord Jenkin eloquently set
out the case for his amendment and there are very few points that I
would wish to add. The case that consumers are being misled was
strongly made out by a recent <I>Which?</I> report. As my noble friend
said, it is clear that the CPRs—the  
<?notus-xml column=62?>consumer protection regulations—are
ineffective because they are not enforced by the OFT and trading
standards and there has been no review which would allow others to
enforce those same regulations.</hs_para>

the past as an intellectual property lawyer. Passing off is very
difficult to establish in these cases but that is the basis on which
you would normally expect to enforce ordinary civil actions against
this kind of parasitic copying. All the evidence given to me by the
British Brands Group suggests that it is extremely difficult to obtain
the evidence required by the courts to show confusion, partly because
consumers tend not to complain about low-priced items. It is
very difficult to gather the evidence in store and courts often dismiss
survey evidence as
unreliable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000003">Another
interesting feature, which the Minister might care to address, is
whether or not the UK is upholding its obligations under the Paris
Convention and TRIPS. Article 10bis of the Paris convention and Article
2 of TRIPS require signatories, which include the UK, to assure
nationals of “effective protection” against unfair
competition. Counsel has given opinion in the past that the UK is not
compliant and I believe that the Gowers review gave some indication
that that was the case as well. The Government have a case to answer on
this question. It is a long-running sore among the owners of these
brands and, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, said, there is photograph
after photograph of this type of parasitic copying. There is plenty of
evidence that it takes
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000004"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Lord Borrie" PimsId="4078" UID="130618132000270" xid="1085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000270">Lord
Borrie:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin
and Lord Clement-Jones, made a clear and convincing case for doing
something about so-called lookalikes. I like the word
“cheat”, which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, used, because
it is a simple, human word, which does not rest on any statute. It is
perfectly clear to people generally what cheating is. This is a form of
cheating and I hope that something can be done about it.</hs_para>

<I>Which?</I> report, which shows basic examples of lookalikes and the
originals and shows how easy it is, when rushing around the
supermarket, to pick up the wrong item when it looks exactly like the
one you want to buy. That is very serious. The only question I have may
be one for the Minister rather than the noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000006">In
the last session we passed a Bill establishing a grocery adjudicator. A
lot of these problems arise with groceries, which are fairly widely
defined in the Groceries Code Adjudicator Act. That Act provides a
remedy for anti-competitive activity by supermarkets and other grocers
in relation to the practices of suppliers of goods, groceries in
particular. I was not very keen on the idea of a special adjudicator
being set up and wondered why we could not use one of the existing
bodies, such as the Office of Fair Trading, and give it a clear remit
to deal with the problem. However, a special post was set up and the
lady is now in office. She has a back office of some sort and deals
with complaints from farmers and other suppliers against supermarkets
which have done something anti-competitively. Why can one not use that
particular office to deal with the problem that the noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin, talked about?</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment proposed by my
noble friends Lord Jenkin and Lord Clement-Jones seeks to protect the
distinctiveness of product packaging. The amendment relates to an
ongoing concern by brand owners relating to what has been called
“lookalike” or “parasitic” packaging. This
is where businesses are said to mimic the packaging of brands with a
reputation, whereby consumers believe that the lookalike product,
normally cheaper than the branded product, shares its characteristics,
such as its quality. My noble friend Lord Jenkin described the issue in
similar fashion. This is considered to be riding on the coat-tails of a
brand’s
reputation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000009">The
Government recognise that brands are a significant contributor to the
UK economy. I can assure my noble friends that we are very much alive
to the concerns of brand owners about so-called lookalike products.
Indeed, the IPO has just published research that that it commissioned
into the phenomenon of lookalike packaging, which we would urge all
interested parties to consider. The report is publicly available and
can be found on the IPO’s website. In relation to the harm that
lookalike packaging does to both consumers and business, the findings
were, perhaps surprisingly, fairly equivocal. In particular, although a
high number of consumers felt disadvantaged by the accidental purchase
of a lookalike, a substantial number saw it as an advantage.
Furthermore, there is a fine line between confusing packaging and the
use of “generic cues” to signal to customers. For
example, the colour green can indicate “mint” on
toothpaste. There is no particular business associated with this
colour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000010">The
Government are considering the findings of the report and look forward
to discussing them with the industry but, as previously stated, the
evidence was not convincing enough to initiate immediate action.
Although the Government agree that brand owners should be entitled to
preserve the distinctiveness of their products, a delicate balance
exists between the proper protection of rights and the openness of the
market to innovation and competition. Any proposal that changes the
status quo should be considered with
caution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000011">In
particular, the Government do not agree that the amendment is an
appropriate addition to the suite of protections already available to
brand owners. The amendment would unduly broaden the scope of the
rights currently enjoyed by owners of intellectual property relating to
product packaging and upset the balance to which I have referred. In
particular, the amendment would prohibit the use of packaging that
tells consumers that a product has similar qualities to those of a
competitor’s product, even where that is true and consumers are
not misled in any way. The law already provides for the protection of
distinctive packaging. Let me explain
why.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000012">First,
where packaging is distinctive, it may be registered as a trade mark.
It is an infringement of a registered trade mark where use of a sign
takes unfair 
<?notus-xml column=64?>advantage of its reputation—the riding on the coat-tails that I
mentioned earlier. Given sufficient reputation in the marketplace, this
protection can apply to even simple examples of packaging, such as the
colour purple, which Cadbury currently has protected as a trade mark
for chocolate
products.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000013">Secondly,
noble Lords will, I am sure, be familiar with the remedies under the
common-law tort of “passing off”. The case of Penguin v
Puffin is an example of the redress that is available under this tort
when a competitor sails too close to the wind in mimicking rival
packaging. There is a more recent example, where the threat of legal
action from Diageo, the makers of Pimm’s, over the use of the
term “Pitchers” by Sainsbury’s resulted in an
agreement over new packaging for the Pitchers product.</hs_para>

have been raised. My noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding stated that
there was plenty of evidence that parasitical lookalike packaging
misleads consumers. I refer him to the report recently commissioned by
the IPO, to which I alluded earlier in my speech. The study, called
<I>The Impact of Lookalikes: Similar Packaging and Fast-m</I><I>oving
Consumer Goods</I>, is very long—more than 400 pages—but
the results cover a wide range of issues. The Committee might find it
useful if I highlight some of the findings, as the issues were raised
today.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="130618132000261" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000261">5

Jenkin also said that it was time for a review of the measures
currently in place. The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading
Regulations protect the public from misleading commercial practices
where the average consumer is likely to be economically disadvantaged
as a result. The regulations carry criminal penalties and are enforced
by enforcement authorities such as local authority trading standards
departments. Enforcement will depend on local priorities and will be
focused where there is an urgent need for protection.</hs_para>

powers to enforce the regulations were considered when they were
drafted. They were rejected at that time because of the danger that
such powers in relation to regulations with a very broad,
principles-based application could lead to a great deal of costly and
burdensome litigation before the courts. Such actions would also need
to be based on consumer detriment resulting from the presence of
lookalike products on the market. The evidence at the time was not
conclusive. The previous Government undertook to review this decision
and the Government are now reassessing the position in the light of the
recently published IPO research.</hs_para>

Jenkin also asked why we cannot follow the model of any of our
international counterparts, which is a fair question. The report looked
specifically at Germany and the United States but the findings
indicated that there is no overwhelming advantage to the systems
operating elsewhere, such as in those countries, that meant that they
would be models for the UK to
follow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000023">My
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones referred to the recent <I>Which?</I>
report, as did the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. The reference in the study
was to the 20% of participants who had, at least once, purchased a
lookalike product believing it to be the brand owner’s product.
This figure refers to the totality of the purchasing history of the
participants in the study. The <I>Which?</I> survey of 2,244 of its
members, conducted in February of this year, also found that of those
who had mistakenly purchased the lookalike product, 38% were annoyed by
the fact and 30% felt misled. However, the survey also reported that
18% of participants had deliberately purchased an own-brand product
because it resembled a branded product, some of them because it was
cheaper than the branded product. Taken together, the Government
consider that these measures grant a proportionate level of protection
to the packaging of brand owners and that therefore the amendment is
not
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000024">My
noble friend Lord Clement-Jones also asked if the UK was upholding its
duties under the TRIPS agreement. I can assure him that the UK is fully
compliant in its obligations under TRIPS and other international
agreements. The noble Lord mentioned a particular legal case that may
have questioned this. If he could provide me with details of that case,
I would be happy to pass this on to my legal
advisers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000025">The
noble Lord, Lord Borrie, raised the Groceries Code Adjudicator Act, and
asked why this matter could not be brought into the new adjudicator
set-up. The new adjudicator’s role is very specific and is
confined to looking at the supply chain and the relationship between
suppliers and the biggest supermarkets. I hope that that answers his
question. With that in mind, I ask my noble friend to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Jenkin of Roding" PimsId="1169" UID="130618132000273" xid="1291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000273">Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened with great interest
to my noble friend giving his answer, and I hope I shall be forgiven
when I say that I have not read all 400 pages of the IPO report. From
his description, it seems to provide “not conclusive
evidence”. I am moved to say to my noble friend that, yes, of
course some customers will be happy that they bought a 
<?notus-xml column=66?>lookalike product because it was cheaper. However, why did it have to
look like the branded product? Why could not the own-label product be
designed not to give the impression that it is riding on the coat-tails
of a well known branded product? Of course some consumers will buy it
deliberately because it is cheaper. I find that evidence very
misleading. Consumers have bought a lookalike because it looks like the
thing that they have always bought but is cheaper, so they like it. Why
buy a lookalike? Why do supermarkets not design their own product? The
answer is that it would not sell. There would not be a market.
Lookalike products are crucial to their marketing. That is cheating.
However, I will look very carefully at what my noble friend said, and
perhaps take advice from some of the people who have more time than I
do and have read the 400-page IPO report. In the mean time, I beg leave
to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="130618132000324" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000324">Amendment

holding the balance between creators and users. As the noble Lord, Lord
Jenkin, said when he proposed the original amendment, the creators and

directly to the White House. We offered a similar title to the Minister
in an earlier debate, but he seemed unwilling to put on the robes or

talked about achieving a balance. Here the noble Lord, Lord Young, is

not so much structures as attitude, increasingly. “By their

Government going to implement the Digital Economy Act? Are they going
to limit the exceptions to those that are really needed in the fields
in which they are being introduced? Will they produce the right kind of

had a certain nostalgic feeling when reference was made to setting up a
director-general of intellectual property because I was once the
director-general of fair trading for some 16 years and I enjoyed that.
I enjoyed the fact that the legislation that applied to me directed
everything in a sort of pyramid set-up, whereby I was at the top of the
pyramid and everybody else was down below. That was rather enjoyable,
but surely my noble friends who have put forward this amendment must
realise that it is terribly dated now. In the 1970s and 1980s, as each
old-fashioned nationalised industry became privatised, a
director-general was set up—for example, of Ofgas, Offer or
Ofcom. They were all set up as sort of clones of the director-general
of fair trading with specialised functions. However, roughly from the
1990s, into this century, all these offices have been remodelled on
what I might call more private enterprise bases, whereby there is a
board, a chairman and a chief executive. The same person can no longer
be both chairman and chief executive in either private enterprise or
the public
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000043">Bodies

Authority—or, rather, the Financial Conduct Authority—and
the new competition body is not called the Office of Fair Trading or
“Office of Competition” but the Competition and Markets

There is no duty to consider the impact on consumers, other businesses

extras but important considerations in their own right. Although the

Lord, Lord Young, asked if intellectual property should be embedded in
considerations across departments in Whitehall. Having the IPO as the
centre of IP expertise and policy in government, to which departments
can turn, helps to facilitate this. Furthermore, IPO policy officials
actively reach out to other departments—DCMS and the Ministry of
Justice, to name but two—on cross-cutting intellectual property

I would not say that this is a perfect amendment. However, if nothing
else, it has again required the Minister to define the way that, as the
IP Minister, he acts within his department and with other departments.
In that respect, it has been useful. It was unfortunate that he
referred to Chamberlain, as his career was terminated rather abruptly,
so perhaps he should choose another analogy in future when he is waving
a piece of paper. Nevertheless, I take the point that he
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000060">The

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is
designed to probe the Government’s intentions as regards the
substantial baggage of copyright exceptions which stem from the
Hargreaves report. We understand the deadline for written comments on
the first batch of draft legislation is 17 July 2013, and that the IPO
will be holding a series of open meetings in the week commencing 8 July
2013 to give opportunity for discussion. Although we welcome this, we
have not had notification so far about the other batches or, indeed,
any certainty on how many of these there will
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000062">Therefore,
can the Minister say, first, that it is intended that the Government
will make the draft legislation widely available so that the finer
points of wording may be examined by parties with a broad range of
expertise? If so, can he spell out the various stages remaining in this
process for the information of the
Committee?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000063">Secondly,
may I ask how the Government will manage the need to take a view of the
impact of these regulations in the round? Will there be a debate or
some other opportunity for both Houses of Parliament to get involved
before the regulations are introduced? On the regulations so far
published, we are already aware of some significant issues which are
being raised across the industry. Can the Minister share with the
Committee how the proposal to introduce an exception for private
copying can be squared with the requirements of the EC copyright
directive and its requirements for fair compensation for rights owners?
In this context, is the Minister aware of concerns about the evidence
base used for the Hargreaves review? For example, the Government
justify the proposal not to provide a compensation system on the basis
that the exception will cause minimal, if any, harm due to the minimal
impact on sales expected to arise from the introduction of this
permitted act and the opportunity that it provides for the value of
private copying to be priced in at the point of
sale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000064">The
impact assessment accompanying the modernising copyright documents
stated on page 15 that the research into private copying appears to

assessment, does not come to this conclusion and instead finds, in the
case of music,

the research concludes that, in the field of music, the researchers
could not find any evidence in support of a widely held view that
stores are including in their price a permission to copy. The
assumption that the value of private copying is priced in at the point
of sale is refuted by the research commissioned by the IPO itself, so
how does the Minister justify the approach now being taken?</hs_parafo>

CDPA refers to permitted private copies being made from a copy that is
held by an individual on a permanent basis. This expression is not
clear and is not currently recognised elsewhere as a means of
distinguishing one copy in the lawful possession of an individual from
another copy which might not meet the test of being a permanent copy.
Can the Minister elucidate this? Will he clarify the concept of 
<?notus-xml column=74?>permanent copies, particularly when a sound recording or a film may
include underlying works which have been licensed only on a limited
basis for inclusion in a so-called permanent

Section 28B(4) of the CDPA appears to ignore how terms and conditions
permitting access to copyright works increasingly relate to the
application of technical protection measures. For example, programmes
which can be viewed on BBC iPlayer may also be downloaded for viewing
during an agreed period, not normally beyond 30 days. If customers can
override the TPM contractual provisions, any terms which are intended
to distinguish access to a catch-up TV service from a full video
on-demand download service will be potentially ineffective. TPM
measures have never been “strictly non-contractual”. Can
the Minister explain how the government drafting takes this into
account?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000067">The
current wording on “cloud” storage does not appear to

hard to see how the new quotation exception can apply to all copyright
works, including photographs. Section 30 of the CDPA allows fair
dealing of copyright works for criticism, review and news reporting but
excludes photographs from the fair dealing provision. Can the Minister
confirm that a similar carve-out will be introduced for photographs?
The phrase “fair dealing for the purposes of quotation”
does not clearly communicate in plain English the fact that uses which
are normally licensed or otherwise exploited are not included. Can the
Minister confirm that this can be looked at
again?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000069">The
Minister will recall that when we discussed parody at length in
Committee on the ERR Bill, the suggestion was made that parodists could
rely on the concept of fair dealing, so that no further definition was
required. This approach was strongly challenged in Committee, not least
because parody is a very popular mode of entertainment in the UK and
needs certainty. I accept that this is a tricky area but do not believe
that the proposed new exception for parody will be sufficient if no
definition or boundaries are set out in the regulations. It is also
quite surprising, given the debate referred to, that no definition is
being proposed to specify what would constitute “parody”,
“caricature” or “pastiche”. Would the
Minister not agree that it will be necessary at least to distinguish
each of those from the others? To avoid further confusion in the
application of any clearly defined exception linked to each of these
expressions, rights owners are likely to argue that it should be made
clear that when users rely upon the proposed exception, any parody,
caricature or pastiche must not infringe the moral rights of the
authors or performers. Can the Minister confirm that this matter might
be looked
at?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000070">I
apologise to the Minister for all the detailed questions, but I hope
that they exemplify why more time needs to be allowed for these
important changes. Unfortunately, I doubt very much whether single

strategic purpose of the Government. The Government have some very
delicate and difficult judgments to make, exception by exception, and
Parliament needs to take responsible decisions. Parliament will be
better educated, and better placed to make appropriate judgments on
this, if we have the opportunity to go through the preliminary stage

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand that the noble
Lords, Lord Stevenson and Lord Young, are keen to discuss the
Government’s plans on copyright exceptions arising from the
Hargreaves review and their copyright consultation. The Government have
already made their vision for the future of intellectual property very
clear. They have endorsed the recommendations of Professor Hargreaves
after his thorough report. We want to see a framework that maximises
growth across the economy, not just for industries that are users of
the intellectual property framework but for everyone.</hs_para>

Lordships a number of documents that establish the Government’s
strategy for intellectual property. These include the report by
Professor Hargreaves himself, published in May 2011; the
Government’s response accepting the professor’s
recommendations, published in August 2011; an international
intellectual property strategy published in the same year, as well as
an IP crime strategy covering a five-year cycle; and, most recently,
the <I>Modernising Copyright</I> document, to which
the amendment refers, which flowed directly from the
Government’s response to the Hargreaves review and their
subsequent copyright consultation that ran from December 2011 to March
2012. Taken together, the documents very clearly lay out the
Government’s vision for intellectual property as an essential
element of growth, and back up that vision with real plans for the next
five years. Those plans are reflected in the IPO’s corporate
plan, which I, as the Minister for Intellectual Property, have signed
off.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000077">I also

proposed changes to copyright exceptions. This work, as the noble Lord
is aware, is being taken forward not in the Bill but through secondary

the noble Lord asked for more information about the timetable for the
technical review of copyright exceptions that the Government are
conducting. As the noble Lord indicated, the IPO is seeking comments on
the first set of draft exceptions by 17 July and has offered open
meetings in the week of 8 July. This first set of technical drafts
covers proposed new exceptions on private copying, parody, quotations,
and changes to the existing exception for public administration. The
next set of technical drafts will cover education, preservation and
archiving, research and private study, and text and data mining. It is
my intention that these will be published before the end of the

will leave one remaining exception: that for disabilities. However,
noble Lords may be aware that the UK is currently involved in
discussions in Marrakech to agree a treaty on improving access for the
visually impaired to published works. Therefore, it may be necessary to
await the outcome of that important work before issuing proposals to
update the disability exemption. I am sure that all noble Lords support
this important work, which has the aim of facilitating access to books
for visually impaired people across the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000081">On the
time available for public comment, the Government are keen to ensure
that sufficient time is provided for all the technical drafts to be
considered 
<?notus-xml column=77?>properly. Therefore, the same time to comment—six
weeks—will be allowed for each technical draft. If any noble
Lords here today wish to respond to the technical review exercise, the
Government will be very happy to hear from them. In addition, I will be
happy to meet any noble Lords who have a keen interest in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000082">I
now turn to how, subject to satisfactory completion of the technical
review exercise, the Government plan to bring the draft legislation
before this House and the other place. These are statutory instruments,
but the Government have committed to lay them before each House for
affirmative resolution. This will provide an opportunity for Parliament
to comment and to express its views. The noble Lord expressed concern
about the time to debate the issues. I do not share the noble
Lord’s fear that there will not be enough time for discussion on
these issues. This House and the other place do not seem to shy away
from debates on copyright. Copyright exceptions have already been the
subject of debate on the Floor of both Houses in the context of the ERR
Act and have been scrutinised by not one but two Select Committee
inquires. However, I recognise the great interest in this area and, as
I indicated, during the passage of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
Act, the Government remain open to the idea of additional debates on
the draft regulations if there is a desire from members of this House
and of the other place. I am happy to repeat that offer here

however, grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, for offering me
his comments at this stage. As the noble Lord himself noted, some of
these points are detailed and technical, such as the definition of
permanent copy. The Government will certainly be looking at this, and
all other comments on the draft. Indeed, the aim of the technical
review process is to devise the best language possible, so I am
grateful for all noble Lords’ initial insights and suggestions
on this matter. I suggest that, rather than discussing each point in
detail, I write to the noble Lord separately to try to answer the more
detailed points he
raises.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000084">Having
said that, there are some points I would like to cover briefly here.
The draft exception will not allow anyone to override copy protection
measures that are applied to works. The Government understand the
importance of these measures in the fight against copyright piracy, and
will continue to protect them. With regard to the particular example
mentioned by the noble Lord, that of storing BBC iPlayer downloads
beyond the 30-day limit, this activity would not fall within the scope
of the exception. This is because this type of copy is not acquired on
a permanent basis. If it did fall within the scope of the exception,
which it does not, then it would still be illegal to break the copy
protection measures applied to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000085">On the
issues raised on pricing and compensation for private copying, the
Government intend to publish an updated impact assessment on this and
the other exceptions, and I hope that this will set out all the
evidence which has been gathered on this issue. The noble Lord raised a
number of points about compensation. However, I am sure that the noble
Lord is not suggesting that consumers should pay twice for content that
they have legitimately purchased. 
<?notus-xml column=78?>For example, if I buy my content online I will have paid for the right
to make copies. Should I pay again for that right when I purchase
something on which to store that content? If consumers wish to purchase
a USB stick and to store their own photographs on it, should they pay a
tax to do so? Should a business have to pay a tax on the photocopier
paper it uses, or discs, or on any other medium that it uses to store
the company’s content? I am sure that noble Lords would agree
that the answer to all these questions has to be
no.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="130618132000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000086">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T17:48:15"></hs_TimeCode>
does not seem sensible to maintain the current position, where many
consumers are infringing copyright on a daily basis. UK consumers and
rights holders should enjoy the same rights as those in other countries
including Australia and Canada. Indeed, the Gowers review commissioned
by the previous Government reached exactly the same conclusions. Those
conclusions, including a private copying exception, were accepted by
Gordon Brown in the pre-Budget report in November 2007. Given the
support of the previous Government for these provisions, I would like
to work with the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, and all Members of this
House so that we can bring our copyright framework up to date. In light

licence fee, as it takes no account of the profits a person may have

pressed, the Ministry of Justice points to the fact that the civil
regime is there only to compensate, while the criminal regime is there
to punish. However, blurring of these boundaries already takes place.
In January 2010, a judge awarded exemplary damages in a civil case
involving a car insurance scam. In addition to ordering the individuals
in the fraud ring to compensate the companies for £300,000 of
losses, the judge ordered the ring to pay a further £92,000 as a
punishment. The reason, he stated, was to send a clear message that

EU directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights echoes
the TRIPS obligation. To satisfy the obligations imposed by TRIPS and
EU law, many EU member states have adopted strong rules on civil
damages for intellectual property infringements; for example, in
Ireland aggravated and exemplary damages are available. In other
markets, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Poland and
Romania, rights holders can recover multiple damages. Lithuania
provides for a form of statutory damages. These remedies are not
available in the UK. In addition, Canada, the US and other countries
have introduced statutory or pre-established
damages.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="130618132000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000099">Can
the Minister say whether the UK Government believe that their
implementation of the enforcement directive meets the requirement for
member states to have “effective, proportionate and
dissuasive” civil remedies? It is true that the courts are free
to continue to apply their existing approach. A subsequent licence
purchase, for example, may be deemed adequate to compensate for lost
profits. Technically, this leaves the rights holder with the ability to
recover unfair profits by suing the infringer. However, proving such
profits can be exceedingly difficult in many cases, especially where
the profit is a saved cost.</hs_para>

examination. In fact, when one looks closely, one sees that this is a
relatively mild amendment because it does not really constitute
exemplary damages. It simply rolls up royalties into a lump sum that
otherwise could have been awarded by a court. Exemplary damages are
rather tougher. Indeed, many rights holders complain that the
provisions of the amendment would be inadequate when all they are going
to get is just the equivalent of a royalty when, in fact, an
infringement has taken place over a long period. One could go a lot

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 28AC would allow
for the awarding of damages in copyright infringement cases that
compensate a plaintiff for the infringement, as well as the additional
damages allowed in some circumstances for copyright infringement. This
is already catered for by Regulation 3(2) of the Intellectual Property
Regulations 2006—SI 2006/1028—and damages may be awarded
at the court’s discretion.</hs_para>

creator of a protected work the right to control certain acts, such as
how and when the work is copied or when it is issued to the public.
Most cases of copyright infringement fall under the remit of civil law
and are dealt with by the civil courts. Infringement can be a criminal
matter, particularly where it is carried out deliberately and/or it
occurs on a commercial scale. The UK legal system does not generally
have principles of punitive damages in the civil courts. In some
circumstances this is possible for blatant copyright infringement, but
these provisions are rarely used. Civil remedies in UK law are aimed at
settling disputes and provide restitution and compensation, while
punishment is the purpose of the criminal
courts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000104">Intellectual
property law is complicated and in many circumstances it is possible
for an individual or business to infringe accidently. As a result,
although it is possible to obtain additional or exemplary damages for
copyright infringement in some circumstances, this isn’t
something that the Government intends to introduce more widely. In
particular, the introduction of further exemplary damages for design
rights and patents would almost certainly have a negative impact on
innovation, as industry would become more nervous about infringement
when developing new products. Further damages would also create a
perverse incentive for some individuals and organisations to take legal
action that might otherwise be
inappropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000105">An
important principle of UK law is ensuring that the level of penalty is
proportionate to the level of wrongdoing. The Government believe that
furthering exemplary damages could allow for disproportionate sanctions
to be imposed on those who unintentionally infringe IP and would not
support rights holders, or protect or enforce their rights. Above all,
we have seen no evidence that exemplary damages work where they are
available in other
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000106">The
noble Lord, Lord Young, questioned whether the UK Government are doing
enough on enforcement. I am delighted that this gives me an opportunity
to provide some highlights of what I regard as a serious and important
matter. The UK’s legal system convicts pirates and
counterfeiters, and 80% of criminal cases under IP legislation in 2009
led to a guilty verdict. In 2009, the UK convicted nearly eight times
as many copyright offenders as in 2002. The assets seized from IP
criminals were £21 million in 2010-11, which was more than twice
the previous year’s figure. Figures vary from year to year,
understandably, but there is an increasing trend in the value of assets
recovered since

noble Lord, Lord Young, spoke generally about whether the current

21 is intended to simplify the way in which the UK currently meets its
international obligations to extend copyright protection to works from
other countries and their citizens, delivering clearer information for
users. This need arises from the fact that the UK is a signatory to a
number of international copyright conventions and treaties. This
obliges the UK to extend copyright protection to works and performances
created by citizens of other member countries, or to works that
originate in other member countries. These obligations are reciprocal:
UK copyright holders benefit from the same protection in those

it became clear after the Bill was introduced that the clause as
drafted would not provide the Government with the flexibility to extend
as much, or as little, of the Act as is appropriate. The policy behind
Section 159 is for protection to apply only where it is offered in
return. This very much depends on which international agreements those
other countries have signed up to, and whether they have opted out of
some elements.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:03:11"></hs_TimeCode> purpose of

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, as your Lordships know, the
public lending right is the legal right of authors to receive payment
for the loan of their books by public libraries. Currently it applies
to the loan of books only in printed format. It does not apply to
e-books, audiobooks and
e-audiobooks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000162">William<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:05:39"></hs_TimeCode>
Sieghart and a distinguished advisory panel carried out a review of a
number of issues and concerns on the subject of e-lending in libraries.
Their report, 
<?notus-xml column=84?><I>An Independent Review of </I><I>E-L</I><I>ending in Public Libraries
in England</I>, was published in March 2013. A number of
recommendations were made to ensure that authors receive fair
remuneration from the lending of digital, audio and e-audiobooks by
libraries. The review recommended that the anomaly whereby rights
holders are still not recompensed for the loan of their audio and
e-books should be urgently addressed by extending PLR to cover e-books,
audiobooks and e-audiobooks; that there should be an increase in the
Government’s PLR funding to take this into account, so that
writers and other rights holders are equitably compensated; that the
provisions in the Digital Economy Act 2010 that extend PLR to on-site
loans of audiobooks, e-books and e-audiobooks should be enacted; and
that the Government should find space in their legislative programme,
at the earliest opportunity, to enact primary legislation to extend PLR
to remote
e-loans<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000163">I
will say a word on the legalities around PLR. Authors who have granted
publishers the right to publish their works as audiobooks or e-books
will typically retain copyright in the work and will often retain the
exclusive right to lend the work granted by Section 16(1) of the
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Under Section 18A of the CDPA
it is an infringement of copyright in a literary work to lend that work
to the public without the copyright owner’s permission. However,
Section 40A of the CDPA permits public libraries to lend books that
fall within the public lending right scheme. If the Digital Economy Act
is implemented, the PLR scheme will be varied to include audiobooks and
e-books. Until that happens, loans of audiobooks and e-books issued
without a copyright owner’s authorisation perpetuate a situation
in which lending rights are being
infringed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are significant, considering that no payment is made to authors for
their loan from libraries and that in many instances the libraries
charge for the loans. The latest CIPFA statistics put the number of
audiobook loans at 9.9 million for 2010-11 and 8.9 million for 2011-12.
However, CIPFA treats e-audio separately in the 2011-12 figures and
there is an additional figure to be taken into account of 287,000 loans
for
e-audiobooks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000165">In
their response to the Sieghart report, the Government committed to
pursuing legislation to extend PLR to remote lending in future
parliamentary Sessions. They also agreed to consider commencing the
relevant provisions of the Digital Economy Act. Their commitment to
pursuing the legislation to extend PLR to remote lending was said to be
subject to compliance with the EU copyright directive, with further
funding dependent on evidence of remote
loans<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:09:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000166">What
are the potential consequences if the Government do not implement the
recommendations? The continuing failure to provide for lending
remuneration in respect of non-print formats raises an important legal
issue. While on-site e-book lending is a developing service, the
ability to access audiobooks in public libraries is clearly highly
valued by the public. The advisory panel heard that around 10 million
audiobook loans take place each year, the vast majority of which are in
hard-copy formats. Quite apart from the inequitable treatment of rights
holders, the current situation also 
<?notus-xml column=85?>places the library service in a position where rights are being
infringed on a daily basis. For libraries and authors, the longer-term
consequences of a failure to implement the Sieghart recommendations
expeditiously are clear: readers are increasingly choosing digital
formats, anticipating on-demand access at the time and place of their
choosing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000167">The
Government should act upon William Sieghart’s recommendations
without delay to effect the extensions to PLR envisaged by the Digital
Economy Act, to provide adequate additional funding for these
extensions and to fund and encourage appropriate models for remote
e-book lending so that libraries can act within the law and authors can

historic authors’ public lending right scheme has always been
run on a highly cost-effective basis. The cost of it has been minimal
to public funds. But it has been valued very much by authors, not
because it makes them rich—there is a low ceiling on the total
remuneration they can receive through the scheme—but because it
gives recognition to their copyright and their rights as authors.
Rightly, they feel strongly about it. It is clear that the principles
of the system need to be extended to e-books and should have been
extended long ago to audiobooks. All the thinking has been done by Mr
Sieghart and his colleagues.</hs_para>

than 23,000 authors, illustrators, photographers, translators and
editors who have contributed to books lent out by public libraries in
the UK receive PLR payments each year, up to a maximum of £6,600

nature of the PLR scheme. Rights holders are automatically included in

important to note that public libraries are able to lend e-books, both
on library premises and remotely, without the PLR scheme being

agreements to license the lending of e-books by contracting the

address my noble friend’s amendment, it is worth noting that
loans of e-books currently represent a tiny fraction of book loans in
this country. The last set of statistics on public library usage showed
that there were 850,000 e-book loans in the UK in 2011-12 compared with
almost 288 million loans of print books in the same period.
Nevertheless, e-lending is a growing trend and we should expect library
users’ expectations and demands to change. In the future, for
some people, perhaps popping to the library will become synonymous with
going upstairs to log on to their
computer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000178">The
Digital Economy Act 2010 contained provisions enabling the PLR scheme
to be extended to on-site e-lending; that is, loans of e-books carried
out on library premises. By contrast, under remote e-lending, a library
user may, for example, log on to a library website from his or her home
and download an e-book in that way. I apologise for labouring the
distinction but it is an important one for the Committee to bear in
mind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0001.htm#130618132000179">Last
autumn, the Minister for Culture in the other place, Ed Vaizey, asked

commencing the provisions in the Digital Economy Act 2010, and that PLR
should be extended to remote e-loans. The government response,

important step, therefore, is ensuring that there is a robust evidence

important point as existing research about e-lending is predominantly

Minister seemed to be saying that it is far easier to implement the
Digital Economy Act for onsite e-lending than it is for remote
e-lending. If I have elicited that as a response, we can at least start
sorting out the wheat from the chaff. It sounds as if 26 June is a very
significant date for whether or not we are going to be able to
implement that part of the Digital Economy Act. I shall put on my party
clothes if, on the 26 June, we know that there is going to be something
in the budget for PLR under Section 43 of the Digital Economy Act. I
shall put on even more party clothes if, after four years, we start
issuing letters next year under the initial obligations code. The fact
that it has taken four years to implement an Act will perhaps be in the

am rather baffled that the Government should commission a report by
somebody extremely distinguished, with a very distinguished advisory
panel, which came to some very clear conclusions about remote
e-lending, and then shuffle the whole thing off into a piece of
research. I am sure that that is very frustrating for all concerned.
The Minister talked about the bodies that were involved, including the
publishers, but the authors—the ALCS and others—really
need to be involved in this process. In many respects, all this is
happening behind a somewhat closed door as far as the writers are
concerned, but they should be
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:27:50"></hs_TimeCode>.

not all libraries have reached an agreement with aggregators. There
will be continuing infringement until we have either proper, blanket
licensing—via the aggregators, publishers or whatever—or
we have something in the Digital Economy Act, or another instrument, to
bring remote e-lending within PLR. The situation will continue to be
very unsatisfactory. I heard exactly what the Minister said about the
status  
<?notus-xml column=90?>of remote e-lending under the copyright directive. I am not an expert on
that directive but I doubt whether it is beyond the wit of man to find
a way through that and to find some satisfactory way of including
remote e-lending in PLR if the budget is there.</hs_para>

the number of hard copy or print books which are subject to PLR is
diminishing over time, so the pool of money required to compensate
authors—the Minister said that £6,600 is the limit under
PLR—may not necessarily grow, because there will be a
compensating diminution in the number of printed books taken out as
against the quantity of digital lending. I would not be at all
surprised if this required no additional funding and it was simply a
matter of political will to recognise that the technology is moving in
a particular direction and to make sure that authors are compensated as
much for the loan of digital books as for the loan of print books.
However, we will not get much further today. I thank the Minister for
his considered reply and beg leave to withdraw the

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid I have three
amendments in a row. I do not know whether it will be
“three strikes and you’re out”, but
Amendment 30 is the second. I will first explain that
Section 73 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act is a provision in
UK copyright law that permits the immediate retransmission of the main
PSB free-to-air services by “cable” in the area where the
original PSB channel was broadcast. Crucially, Section 73 provides that
the copyright in the broadcast, and in any work included in the
broadcast, is not infringed by such retransmission. The effect of the
section is to permit “cable” operators to retransmit PSB
services without agreement or
consent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000116">What
was the original purpose of the provision? The policy justification for
Section 73 in its current form was to encourage cable rollout in the
1980s and 1990s as a competing platform to terrestrial television. How
have the courts interpreted the provision today? In the recent
TVCatchup litigation in the UK and CJEU, TVCatchup, an online TV
service provider, argued that its retransmission and commercial
exploitation of the PSB services via the internet was lawful under
Section 73 on the basis that “cable” ought to be given
its natural meaning. The judge in the High Court litigation agreed, and
stated:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="130618132000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000230">“I
see no reason why the cabling system inherent in the internet should
not be regarded as ‘cable’ for the purposes of the
Section 73 defence”.</hs_quote>

interpretation that can ever have been intended by
Parliament—and nor, based on correspondence with the IPO, is it
one that the Government believe is correct. In that correspondence in
2008-09 the IPO stated
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="130618132000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000257">“‘cable’
in section 73 as amended must mean the same thing as
‘cable’ in the Information Society Directive, the
relevant requirements of which were implemented by the section 73
amendments in question. In the Information Society Directive
‘cable’ is not synonymous with ‘wire’ and
is confined (as therefore, is section 73 CDPA) to the retransmission of
broadcasts by conventional cable programme providers. The foregoing
supports this Office’s view that the activities of IPTV
providers such as ‘Zattoo’ who purport to rely on section
73, are in fact wholly outside the scope of that provision and that
there are grounds for challenging them on that
basis”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="130618132000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000201">The

are the problems with Section 73 now, in the light of that case? First,
economic loss for PSBs and the UK creative economy. Section 73 is now
being relied on by a series of service providers, most notably
TVCatchup and FilmOn, to make money from PSB channels by retransmitting
them via their own online services and placing advertising in and
around the channels, which include BBC channels. Not only are the PSB
services being exploited without agreement or payment to anyone,
including contributors, but, perversely, Section 73 effectively permits
these illegitimate online services to stream a small amount of content
on the PSB channels, such as a number of old series for which online
rights were not obtained and some sports coverage, that the PSB
services themselves cannot stream online for rights reasons. This
perverse consequence of Section 73 has attracted significant
attention from underlying rights holders, including UK producers and
foreign providers such as US studios, as well as from other industry
bodies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000119">Services
such as TVCatchup undermine the legitimate online streaming services
and on-demand catch-up services provided by PSBs which, in the case of
commercial PSBs, are a core part of ongoing efforts to make a financial
return on the PSB investment in original UK
content.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000120">It
is increasingly clear that TVCatchup in particular is operating at
scale in the UK and has many millions of users. Indeed, it claims that
it has close to 12 million registered users on its site. The
key losses from this exploitation for the PSBs are loss of audience
from legitimate PSB online streaming services, linear broadcast viewing
and on-demand services, and, for the commercial PSBs, loss of
advertising and sponsorship revenue from their own channels. By
contrast with PSB exploitation of channels and content online, none of
the TVCatchup revenue flows back into original UK content production or
to underlying talent and rights holders. The scale and problem of this
free riding is likely to increase substantially over the coming years
as more and more households adopt connected TV—that is,
IPTV.</hs_para>

the original policy rationale for Section 73 has gone.
Significant cable roll-out is now a thing of the past and the TV
distribution market is now highly competitive. Cable is a highly
effective and well resourced competitor to Sky and freeview/digital
terrestrial television. There is no reason to continue to grant a
primary legislative advantage from the 1980s to one particular platform
operator in the current competitive market. Moreover, the
Communications Act 2003 introduced a “must offer”
obligation on the PSBs under Section 272, requiring
broadcasters to offer the main PSB services for carriage on the cable,
as well as satellite, platform. In addition, Virgin Media contracts

is almost certainly in breach of European law and exposes the UK
Government to damages actions. In its submissions to the CJEU on the
TVCatchup case, the European Commission made clear that it had grave
doubts about the compatibility of Section 73 with the 2001 copyright
directive. I will not go into the detail of that. The Commission went
on to observe that it was “very doubtful” that the UK
court’s ruling that TVCatchup could make use of Section 73 for
that part of its service transmitted over the internet “could
stand”. Notwithstanding the Commission’s clear position,
however, the CJEU could not deal with the compatibility of Section73 in
its judgment in the TVCatchup case because the UK court had declined
the request of the broadcasters to refer the question of the
compatibility of Section 73 to the CJEU in the first place. What should
the Government do in the face of
this?</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000123">In
broadcasters’ meetings with the Government to date it has been
very hard to understand the remaining policy rationale for Section 73,
particularly given the “must offer” obligation that
applies to the PSB channels. Broadcasters believe that repeal of
Section 73 would be a sensible deregulatory measure that would end the
unjustifiable damage which is being suffered by the PSBs, and would
ensure that the UK continues to meet its Community law obligations.
They believe that the forthcoming legislative programme, including this
Bill, provides the Government with an opportunity urgently to consider
repealing Section 73, assuming this cannot be achieved by secondary
legislation following the passage of the Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform Act. Repeal of Section 73 would not only assist broadcasters in
their fight against parasitic websites—we have used that term
earlier today—but would also ensure that UK legislation complies
with the EU acquis and therefore reduces the risk of any potential
infringement proceedings against the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000124">The
negative commercial impact of retaining Section 73 is
significant for UK public service broadcasters, and ultimately, as a
result, the producers of the audio-visual content they broadcast. This
impact will continue to increase if no action is taken by the
Government to repeal these provisions. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_18_PT_1/2AE2B7842B71D5CBF41B4F2E4696B3C1B1AB8686" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 June 2013">Tuesday,

amendment troubles me. Section 73 of that Act is only one component of
a complex web of regulation that provides equilibrium in the UK
broadcast market. It ensures that consumers who have already paid for
PSB content through the licence fee or indirect taxation can get access
to publicly funded content through a cable platform at no additional
cost. It is true that Section 73 is a relatively old provision created
when the cable industry was in its infancy. It is also true that the
cable industry is in a different position than when Section 73 was
conceived. However, the age of something should not determine value.

might be amended and tightened to ensure that the beneficiaries of the

Perhaps when he responds the Minister will again put on his DCMS hat

apart from the TVCatchup issue, I understand that Section 73 continues
to provide PSBs and consumers with the most efficient route to access
the PSB channels that most cable subscribers want and who equally do
not want to have to pay twice for. Some noble Lords may be aware of the
ongoing row between the PSB community and the Sky platform about the
level of fees paid to broadcast on the commercial satellite platform.
Indeed, one of the major gripes that PSBs have at the moment—and
I understand that they been lobbying for this through the

73 of the CDPA is just one part of the overall framework that supports
the availability of TV and investment in television programming in the

These include the obligations on PSBs to offer their content to all
relevant platforms, the rules governing payments by broadcasters for
technical platform services, and the powers for regulators to compel
these services to carry PSB
content.</hs_para><hs_time UID="130618132000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000267">6.45

balance between the competing interests and objectives involved before
deciding on the appropriate course of action. It is also important to
ensure that a change to one part of this framework does not undermine
other aspects of the framework or give rise to unintended consequences

that there is not going to be a knee-jerk reaction to Section 73 going

intention was to draw attention to what, really, is cheating—we
were talking earlier about cheating—by services such as
TVCatchup, which has no commercial arrangements with the public service
broadcasters. It inserts its own advertising in the breaks of
commercial broadcasting. It is taking advantage of other
people’s content. It is not paying for it. It does not feed back
into the public service broadcasters in any shape or form. If one puts
a TVCatchup app on an iPad or another tablet, there is no obligation to
pay the BBC licence fee, so nobody is deriving any benefit from the
services it provides other than TVCatchup itself. This why our public
service broadcasters are so concerned and wish to see action on this. I
very much hope that, come July, our honourable friend Mr Vaizey will
take cognisance of a serious gap through which TVCatchup is driving a

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> Noble Lords will be pleased to hear that
this is a rather shorter amendment. Amendment 31 inserts a
new clause which will increase criminal penalties for digital copyright
offences. Criminal offences for online copyright theft have maximum
penalties of two years’ imprisonment. Criminal offences for
physical copyright theft have maximum penalties of 10 years’
imprisonment. This discrepancy came about because the new offences were
introduced by secondary legislation using the European Communities Act
1972 as part of the UK’s implementation of the copyright
directive in 2003. Penalties for new criminal offences introduced by
secondary legislation via the ECA are limited to two years’
imprisonment. This was also after my right honourable friend Vince
Cable’s Private Member’s Bill that became the Copyright
etc. Trade Mark (Offences and Enforcement) Act 2002 and that increased
penalties for criminal copyright offences to harmonise them with those
available for trade mark offences at 10
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:51:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000145">I
strongly believe that criminal sanctions should not be dependent on
whether the offence is taking place in an online or physical
environment. Intellectual property is still being stolen, whichever
format is being used. The problem that this has created for law
enforcement was seen recently in FACT’s significant landmark
private prosecution of Anton Vickerman. Vickerman was making
£50,000 each month running a website which
facilitated mass-scale copyright infringement. He was prosecuted and
subsequently convicted on two counts of conspiracy to defraud and
sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. This sentence would not
have been possible if he had been prosecuted under copyright
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000146">This
amendment does not introduce any new offence. It is simply about
addressing an anomaly in the level of penalties available. The maximum
criminal penalties for IP offences are: trade mark, 10 years; physical
copyright, 10 years; registered designs, 10 years proposed in the Bill;
and online copyright, two years. The Government prosecutors are happier
using fraud legislation to obtain convictions against online
infringers. Given this, there is no appetite to amend the CDPA. Trade
associations such as FACT and the BPI anti-piracy unit tell a different
story. While they do use the Fraud Act in some instances, it would not
be applicable to all cases and offences. Fraud legislation is used
because, owing to this discrepancy, there is no other option. The Fraud
Act is used as a work-around because of the leniency in the
CDPA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-18T18:53:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

had he not conspired with someone, conspiracy would not have been a
possible charge, which would have left a serious offence subject to a
disproportionately low maximum penalty. What law enforcement and
prosecutors need is a full package of legislative options available to
them so that they can consider each case individually and use the piece
of legislation that will get them the best result. This discrepancy
aids defendants. They are able to point to the fact that the maximum
penalty for these offences is only two years, and therefore that they
are minor offences and should not be viewed as serious. This is
incredibly damaging. Modern copyright law should focus on having a
content-neutral and platform-neutral approach to infringement. I beg to
move.</hs_para>

copyright infringement, with a maximum of two years’
imprisonment, and physical copyright infringement, with a maximum of 10
years under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, I cannot
support harmonisation of the two offences, given my understanding of
the
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="130618132000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-gc0002.htm#130618132000151">Prosecutors
are already using our current fraud legislation to obtain convictions
for online infringement, with substantial penalties, up to a maximum of
10 years’ imprisonment. The existing legislation
allows for effective prosecutions to be made without reliance on any
specialist intellectual property knowledge. Last year, for example, the
owner of the website Surfthechannel—which linked to pirated
copies of films and TV—was sentenced to four years in prison on
two counts of conspiracy to defraud, more than the two years available
under the

important economic aspect of this was addressed by the Digital Economy
Act when it came into force in 2010. This raised financial penalties on
digital offences to £50,000, in line with physical copyright

<?notus-xml column=98?>that an increased sanction for online copyright infringement would
either increase the number of prosecutions brought forward, increase
the length of sentences passed down to those found guilty of

talking to a different set of prosecutors. However, on a couple of

first item was a full “tour de table” debate guided by
questions from the presidency on the digital agenda for
Europe—the role of the telecommunications and ICT sectors. The
commissioner for the digital agenda, Vice-President Kroes is planning
to launch an initiative with the aim of achieving the goal of a further
integrated European telecoms single market. It forms part of the goal

two questions: garnering member states’ views on how to realise
the ambition of a more integrated telecoms single market and views on
further pan-European spectrum harmonisation. The commissioner for the
digital agenda opened the debate by urging member states to see the
digital agenda as a vehicle for increasing growth and jobs,
particularly for young people. She went on to say that the telecoms
sector is too fragmented across member states and there are too many
barriers that prevent cross border trade in digital goods and
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061884000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-wms0001.htm#13061884000024">My
intervention noted that the UK welcomed the idea of a further
integrated single market in telecoms in principle, including the
proposal for a telecoms passport which would allow telecoms providers
the ability to be able to operate in any Member State, along similar
lines to the single European banking licence. However, I also suggested
that that this proposal should not allow telecom companies the ability
to base themselves in a member state with a weak regulator. I also
stated that any proposals will need to strike the right balance between
allowing consolidation in the telecoms market but still ensuring that
there is vibrant competition.</hs_para>

level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061884000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-wms0001.htm#13061884000026">The
majority of member states broadly supported the principle of a single
telecoms market. However, Germany, Belgium and Spain expressed
scepticism on  
<?notus-xml column=10?>the need for any further telecoms regulation. Many member states also
emphasized that one of the outcomes of these proposals should be that
broadband is available to all citizens regardless of where they live in
the EU. On spectrum, there was consensus among member states that there
should no changes that would reduce member states’ abilities to
make their own decisions to how spectrum is
allocated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061884000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130618-wms0001.htm#13061884000027">The
next item was a progress report from the presidency, followed by an
orientation debate on the proposal for a directive of the European
Parliament and of the council concerning measures to ensure a high
level of network and information security across the Union. (First
reading – EM6342/13) My intervention supported the high level
principles of the strategy but expressed concern that the current
proposal was too prescriptive. I also said that voluntary data sharing
arrangements were very valuable and should not be threatened by
mandatory reporting requirements. Finland, France, Sweden and Germany
also shared my view that the regulation was too prescriptive. However,
most member states believed that legislation was necessary but only in
respect of sectors that were considered “critical”

will help deliver a new system of independent and robust press

principles set out in Lord Justice Leveson’s report. This system
will ensure up-front apologies, million pound fines, a self-regulatory
body with independence of appointments and funding, a robust standards
code, an arbitration service that is free for victims, and a speedy
complaint-handling mechanism. However, it would be inappropriate for
the Government to put its Charter forward to the Privy Council at this
