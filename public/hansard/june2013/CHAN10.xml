There is still, as there has always been, an ability to suspend a
permitted development that is not right for an area. That is why

background to this, with spending on council tax benefit doubling under
Labour and currently costing taxpayers £4 billion a

to tackle the deficit left by the last Labour Government. Under the
last Administration, more was being spent on this than on defence,
education and health combined. That simply has to stop. The reforms we

people into work. It is against the local authorities’ interests
to penalise people. They should be wanting people to get into work to
drive economic growth. This change gives them the incentive to do that,
and through the Localism Act 2011we have given them the freedom to do
just that.</hs_Para>

it is clear we need to do more. When young men born and bred in this

extremists to prosper; whether we are doing enough to disrupt groups
that incite hatred, violence or criminal damage; whether we are doing
enough to deal with radicalisation on our university campuses, on the

education centres such as madrassahs to prevent radicalisation; and
whether we do enough to help mosques to expel extremists and recruit
imams who understand Britain. We will also look at new ways to support
communities as they come together and take a united stand against all
forms of extremism. Just as we will not stand for those who pervert

Syria’s warring parties around the negotiating table this month

by division and hate. As the Prime Minister said, in the past 10 days
we have seen attempts by some to use this evil crime as justification

the chances of a successful political transition and political process?
Do we maximise those chances by allowing Assad to dominate militarily

some of the

bad consequences, but not taking action is a decision too, and in
Bosnia it led to the slaughter of up to 200,000 people and did not stop
the growth of extremism and radicalisation, but increased it. We should

crimes involve the use of communications data. This is not about the
content of a fixed or mobile telephone call, but about the nature of
the call: when it was made, who made it and when they made it. As
telephony moves from fixed and mobile telephony on to the internet, our

I put it to my right hon. Friend, first, that this is fundamentally a
religious war between the Shi’a and the Sunni, which has raged
within Islam for 1,300 years? Secondly, the Alawites, who
are a branch of the Shi’a, will fight to the end, because they
believe—and so does the large Christian minority in
Syria—that they will be massacred if the Sunni overthrow the
present regime. Thirdly, Russia will never allow the regime to be
overthrown, 
<?notus-xml column=1239?>because its overthrow would mean a humiliating

Friend. I would just make two points. The first is that when I see the
official Syrian opposition, I do not see purely a religious grouping; I
see a group of people who have declared that they are in favour of
democracy, human rights and a future for minorities, including
Christians, in Syria. That is the fact of the matter. Secondly, of
course the Russians have long supported the regime, but they can see
the damage that is being done to Syria and to their reputation
throughout the middle east. That is why it is a good time to push all
parties towards the political transition that is so deeply needed in
this

helping to massacre Syrian civilians. Clearly in the end what is needed
more than anything else—more than the engagement of any regional
player or indeed any superpower—is for the Syrian people

Gentleman, but on this occasion I have to disagree with him on both
counts. First, it is completely wrong to pretend that Russia has
changed its view of Syria or its supply of arms to that country because
of the European Union’s decision. Russia has been supplying the
Syrian regime with arms for decades, and it has done so during this
conflict. To suggest otherwise is really quite naive. I fully support
the idea of the peace conference, which is why I flew to see President
Putin on the Black sea and why I held discussions with Barack Obama. We
should do everything we can to bring the parties together at this peace
conference, but I would put the question again: are we more likely to
get some sort of compliance from President Assad at a peace conference
that would result in a transitional government if he believes that he
cannot win militarily? That is the question that we have to put to
ourselves.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_03_PT_1/EAF20CCD132B945DAFBD623644CD678038E76D18" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 June 2013">Monday

communities that make up Bradford condemn the killing of Lee Rigby and
I am heartened today that the Prime Minister has talked about the
searching questions that need to be asked about the variety of bodies
in which there is radicalism. We need more than a tick-box exercise,
and I know it will be more than that. We need to get to the heart of
the problem, and to do so quickly. Following 7/7, cities such as
Bradford in west Yorkshire had expertise in such matters. The big thing
is that it is about talking not only to the Muslim communities but to
the whole community, and about celebrating differences. Over the
weekend in Bradford, some mosques have opened their doors to the wider
community. We must do more of that to ensure that people understand.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T16:27:07"></hs_TimeCode>It is even about

benefit from competition and low prices, but we also want security of

imported gas, gas from the North sea, and the renewable technologies.

say to companies, “Look, we have a low tax rate in this country;
you now really should be paying it.” The point that I
would make is this: of course tax evasion is illegal, but I think there
is a case for saying that very aggressive tax avoidance also raises
moral issues that companies should consider. That is a conversation
that I have had with the CBI and others, who back that view, but we

First, we should pay tribute to British Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus who
serve in our armed forces and the brave things that they do. I argue
that for all institutions—the Army, just as for a political
party, the judiciary or anyone else—it is not enough just to
open the doors and invite people in. We need to get out into minority
communities and encourage people to join up and serve. Only when people
see others from their background and community serving in the Army or
on these Benches in politics will they truly feel empowered to do the
same. As I said, that is a very good point on which to

mechanism, known as a strategic reserve, to be included in the Bill. As
I understand it, a strategic reserve would hold a small amount of
capacity outside the market, to be deployed only in limited
circumstances. The Government have always acknowledged the potential
benefits of a reserve as a short-term measure. If it is necessary to
respond to a short-term security of supply challenge, Ofgem already has
powers it could use. For instance, it could strengthen the options that
the national grid has, to ensure sufficient capacity is in place before
the capacity market is implemented. However, I would suggest to the

if used as a longer-term intervention, a strategic reserve could
undermine the market signals for capacity providers by reducing revenue
certainty. That is because of the uncertainty about when the reserve
might be deployed and the negative impact on the revenue of other
capacity providers. There is a danger that investors may decide that
future Governments will be tempted to use the reserve too
frequently—a reasonable concern in a world of rising
prices—which would increase the risk of not getting a sufficient
return on their investment. The resultant increase in financing costs
would flow through to the consumer, with the long-term risk that less
capacity is built and the Government are forced to create a larger and
larger reserve, at which point the competitive market disappears. By
contrast, a capacity market is open to all providers of reliable
capacity, with the only exceptions intended to be plant receiving
support under CFDs. This provides the right, market-based signals for
both existing and new
capacity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, offering both capacity mechanisms in the Bill—the
capacity market and the strategic reserve—would create
regulatory uncertainty about the Government’s preferred approach
and, again, act as a disincentive to
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:13:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060314000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060314000117">Let
me turn, fourthly, to nuclear power. The Government have made it clear
that nuclear generation has an important part to play in decarbonising
electricity generation. It is 
<?notus-xml column=1272?>a source of reliable generation capacity and it is a vital part of our
energy mix. CFDs are intended to provide support to all forms of low
carbon generation; hence I could not support amendment 23, as it would
exclude nuclear generation. I also have concerns about
amendment 24, which seeks to limit the amount paid under a
CFD to nuclear generation to no more than what can be paid to
renewables generation. It would not make sense artificially to link the
amount of support for one technology with support for another. Support
should be set based on robust evidence and advice that demonstrates,
for instance, that the level of support makes a project economically
viable—and thus will attract investment—and that it
delivers our policy objectives while minimising costs for consumers.
More widely, renewables support rates will vary over time, as has
happened with the renewables obligation, and a mechanism to link
support levels in this way, as proposed in amendment 24, could be
cumbersome and could restrict our discretion to set support levels that
might otherwise provide value for

Let me reassure the House, if there is a concern about construction

reasonable for certain construction risks to be shared. They include
cases involving less mature technologies such as carbon capture and

construction costs, and those relating to certain events outside a

apply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060311000522" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060311000522"><B><Member ContinuationText="Michael Fallon" PimsId="3183" UID="13060311000931" xid="195" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060311000931">Michael

the hon. Gentleman may be right, but I think that some of my

releasing details of its proposed reforms to improve market liquidity,
and I welcome that progress. However, it is crucial for the Government
to be able to act if Ofgem is unable to deliver ambitious reforms
allowing more independent generation in a timely fashion. That is why
we need the backstop powers in clause

95 to 99, also tabled by the my hon. Friend the Member for
Rochester and Strood, would remove the emissions performance standard
from the Bill. I know that my hon. Friend is concerned about its impact
on coal-fired generation, and suspect that he feels that the carbon
price floor provides sufficient market signals to disincentivise such
generation, but the Government's objective is to deliver a clear and
unambiguous message to investors that coal-fired generation must
significantly reduce its emissions to have a long-term role in our
energy mix.</hs_Para>

commitment to decarbonisation is delivered through economic signals
such as support for the carbon price, through planning
policy—which states that new coal-fired 
<?notus-xml column=1276?>power stations should be equipped with carbon capture and

a firm limit on the amount of carbon that can be emitted, regardless of
the price of coal or carbon. That commitment to reducing emissions
would be undermined by amendments 173 to 175, and I hope that my hon.
Friend the Member for Daventry understands why I cannot accept them. In
relation to amendment 174, I should point out that the
formula in clause 42 was carefully designed to ensure that potential
emissions from new coal plant would be at least
halved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060311000526" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060311000526">Amendment
148, tabled by the hon. Member for Brent North, would apply the EPS to
existing coal-fired plant that installed pollution abatement equipment
to comply with the industrial emissions directive. I understand his
fear that, if the relatively low price of coal continues, it may lead
to levels of coal generation that will put our decarbonisation
objectives at risk. However, our electricity market reform measures
should mitigate the risk of carbon “lock-in” by driving
investment in new low-carbon generation which will increasingly
displace generation from fossil
fuel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060311000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060311000527">Amendment
150 would reduce by 15 years the period in which the emissions limit
for a new plant is “grandfathered”. Grandfathering until
2045 gives investors in new gas plant the regulatory certainty they
need that the EPS will not stop them from making a return on their
investment, thus assisting the provision of the new plants that we
require in order to replace ageing capacity. Let me be clear: we need
gas-fired generation in our future energy mix to balance increasing
levels of intermittent and inflexible plant coming on to the system.
Amendment 150 would deter such investment and thus reduce, not
increase, the reliability of our electricity
supplies.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13060311000591" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060311000591">5.30

Friends the Members for Daventry and for Waveney (Peter Aldous) have

Friend the Member for Waveney that the provisions he seeks to remove
through amendments 153, 154 and 157 to 159 simply replicate legislation
that exists under the renewables obligation. Caps have been set before,
such as for bioliquids; exemptions already exist for very small
suppliers; and costs of administering the scheme are already recovered
from the RO buy-out funds. The powers he wants to remove through
amendment 159 would, for example, be needed to revoke any incorrectly
issued certificates. These provisions therefore ensure the continued
effective operation of the
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060311000534" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060311000534">On

foremost, let me be clear that electricity market
reform—EMR—is good for the consumer. Gas prices are
rising and are projected to carry on rising. We need to move to a more
diverse energy mix, which breaks our dependency on both gas and fossil

consumers by ensuring that generators pay back when the market price
goes over the strike price, and the price certainty it brings will
reduce the cost of financing new power stations, and thus reduce costs
to the consumer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:35:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
EMR also serves the public interest by reducing carbon emissions and

Government amendments 119 to 133 will align the powers in clause 121
more closely with Ofgem’s retail market review proposals.
Government amendments 119, 120, 122 and 123 further clarify that those
powers cannot be used for the purpose of imposing price controls by
limiting the powers of the Secretary of State to make provisions under
clause 121 only to the list set out in subsection

Secretary of State power set out in clause 121 to move consumers off
poor-value dead tariffs. His amendment would leave the only basis on
which people can be moved off poor-value dead tariffs as an opt-out for
consumers. Moving customers off such tariffs is a key part of meeting
the Prime Minister’s commitment on energy bills. I would like to
reassure hon. Members that in the event that Ofgem’s reforms are
unduly delayed, we fully intend to make use of the opt-out approach
rather than an opt-in. As a result of Ofgem’s review, however,
it could become clear that there are certain circumstances in which
some consumers could be actively disadvantaged by an opt-out approach,
so we consider it prudent to retain the option to pursue an opt-in
approach if necessary. Consumers could be disadvantaged 
<?notus-xml column=1279?>should it, for example, transpire that as a result of market changes

supplier or different terms, “unless the customer
objects”. The customer can always come back and say, “No,
I don’t want to do that”; even though the company is
saying, “This is a better tariff for you”, the customer
still has the ability to do that. The difficulty with including
subsection 3(e)(ii) is that, as the regulatory impact assessment said,
very many customers never get round to switching and do not react when
they are given offers or told a better deal is available. Leaving that

would add a new power for the Secretary of State in relation to
customers with pre-payment meters, and there is a difficulty with it,
too. The amendment is in two parts: proposed new paragraph (f)(i)

aim of the amendment is to help out the most vulnerable customers, and
I wholeheartedly support that. The Government are keen to see that
consumers who use pre-payment meters are not disadvantaged,
particularly the 20% of the fuel poor who currently pay for their gas
or electricity in this way. Since 2010, there has been a major step
forward in the treatment of consumers with pre-payment meters, with all
the large energy suppliers choosing to equalise their pre-payment

prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060311000549" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060311000549">The
second part of the amendment relates to changing the way debt is repaid
by customers on pre-payment meters. Customers in this situation
currently repay a fixed amount at fixed intervals, for example, each
week. The amount repaid is calculated for each consumer on the basis of
their personal circumstances and ability to pay. The amendment proposes
a limit of no more than 20% of the top-up amount, which in practice
would turn most or all repayments from a fixed rate to a proportional
one.</hs_Para>

are at least three reasons why we should not legislate in that way, the
first of which is the cost to consumers of changing meters to
accommodate such a provision. Secondly, let us consider the
following: if a family paid a total of £10 a week, with 20%
going towards repaying the debt, it would take the family seven years
to clear the debt. This plan would also require the family to continue
to pay £10 a week or £20 a week during the summer
months, when most 
<?notus-xml column=1280?>pre-payment meter customers use very little gas. If they reduce the
total weekly payment in that period, the overall repayment period of
the debt will, of course, increase again. Thirdly, there are existing
obligations on suppliers under their licence to take into account a
customer’s ability to repay when setting a repayment schedule.
Suppliers are currently obliged to develop individualised repayment
plans that take account of ability to pay, but existing pre-payment
meters are not designed to allow for debt levels to be deducted on a
proportional basis.</hs_Para>

the issue from Citizens Advice he will see that it gives an example of

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:46:47"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

matters.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner) will try to
catch your eye, Mr Deputy Speaker, to speak in support of his amendment
150. I hope that the Minister will take that seriously in the context

relation to the EPS, let me say a few words about amendment 179 on
carbon capture and storage. The provisions in chapter 8 on the EPS will
have a significant impact on the future development of CCS. The
Opposition have consistently and clearly set out our support for
developing that technology, which we believe has a vital role to play
in our future energy mix alongside other low-carbon technologies. We do
not need to go over the same ground again, but I probably first raised
with the Minister’s predecessor but one some of the issues about
the £1 billion that was supposedly available for capital
funding. We know what the Cabinet Office document said was available
for this comprehensive spending review period, although I am conscious
that the Minister’s Department—or one of his Departments,
the Department of Energy and Climate Change—seems to have
secured its negotiations with the Treasury on the CSR. I wonder whether
the remainder of that £1 billion is part of the savings that
have been offered
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060323000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060323000035"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:49:14"></hs_TimeCode>If
we do not get the technology developed for CCS, we will face a
significant gap in our ability properly to deal with the peaks in our
generation requirements.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>That is why we
tabled amendment 179. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:49:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Warrington South (David Mowat) perhaps suggested in his
intervention about carbon capture and storage, we are conscious that
there have been bumps in the road in moving that technology towards
commercial development; I think it is fair to put it in those terms. We
are concerned, as are a number of industry bodies, that an unintended
consequence of the Bill is that it makes that technology less likely to
be
developed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060323000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060323000036">The
Minister was right to say that the exemption was in the draft Bill, but
was taken out as a result of concerns, expressed by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:50:08"></hs_TimeCode> Select
Committee on Energy and Climate Change and others, that it could be a
loophole allowing unabated coal generation. The way in which the
amendment is framed—it relates to a specific commissioning
period—helps to address that sensibly, and to ensure that CCS is
given the best chance of developing and being part of the
future-generation mix, as many of us wish it to be. I therefore intend
to push amendment 179 to a Division.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:51:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) and a number of other Members from
across the House, on establishing a panel of independent experts to
offer advice and guidance to the Government before they enter into a
CFD. Although the Minister was not on the Committee, I am sure that he
is familiar with the tenor of our debates on the subject; we
tabled a number of similar amendments in Committee, and 
<?notus-xml column=1282?>argued strongly for an independent expert panel to
offer transparency, expertise and, crucially, protection for consumers.
That differs from the Government’s plan to set up a
non-statutory panel, and would deal with the concerns that the
non-statutory proposals do not go far
enough.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060323000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060323000038">I
am sure that the Minister will be aware that in Committee, we argued
that for many people, this is still a controversial issue. The best way
to ensure confidence in the negotiations that are under way—I
think I heard the Minister refer to “when”, rather than
“if”, the contract is secured; I am not sure whether that
was a Freudian slip—is to ensure transparency around the
process. Having that panel is a sensible way of providing scrutiny and
transparency. If those Members who tabled the amendment seek to push it
to a Division, they will have the support of Labour
Members.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060323000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0002.htm#13060323000039">On

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T17:59:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger), push the
Government to be more transparent about agreements with generators
through investment contracts. It would be churlish of me not to
recognise that the Government have moved on the issue since Committee,
and have listened to what the Opposition said in Committee about what
information could be restricted. I listened carefully to what the
Minister said about the information that is not made available being
described. However, I am unconvinced that that goes as far as it could
or should. I take the point that it may be appropriate for certain
information not to be put in the public domain, particularly when we
are dealing with nuclear energy, but that should be the very limited
exception, rather than the rule. That is why amendments 8
and 9 make it clear that the exception will be for “trade
secrets”, rather than “confidential information”,
as the Government could decide what was, or was not, confidential. That
is important for transparency and confidence.</hs_Para>

will be aware that the representative of EDF Energy who gave evidence
at the start of Committee proceedings was very clear about the
importance of transparency. It would be slightly odd if the Government
sought to restrict that transparency. We will never have the confidence
that we should have in nuclear as part of our generation mix if people
are able to gainsay aspects of agreements between the Government and
companies. The best way of ensuring that that does not happen is to
make all the information available; people can then make their
judgments. I am sure that that would not stop some Members from being
against nuclear power, but it would give a number of others—and,
more importantly, people more widely—confidence that nuclear
should continue to be part of our generation

motivation of my amendments was simple: to include a reference to the

the contracts created and the costs imposed by the Energy Bill. We all
know that the Bill came out of the Government’s electricity
market reform process, which began in 2010 and had three elements. The
first is the carbon price floor, which has been introduced by the
Finance Act 2013 and sets out a path for a minimum carbon price in the
UK from the fiscal year 2013-14 from £16 per tonne to £30

strand is that the Government will create a capacity market that will

still ongoing, so the exact nature of the market in the future is
unclear, and we do not know when it is planned to hold the first
capacity auction. I believe that it will potentially be in 2014 for
delivery in 2018. Then there are the bits about emission performance

though, there is an overall problem with the Bill, which was
highlighted by the Opposition’s general agreement. It is a kind
of renationalisation of the power sector—very, very nearly. To
deliver their policy goals the Government require utility companies and
third-party investors to build assets that are fundamentally not
economic, often in technologies that are far from robust or mature. The
Government have taken upon themselves the responsibility of deciding
which generation technologies are bad, such as coal and unabated gas,
and which are good, such as hydro or nuclear or wind perhaps. They have
also decided the pace of change, that coal should largely be removed
from the power matrix by 2024, and that unabated gas should operate
only at peak from 2027. They have decided which future technologies
should or should not be developed and are pushing forward with a leap
of faith on as yet completely unproven technologies, as we have heard
before, including carbon capture and

Bill will take Government intervention up yet another level. Under the
powers granted by the Bill, the Department of Energy and Climate Change
will allocate contracts for difference to developers in those
technologies and at those locations that DECC favours. It will set the
strike price and so determine the revenue of the asset, what the
consumer pays and the returns on investment. It is very much a
centralising measure. I am not convinced that it gives the

non-conventional gas and oil exploration in the US. That has
essentially destroyed the notion that the world has already hit peak
oil or peak gas. If we compare projected gas
prices—the Minister mentioned this—with what

struggle with building quickly and economically on that sort of scale.

impact of changes to prices is for 2009. This suggests that the
increased cost of electricity due to the renewables obligation alone

to my amendments 48 to 50, which, as we have heard from Minister, are
concerned with the development of a capacity market intended to ensure
that we have the range of capacity that we will require over the coming
years and decades. Not to put too fine a point on it, it is intended to
ensure that the lights stay on and that there is a decent margin

capacity market is a choice. It is not the only option available to
secure the necessary capacity for the future. It seems to me that that
choice needs to be based not just on whether the right capacity margin
can be maintained. We should also ask at what cost it can be done, with
what reliability and at what risk. I suggest that the choice of
mechanism for maintaining capacity that is being made in the Bill fails

have not invented that conclusion; the Department itself produced an
impact assessment on the two choices that it had considered for
securing capacity—a strategic reserve arrangement and a capacity
market arrangement. Among other things, that choice is about ensuring
that the amount of money that can be obtained through the sale of power
into the market at times when capacity is tight stays within reasonable
bounds. The impact assessment suggested that, in future, those
reasonable bounds might get larger and larger. At the moment there is a
maximum of about £1,000 per megawatt-hour, but it could go up as
high as £10,000, in which case the consumer would be paying an
enormous amount for their electricity under certain circumstances. The
whole idea of keeping the costs of the capacity market under control

question then arises: which method best suits the need both to keep the
right capacity and to keep it at a reasonable price and with reasonable
reliability? Hon. Members will not be surprised that costs of the
capacity market option over the period 2010 to 2030 have been assessed
at two and a half times those of the strategic reserve option, and the
effect on bills at 11 times higher. At first sight, that is not a good

auction market for capacity, we are ensuring that there is a subsidy
across all aspects of energy generation, not just some. There is
potential for 
<?notus-xml column=1290?>gaming of that arrangement. The Government will have to
decide how tight the capacity is after considering what the market will
look like four years ahead, and then they will have to create an
auction. That choice will be necessary for the auction to take place at
all, and it will determine how much money there is in the auction. If
the market is gamed so that the capacity looks much tighter than it is,
the amount of money will be larger and the price will be even

down over the next few years, and given how the energy market works,
which I have described, one would expect the ability to obtain rents at
the margins of the market to encourage the development of new plant.
The statement made by the development of a capacity market auction is
that that mechanism will not exist, so a permanent underwriting of new
plant development needs to be auctioned to allow that to take

a capacity market was chosen to underpin the entire energy market

that if that does not work very well, as I also modestly suggest it

down the gaming of the capacity market auctions that may well take
place over the next few years. That would be helpful for our ability to
run a coherent energy policy over the next few years, and I tabled my
amendments in the spirit of that helpfulness and to ensure that,
whichever way we decide to go, we do not shut the door on something

for Cheltenham mentioned the price of nuclear in Finland and France. We
should compare that with the fact that the costs of renewables are
falling across the board. Last month, Citi Investment Research and
Analysis highlighted that, in many cases, renewables are at cost parity
with established forms of electricity generation. Recent analysis by
Bloomberg New Energy Finance found that the levelised cost of onshore
wind had fallen dramatically in recent years, that the best onshore
wind farms in the world currently produce power as economically as
coal, gas and nuclear generators, and that the average onshore wind
farm will reach grid parity by

is the point of my first three proposals. They are not anti-nuclear;
they would simply ensure that Minister’s warm words on

nuclear power is as cost-effective as we are told, I can see no reason
why hon. Members would not support my proposals 
<?notus-xml column=1295?>to ensure it. Amendment 24, which has cross-party support, would simply
ensure that payments under a CFD for nuclear electricity are not
greater than payments for any form of renewable generation, in terms of

26 and 27 deal with transparency and parliamentary scrutiny of

House are to have any hope of deciding for themselves whether the terms

23 and 25 are more far-reaching. They would in effect rule out new
nuclear altogether. Having examined the evidence, I am increasingly
convinced that we should reject new nuclear for economic and
environmental reasons. There are better, cheaper and faster ways to
achieve a zero-carbon power sector by 2030 than going down the nuclear
route. Moreover, many experts are concerned that Government support for
new nuclear power would mean significantly less investment in
renewables and energy efficiency. To do the right thing for our
economy, for constituents struggling with fuel bills, and for the
environment, amendment 23 would rule out payments for new nuclear
through CFD mechanisms. Amendment 25 would rule out any public
underwriting of construction costs or other public support for new

will be brief because other hon. Members wish to speak. Amendment 29
would rule out handouts for new fossil fuel plants under the capacity
mechanism, which means that capacity payments would go to non-fossil
fuel ways of ensuring that power supply met demand. The big six energy
suppliers are pressing the Government to support gas-fired power, and
urging Ministers to go faster on their capacity market plan to
encourage investment in new gas-fired power stations, but a dash for
gas, as envisaged by the gas strategy, would be completely incompatible
with the nation’s legally binding carbon emissions targets.
According to the Committee on Climate Change, that should be plan Z.
Perpetuating our reliance on expensive and imported gas means
perpetuating high fuel bills. Nor is that the golden solution to energy
security that lobbyists would like us to believe it is. Alternative
solutions, including the construction and use of interconnector routes,
electricity storage, and temporarily shifting or reducing demand during
peak periods, should be considered instead. Such solutions should be
prioritised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060323000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0003.htm#13060323000126">Finally,
anyone who is willing to do the maths on climate change should look at
how much more carbon can be safely emitted into the atmosphere and
compare it with how much carbon is stored in fossil fuel reserves. For
the UK to fulfil its repeated commitment to keep climate change below
2°, around 80% of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the
ground. In the context of that unburnable carbon, using the capacity
mechanism to encourage a new dash for gas is both dangerous and

hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) addressed
this—is the length of the contract. I do not go all the way with
him on the £1 billion a year cost, or the very large sum grossed
up over the period of the contract, but my calculations suggest
something in the range of £600 million to £700
million a year just for the new Hinkley stations. That is a huge amount
of money. Earlier, the Minister seemed unable to get to grips with the
idea that the House might express a view on that. The contract is
enormous and could put hundreds of pounds on consumers’ bills,
and cost billions of pounds over the length of the contract. It would

key problem with the Bill is that it changes the law and puts very
large subsidies to different technologies, which Ministers pick as

increase in the limit from about £2.4 billion to £9.8
billion per year, which is a quadrupling of the amount spent. That will
be added to consumers’ bills for those various technologies, but
the Bill implements that into contracts that cannot be unpicked. The

Reckless:</Member></B> I am sorry to hear the hon. Gentleman not
focusing on his constituents’ heritage. Climate reduction and
the carbon issue should relate to cost. The coal price has collapsed
globally largely because of the success of shale gas in the US and its
export of coal, and that means that the cost of the proposals is now
far larger than it was. Global temperatures rose until 1998 or 2000.
Since then, projections of an exponential increase 
<?notus-xml column=1297?>in temperature have not been borne out by recent data. We have cut our
emissions by 24% since 1990, which I think is larger than any other
country. What we are left with is a complete mess of policy in the
Bill, with various subsidies interacting and greatly increasing bills
for our consumers, and I am not sure what the effect will be on
reducing carbon emissions compared with, say, the US, which has had a
big decrease.</hs_Para>

should look at the cost of coal and the extent to which carbon

£16 per tonne on carbon. Under the EU emissions trading scheme,
it is less than £2. We are making a great unilateral cross that
we must bear when other countries in Europe, for example Germany, are
constructing more unabated coal. We will have to buy electricity
through the interconnectors, which will hurt our balance of payments
and increase the cost to our constituents while we shut down our cheap
coal plants. At the same time, shale gas has not come on stream due to
the moratorium, as well as ownership and other regulatory restrictions.
We will end up with some of the most expensive energy in the world and
it is not clear what the impact will be on reducing carbon
output.</hs_Para>

the same time as we are closing existing power plants because of the

constituents should be added to the £9.8 billion figure. We
would be much better off if we had a proper market in electricity
production, rather than a market rigged against consumers. The
Minister, through clauses 38 to 40, wants to introduce a huge network
of conflicting subsidies that will let the Government, ex-post, change
the conditions of someone’s electricity supply contract. All
that will do is increase the price of investment to guard against that
risk—yet another thing moving us away from the free market in
electricity that might drive down prices for consumers who, certainly
in my constituency, are finding the costs very difficult to bear. The
previous Government’s policies were bad enough, but the Bill
will lead to long-term contracts that may be impossible to get out off,

the large combustion plant directive, 8 GW of old coal has to close by
2015. Of that, 6 GW has already gone, with the remaining 2 GW being
considered for conversion to biomass. That leaves 20 GW of old coal set
to stay on the system. Of that, approximately 15 GW is being considered
for all options, which means that it could be opted into the integrated
emissions directive, investing in air filters for NOx and SOx in order
to comply. This plant would then not have to close in 2023, and would
naturally seek to maximise its return on that capital cost by
continuing to provide base load generation capacity unconstrained by
the EPS.</hs_Para>

148 would ensure that where substantial pollution abatement equipment
properly dealing with the oxides of sulphur, nitrogen, heavy metals or
particles is fitted to the generating station in such a way that 
<?notus-xml column=1298?>makes it compliant with the EU IED while still emitting above 450 grams
per kWh, the plant would then be brought under the EPS framework.
Without the amendment, many plants will succeed in circumventing the
EPS, which would undermine the EMR, the UK’s carbon budgets, the
incentive to invest in CCS and the coalition agreement, which committed
the Department of Energy and Climate Change to introducing an EPS as a
backstop to unabated coal. Remember, these old coal plants have already
recouped their capital costs. Allowing them to avoid the EPS cannot
therefore be justified, and I dispute what the Minister said about the
importance of not accepting the amendment in order to allow new coal to
recoup its

Gardiner:</Member></B> I am in 100% agreement with my hon. Friend. I am
happy to put on the record that coal is the energy of the future for
the next 40 years; not necessarily in this country, but around the
world. Unless we develop CCS and export it to such countries as China
and India, which are going to be using coal, the future will be bleak
for all of us. It is imperative to incentivise CCS, which is why
amendment 179, in conjunction with amendments 148 and 150, is so
important.</hs_Para>

central purpose of the grandfathering provision in the EPS is to enable
investors in newly-consented plant to recover their costs prior to
being forced to fit CCS and/or limit their running hours. The
grandfathering date in the Bill as it stands is simply not credible.
The EPS currently allows unabated gas to operate as base load until
2045. This is not plausible in a carbon-constrained world in which
international commitments to reduce carbon are more likely to increase
than otherwise. More to the point, grandfathering to 2045 reduces the
policy levers available to government, and is likely to reduce the
demand for CCS for coal and seriously undermine the credibility of CCS
for gas. The EPS is the backstop; it is a very different policy lever
from the decarbonisation target. As such, it should retain flexibility
to account for policy failure. I have not sought, therefore, to amend
the level of the EPS, because in a situation of extreme policy failure,
we might need to continue to use some of the unabated gas into the late
2020s. The inclusion of a 2030 decarbonisation target should reduce
that risk significantly, but it would remain a risk, and one for which
the EPS would have to account.</hs_Para>

150 proposes a 15-year window up to 2029 providing an adequate
commercial time frame and aligning itself with the 2030 power sector
decarbonisation trajectory. It would provide increased investor
confidence by being more credible than the current 2045, and by setting
a shorter grandfathering period, new gas plant would be incentivised to
begin operation sooner, assisting efforts to address energy security
concerns in this decade.</hs_Para>

179 would remedy the problem of the Energy Bill’s requiring CCS
projects to operate under the EPS regime from day one. The amendment
would apply the EPS to CCS projects only once an agreed and clearly
defined commissioning and proving window had 
<?notus-xml column=1299?>passed. That approach would remove an unnecessary regulatory burden for
project developers and lower the cost for consumers, as the EPS risk
would not need to be factored into the CFD strike price, and would

operating—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) any
nuclear reactor (other than a nuclear reactor comprised in a means of
transport, whether by land, water or air),
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any other installation
of a prescribed kind,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>unless a
licence to do so has been granted in respect of the site by the
appropriate national authority and is in
force.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) Such a licence is
referred to in this Act as a “nuclear site
licence”.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) The only
kinds of installation that may be prescribed under subsection (1)(b)
are installations (other than nuclear reactors) designed or adapted
for—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) producing or
using atomic energy,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any
process which—</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(i) is
preparatory or ancillary to producing or using atomic energy,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(ii) involves, or is
capable of causing, the emission of ionising radiations,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) storing, processing or
disposing of—</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(i)
nuclear fuel, or</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(ii) bulk
quantities of other radioactive matter which has been produced or
irradiated in the course of the production or use of nuclear
fuel.</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) Regulations under
subsection (1)(b) may make provision for exempting an installation from
subsection (1).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) Regulations
made by virtue of subsection
(4)—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) may provide for
any exemption to be
conditional;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) may not result
in an installation being exempt from subsection (1) unless the
Secretary of State is satisfied that it is not a relevant installation
(or, in the case of a conditional exemption, would not be a relevant
installation if the prescribed conditions were
satisfied).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Before
exercising any function under subsection (1)(b), (4) or (5) in or as
regards Scotland, the Secretary of State must consult the Scottish
Ministers.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) Any person who
contravenes subsection (1) is guilty of an
offence.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) A person convicted
of an offence under subsection (7) in England and Wales or Scotland is
liable—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) on
conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2
years, or a fine, or both;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)

years, or a fine, or both;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3
months, or a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or
both.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(10) In relation to an
offence committed before the commencement of section 154(1) of the
Criminal Justice Act 2003 (general limit on magistrates’
court’s power to imprison), the reference to 12 months in
subsection (8)(b), as it has effect in England and Wales, is to be read
as a reference to 6 months.</hs_AmendmentLevel1> 
<?notus-xml column=1326?><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(11) Subsection (1) is subject to section 47 of the
Energy Act 2008 (prohibition in England and Wales and Northern Ireland

programme).”</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>17 For
section 3
substitute—</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel2>“3
Grant and variation of nuclear site
licences</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) A nuclear site
licence—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) may be
granted only to a body
corporate;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) is not
transferable.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The
appropriate national authority must consult the appropriate environment
authority before granting a nuclear site
licence.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Two or more
installations in the vicinity of one another may, if the appropriate
national authority consider appropriate, be treated for the purposes of
the grant of a nuclear site licence as being on the same
site.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) Subject to subsection
(8), where an application is made for a nuclear site licence, the
appropriate national authority may direct the applicant to serve a
notice on any public authority specified in the
direction.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) For this purpose
“public authority”
includes—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) in
relation to a site in England or Wales, a water
undertaker;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) in relation to
a site in Scotland, Scottish
Water;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) in relation to a
site in Northern Ireland, a water undertaker (within the meaning of the
Water and Sewerage Services) (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 (S.I.
2006/3336 (N.I. 21)).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Such
a notice must—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) state
that the application has been
made,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) give such particulars
about the proposed use of the site under the licence as may be
specified in the direction,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) state
that the body on whom it is served may make representations about the
application to the appropriate national authority within three months
of the date of service.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7)
Where a direction has been given under subsection (4), the appropriate
national authority may not grant the licence unless it is satisfied
that—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) three months
have passed since the service of the last of the notices required by
the direction, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the
authority has considered any representations made in accordance with
any of those notices.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8)
Subsection (4) does not apply in relation to an application in respect
of a site for a generating station
where—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a consent
under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 is required for the
operation of the station (or would be required but for an order under
the Planning Act 2008 granting development consent for the site),
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a consent under Article
39 of the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 is required for the
operation of the station.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(9) A
nuclear site licence may include provision about when section 19(1) is
to start to apply in relation to the licensed
site.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(10) But, if the licence
relates to a site in England, Wales or Scotland, such a provision may
be included only with the consent of the Secretary of
State.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(11) Where a nuclear
site licence includes such a provision, section 19(1) does not apply in
relation to the site
until—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the time
determined in accordance with the provision,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) if earlier, the time
when the site is first used for the operation of a nuclear installation
after the grant of the
licence.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(12) The appropriate
national authority may from time to time vary a nuclear site licence by
excluding from it any part of the licensed
site—</hs_AmendmentLevel1> 
<?notus-xml column=1327?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) which the licensee no longer
needs for any use requiring such a licence,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) with respect to which
the appropriate national authority is satisfied that there is no danger
from ionising radiations from anything on that part of the
site.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(13) The appropriate
national authority must consult the appropriate environment authority
before varying a nuclear site licence if the variation relates to or
affects the creation, accumulation or disposal of radioactive
waste.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(14) In subsection (13),
“radioactive
waste”—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) in
relation to a site in England or Wales, has the same meaning as in the
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 (S.I.
2010/675);</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) in relation to a
site in Scotland or Northern Ireland, has the same meaning as in the
Radioactive Substances Act
1993.”</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel0>18 For section 4
substitute—</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel2>“4
Attachment of conditions to
licences</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) The appropriate
national authority—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
must, when it grants a nuclear site licence, attach to it such
conditions as the authority considers necessary or desirable in the
interests of safety, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
may attach such conditions to it at any other
time.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) For the purposes of
subsection (1), “safety” in relation to a nuclear site
includes—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) safety in
normal circumstances, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
safety in the event of any accident or other emergency on the
site.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Conditions that may
be attached to a licence by virtue of subsection (1) may in particular
include provision—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
for securing that an efficient system is maintained for detecting and
recording the presence and intensity of any ionising radiations from
time to time emitted from anything on the site or from anything
discharged on or from the
site;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
with respect to the design, siting, construction, installation,
operation, modification and maintenance of any plant or other

preparations for dealing with, and measures to be taken on the
happening of, any accident or other emergency on the
site;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(d)
without prejudice to sections 13 and 16 of the Radioactive Substances

Regulations 2010 (S.I. 2010/675), with respect to the discharge of any
substance on or from the

national authority may at any time attach to a nuclear site licence
such conditions as the appropriate national authority may consider
appropriate with respect to the handling, treatment and disposal of
nuclear matter.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) The
appropriate national authority may at any time vary or revoke any
condition for the time being attached to a nuclear site licence by
virtue of this section.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) The
appropriate national authority must consult the appropriate environment
authority before—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
attaching any condition to a nuclear site licence,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) varying or revoking any
condition attached to a nuclear site
licence,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>if the condition
relates to or affects the creation, accumulation or disposal of
radioactive waste.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) In
subsection (6) “radioactive

relation to a site in England or Wales, has the same meaning as in the
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 (S.I.
2010/675);</hs_AmendmentLevel2>  
<?notus-xml column=1328?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) in relation to a site in

section to attach, vary or revoke a condition is exercisable in
writing.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(9) The appropriate
national authority must consider any representation which
is—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) made to it by an
organisation representing persons who have duties on a site in respect
of which a nuclear site licence is in force,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) relates to the exercise
by the authority of any of its powers under this section in relation to
the site.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(10) Where a

appropriate national authority,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) surrendered by the
licensee.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The appropriate
national authority must consult the appropriate environment authority
before revoking a nuclear site
licence.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Subsections (4) to
(6) apply where a nuclear site licence has been revoked or
surrendered.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) If the
appropriate national authority requires it to do so, the licensee must
deliver up or account for the licence to such person as the appropriate
national authority may
direct.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) During the
remainder of the period of the licensee’s responsibility the
appropriate national authority may give the licensee such directions as
the authority may consider appropriate for preventing, or giving

be any danger from ionising radiations from anything on the site or, as
the case may be, on the part of it in

helping hard-working families and, indeed, all consumers with the
rising cost of living, but to empowering consumers and protecting
hard-working families from rip-offs and scams. So although I have some
sympathy with the aim of amendments 2 and 5, which are intended to
allow Ofgem to compel energy companies to pay redress for events that
happened prior to the enactment of this Bill, I am troubled by the
effect of setting a precedent by retrospectively applying powers in the

There is a general principle that powers should not be applied by this

very real, negative impacts on
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060328001235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0004.htm#13060328001235">The
Government are committed to encouraging competitive pressure on the big
energy market players, but the regulatory uncertainty these amendments
would introduce would be likely to lead to an increase in the cost of

very time we are trying to encourage the necessary private sector
investment required to move to a low-carbon economy and renew our
energy infrastructure. More expensive finance would most heavily hit
the smaller companies that are also covered by this
legislation—the very small companies and entrepreneurs we want
to attract into the sector. Under the previous Labour Government,
competition in the electricity sector shrank to leave just six big
supply companies dominating it. The last thing we want to do is accept

hard-working families, at a time when, as we know, many can ill afford

would allow for a relatively straightforward resolution of relatively
simple cases. Accepting amendments to remove the cap would require us
to make changes to the appeal mechanism, which could deny consumers
access to the timely compensation they are due, as it could result in a
far lengthier resolution of cases if the stakes are much higher. In
considering whether such a trade-off is justifiable, we should take
into account just how unlikely it would be for consumers to lose out on

<?notus-xml column=1337?>this scale. Exceeding a 10% cap of annual turnover would mean penalties
and compensation of over a £1 billion for the very
largest domestic energy supplier. The largest penalty imposed to date
by Ofgem has been £15 million and under our legislation the cap
for the largest would be set at £1 billion. A cap on redress is
therefore unlikely to hinder Ofgem’s ability to impose
appropriate redress orders.</hs_Para>

addition, there are unintended consequences of removing the 10% cap on
penalty and redress, as that could also increase the costs of capital
and insurance premiums for energy companies. Again, that would
particularly affect the smaller companies—the very ones we are
trying to attract into the sector—with all the adverse impacts
on consumer bills that I mentioned
earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060328001245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0004.htm#13060328001245">Energy
companies should be in no doubt, however, that these powers are
designed to ensure that consumers receive appropriate compensation. The
combined 10% cap on penalties and redress will apply to each separate
regulatory breach. If companies flout the rules on a number of
occasions, they will therefore face correspondingly larger payouts. For
the reasons I have set out, I hope that hon. Members will, on balance,
agree not to press their amendments to a

with a lot of what those on both Front Benches have said. I have a lot
of sympathy with the amendments and, unlike the Minister, I do not find
any difficulties with amendments 2 and 5. If a company has been doing
over consumers, whether it has been doing it the day before the Act
comes into force or the day after does not seem to make any difference.
If we are seriously considering making such companies pay such large
sums for their misdemeanours, I would be happy to support
those two amendments. That would send a clear message that we
are fed up with some of the things that have been coming to light in
recent years and with how the consumer has been mistreated, taken for

way, particularly as I have only just sat down. Let me be absolutely
clear on this important point. For investigations by Ofgem that are
already under way, Ofgem will continue to negotiate compensation on
behalf of affected consumers. Companies that fail to negotiate and
agree satisfactory redress can expect Ofgem to reflect that lack of
co-operation in the penalty it

saying, but he said in his speech that the maximum penalty to date had
been £15 million. Under the Bill he is talking about £1
billion. There is a massive difference between the two and my point
stands: if consumers have been ripped off, it does not matter whether
it happened just before the new system was introduced or just after
that. The same should apply, in my view, and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:21:24"></hs_TimeCode>I do not have

I have a big problem with amendments 3, 4, 6 and 7. As I said in an
intervention on
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:21:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger), I have a worry—the
same sort of worry as the Minister—about the effect that the
amendments would have on the company. It seems that one aspect of the
Bill is about trying to get investment into the energy industry. For
far too long there has been insufficient investment; a lot of
modernisation and new investment is needed to get our energy system up
to scratch. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:22:11"></hs_TimeCode>The
figure is 10% of the turnover, whatever that turnover will be—I
am still not clear what the word covers.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T18:15:45"></hs_TimeCode> takes me
back to the days when I served on the Select Committee on Energy and
Climate Change with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:22:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Glasgow North West and we had the big six in one day and
asked them about their profits. We asked whether they had made their
profits selling to the consumer and they replied, “Oh no, we
didn’t do that.” We asked whether they made them through
generation, and heard, “Oh no, we didn’t make it from
that.” We asked, “Where did you make those profits? You
have large profits,” and no one could answer the question. There
is great difficulty in pinning down what is meant by profit and
turnover<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:22:56"></hs_TimeCode>. In a
time when we have six big energy companies, five of which are
effectively multinational companies—we have seen in recent weeks
what happens with the tax of multinational companies—we need a
bit more clarity about what is meant by turnover.</hs_Para>

the sums involved in 10% of turnover are significant, my bigger worry
is that a company could be under investigation for an alleged breach
for a considerable time. If there is a set limit, whether it is 10%,
20% or whatever, anyone thinking of lending that company money for
infrastructure projects—most of them borrow from large financial
institutions or other lenders—will know the contingent liability
and what they are dealing with. I grant that if the liability is
absolutely unlimited the sums involved are unlikely greatly to affect
the big companies, given their size, but the uncertainty might well
affect them. As we all know, those lending sums of money of such
magnitude will consider the state of the company. A potential unlimited
liability going into many billions of pounds, if there has been such an
incident, could seriously undermine the company’s ability to
borrow the money for much-needed infrastructure in our energy supply
system.</hs_Para>

big six would be able to take that financial hit, many of the smaller
companies would not be able to do so. These proposals would take us
down a road that could have serious repercussions. Many small companies

hard-working families should always be looked at and looked after as
best we can. My constituency has more than its fair share of elderly
people and it has the highest percentage of single women in any
constituency in the country, which probably means that most of them
will be elderly. That means that they might have some difficulties that
other people do not have. There are also quite a number of people who
are disabled. We have found over the years that those are the people
who do not complain, because they are frightened to, and who do not get
the help they probably should get. Once again, we are getting to a
stage when people think that their biggest bill is their electricity
bill, their gas bill or both. According to some newspaper articles,
people will be more worried about how they will pay their fuel bills
than how they will pay their mortgage.</hs_Para>

worry about the big six, because they are making plenty of money, but
we have to nail down what we mean by profit and turnover. Let us take
EDF, a large multinational company that is to build a new nuclear power
station, from which it will make a lot of money. It also has other
power stations in the United Kingdom on which it makes money, and of
course it is involved in retail as well, where it says it makes 2%
profit. It makes some 17% to 19% profit from generation. 
<?notus-xml column=1340?>It puts that 19% alongside the 2% when it comes to giving shareholders a
dividend, but it tells Government that it is making only 2% profit. The
company may therefore put up its prices—SSE did so only last

company should have to pay that back to its consumers. It should not

lies the biggest problem that we have with energy: looking at the
books. What are the books? I have talked to Ofgem and to the Minister.
What do the books cover? That goes back to the definition of cost and
the definition of turnover. Where does the generation element come in
and where does the retail element end? What happens to all the money
that is made on either side of the box in the middle? That is a real
problem. When billions of pounds of profit are made on one side and
appear not to be counted, and billions of pounds are missing on the
other side so the companies put the prices up, they keep making money
but the consumers—the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the
hard-working families that the Minister likes to talk about—are
all suffering, and it appears that our Government do not

reiterate the point that I made about the number of investigations
currently under way. Ofgem is carrying out 15 formal investigations
into potential malpractice by energy suppliers, and its enforcement
team is informally reviewing an additional 12 cases. On that basis we
consider it crucial that consumer redress orders be issued in respect
of contraventions that might occur before the Bill comes into force. I
reiterate that that is not retrospective legislation; it just means
that consumers can get the redress they
deserve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T20:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060328001273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0004.htm#13060328001273">Amendment
3 protects an important point of principle. Instead of a cap on the
amount of compensation that consumers can receive, customers who have
been treated poorly should be entitled to receive what they are rightly
due. If the Government are convinced, as I heard the Minister say, that
the level of compensation would 
<?notus-xml column=1342?>never reach 10% of turnover, whatever that
definition of turnover might be, the amendments should not present much
difficulty. They would take effect only if the harm to consumers was
above the 10% threshold. If it is unlikely ever to reach that
threshold, the cost of that risk would be relatively small, and if the
level of damages were to exceed that level, surely the Government would
want to ensure that customers who had been treated unfairly were
properly

O'Donnell</B> (East Lothian) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for the
opportunity to debate the regulation of the timeshare industry. I want
to start with a list of thank yous. It is appropriate that we are
speaking about timeshare: I thank Ministers from the Department of
Energy and Climate Change for disposing of their business so quickly
that they have managed to share the time this evening more evenly. I
thank the Minister and her officials for the interest they have taken
in this issue. I look forward to working with them in the hope that we
can find a way to solve the problems faced by the people I will be
speaking about. I thank the various consumer organisations that have
been supportive: Citizens Advice Scotland, Which? and the trade body of
the sector, the Resort Development Organisation.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T19:00:06"></hs_TimeCode>Most of all,
however, I would like to thank <I>The Sunday Post</I>, which has run a
really effective campaign on the issue. That newspaper is often the
subject of urban myths—according to one that does the rounds in
Scotland, when the Titanic sank, its headline was “Titanic
sinks. Govan man feared drowned”, but this campaign shows that
those urban myths are a thing of the past.</hs_Para>

most people, owning a holiday home is little more than a dream, but a
solution was apparently found back in the 1960s, with the birth of
timeshare. Holidaymakers keen for their own slice of paradise without
the full cost of owning a place abroad—something they could not
afford—turned to this option. Under a timeshare agreement,
individuals and families own not a whole property but the right to
occupy a property for a specific period each year. Timeshares are
binding, contractual agreements between owners and the company that
owns and manages the property, with the owner paying a one-off fee and
ongoing maintenance costs. The legal rights and obligations binding the
company and owner are detailed in a timeshare agreement.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060328002290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0004.htm#13060328002290"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:05:46"></hs_TimeCode>Timeshares
were meant to offer families certainty and security. By investing in a
property held in trust for mutual benefit, families could enjoy regular
holidays in accommodation of a higher quality than that which they
could otherwise have afforded. The idea of timeshare became popular,
and recent figures from a European timeshare industry report show that
more than 500,000 Britons own timeshares. It is a huge sector in the
UK, therefore, and although much progress has been made in terms of
regulation and better practice, there is still room for improvement
because for many that holiday dream has turned into a
nightmare.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060328002291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0004.htm#13060328002291"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:06:31"></hs_TimeCode>During
the boom years of the ’80s and ’90s, timeshares were
often sold aggressively to tourists who were on holiday and without
access to legal advice. Many contracts were not in English and deals
were agreed in currencies other than sterling, meaning that maintenance
fees have risen as the pound has weakened. Many timeshare owners
unwittingly signed contracts that locked them and—it now
transpires—their children in for life, because timeshare
agreements regularly included an “in perpetuity” clause,
extending the right to a property beyond the owner’s death. The
only way for these timeshare owners to escape their timeshare is to
sell it on, but there is little 
<?notus-xml column=1352?>demand for second-hand timeshares, and many owners have been forced to
use unscrupulous middlemen to find a buyer.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>Often, these
issues are not reported, but they affect many families across the UK.
This debate follows on the heels of scams awareness month, and it
seemed an appropriate time to raise it in this place.</hs_Para>

Timeshare Act 1992 and the Timeshare Regulations 1997 were repealed by
the Timeshare, Holiday Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts
Regulations 2010, which came into force in February 2011. The 2010
regulations were introduced to transpose EU directive
2008/122/EC—on the protection of consumers in respect of certain
aspects of timeshare, long-term holiday products, and resale and
exchange contracts—which had been adopted on 14 January 2009.
The directive aimed to enhance consumer rights, especially through
stronger rules on the information that companies had to provide to
consumers, including on the consumer’s right of withdrawal.
Under the new rules, a private individual considering the purchase of a
timeshare must be made aware of key information in their own language
and in the standardised form. Buyers are also given rights of
withdrawal, so that they can cancel a contract during a
cooling-off period.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060328002293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0004.htm#13060328002293"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:08:47"></hs_TimeCode>In
short, new timeshares with contracts of more than a year must be sold
with a 14-day cooling-off period, giving buyers a right to cancel. The
seller cannot ask for any money within the 14 days, and if they do not
inform the buyer about the cooling-off period, it can be extended to
one year and 14 days. This is a great improvement on the previous
situation, when there was a cooling-off period only if the timeshare
agreement was for at least three years. Afterwards, the buyer can
cancel the timeshare if the timeshare allows for it, although they may
have to use a timeshare or resale company, which usually charges
commission, in order to secure this.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060328002294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/debtext/130603-0004.htm#13060328002294"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:10:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:09:27"></hs_TimeCode>The
2010 regulations sought to address a number of problems by extending
protection to holiday products similar to timeshares, including holiday
clubs, and improving consumer confidence by ensuring that important
information is provided to individuals before they commit to timeshare
purchases or resales. The Office of Fair Trading and trading standards
officers are responsible for enforcing the regulations, which were
broadly welcomed. Consumer bodies such as Which? had lobbied for
increased protections. However, the regulations address problems with
only certain aspects of timeshare agreements—for example,
consumer rights when entering the contract. Meanwhile, issues such as
termination of contracts and inheritance of rights and obligations
remain regulated by national laws of European Union member
states.</hs_Para>

EU Commission will review the application of the directive and report
to the European Parliament and the European Council in 2014. I will be
interested to hear whether the Minister thinks there might be an
opportunity in that review to extend the remit of the regulations. The
2010 regulations indicate that policy makers recognised a need to
reform the timeshare market, but protections did not address
in-perpetuity contracts, which continue to affect countless timeshare
owners. If the timeshare company is a member of the trade body, the
Resort Development Organisation, owners can escalate complaints through
an internal reconciliation process, although this may prevent future
court action. There are also several bodies offering advice to
timeshare owners. In addition to the 2010 regulations, the Unfair 
<?notus-xml column=1353?>Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 may be relevant in
determining the legality of a timeshare agreement. It would be for the
OFT to decide whether to investigate.</hs_Para>

I have looked further into this issue, it has become clear that there
is uncertainty in many areas of regulation. Other than the 2010

Kaney from Bridge of Allan contacted <I>The Sunday Post</I> about her

her husband in 1994. They paid £6,600 for their timeshare, and
maintenance fees have risen to £1,100 annually. Mrs
Kaney’s husband died over seven years ago and then she suffered
a stroke, which made travel difficult. Mrs Kaney has had her timeshare
up for sale for two years. Following an intervention by <I>The Sunday

most of its members allowed owners who were over 70 to leave. <I>The

The annual maintenance fee is now more than £1,000. Mr

further information on the timeshare sector in the UK and overseas. It
informs me that if a timeshare is jointly owned with the right of
survivorship, the surviving owner should automatically become the full
owner. However, if the deed reflects sole ownership, the property may
be handed down to another party according to the terms of the
deceased’s will, trust or other legal document that specifies
who will inherit his or her estate. In effect, a person could inherit a
timeshare that they do not want and cannot afford. The beneficiary can
formally disclaim the timeshare if they do not want it. That allows the
executor to take charge of the property instead. They may then be able
to sell or donate

timeshare and have been told that they must continue to pay the
maintenance fees or legal action will be taken against them. This is
despite the timeshare itself being in someone else’s name. As

not think that anyone could be unmoved by the case of Mrs Kaney, the
elderly lady who was still being forced to pay £1,100 a year
long after ceasing to benefit from a product that she had bought a long
time ago when her husband was still alive, or by the plight of people
who feel pressured into paying hundreds of pounds a year or else face a
one-off cost of more than £5,000 to buy themselves out. Such

think it fair to say that the timeshare industry and service providers
associated with timeshares and other long-term holiday products have
had a pretty poor reputation for a long time. When I was preparing for
the debate I spoke about it to some of my colleagues, and a common
refrain was “Are timeshares still around?” Of course,
given perpetuity contracts, they certainly are still around.
Historically, companies in the sector have behaved abominably,
pressurising people while they are supposed to be on holiday and trying
to persuade them to buy products that they do not really want or even
understand at the time. That has left a legacy of difficult issues for
some timeshare owners.</hs_Para>

only do timeshare contracts generally impose an annual obligation to
pay maintenance fees in respect of the properties, but they can be very
long-lasting. Although nowadays it is possibly more usual for timeshare
agreements to specify a set period such as 10 years, and although
people may indeed expect to be happy to visit a certain destination
throughout the following decade, it is more difficult to predict
whether in a few decades’ time a longer-term contract will still
be desirable, and whether people will still be willing to accept the
obligation that it involves.</hs_Para>

the timeshares were originally sold to people, they were assured that
they would have an opportunity to sell on the contracts and that they
would be worth a significant amount, but I suspect that those promises
have not come to much when people have tried to sell. Some timeshare
owners now find themselves with liabilities which, for one reason or
another—age, altered preferences or a change of
circumstances—no longer provide them with any actual
benefit.</hs_Para>

important to see the position in a balanced way. It is true that many
thousands of timeshare owners in the United Kingdom, elsewhere in
Europe, and indeed worldwide are very happy with the product and the
opportunities that it provides, and it is true that, when properly sold
and constructed, the product in itself need not be problematic and can
be enjoyed by many people. At its best, the timeshare industry can
deliver an attractive, high-end product that matches its
customers’ requirements extremely well. However, it is not a
product that is suitable for everyone. That is why the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills continues to recommend, despite the
improved protections that have existed since 2011, that any prospective
customer should always seek legal advice before accepting any kind of
long-term contract that involves an ongoing financial commitment,
including timeshare contracts.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady’s recognition that significant improvements have been
made, and I shall say more about those improvements later. I think it
important to note that, although the regulations came into force in
2011 under the present Government, they were formalised in 2010, and
were the result of a great deal of work by the last Government and by
European partners. This is not a party political issue. We all want
better rights for consumers and I am always delighted to work with
people across parties who are keen to achieve that, so I welcome the
spirit in which the hon. Lady made her remarks. I would be happy to

sympathise with the concerns that the hon. Lady raised about contracts
in perpetuity or contracts that last for an incredibly long time which
people no longer wish to have. Perhaps when the contracts were entered
into, for many people, the idea of passing on the timeshare to family
members was quite attractive but, with the elapsing of time, some
consumers no longer wish to be involved in those contracts. The only
way they can come out of the situation with any certainty is by
pursuing the matter through the courts, which as we all understand is
not necessarily an easy option or one that many people have the
resources to pursue; or by negotiating with the resort operators, which
can lead to wildly varying responses, as has been outlined.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady mentioned the law in Spain, where many UK customers have
timeshare contracts and where any contract longer than 50 years is
unenforceable on the basis that it is unfair. The UK could look at such
issues. In normal circumstances, we try not to intervene in individual
contractual matters between two parties who can come to an arrangement
that suits them. Instead we try to create a framework where the
conditions under which fair and honest trading takes place are set out
clearly and any imbalance in knowledge between trader and consumer can
be addressed. The aim is to create a situation where consumers can make
properly informed choices when they buy products and

under review. The evidence and the cases that the hon. Lady has
presented help with that. I encourage consumer groups that have been
campaigning on the issue to be prepared to put those cases together and
to collect the evidence, particularly when it comes to the review in

return to what can be done to help the people who are having problems
now— current timeshare owners—the trade body representing
the sector across Europe, the Resort Development Organisation, makes it
clear that its members recognise the damage that these legacy issues
continue to inflict on an industry that is focused on moving on,
developing and improving its customer service offer. They clearly have
an interest in trying to improve the reputation of timeshare contracts,
particularly because, often, the newer types of contract, as a result
of the protections that are in place, bear little resemblance to those
that were offered in the past. As a result, that organisation and its
members are willing to engage with timeshare owners to try to resolve
matters when ownership is impractical or unwanted, although, as the
hon. Lady pointed out, that is not universally the case.</hs_Para>

element has not been touched on in the debate but is important. What
might be the perfect solution for an individual timeshare owner who is
stuck with a contract that they do not want, might have knock-on
effects for people who own the other weeks of the year of the
timeshare, or other properties in the resort. That is where the nub of
some of the problems
lie<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:34:34"></hs_TimeCode>s. Because
the way the contracts are structured is such that there is a collective
obligation to fund the maintenance and upkeep of the resort, if
individual owners rescind the contracts or hand them back without them
being sold to somebody else, the members who remain generally have to
bear the increased costs and the burden of the lost revenues unless a
new owner can be found. That might not be difficult for popular weeks,

Macdonald. The Scottish highlands is one of the places in the UK with a

they had been managing to resolve any issues in a much more consensual

Swinson:</Member></B> I would not want to paraphrase the entire guide
to timeshare disposal, which the TA produced and which could probably
say it better than I could. I can recommend that publication to the
hon. Gentleman, as it would be useful for him to have a look at it. In
general terms, buyers can be found for the contracts in some cases,
whereas in others resort owners have a points system in a second-hand
market. For example, where the owner of a timeshare contract is no
longer able to access the benefits of the contract, perhaps because the
location is a long distance away and they can no longer travel far
because of age or infirmity, they might be able to swap the contract,
through that points market, changing to a different property or a
different resort much closer to home. Sometimes people are just seeking
variety, because they do not want to go to the same place they have
been going to for 15 years, and that can provide a helpful option to
individuals in this situation. A wide range of avenues can be explored.
Of course I am also looking at the issues arising from some cases
where, because of age or a particular medical reason, there clearly
will not be any benefit to the individual. In some of those cases
resort owners have also been able to show flexibility in taking back
those contracts. So a range of different routes can be explored but I
certainly encourage anyone who finds themselves in that situation to
make contact, because each individual case will be different and
getting specific tailored advice would be helpful.</hs_Para>

issue that has been raised is that of bogus resellers and, indeed,
bogus compensators—we end up rolling our eyes, thinking that
there will always be people who want to rip other people off. It is a
sad state of affairs that we get the bogus compensators as well as the
bogus resellers. It is positive to be able to report that the Office of
Fair Trading has taken proceedings in the High Court in relation to
some of the sales and marketing practices of Incentive Leisure Group
Ltd, Personal Travel Group Ltd and others, and that legislation is
already in place to tackle bogus resellers. The enforcers, who include
not only the OFT, but trading standards, can obtain enforcement orders
against companies under the Enterprise Act 2002. Let me give an example
of how that can be used. Final enforcement orders were obtained in
March 2012 against seven individuals and the companies concerned. Among
other things, those orders prohibit the companies and individuals from
engaging in misleading sales practices when dealing with people who
want to dispose of their timeshares, and the orders require customers
to be given cancellation rights in certain 
<?notus-xml column=1361?>circumstances. So legislation and protection is in place, and it can be,
will be and is enforced. That can provide reassurance, in any

timeshare owners can pursue solutions through a range of avenues, even
though before 2011 they did not have the revised cover of the new

properly to assess the value and detail of not only timeshare
contracts, but timeshare exchange contracts and, most importantly,
contracts for other long-term holiday products. Although “other
long-term holiday products” is a clumsy phrase, it had to be
designed because when the first directive tightened the conditions
under which timeshare contracts could be sold, effectively outlawing
the worst of the timeshare sales practices that were so prevalent in
the ‘70s and ‘80s, these other products suddenly emerged

new directive was implemented in the UK by The Timeshare, Holiday
Products, Resale and Exchange Contracts Regulations 2010, and I will
give the House a few examples of how we saw the rules tightened
significantly. For example, much more information needs to be provided
to consumers about how the contract can be terminated, the methods by
which future costs, such as maintenance charges, will be calculated,
the degree to which timeshare owners have a role in decisions about
future costs and detailed information about precisely what rights are
provided under the contract. All that information is considered to be
part of the contract.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-03T21:44:29"></hs_TimeCode>Importantly, the
directive also provides the consumer with 14 days in which to consider
the decision and withdraw from the contract if they decide it is not
for them after all. No money can be taken from the consumer until that
14 days has elapsed.</hs_Para>

markedly and the industry reports that provisions such as the

is important that when there is evidence of problems in the industry,

position to communicate with the Commission on any problems that have
been found. Obviously, whether any changes are needed will ultimately
be for European agreement, so I encourage those campaigning on the
issue not only to pull together the evidence and the case but to
consider

that might be able to help, I hope that I have been able to reassure
the House and the hon. Lady in particular that there are now far more
robust protections for consumers in the sector. The signs are positive
that the new protections are working. Unfortunately, there will always
be some in the market who attempt to operate outside the law, as there
are in other markets, but the new regime seems in the main to be robust

EU’s multi-annual financial framework (MFF) for 2014-20. The UK,

Government believe that those on Housing Benefit in the social rented
sector should face the same choices about where to live as those living
in the private rented sector. That is why we have removed the spare
room subsidy in the social rented sector by restricting the amount of
Housing Benefit paid to working age social sector tenants who live in a
property that is too large for their needs. This is not a tax on
bedrooms, but 
<?notus-xml column=10?>rather a reduction in the level of state support for housing costs for
those who under
occupy.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13060318000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/petntext/130603p0001.htm#13060318000047">The
Housing Benefit bill must be brought under control. It has increased by
around 50% in real terms over the last decade and in 2012-13
expenditure was estimated at around £24 billion. The Government
cannot expect taxpayers to continue to underwrite people’s
housing costs regardless of the size of their accommodation. People
receiving Housing Benefit who wish to remain in accommodation that is
larger than their household requires need to fund part of the cost
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13060318000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/petntext/130603p0001.htm#13060318000048">The

are approaching 1 million extra rooms being paid for by working age
Housing Benefit at a time when almost quarter of a million people are
living in overcrowded accommodation and there are approaching 2 million
on social housing waiting lists in England alone. Over time the removal
of the spare room subsidy will encourage more effective use of social
housing stock and a more strategic approach in both the allocation of
property and, in the longer term, building programmes, ensuring more
appropriately sized accommodation for demand. It is in the interests of
both social landlords and tenants to ensure a better match between

Payments and from 2013-14 has added a further £25

will enable local authorities to provide additional support, such as
allowing extra time for vulnerable people to find suitable alternative

detect changes in the abundance of insect pollinators accurately is
not, and has never been, carried out systematically in the UK or in
Europe. Our current knowledge is derived from limited abundance surveys
for some species groups or from analysis of occurrence records to
identify changes in range or
diversity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306046000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0001.htm#1306046000121">The
quality of data from which population trends can be derived varies, but
it is possible to make an assessment. In Great Britain there have been
changes in the diversity of wild bees in recent decades, with some
geographical areas showing an increase in diversity but a significantly
greater area showing a decline. Declines are likely to be driven, at
least in part, by contractions in the geographical ranges of specialist
species that are associated with natural or semi-natural habitat or
have narrow forage requirements. There is no single threat that seems
to be driving the changes; intensification of land-use, habitat loss,
pests, diseases, invasive species, inappropriate use of agrochemicals
over the last century and, increasingly, climate change, are all
thought to be playing a
part.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1306046000008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0001.htm#1306046000008">Bees:

Heath</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 21 May 2013]:</I> All mammals are
susceptible (to different degrees) to the bacterium that causes bovine
TB (Mycobacterium bovis). A very small number of cases of M. bovis
infection are recorded 
<?notus-xml column=787?>in domestic cats every year in GB. The clinical presentation and the
epidemiology of those cases strongly suggests that cats (including
feral ones) are spillover hosts of infection in wildlife or

those farmers who consistently demonstrate high standards by driving
forward implementation of earned recognition. Earned recognition was

case for changes in the laws regulating slaughterhouses and abattoirs.
However, the Food Standards Agency has commissioned an independent
review into its response to the recent incidents of adulteration of
processed beef products with horse and pig meat and DNA. This will make
recommendations to the Food Standards Agency Board on the relevant
capacity and capabilities of the Agency and any actions that should be
taken to maintain or build them. This review is being led by Professor
Pat Troop, with findings to be presented to the Food Standard Agency's
Open Board meeting on 4 June 2013. Findings from this review will feed
into the strategic review of the incident and its implications for the
food chain. These reviews will help the Government establish if there
are weaknesses or gaps within the current regulatory framework, and how
these should be addressed to maintain consumer confidence and ensure
the integrity of the meat processing supply
chain.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1306046000039" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0001.htm#1306046000039">Travel</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1306046000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0001.htm#1306046000306"><B><Member PimsId="3065" UID="1306046000432" xid="186" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0001.htm#1306046000432">Maria

Gauke:</Member></B> HMRC is responsible for the collection and
management of the taxes it administers. HMRC carries out checks into
returns to make sure that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax
at the right time and receiving the right allowances and tax reliefs.
HMRC does not reimburse the normal day to day costs people incur in
complying with their legal obligations. This includes the cost of
normal communications, of clarifying or verifying matters, and
preparing returns and the costs arising from inquiries and
interventions. A random inquiry is just like any other compliance check
and is undertaken in a way proportionate to the risks addressed.
Inquiries are closed down promptly if no additional tax is due. A
taxpayer can ask a Tribunal for an inquiry to be closed if they believe
it is kept open too
long.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13060413000046" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0002.htm#13060413000046">Scotland</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13060413000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0002.htm#13060413000420"><B><Member PimsId="3725" UID="13060413001623" xid="249" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0002.htm#13060413001623">Mr

Soubry:</Member></B> The Department recognises that the impact of human
trafficking on victims is significant for both mental health and
physical health. We also recognise that our current understanding in
this area is limited. Therefore, the Department has commissioned a
33-month study of trafficking and health issues, under its Policy
Research Programme. The project is entitled: "Optimising
identification, referral and care of trafficked people within the NHS".
It started in July 2012 and is due to finish by March 2015. The
overarching aim of this research is to provide evidence to inform the
NHS response to human trafficking, specifically in the identification
and referral of trafficked people, and in the provision of safe and
appropriate care to meet their health
needs.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13060413000076" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0003.htm#13060413000076">ICT</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13060413001209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0003.htm#13060413001209"><B><Member PimsId="4261" UID="13060413001697" xid="589" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0003.htm#13060413001697">Mr

Connecting for Health (NHS CfH) was part of the Department’s
informatics directorate until its move to the Health and Social Care
Information Centre on 1 April 2013. While part of the

Department and NHS CfH including suppliers of equipment used. It is

These data are estimates of the number of items claimed by those aged
65+ in 2013-14, based on current prescription
levels.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>2</Sup> Scenario 1 assumes
that three quarters of the population aged 65 and over would use
pre-payment certificates to claim prescriptions should exemption be
withdrawn. This is a more likely scenario because people in this age
group generally claim multiple prescriptions and would therefore
benefit from use of pre-payment certificates. The estimated theoretical
maximum revenue (Scenario 2) is based, on the assumption that all those
aged 65 and over would pay for prescription charges at the point of
dispensing, paying £7.85 per prescription item. Note that those
on lower incomes are likely to claim more prescriptions than those on
higher incomes, so these estimates are likely to be over-estimates, as
these calculations assume that each group will claim prescriptions at
the same rate. In addition, people in this age group are more likely to
have long term medical conditions and may be eligible for medical
exemption certificates (MEDEX) if free prescriptions were
withdrawn.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>3</Sup> To simplify
these calculations, the estimates above have been applied to all those
in England aged over 65 years. However, the female state pension age is

all levels of the Ethiopian Government. In April officials at the
British embassy in Addis Ababa raised with Ethiopian State Ministers
the issue of displacement of ethnic Amharas from the Benishangul-Gumuz
region. We obtained assurances that this had been a mistake, that the
Amharas had returned home, and that the Government officials involved
in the displacement had been removed from their posts and that an

about the implementation of the commune programme (sometimes referred

criminal penalties for copyright infringement irrespective of whether
electronic rights management information has been removed from the
copyright works. For example, section 107 of the Copyright, Designs and
Patents Act 1988 already provides a criminal offence where, under
section 107(2A), a person communicates a copyright work to the public,
knowing or having reason to believe that he is infringing copyright and
the act was either done in the course of a business or it prejudicially
affects the owner of the copyright. Criminal proceedings may also be
brought under the Fraud Act 2006, where a person strips metadata and
falsely claims to be the copyright owner in order to make a gain for
himself (Section 2 Fraud by false

and autonomous institutions further and higher education institutions
are responsible for all matters relating to student conduct including
monitoring performance and attainment levels. Higher education is an
adult environment. However, it is a long-established principle that
universities have a duty of care to their students. This is also true
for further education colleges where the age range of students is
wider. As such, both types of institution will determine what welfare
and counselling services they need to provide to their students to
offer appropriate
support.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13060415000047" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0004.htm#13060415000047">Technology

especially both pre-service and in-service skills training. The last

skilled health workers who are trained, deployed where most needed and

not be

security situation in Darfur which is deteriorating. The UK continues
to press the Government of Sudan, rebel movements and tribal leaders to
work for peace as well as lobbying for access through our bilateral
relations and in the UN Security Council. The lack of access in Darfur
is seriously impacting the ability of agencies to deliver aid. As
acknowledged in a report of 10 April to the UN Security Council by the
UN Secretary General the United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur
could be more effective in carrying out its mandate to protect
civilians. Officials have discussed the effectiveness of the mission on

At the Conference the UK welcomed the re-commitment of the Government
of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement made to meet their
obligations under the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur. My officials
took the opportunity to remind the Government of Sudan of the need to
improve the operating environment for development to be effective.

conflict between the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N)
and the Government of Sudan in South Kordofan and Blue Nile and the
impact this is having on civilians. The ongoing violence and
restrictions on access make assessing the humanitarian need difficult.
However discussions with UN agencies and non-governmental organisations
and the condition of new refugee arrivals in Ethiopia and South Sudan
point to an increasingly urgent situation. We continue to urge both
parties to agree a cessation of hostilities. Once access is granted, we
will move quickly to understand what help is needed, and ensure that
independent humanitarian agencies can start to provide the assistance

British passport relies on the person's ability to show their
entitlement to British citizenship and to confirm their identity. Her

of the applicant at the time of their application as an address does
not reflect the country of birth or nationality. However, data acquired

minimum sentence for repeat driving offences at the present time. There
is nothing preventing the courts from imposing sentences up to the
maximum penalty if the offending behaviour is serious enough. This
includes custodial sentences of up to 14 years for the most serious
offences, including driving while disqualified and driving or
attempting to drive under the influence of excess alcohol, as well as
dangerous driving and offences where death was caused. The courts take
relevant previous offences into account into deciding what sentence to

an element of a monetary award, that judgment will be issued to the
parties involved, and the respondent will be directed to pay as
appropriate. If the respondent fails to satisfy that award (i.e. fails
to make the appropriate payment), the claimant is then able to bring
enforcement proceedings through a civil court. Therefore the employment
tribunal has no means of ascertaining what awards are satisfied, and
what awards are not. As a result there is no information held on the
number of awards that are satisfied, or the number that remain
unpaid.</hs_Para>

Policy savings in UEP are estimated against a 2009 baseline. Since CCAs
pre-date 2009, UEP figures are estimated legacy and planned savings
from the extension of the scheme over the period 2008 to 2015 and to
2020 for targets set up to 2010. Estimates published in 2012 correspond
to the analysis published by the Energy Efficiency Strategy which
includes legacy savings but excludes emissions savings from new CCA

its site licence companies (SLCs) are responsible for tackling the
nuclear legacy. In doing so they are required to ensure that they
maintain and improve the skills in local communities necessary to
deliver their mission. One of the ways they can do so is 
<?notus-xml column=950?>through their procurement of goods and services from the supply chain.
Procurement across the NDA’s estate is a matter for the NDA and
the SLC’s, which they carry out in line with EU procurement
rules. The Government is not involved in individual procurements, but
within the bounds of procurement rules, we do encourage the NDA to use
procurement to help deliver their responsibility to maintain and
develop local skills. We have agreed a small and medium enterprise
(SME) action plan with the NDA. This seeks to reduce barriers and
increase opportunities for SMEs, which tend to have a strong local
presence, in the NDA’s supply chain. We also encourage local
suppliers to bid for contracts, in the hope the work can be performed
locally and contribute to local economic
growth.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13060419000042" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130603/text/130603w0007.htm#13060419000042">Renewable
