Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, under
the Video Recordings Act 1984, videos on recordable media,
such as DVDs, are classified by the British Board of Film
Classification. However, to date many products about sports, music,
religion and education have been exempt from this requirement.
Following a public consultation, the Government announced last month
that they will bring forward legislation to tighten up the exemptions
and to ensure that, in future, any products in these genres will be
classified if they contain material deemed to be unsuitable for younger
children.</hs_para>

Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his reply. I am
sure that he is not aware of Cannibal Corpse’s “Live
Cannibalism” DVD being legally supplied to British children or,
indeed, the double-disc set “His Name was Jason: Thirty Years of
Friday the 13th”, so the change in the law for such content to
be brought within the regulatory scope of the BBFC cannot come too
soon.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061260000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000004">I note
that the Government’s announcement also mentioned another
potential loophole in the current regime, that being online music

consider following the example of the home entertainment industry by

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I think we are agreed that
the number one priority in all we are seeking to do is to protect
children. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have been
rightly robust about this, as have many noble Lords. The Government are
taking action to protect children from inappropriate content, and there
are strong intentions in the online area as well because it is clearly
the case that children are viewing content online. We are therefore
going to do more in the area of online video labelling, and we are
working with many organisations and parents to deal with music or
anything that could be potentially harmful to younger
children.</hs_para>

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the Minister on
confirming that the Government have decided to act decisively to ensure
that currently exempt material which is potentially harmful to children
is brought within the regulatory ambit of the BBFC. I mention this
because as long ago as 2009 I moved amendments in this House seeking to
change the law in this area. How swiftly does the Minister think that
this change to the current regime can be implemented? I know that it
has the support of the BBFC and, most importantly, of the parents of
vulnerable children.</hs_para>

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I know of the deep interest
of the noble Baroness in content available online, which we need to
deal with. So far as this matter is concerned, we are working carefully
to ensure that the definitions dealing with violent sexual behaviour
and swearing are worded so as to ensure that they identify all products
that are unsuitable for younger children. The final version of the
definitions will be written into the draft legislation that is to be
issued for consultation soon. We want to get it right and we would very
much welcome any comments. We will then need to notify the EU about the
new regulations, following which there will be the secondary
legislative process.</hs_para>

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the
greatest crime of the 21st century is the destruction of childhood
innocence? The second greatest crime is preventing young people growing
up normally and naturally. Will he be a little bit generous in his
interpretation of the word “children” to make sure that
we do not expose young men in puberty and girls of equivalent age to
things which, frankly, they should never ever be able to
see?</hs_para>

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I have sympathy with my
noble friend. Childhood at whatever age is a very precious time of our
lives and children should be able to enjoy it. It is important that the
Government should work with parents because their first priority and
responsibility is looking after their children. It is obvious that
online content is troubling many parents, so that is why we are working
to set up internet parental controls and are working with wi-fi
providers on a number of issues. In that way, we can ensure that
children do not see inappropriate content.</hs_para>

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, it is very much a feature of
technology moving so fast that we also need to ensure that the checks

technological advances children do not see inappropriate content, which
is what we want to ensure.</hs_para>

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> The noble Lord
again raises an important point. That is why, across the
piece, the Government, industry and charity, through the UK Council for
Child Internet Safety, are working so much together and why the

internet service providers, mobile operators, search engines and social

public service broadcasting are hugely important for our society. Rapid
changes in technology and convergence between the internet and
television could affect both considerably over time. The Government
acknowledged this in their response to the recent Communications
Committee report on convergence, yet now they propose to get rid of
Ofcom’s obligations to review public service broadcasters on a

“foreign agents” law. These concerns are outlined in the
FCO’s <I>Human Rights and Democracy</I> report for this year. In
recent months the Foreign Secretary, the Minister for Europe, and my
noble friend the Minister of State for Justice have raised this subject
with their Russian counterparts. Two days before the Prime
Minister’s 10 May visit to Sochi, senior officials raised
concerns about the treatment of civil society at the annual UK-Russia

vibrant civil society, participating in public debates and analysing

to a healthy democracy? How can the recent draconian action by the
Russians, with more than 208 organisations now raided by government
officials, possibly strengthen democracy and stability in Russia? How
can this be reconciled with membership of the Council of Europe? What
are the Government, together with European Union partners, doing, in

therefore suggest that the better approach at present is probably

network of high-quality museums and galleries, both national and
regional, which educate and delight local people and tourists alike.
DCMS has overall responsibility for those in England. These museums
have a strong identity within their local communities. They are often
at the heart of their regions’ creative industries, provide an

committed to promoting tourism in the regions, but also to encouraging
youngsters to follow careers in science and engineering, is it not
incomprehensible that the Science Museum Group is faced with a possible
further 10% funding cut, on top of the 25% cut, thus publicly having to
state that it might have to close one of its three regional museums?
The Manchester Museum of Science &amp; Industry, or MOSI, attracts
700,000 visitors a year of all ages. They come to see the
museum of the first industrial city, the first baby computer and the
first passenger railway station in Manchester. Would it not be
bordering on the criminal if there was any question of contraction or
closure?</hs_para>

a trustee of the Science Museum Group and as a former chairman, like
the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, of the advisory board of MOSI in
Manchester. The Minister is right to draw attention to the huge
popularity of MOSI. It is a similar story at the other
museums in the Science Museum Group. The total number of visitors now
exceeds 5 million a year. However, is he aware—and I hope that
he listens very carefully to the points made by his noble
friend—that the group has had to accept funding cuts of 25%,
as the noble Lord says, over the past four years? A further
10%, if that is contained in the spending review, may make it
inevitable, although very undesirable, that one of the museums in the
group may have to close. Can he use all his influence to make sure that
that spending review does not contain a cut on that

concern that has been expressed in the north, in particular in
Yorkshire and in Manchester. Clearly, as I said, the spending review
process has not been completed. I am absolutely sure that ministerial
colleagues to whom I have spoken in the department are absolutely clear
about the contribution that museums make to the tourism market. The
DCMS museums are the first six of all visitor attractions in the

Liverpool, the Imperial War Museum North and the Museum of Science

rightly drawn our attention today—and recognise that they make a
major contribution to the cultural and educational life of the north of
England? They are an indispensable asset for children in our schools.
If they were to be removed at a time when we are trying to promote

there to be any sense of divide. As the noble Lord has quite rightly

in the regional

draconian cuts that are being imposed have put a huge problem in the
face of all the museums? Given the Imperial War Museum’s scope
of museums, there is no doubt that one has to look at what draws the
most visitors. There is no doubt that a museum such as the Imperial War
Museum North—which is an amazing facility opposite the BBC in
Salford, and is a fantastic focus—has to be at threat. I would
ask whether we are looking at the dreadful business of possibly
charging people, because I cannot see how museums can go forward with

our national and regional museum life. I am very

With the commemoration of the First World War and the investment that
is going into the Imperial War Museum, and certainly from the meetings

task persuading your Lordships. It is important to say that under the
National Heritage Act 1983 the appointment of trustees must have regard
to their experience of the development of science and technology, in
the case of MOSI, and to their knowledge of management, industrial
relations and administration. Interestingly, the chairman of the
Science Museum lives in West Yorkshire, and I am led to believe that
half the representatives of the board of trustees live outside London.

average, around 3,700 heart procedures are carried out each year on
children who have been diagnosed with congenital heart conditions. The
mortality rates at Bristol Royal Infirmary, identified as far back as
1989, indicated that we are not as successful as we 
<?notus-xml column=1606?>should be in such operations. The Safe and Sustainable review began in
2008 and set out to make sure that children’s heart services are
the best they can be for all children across the country. Whatever the
controversy about the location of such services, we all have a
responsibility to ensure the best possible outcomes for children and
their families, who must always come first in any decision about

Ian Kennedy, in his Bristol inquiry report in 2001, recommended the
concentration of medical and nursing expertise in a smaller number of
centres. Subsequent working groups and reports have endorsed that
recommendation, including the Royal College of Surgeons in 2007. The
public consultation on the Safe and Sustainable review received over
75,000 responses. This was the largest review of its kind, conducted
independently of government by the
NHS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000064">In July
2012, the then Joint Committee of Primary Care Trusts—the
JCPCT—on behalf of local NHS commissioners, decided that
children’s heart surgery networks should be formally structured
around specialist surgical centres in Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool,
Newcastle and Southampton, as well as Great Ormond Street and the
Evelina Children’s Hospital in London. They recommended that
services should no longer be provided in Leicester, Leeds, Oxford and
the Royal Brompton and Harefield in London. Following the
JCPCT’s announcement, three local health overview and scrutiny
committees formally referred the JCPCT’s decision for me to
review and I wrote to the Independent Reconfiguration Panel—the
IRP—asking them to undertake a full review of the
proposals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000065">On
30 April 2013 I received the report. I would like to thank the IRP for
producing such a comprehensive review of such a challenging topic. It
strongly agrees with the case for change, specifically that congenital
cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology should only be provided
by specialist teams large enough to sustain a comprehensive range of
interventions, round-the-clock care, specialist training and research.
I agree with their
analysis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000066">However,
the report also concludes that the outcome of the Safe and Sustainable
review was based on a flawed analysis of the impact of incomplete
proposals, and leaves too many questions about sustainability and
implementation. This is clearly a serious criticism of the Safe and
Sustainable process. I therefore accept their recommendation that the
proposals cannot go ahead in their current form and am suspending the
review today. NHS England will also seek to withdraw its appeal against
the judicial review successfully achieved by Save Our Surgery in
Leeds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000067">None
the less, the IRP is clear that the clinical case for change remains,
and its report is very helpful in setting out the way forward in terms
of broadening the scope of the discussion, and looking in detail
at the affordability and sustainability of the proposals.
The IRP says—and I agree—that this is not a mandate for
the status quo or for going back over all the ground already covered
during the last five years. The case for change commands widespread
support and understanding and we must continue to seek every
opportunity to improve services for children.</hs_para>

recommendations in the report set out what the IRP considers needs to
be done to bring about the desired improvements in services in a way
that addresses gaps and weaknesses in the original proposals.
Specifically, they include: better co-ordination with the review of
adult heart surgery services; expanding the detailed work on
the clinical model and associated service standards for the
whole pathway of care, beyond surgery; services to be fully modelled
and their affordability retested; NHS England to establish a
systematic, transparent, authoritative and continuous stream of data
and information about the performance of congenital heart services; NHS
England and the relevant professional associations to put in place the
means to continuously review the pattern of activity and optimise
outcomes for the more rare, innovative and complex procedures; NHS
England to reflect on the criticisms of the JCPCT’s assessment
of quality and learn lessons to avoid similar situations in its future
commissioning of specialist services; and NHS England to use the
lessons from this review to create with its partners a more resource
and time-effective process for achieving genuine involvement and
engagement in its commissioning of specialist services.</hs_para>

move forward on the basis of these clear recommendations and the Leeds
court judgment. I have therefore today written to NHS England, and the
local overview and scrutiny committees that originally referred the
JCPCT’s decision to me, to explain that the IRP’s report
shows that the proposals of the Safe and Sustainable review clearly
cannot go ahead in their current form. It is right to give all parties
some time to reflect on the best way forward, now that the IRP report
is in the public domain, so I have asked NHS England to report back to
me by the end of July on how it intends to proceed. In the mean time,
it is important to stress that I believe that care for children with
congenital heart conditions is safe in the NHS, and that ensuring it
continues to be will be the top priority for all involved in this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000070">I
know that many families have found the Safe and Sustainable review to
be a traumatic experience. People are rightly proud of the hospitals
and the staff that have saved, or tried their best to save, the lives
of their children. However, there is overwhelming consensus that we
cannot stick with the model of care that we have now. To do so would be
a betrayal of the families who lost loved ones in Bristol and who want
nothing more than for the NHS to learn the lessons from their personal
tragedies. So it is right we continue with this process, but it is also
essential that it is performed correctly so that any decisions, as
difficult as they may ultimately be, carry the confidence of the
public. I commend the report and this Statement to the

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for
repeating the Statement and for reminding the House of the events which
led to the Safe and Sustainable review. Terrible failings in the care
of very sick children at the Bristol Royal Infirmary in the
1980s and 1990s led Sir Ian Kennedy to call for expertise to be
concentrated on fewer surgical sites, a call supported by more
immediate, recent events, including the suspension 
<?notus-xml column=1608?>of children’s heart surgery at the John Radcliffe Hospital in
Oxford in 2010. Since Bristol, Sir Ian’s important conclusion
has had the support of the health professions and all sides of the
House.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061260000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000073">As we
digest what the noble Earl has said, two considerations must remain
foremost in our minds. First, this issue continues to transcend party
politics; and secondly, the complexity it presents should not derail us
from our determination to deliver the safest possible care for children
in the country. That said, changes of this magnitude must be able to
command consensus and public confidence and that has not happened since
the decision on site selection by the joint committee.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061260000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000074">When<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
it was published, while the Opposition supported the reduction in
sites, we expressed concerns about the distribution of the seven sites,
skewed towards the west of England and leaving a large swathe of
eastern England, from Newcastle to London, without a centre. For a
family living in Hull or Lincoln, the prospect of leaving home to
travel hundreds of miles, with the cost of accommodation and time off
work, added to their stress and anxiety. Therefore, it is not
surprising that there has been such strength of feeling, particularly
across Yorkshire, the Humber and east Midlands. While clinical safety
must predominate, does the noble Earl agree that the NHS needs to give
further consideration to public access and travel times when
reconfiguring services? In this case, as the IRP points out, the joint
committee considered access the least important factor. The IRP
concluded, surely rightly, that the decision used a flawed and
incomplete analysis of accessibility. Going forward, can the noble Earl
tell me that his department will ensure that that is corrected and that
access will be a significant factor in a future

the review itself, the noble Earl will know that one main concern has
been that mortality data were not given enough weight. While decisions
on this cannot be based on death rates alone, we agree with John
Deanfield, the director of NICOR, who, in his letter to NHS England in
April 2013,
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13061260000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000172">“Mortality

main concern we have with the announcement that the Government have
made today is the proposal to link the children’s review with
the review of adult heart services and the implications that might have
for the timetable. The Statement uses the words “better
co-ordination”. I understand that about 30 centres are carrying
out adult heart surgery. The seven selected centres for children will
not be collocated with adult heart surgery. As the noble Earl knows,
there are a number of specialist children’s sites. The link
between the children’s sites and the adults’ sites is not
at all clear. Is there a danger that, by linking the review with adult
heart surgery, the Government risk a loss of focus and, indeed, more
delay? By broadening it in this way, is there a danger that we will
lose the consensus that has already been gained over the future of
children’s heart

clearly have implications for the timetable of the children’s
review. It is noticeable that the Statement does not really contain a
clear timetable. Can the noble Earl set out a more precise timetable

wonder whether the noble Earl has seen the response from the Royal
College of Surgeons today. It expressed disappointment that the reform
plans will be suspended, adding to what it describes as a long and
exhaustive process. In its final comment, it urges NHS England to act
swiftly and decisively, and
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13061260000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000173">“Continued

the noble Earl respond to that? He says that the review will be

Statement sets out a major role for NHS England going forward. Can I be
assured that, in the process that NHS England takes forward, it will
operate independently of interests linked to the selected sites? Does
he agree that it is vital that we do not lose confidence in the process
and damage confidence in all 10 existing services? I noted what he said
in reassuring the House about safety. I welcome that, but is his
department taking action to ensure that all existing units will not
lose expertise in the intervening period? That will be a source of

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Hunt, for his measured comments. I agree with many, if not most, of
them. I certainly agree that party politics should play no part in this
matter. That is one reason why in 2008 his Government decided that the
safe and sustainable review should be a process set apart from the
Department of Health and led by the NHS. We agree with that and still
believe that it should be NHS-led. I also agree with what he said about
the complexity of this issue being no excuse for 
<?notus-xml column=1610?>not proceeding as fast as is safe and possible with
a process designed to see a satisfactory resolution of this issue. That
is certainly our view.</hs_para>

noble Lord said about public confidence. It is clear that parts of the
safe and sustainable process sadly did not command public confidence,
not least in Leeds, but also in Leicester and other places. The noble
Lord will no doubt have noticed, in the IRP’s press releases
today, the emphasis on openness and transparency in the process going
forward. NHS England has also made clear that whatever the process that
it recommends going forward, it should involve the maximum amount of
consultation with those concerned, not just the clinicians in the
centres involved, who are of course very important, but also patients
and their families.</hs_para>

to the need for greater consideration to be given to access and travel
times. I noted an emphasis on that very point in
recommendation 4 of the IRP’s report. They clearly matter to
families, as was very much picked up by the IRP in its work engaging
with stakeholders. In agreeing to address all the recommendations of
the IRP report, which NHS England has done, it could not fail to
address that part of the
recommendation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000085">With
regard to mortality data, I am sure that the noble Lord will understand
that when we are dealing with a procedure as complicated and specialist
as children’s congenital heart surgery, while transparency of
data is certainly an objective, it is important that the data published
are not open to misinterpretation. Mortality data are a problem that
beset this kind of area because the numbers are small. They must also
be presented in a way that is understandable to the public as well as
to clinicians. For the most part, clinicians already have this data,
but it is important going forward to ensure that when we publish data,
there is genuine comparability between the various centres in terms of
the outcomes
denoted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000086">The
noble Lord rightly said that, by introducing the dimension of adult
cardiac surgery, the IRP had added greater complexity to the whole
issue. There is no doubt that that is true. All I will say to him is
that this was by far the longest and most complicated review
that the IRP has undertaken in its 10-year history. It took evidence
over 25 full days. That alone should indicate that the
opinions that were tapped were very extensive. The IRP did not come up
with this recommendation lightly. Although it adds complexity, it
behoves NHS England to take that point extremely

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I take us back to Sir Ian
Kennedy’s review 12 years ago in which he made it crystal clear
that unless we significantly reduced the number of these centres,
children would continue to die unnecessarily. That was the brutal
conclusion of the Bristol inquiry. Has anything come out of the IRP
review that fundamentally changes the July 2012 decision of the Joint
Committee of Primary Care Trusts that seven centres, with clinical
networks built around them, was the right number? As I understand it,
the argument is not necessarily that seven was the wrong number of
centres, but that the wrong seven were chosen. Are we not now opening
up the whole issue of the relationship with adult services, which will
take us back to a situation where we start to review from the beginning
the appropriateness of the particular centres? Do we not need to get
back to where the JCPCT was when there was a good deal of consensus
around the idea that seven was the right kind of number? The
issue is really about east coast versus west coast, and the danger of
this report, thorough though it may be, is that it will now reopen all
the issues on which we had actually made a good deal of progress by
2012.</hs_para>

by the clinical community and noble Lords that we are little further
forward in terms of deciding exactly where these services should be
delivered. The noble Lord is also right to say that support for a
philosophy of improving children’s heart services by
concentrating surgical expertise to provide round-the-clock cover and
develop networks of care is as strong as ever. There is a rare
consensus on the clinical case for improving services on the pathway of
care for children. The IRP has said that its report is not a mandate
for going back over the ground of the past five years; indeed, it
commends a great deal of the work done by the JCPCT. The IRP says that
that work should be built upon. The JCPCT should not necessarily feel
bruised by this, although I am sure that it will feel

Little Hearts Matter, the organisation that represents a large number
of families who have children with heart conditions, particularly
hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which is extremely serious and needs
highly skilled intervention. Who does the Minister think is most
disappointed about the failure of the review? I probably meet more
families and children than most of your Lordships—children who
await open heart surgery or extremely complex technical interventions,
and whose anxiety is huge; and parents who thought that they were going
to have clear answers on where their children would receive treatment
and on the quality of those interventions at the end of the safe and
sustainable review. I ask the Minister to take back with him all those
disappointments and to look not only at safety, which is key to the
families. Many of them would travel to wherever you took them if they
were sure that the operation would be successful. As a woman from
Yorkshire and the east of England, I understand that gap, but what the
families want most is quality of service.</hs_para>

ask the Minister whether it is those issues or other issues that have

outcomes for these children, I do not believe that it is in
anyone’s interests to try to say to ourselves that we can make
do with a half-good set of solutions. I do not suggest that the noble
Baroness is saying that; of course she is not. We need to be thorough
about this without spending another 10 years over it. I hope

paediatric and adult heart surgery that stand comparison with the best
cardiac centres in the world. I know that this further delay is going

regard to Clause 97 standing part of the Bill, I should like to refer
the noble Earl to paragraph 8 of the first report this Session of the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The committee
expressed concern over the Secretary of State’s powers to amend
the main functions of the Health Research Authority. If, as suggested,
they were needed to meet the obligations of an EU directive, an
appropriate amendment could be made by exercising powers under Section
2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. If that is the case, perhaps
the noble Earl could explain why the Secretary of State

agree very much with the tenor of what the noble Lord, Lord Collins,
had to say. The Committee will know that our vision is to improve the
health and wealth of the nation through research. The Government are
committed to cutting the bureaucracy involved in health and social care
research. We want to speed up the initiation and delivery of research
so that research findings can benefit people more quickly and improve
the UK’s competitiveness in the life sciences.
At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:26:01"></hs_TimeCode> the same

97 sets out the Health Research Authority’s four main functions,
which are described in more detail in Clauses 98 to 104. It also sets
out the authority’s main objective in performing those
functions. The Health Research Authority will have functions in four
main areas. These will be, first, functions relating to the
co-ordination and standardisation of practice relating to the
regulation of health and social care research; secondly, functions
relating to research ethics committees; thirdly, functions as a member
of the UK Ethics Committee Authority; and, lastly, functions relating
to approvals for the exceptional processing of confidential patient
information. The Health Research Authority’s main objective in
carrying out its functions will be to protect participants, potential
participants and the general public by encouraging safe and ethical
research, and to promote their interests by facilitating the conduct of
such research. This objective has been deliberately framed in a way
that ensures that the interests of participants and the public are put
first<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:27:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

research sometimes involves a degree of risk, so regulation provides
participants, potential participants and the public with assurance that
there are appropriate safeguards in which they can be confident. The
Health Research Authority will meet the first part of its objective
through the regulatory functions that this Bill confers on it relating
to the regulation of health research and social care research in order
to protect the dignity, rights, safety and well-being of research
participants. The second part of the Health Research Authority’s
overarching objective is to promote the interests of participants,
potential participants and the general public in health research and
social care research. The Health Research Authority will promote these
interests by facilitating high quality and ethical research. This
includes co-operating with others to create a unified approval process
for research and to promote consistent and proportionate standards
for compliance and
inspection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:28:33"></hs_TimeCode>. To
meet its objective of protecting and promoting participants,
potential participants and public interest in research, we would expect
the HRA to engage patients and the public in its work. For
example, Schedule 7 would give it the power to set up committees or
sub-committees which may include people from outside the Health
Research
Authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:28:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

specifics of Amendment 58A, which seeks to make encouraging the
translation of research into innovative practice a function of the
Health Research Authority. First, I should like to reassure the noble
Lord, Lord Collins, and the Committee that we are fully committed to
encouraging the translation of research into practice. The Health and
Social Care Act 2012 recognises the need to promote research and the
use of research evidence and has created unprecedented powers and
duties at all levels to meet that need. When it was passing through
your Lordships’ House, we debated the duties that the Act places
on the Secretary of State. Noble Lords will remember that the Act
places a duty on the Secretary of State to promote the use within the
health service of evidence obtained 
<?notus-xml column=1618?>from research when exercising his functions in
relation to the health service. The 2012 Act also places equivalent
duties on the NHS Commissioning Board, now known as NHS England, and
clinical commissioning groups when they are exercising their functions
under the 2012
Act.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061260000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000203">4.30

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has a key role here.
Its guidance helps health and care professionals to deliver the best

regulate the professions—the General Medical Council, the
General Dental Council, the Nursing and Midwifery Council—as
well as the nurses. I agree entirely with the statement that
the nurses should be included. In saying this I should also mention the
pharmacists, who play an important part in research. I have been

Amendments 61 and 62. On Amendment 60, I emphasise the important part
played by the local R&amp;D committees of NHS trusts, which the noble
Lord, Lord Hunt, mentioned. We now have the Health Research
Authority, which is doing a really remarkable job in speeding up the
process for approval of research by bringing together the different
research ethics committees and the special ethical approval for
research, using data where patients are no longer able to give consent.
It has developed a single portal of entry and a single application,
which is having an enormously helpful effect, but there
remains one major hurdle in the way of those trying to carry out
multicentre clinical trials: the local R&amp;D committees of NHS
trusts. Some are good and speedy while others are slow and capricious,
and the whole clinical trial is determined by the slowest and most
capricious of those who have to give approval.</hs_para>

Medical Sciences reviewed research regulation, it identified the local
R&amp;D committees as the most difficult and time-consuming concerned,
with delays of almost a year in too many instances, so in Amendment 60
we are trying to give the HRA the responsibility of rationalising and
improving the approval 
<?notus-xml column=1622?>processes in R&amp;D committees. If it can get the
approval of all trust R&amp;D committees to rely on and accept a single
robust assessment, covering all their various concerns, it will not
only relieve them of that burden but give them the confidence that the
review has been properly performed. It will also speed up the process
for researchers. I hope that we can include this message in the Bill at
a time when I know that the HRA itself is working hard to achieve it.

for its efforts.</hs_para>

Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, I was
uncertain whether to speak on these amendments in the presence of two
past presidents of medical royal colleges, the noble Lords, Lord
Turnberg and Lord Patel. I feel unable to support Amendment
58B because the medical royal colleges are not regulatory bodies. They
are essentially educational bodies. They play a role in producing and
monitoring the standards of qualifying examinations for those seeking
to be specialists, but they are essentially educational and do not have
a regulatory role, although, of course, they play an important part in
advising on a whole range of health service issues.</hs_para>

is right that Amendment 58C should be inserted, because the bodies
mentioned are regulatory authorities. The General Medical Council, for

This is very relevant to the qualities and responsibilities of the HRA,

this point. I have raised the issue of the importance of evidence-based
practice and the need for us to be able to develop research within the
nursing profession where, to date, it has not been at the forefront of
progress. Having the Chief Nursing Officer taking part in the work of
the research authority, although perhaps not in its detailed content,
will assist in raising the profile of the importance of research. It
may well be delegated from the CCGs 
<?notus-xml column=1623?>to the health trusts, where we may see professors of research, which
will then encourage research throughout. The nursing profession is the
largest single workforce within the NHS. It is important that we

it is encouraging to see the list in the Bill. When the Health Bill was

what the noble Lord, Lord MacKenzie, said. It seems that, over the
years, nursing has been the poor relation when it comes to promoting
the medical profession. Both are so important, and they have to work
together. If the Francis report tells us anything, it is that we need

should be of a higher profile. It should be applauded and used. I
appreciate very much what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said about lists,
which are a trap that I remember falling into on 
<?notus-xml column=1624?>occasions when I was a Minister. I suspect that the
noble Earl will tell us that we want to have it both ways: sometimes we
want things in regulations because that is more flexible and at other

the NHS trusts involved. The time taken between submission of

unacceptable. Those who are promoting the research, and are the leaders
in it, must get so frustrated when the bureaucracy will not allow them
to go ahead. We need good research. It makes a huge improvement to
patients’ lives, especially, of course, when it is translated to
the patient in the bed, as it were. Anything that we can do to speed

the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, to have an amendment about
the medical royal colleges lead to a discussion on value-based pricing
and the cancer drugs fund. I am tempted to have that debate because it
may be much more interesting; it is an issue that we should debate at
some stage. In responding to the previous amendment, the noble Earl
highlighted the Government’s strong backing for life sciences.
When we talk about value-based pricing, we must consider how we could
reimburse cell-based therapy, which is not drug therapy, at what stage
in the development of cell-based therapy reimbursement should kick in
and what value would be put on different stages. That would be a good

every other way, a clinical trial as part of a multi-centred clinical

be wrong. Surely there is an omission. Amendment 62, to

produces and who should pay heed to it. Here we have a mini-list, but
the not-for-profit and private sectors were missing from it. Anybody
who does work for the NHS should be included. The wording should be
strengthened from “have regard” to “comply
with”. It currently makes no sense whatever. I would be grateful
if the Minister can confirm
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061260000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000158"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Turnberg" PimsId="4356" UID="13061260000314" xid="1473" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061260000314">Lord

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, a great many points have been raised in
this debate, so I may take a little time to respond. I hope that the
Committee will bear with me. Amendments 58B to 62 seek to give the
Health Research Authority a stronger role in streamlining the
management of research, particularly in the NHS. I am the first to
recognise that delays in obtaining research approvals 
<?notus-xml column=1626?>in the NHS remain a problem for many researchers and that there is an
expectation that the Health Research Authority will help to improve
this situation through its relationship with the
NHS.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000002">I also
appreciate that noble Lords, particularly in relation to Amendments 61
and 62, seek reassurance that all providers of NHS services will be
required to pay attention to the guidance that the authority is
required to produce under Clause 98(6). This issue was highlighted by
both the Academy of Medical Sciences and the Wellcome Trust during
pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. The clauses in the Care Bill
would give the Health Research Authority a unique, free-standing duty
to promote the co-ordination and standardisation of practice in the UK
relating to the regulation of health and social care research. At this
point I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, that the duty of
co-ordination and standardisation necessarily involves co-ordinating
and standardising the practice of NHS trust research and development
committees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000003">In
addition, the Health Research Authority will have a reciprocal duty to
co-operate with other regulatory bodies or individuals that have
statutory functions in the regulation of health and social care
research. Statutory functions are an important point. I take this
opportunity to address the three amendments listed here that are
concerned with this duty. In doing so, it is important to explain why
Clause 98(1) would place a duty of co-operation on the HRA and in
particular the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health. The
reason is that the Chief Medical Officer holds functions relating to
research under the Abortion Regulations 1991. These require notice to
be given to the Chief Medical Officer of any abortion and any
information relevant to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000004">The
disclosure of such information is restricted, except in specific
circumstances, which include disclosure for the purposes of scientific
research. The Chief Medical Officer is responsible for determining
whether disclosure can be made. It is because of the Chief Medical
Officer’s functions in approving the disclosure of information
about abortions for the purposes of scientific research that the
authority, the Chief Medical Officer and the bodies and individuals
listed must co-operate with one another with a view to standardising
and co-ordinating practice relating to the regulation of health and
social care research. Similarly, other bodies and individuals listed
have functions relating to the regulation of health or social care
research. So it links in those statutory functions.</hs_para>

care and a great deal of understanding to the noble Lord, Lord
MacKenzie, my noble friend Lady Cumberlege, the noble Baroness, Lady
Emerton, and others on their wish to expand the duty of co-operation to
include the Chief Nursing Officer. The Chief Nursing Officer is an NHS
England role, while the Department of Health has a director of nursing.
Neither of these posts has any statutory functions relating to the
regulation of health or social care research. That is the key point.
For this reason, Clause 98(1) does not create a duty of co-operation on
the HRA either with the Chief Nursing Officer of NHS England or with
the Department of Health’s 
<?notus-xml column=1627?>director of nursing and the bodies and individuals listed in Clause
98(1). I hope that this explanation is
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000006">On
Amendments 58B and 58C, the medical royal colleges, the General Medical
Council, the General Dental Council and the Nursing and Midwifery
Council do not have such statutory functions in this context either.
The noble Lord, Lord Walton, made an important and powerful point about
the GMC. However, the Health Research Authority would have powers,
under paragraph 13 of Schedule 7, to work with the GMC and the other
medical regulators to help and advise them in their work. That, I hope,
will reassure the noble Lord that that aspect of the HRA’s work
has not been forgotten

60A would require the Health Research Authority to assess the impact of
proposed changes to the system for setting pharmaceutical prices on
health and social care research. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord
Hunt, for introducing this extremely interesting topic to our debates.
I believe that this function is best undertaken by the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence rather than making it part of
the authority’s role in
promoting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:10:17"></hs_TimeCode> the
co-ordination and standardisation of regulatory practice. As he will

noble Lord made a point about value-based pricing, in that it is
important for the Government—I agree with him—to take
account of the need to attract investment into this country. As set out
in our plan for growth and our <I>Strategy for UK Life
Sciences</I>, the Government are absolutely committed to ensuring that
the UK continues to offer an environment that supports and encourages
investment and innovation by the life sciences sector, and where the
NHS is a world leader in clinical trials. However, there are some
legitimate points of debate here about the impact of medicine prices on
companies’ decisions on where to locate investments or conduct
research. As highlighted in the 2007 NERA study, <I>Key Factors in
Attracting Internationally Mobile</I><I> Investments by the
Research-</I><I>Based Pharmaceutical Industry</I>, this is a global
market. Companies locate where they can find the best science base at
reasonable cost, taking into account other factors such as
taxation, flexible labour markets and economic stability. It is not
self-evident that the pricing of medicines drives decisions of this
kind. It is an interesting debate to have, but perhaps it is one for
another

noble Lord also asked about the cancer drugs fund. It is very
heartening that more than 30,000 patients in England have
now benefited from that fund, which in total amounts to
£650 million over three and a half years. We are committed to
building on that success. In the context of developing new pricing
arrangements for branded medicines, I can reassure the noble Lord by
saying that we are exploring ways in which new patients can benefit
from innovative cancer drugs at a cost that represents value to the
NHS. NHS England is very much included in that discussion, and we well
appreciate how important it is for
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:13:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

co-operation in this whole area, the Health Research Authority will be
required to take the lead in actively identifying ways in which to
remove duplication, streamlining the regulation of health and social
care research and seeking to ensure that regulation is proportionate.
At this point, I reassure noble Lords that the authority must
facilitate all types of high-quality ethical research, including
research that is multidisciplinary in nature and research by
multiprofessionals. In keeping under review matters relating to the
regulation of health or social care research, the authority may provide
advice to the Secretary of State and must do so on request. Such advice
could include recommendations to improve the regulatory landscape for

98(6) requires the HRA to publish guidance setting out principles of

good practice. Having heard that the main residual barrier to research

Jolly and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, questioned the strength of that

that, in this case, NHS trusts, NHS foundation trusts and local
authorities that provide or arrange care will be under a duty to
consider with great care the guidance published by the HRA and will be
expected to follow it unless they have very clear and cogent reasons
for not doing so. The legal meaning of “have regard to”
has been interpreted in the courts to mean that such guidance must be
followed by those to whom it is addressed unless there are clear and
cogent reasons for them not doing so. In fact, providers, including
private providers of NHS services, can be required to have regard to
the guidance 
<?notus-xml column=1629?>by placing conditions within their operating frameworks and contracts,
for example. In the final analysis, this matter could also be subject

study with a number of pilots to test the effect of rationalising and
combining elements of NHS study-wide review with elements of the
research ethics committee review into a single HRA assessment. The

improve both study set-up times and the quality and consistency of

extended, as I have mentioned, to local authorities. Given that the
HRA’s remit will now also extend to social care research, the
statutory duty to have regard to the authority’s guidance means
that these bodies must consider the guidance with great care. It will
be expected that they will follow such guidance, as I have explained.
We are not seeking to establish the HRA as an inspectorate with
enforcement powers. Such powers would be required if a statutory duty
to follow guidance were to be imposed on private providers, because
there would have to be an express enforcement mechanism, such as powers
to apply a sanction, if these providers failed to have regard to the

existing special health authority is demonstrating, I believe, another
way of working. A great deal can be achieved by working and
co-operating with others. It is collaborating with its stakeholder
community, including the NHS, charities and the private sector. For
instance, securing buy-in through early engagement was key to the
successful adoption of the integrated research application system by
all research approval bodies across the whole of the UK. We
want the HRA to continue to put that spirit of co-operation into
practice and to get support for the guidance that it will be required

produce.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000018">Giving
the HRA powers to take enforcement action would be counterproductive if
it made it more difficult for the authority to take a collaborative
approach to carrying out its work and fostering informed support among
the range of stakeholders. However, a number of mechanisms may be used
as a means to secure compliance with the research governance framework.
I have already mentioned contracts. Funding for research may be
conditional on ensuring compliance with the framework. Compliance with
the current guidance has also been achieved through the system of care
regulation, so there are various ways in which to achieve what the

Howe:</Member></B> I understand the issue that the noble Lord has
raised. There are a number of ways of exercising leverage on foundation
trusts, if I can put it in that rather impolite way. One of them
relates to the funding from the National Institute for Health Research.
The noble Lord may well be aware that as from 1 April that funding is
conditional on the 70-day timeline for the recruitment of the first
patient into a trial. If that timeline is not met, the funding does not
follow. I can tell the noble Lord that that has concentrated minds
rather effectively across the health service, including in foundation
trusts, towards achieving a much more efficient and effective

that high-quality research is one of the best ways to enhance the
quality of patient care. I remain concerned that bodies in the NHS
still do not understand the importance of getting their act together in
research approval. That does not mean that they do not have to go
through a thorough process, because there clearly has to be a rigorous
process to protect the public. I would like to see stronger language in

Patel:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to this amendment in the
name of the noble Lord, Lord Willis of Knaresborough, with some
trepidation. It is not because I do not strongly support his amendment,
but because I hope that I can do justice to it with the kind of passion
that he would have demonstrated when presenting the argument if he had
been here. However, I have no doubt that while resting in his bed, he
has probably turned on BBC Parliament and is watching to see that I do
the task
adequately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000030">I
think the reason why the noble Lord, Lord Willis, has demonstrated such
passion is because he recognises that there is a need to reduce
bureaucracy. Too many regulatory bodies mean more bureaucracy. To give
an example, we have the second-highest number of competent authorities
in the EU. Joint highest are Poland, Romania and Italy. However, on top
of that, we have more regulatory authorities—over a
dozen—than any other EU country. I see noble Lords look rather
surprised, but I believe that to be
true.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000031">One
issue is reducing unnecessary regulatory bodies. Another issue is
reducing bureaucracy. The third issue is reducing duplication. The
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority’s key role is to
improve clinical services related to patients with fertility problems.
The key reason that the authority was set up, following the birth of
Louise Brown, was to reduce public anxiety about in vitro
fertilisation. No such public anxiety now exists related to in vitro
fertilisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000032">Further
functions were added to that authority in terms of embryo research.
There may still be a need for that, but a reducing one. To give an
example, we have enough clinical grade embryonic stem cell lines
to last us a century and supply the world. I think the
derivation of more embryonic stem cell lines is probably unlikely,
unless there is some kind of major breakthrough. Research on embryos
and embryonic stem cell lines is also now slightly superseded by
induced pluripotent cells, dendritic cells and adult cells. However, I
agree that there might still be a need for some embryo research and
that function needs to
remain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000033">The
duplication is likely because the CQC will have a licensing role for
those trusts that provide clinical services in infertility. Of course,
I accept that the majority of infertility services relating to in vitro
fertilisation—and I have no doubt that the noble Lord, Lord
Winston, who is listening to me carefully, will correct me wherever I
go wrong—are in the independent sector. Unless that service is
provided for an NHS patient, the CQC does not have a role, and there
must be a way of overcoming that. If we do not overcome that, the
services provided within the NHS will run the risk of duplication of
effort by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the
CQC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000034">There is
also a fourth argument, and that is the reduction of cost. The noble
Lord, Lord Willis, wrote a letter to the <I>Times</I> asking why all
these regulatory authorities have a whole army of communication
officers. What do they communicate? Why do they need so 
<?notus-xml column=1634?>many? The noble Lord referred to the cost, and there
are also other back office costs that are increased unless
we reduce the number of regulatory authorities. His proposal is that
there should be a reduction and that a body called the Human Tissue and
Embryo Authority should be established rather than the HTA and the
HFEA. The noble Lord lists where the changes would be required in their
functions and in subsection (15) sets out the role of the Care Quality
Commission to streamline all these efforts and reduce
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000035">It is
interesting that initially, in an attempt to reduce the number of
quangos, the Government in the Health and Social Care Act decided that
the HFEA and the HTA, with other quangos, would be abolished. Now, with
the high profile of patient safety, we wonder whether some of the
others should have been abolished. If I remember correctly, we debated
the HFEA and the HTA during the passage of the Health and Social Care

decided to go to consultation, and I understand that Justin McCracken
has been commissioned to review the operating functions of the HFEA and

that this amendment, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Willis of
Knaresborough, would deliver those efficiencies, and I should be

that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has advanced, although I did not know
as much then as I know now about the number of bodies that we had

withdrew. Really, they withdrew because at the end of the day the
savings were—certainly so far as I was concerned—not
significant compared with some of the other savings that could be made.

Winston:</Member></B> My Lords, I fear that I have to support the noble
Lord, Lord Patel, on this amendment, even though I do not think it goes
far enough. In my view, the case for having a Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Authority at all is now quite dubious. It is 20 years or
more since this treatment was established. There is no longer public
anxiety about it, as there was in 1990, when the Act was introduced. It
is now a regular treatment. As long as this treatment is licensed in
this way, it will look like a maverick
treatment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:39:35"></hs_TimeCode> to
people—something extra, outside the health service.</hs_para>

issue is that, sadly, these treatments are affordable only in private
practice. Of course, the health service has done a good deal towards
trying to supply them, but as the noble Earl knows, there are many
examples where people pay very large sums in the private sector for
these treatments and they are not and cannot be regulated. If one was
really going to be serious about regulating in vitro fertilisation, the
first thing that would be needed to prevent couples being exploited
would be to find a way to reduce the massive burden of cost, which is
out of proportion to the actual expense of the treatment. That is
really something that needs to be looked
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:40:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000043">Sadly,
the HFEA has not performed particularly well in the areas of research.
I would like to recount briefly as an example the last licensed
inspection of my own laboratory where we conduct
experiments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:40:44"></hs_TimeCode> on
embryos where there is no possibility of those embryos being
transferred to a human patient. They are of course effectively dying in
culture. It is extraordinary how stringent the last inspection was with
regard to the quality of our laboratory. Why our laboratory should be
seen to be more up to a particular standard than others doing cell
culture work was beyond my comprehension given the fact that these
cells, under no circumstances, could be used for human treatment: they
were simply to investigate a
phenomenon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:41:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061278000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061278000044">I
could not help wondering whether in fact that particular inspection
committee was being vituperative, because it had heard me speak against
the HFEA at a previous debate in the House of Lords. I have no idea
about that. But certainly, given that the previous year we had had a
gold standard approval for our methods, I have to say that the
inspection process is a patchy
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:41:47"></hs_TimeCode>. The problem
really is that, currently, the HFEA licenses treatments that are
practically research procedures that have not been validated and which
are being charged to patients.</hs_para>

have seen this week a full-page advertisement for egg sharing at a
London private clinic. Incidentally, that clinic has been run by a
member of the HFEA. One cannot help but feel that this is a shocking
conflict of interest given that egg sharing is somewhat difficult to
justify in certain circumstances as poor women may be persuaded to give
their eggs under situations that are perhaps not ideal for them. They
may in fact end up with someone else getting treatment at their mental
expense—not 
<?notus-xml column=1636?>their physical expense because they get a free treatment—and then
20 years later finding a child they do not even know about trying to

am really very surprised, too, that no serious attempt has been made to
bar clinics that seek to send patients overseas for treatments that are
not allowed in this country. There are many examples where patients are
sent for various treatments where they might receive more than two
embryos at a treatment, which would be against the regulations in this

revisit the Act of Parliament to see what would be best for purpose. In
the mean time, however, there is a great deal of force in agreeing to
slim down the number of regulatory authorities. As everyone across the
House knows, regenerative medicine is one of the great opportunities
for British medicine. At the moment, one may have to apply to up to
10 different regulatory authorities to get full licensing
for the sorts of procedures one might want to follow for research,
particularly where animal research may have to be done in parallel.

Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, it pains me to oppose this
amendment because the noble Lords, Lord Willis, Lord Patel and Lord
Winston, are people for whom I have the highest possible regard. Each
in their own way has made outstanding contributions to issues relating
to medicine and science in your Lordships’
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:46:27"></hs_TimeCode>. Almost
invariably, we have found ourselves singing the same tune, if perhaps
sometimes in slightly different keys. Having said that, however, I am
opposed 
<?notus-xml column=1637?>to the amendment because I thought that this battle had been won two
years ago. Admittedly, when this Government came into office, they
embarked on what they called the “bonfire of the
quangos”. A huge number of quangos were abolished, but after
careful consideration and an attempt to merge these two bodies, the
decision was made that they should continue to function
independently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

for taking this view. When I came to this House in 1989, my baptism of
fire was the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill that later became
an Act. It was based upon the Warnock report. The function
of the Bill was to create a Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority that would license bodies and scientists working on research
into the human embryo up to 14 days after fertilisation with, first,
the objective of improving the treatment of infertility and, secondly,
of helping in the prevention of inherited diseases. The noble Lord,
Lord Winston, and others were among those who were eventually
extraordinarily successful in carrying out the procedure known as
pre-implantation diagnosis in order to detect embryos which were likely
to cause serious human diseases. That was a very important
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061281000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061281000003">Subsequently, several
other amendments were introduced—and I was deeply involved in
those debates in your Lordships’ House—so that the
licence could allow people to embark on research with these objectives
and to address the important and crucial issue of carrying out research
into the treatment of human disease. That in turn led to the
development of the mechanism for creating stem cells for the treatment
of human disease. There has been a series of progressive amendments
that have been fully debated in your Lordships’ House. Now we
are faced with the very exciting prospect, following an extensive
period of consultation, whereby embryos can be created by pronuclear
transfer derived from women who are likely to pass on devastating
mitochondrial genetic mutations to all of their children of both sexes.
The consultation is now complete and we can look with hope towards the
prospect of the regulations to allow those embryos to be implanted
being introduced into your Lordships’ House. This is a crucial
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:49:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I
agree entirely with certain things that the noble Lord, Lord Winston,
has said—the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has
not functioned as effectively as it might. However, his
criticisms were largely concerned not with the potential merger but
with the actual performance of the body as an
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:49:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

involved in the debates in your Lordships’ House on the
formation of the Human Tissue Authority. This body arose as a result of
the so-called Alder Hey scandal where a huge number of human brains and
other organs were kept in the hospital without the permission of the
families. Of course, it was not recognised in many debates at the time
that certain members of the medical profession held a widespread,
ill-founded belief that once permission was given by a family for a
post mortem examination it was proper to retain organs. That belief was
partly based on the fact that to establish a diagnosis after a post
mortem examination it is essential that certain organs are fixed in
formalin before they can be studied 
<?notus-xml column=1638?>and before the diagnosis can be confirmed. This is
crucial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>. As a
result of the so-called Alder Hey scandal the Human Tissue Authority
was established. It has the authority to license anatomy departments to
handle human organs and pathology departments to study human samples,
both full organs and biopsy specimens. It has the authority to license
organs being used for transplantation purposes and many similar
functions. These departments in universities and hospitals are licensed
by the
HTA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:51:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

two bodies is entirely different and I do not believe that it is
sensible—even in the attempt to create another quango which
brings together two quangos—to merge them. The new body would
undoubtedly have to create two sub-committees, one to look at human
fertilisation and embryology and another to look at the issues of human
tissue and the retention of it. I therefore do not support this

Patel:</Member></B> I disagree with my noble, respected and even
revered friend Lord Walton of Detchant. He fundamentally fails to
understand this amendment. It does not remove the research functions of
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. I have spoken
strongly in the past about embryo research, including cell nuclear
transfer and mitochondrial research. It is the authority that has held
up for so long the progress in mitochondrial research. We should have
been doing something about it at least 18 months ago. This amendment
does not remove that function, nor does it remove the functions of the
Human Tissue Authority, but by amalgamating these functions we can
better promote research. The authority and functions of the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology Authority—and now we are entering
into a science debate, which is not the purpose of the Bill—stop
once it gives a licence to do specific research on an embryo. Once the
embryonic stem cells are created it has no authority over how those
cells are used. Once the cells are used to create a tissue for research
it does not have any authority, but the Human Tissue Authority may do.
By amalgamating the two you are co-ordinating this research function
and maybe improving it. I hope that my noble and revered friend accepts

I fear that I might lower the tone of the debate. However, I think that
my money is with the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant. There is a
world of difference morally between research carried out on tissue
taken from a dead body and research taking place on living tissue which
has the potential to be a human being in one way or
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:54:28"></hs_TimeCode>. People
will argue about when life begins and those arguments can be very
sensitive and very divisive. That is why there is separate legislation
on research and on therapeutic techniques involving eggs fertilised
outside the womb. Whether one likes it or not, if you put together the
Human Tissue Authority and the HFEA you will create an impression that
you are just dealing with dead matter or whatever, just a lump of
cells. That is the impression that will certainly be given
psychologically, even if in practice one could construct the unified
authority in a way that had the two

may well be that one needs to revisit this area. The noble Lord, Lord
Winston, speaks with such authority that I am very reluctant to take a
different view. However, he seemed almost to be arguing for greater
regulation rather than no regulation. I would be very reluctant to see
a free market in implanting more than two embryos into women in this
country, for example. The 14-day rule, which may be an irritant to
researchers, was fought over and discussed at great length. To those of
us who have quite a few reservations in this area, that is at least a
line in the sand. I think that this area needs to be considered on its

further, perhaps I may just take us back and slightly challenge the

Human Tissue Act through this House. I am well seized of the
circumstances that we faced then. At the time, I was bombarded by the
research community with their concerns about setting up that
body and whether it would be another obstacle to research. They
recognised that this country had to do something in legislation in
terms of the EU directive on human tissue. We were caught
between a rock and a hard place. We had to do something about the EU
directive; we had all the concerns about what had happened in
Liverpool; but we were also conscious that we needed to ensure that we

matter being used for research under the aegis of those two
regulatory bodies. In some cases, human tissues were themselves living
cells being used for research, and we did not regard that as
fundamentally a different type of matter from the one that is regulated
for research purposes by the HFEA. I cannot even

these bodies survived. The idea of merging the HFEA and HTA is not new,
as my noble friend Lord Warner said, and has been rejected on more than
one occasion. I am puzzled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, raising it
now, especially in the middle of yet another review. What I waited to
hear, particularly from noble Lords with scientific and
research backgrounds, was what the public thought. The right reverend
Prelate was right when he said that this is also about how people feel
about these issues, not just how the great doctors and scientists think
things should be done. In fact, that was how we started out with all
these
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061281000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061281000016">As my
noble friend Lord Warner said, this was first raised by my Government.
We proposed establishing a new arm’s-length body called
RATE—the regulatory authority for tissue and embryos. According
to my research, in 2007 the Government wisely decided not to proceed
with that following criticism from a Joint Committee set up to
scrutinise that draft Bill. The arguments advanced against RATE then
were just as persuasive as they are today. Many of us have held that
there is little overlap in the work of the two bodies and that the
specialist expertise each provides should be maintained to ensure that
regulation remains effective and public confidence is maintained. The
discussion we have had so far today has not convinced me that this
proposal is the best way forward at the moment. The independence of the
HTA and HFEA is important for a number of reasons, not least because of
the public confidence needed in both the areas they
cover.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061281000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0001.htm#13061281000017">In
2010, the Government proposed as part of their bonfire of the quangos
that the functions of the HFEA and the HTA should be transferred
largely to the CQC. Noble Lords will remember the debate about that
during the passage of the Public Bodies Act. Following an extensive
public consultation, that proposal was also rejected by the Government
in January this year. Once more, a clear majority of those who
responded thought that the risks involved in such sensitive areas of
medicine were just too great. Instead, the Government decided that an
independent review of the way the HFEA and HTA carry out their
functions should be undertaken by Justin McCracken. I understand that
Mr McCracken’s review is complete and Ministers have yet to
decide what to do. Perhaps we will have a sneak preview of that

ethical importance. We accept entirely that there is always room for
improvement and we should never be complacent. The review led by Justin

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a very instructive debate
and one to which I have listened with enormous care and interest. It
takes us back to a well-worn area, as noble Lords have been keen to
point out. The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, would
abolish the HFEA and HTA and replace them with a new regulatory body,
the human tissue and embryo authority. It would also transfer
responsibility for the regulation of infertility treatment involving
embryos, sperm and eggs to the
CQC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061281000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061281000022">I
listened with great care, as I always do, to the noble Lord, Lord
Patel, when he moved the amendment. As has been amply demonstrated in
the course of this 
<?notus-xml column=1642?>debate, the prospect of the merger of the HFEA and HTA, or of the
transfer of their functions elsewhere and the subsequent abolition of
the two bodies, is by no means a new one. It has been considered
carefully and consulted on on a number of occasions over recent years,
including by Members of this

2007, as we were reminded, a Joint Committee of both Houses of
Parliament, chaired by my noble friend Lord Willis, considered a

proposal. It recognised concerns expressed by stakeholders about the
risk of losing the specialist expertise that the HFEA and HTA
individually hold and the small extent to which the two bodies actually
cover common ground. That point was made very powerfully by the noble
Lord, Lord Walton,
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061281000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061281000024">The
Government are as keen as anybody to minimise the number of
arm’s-length bodies when we possible can. A substantial exercise
was undertaken across government when the coalition was new to do
exactly that and a great number of bodies were abolished. Within that
framework, last year the Department of Health undertook a public
consultation on a proposal to transfer the functions of the HFEA and
HTA to the Care Quality Commission and the Health Research Authority,
as part of our review of the arm’s-length bodies. Across the
full range of respondents, a majority of three-quarters disagreed with
the proposal. The main reason cited was that the HFEA and the HTA have
developed considerable expertise in their highly specialised fields.
They were said to be trusted and respected by the regulated sectors.
Respondents believed that this expertise and trust would be lost were a
transfer of functions to take place. That point was well made by the
noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:09:58"></hs_TimeCode> Thornton,

Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:10:06"></hs_TimeCode> Patel,

also said that they did not believe that the CQC was well-placed at the
time to take on the functions of the two bodies and they feared that
those functions would be subsumed by the CQC’s other
responsibilities. Another strong message from the consultation was that
the small size of the two bodies and the small overall anticipated
savings did not warrant the risks involved in abolishing them and
transferring their functions. I recall that the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:10:46"></hs_TimeCode> Warner,
made that very point when we debated these issues during the passage of
the Public Bodies Bill.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Government
listened to the responses and decided not to proceed with the transfer
and abolition. However, we also recognised the clear message from the
consultation that there is scope for the HFEA and the HTA to achieve
further efficiencies in the way that they operate. That much, I hope,
all noble Lords agree

regenerative medicine in the UK and pointed to the complexity of these
arrangements. I understand that point of view, but we are now in a

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, we now come to Part
2 of the Bill and particularly to Clauses 74 to 77, which
may be described as a failure regime for NHS trusts and NHS foundation
trusts. Clause 74 makes amendments to the powers of CQC to issue
warning notices to those bodies. Where it appears to CQC that the
quality of healthcare services provided by a trust requires significant
improvement, CQC will be able to highlight those areas in a new form of
warning notice. This will state the reasons for CQC’s view, and
it will require improvements in the quality of services to be delivered
within a specified time. At the end of that period, CQC must review
whether the requirements specified in the notice have been
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061281000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061281000033">Where CQC
is not satisfied, it must decide what further action needs to be taken.
In the case of a foundation trust, CQC’s review must include use
of its power to require Monitor to put the trust into special
administration. Clause 75 extends Monitor’s powers to be able to
issue additional license conditions on foundation trusts when CQC has
issued a warning notice. At present, Monitor can make use of these
powers only if there is a failure in the governance of a foundation
trust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061281000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061281000034">In the
event of healthcare services provided by the trust requiring
significant improvement, Monitor will as a result be able to take
timely action to make changes to leadership or governance with the
intention of securing improvements to those services. Clause 76 will
enable Monitor to make an audit to authorise the appointment of a trust
special administrator in cases where it or CQC is satisfied that there
is a serious failure by an NHS foundation trust to provide healthcare
services of sufficient quality and that it is appropriate to make the
order. At present, Monitor is able to authorise the appointment of a
trust special administrator only in cases of insolvency. Monitor may
make an order when it is so satisfied, but must make the order when
required to do so by
CQC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061281000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061281000035">Let me
say at once that the Opposition support the intention of giving greater
emphasis to safety and quality and enhancing CQC’s powers in
this area. Of course, we are very much influenced by the report of
Robert Francis on Mid Staffordshire. We also welcome the introduction
of a single failure regime, focused on quality as well as financial
failure. However, I suspect that I am not the only noble Lord to have
been confused by the respective roles of CQC and Monitor when reading
this Bill. Indeed, I was surprised that the 
<?notus-xml column=1645?>Department of Health boldly claimed in its factsheet that the new
failure regime will give regulators clear roles in tackling failure. I
must say that I found it anything but clear. The factsheet
says:</hs_para>

confuse matters further, CQC retains enforcement powers for social
care, general practice and independent sector providers. That is going
to be very confusing. I also pose the question as to whether there are
not going to be significant risks associated with these
changes. As Robert Francis made clear, regulatory complexity can
contribute to system failings. It is important that we get this right,
so there are a number of matters which I would like to put to the noble
Earl, Lord Howe.</hs_para>

consider that with this level of complexity, there is a risk of
slowdown in the action required to address failures? How will Monitor,
CQC and the NHS Trust Development Authority work together to

Development Authority be able to question CQC’s findings and
recommendations? What happens if those three august bodies disagree
about whether action is needed? Will Monitor and the NHSTDA be equipped

know that the potential confusion has been examined recently by the
Health Select Committee. Indeed, the Secretary of State explained to
the Commons Health Committee that the change in the arrangements so
that CQC in essence has to refer concerns to Monitor, which then takes
enforcement action, is devoid, as he put it, of conflict of interest
when an inspector identifies a fault then later feels obliged to say
that there is no longer a fault, simply to avoid the enforcement action
appearing ineffective. However, that does not apply to the other
sectors. It does not apply to social care provision, general practice
or the independent sector. I do not understand why there is deemed to
be a conflict of interest in relation to NHS foundation trusts and NHS
trusts but not the other bodies. Nor does it apply to other sector
regulators, such as the Health and Safety Executive or the Civil
Aviation Authority. There are plenty of examples of regulators that
monitor and also take the enforcement action.</hs_para>

understand why, when it comes to healthcare, the NHS has a different
regulatory regime from that of the private sector. Surely, there ought
to be consistency in approach. The noble Earl will know that we have
had the fair playing field work undertaken by Monitor, as a result of
discussions on the previous Bill. It does not seem that there is a fair
playing field when it comes to regulatory machinery in relation to,
say, the independent sector and to the NHS, even though they are both
providing services under NHS contracts. I very much welcome Amendments
65, 66 and 67, tabled by my noble friend Lord Warner, and I

NHS trusts, there is a puzzle regarding what appears from the
architecture. I think it is generally accepted that those trusts which
have not yet reached foundation trust status are generally considered

the weaker organisations seem to come under a weaker regulatory system.

another restructuring in relation, for instance, to CQC—given

Monitor interventions, ought there not to be a clear appeals process

issued, a foundation trust should have the right to appeal under my
Amendment 66ZC, which is consequential on Amendment 66ZE. The same

a lot of work to be done to make sure that the health service and other

between the two roles of Monitor and CQC and that the NHS Trust
Development Authority’s role is rather mysterious. It is hard to
understand why NHS trusts are not in fact subject to a much more robust
process than other providers because, as far as I can see, apart from a
number of community trusts which are likely to get foundation trust
status, the intention is that we simply roll on for years to come with
these unviable organisations. Money is clearly top-sliced in order to
keep them going, and we know that the real issue is, in many cases, a
failure to tackle reconfiguration. It is a worry that almost a limbo
situation is being created in which no progress at all is going to be
made. There is also a very clear need for due process as to how these
licensing provisions are to operate and an appeal process for any
organisation that is affected by them.</hs_para>

65, 66 and 67 and to Clause 77 standing part. I share very much the
concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Hunt and I am not going to
repeat what he said about the slightly strange situation that we are
now in with the CQC having enforcement responsibilities in
relation to some bodies that it registers but not in relation to
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:31:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000002">I
want to concentrate on the missing part of this group of
clauses, which is the Trust Development Authority, and go into a bit
more detail on this area than my noble friend Lord Hunt had time to do.
The purpose of these amendments is to try to pursue the question of
whether there is parity of action required by the Trust Development
Authority and Monitor, when the CQC issues a warning notice,
irrespective of whether that notice applies to an NHS trust or an NHS
foundation trust. There is something very curious about writing this
quite complicated legislation, which, if I may say as a connoisseur of
health and social security legislation, has the air of a rather rushed
job. The builder was going to go off site quite quickly if we did not
get the trimmings of the house finished—it has that feel to

Bill is very focused on the enforcement action by Monitor, but is
pretty much silent on what the TDA does. Like my noble friend Lord
Hunt, this strikes me as extremely odd, because, as a general rule, the
weaker trusts—I exempt my noble friend Lady Wall and her skilful
chairmanship of her trust—are tucked away in the Trust
Development Authority.

seem to recall that since its inception the TDA has not made a great

correct me if I am wrong, is that there is only one trust in
the past 18 months, Kingston, which has made it to FT status. There is
hardly a queue of candidates in Monitor’s FT pipeline. Indeed,
there is a real danger—if I may say so, slightly
pessimistically—that the Trust Development Authority will

uncertain which ones it will have to satisfy. It has set a lot of
operational performance standards which look uncannily like the evil
Labour targets imposed from time to time. It promises more details on
the Trust Development Authority’s oversight model. I have yet to
see very much of that further detail, but nowhere in this document is

my search for enlightenment, I have moved on to read the May Department

pretty clear. We start to get into a bit of difficulty when we get to
page 10, which is headed “Intervention”. That is when I
became really puzzled. It says—I am not quoting, but this is
pretty much what it says—that the TDA can request recovery
plans, increase engagement with the trust, commission an independent

like a bit of a rehash of what it should have been doing in order to
get the trusts for which it was responsible to pass the foundation
trust tests set by Monitor. When it was set up, it was supposed to have
that responsibility for quite a short period of time. It hardly looks
like some new, sexy enforcement set of procedures which we would expect
it to take when the CQC warning notices come to its
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:39:10"></hs_TimeCode>. It
looks as if the enforcement procedure for the trusts in the TDA remit
is that they have to be given further chances. It is not explicit
but—dare I suggest, as my noble friend Lord Hunt I think
implied? —we could be heading back down the road of money being
taken away from the successful trusts to buttress people in
organisations who are not cutting the mustard in terms of the quality
of services or the financial management that is required not only to be
an effective foundation trust but to be an effective

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:40:29"></hs_TimeCode> am sure that
the noble Earl will tell me about other bits of legislation, but it
seems to me that if we want to convince the public that there is a new
show in town for real enforcement when things continue to fail in a
trust, whether it is an FT or an NHS trust, it would be sensible to put
these provisions in the same Bill, particularly when we all know that
the weaker trusts are under the

27 of the May document I mentioned is pretty elusive. Commissioners can
have a go at reconfiguring if there is failure but that may not work.
Eventually, the trust is unsustainable and becomes the responsibility
of the TDA. Guess what the TDA can do? The TDA has absolutely
discretion as to whether it advises the Secretary of State. It can
advise the Secretary of State to appoint a trust special administrator
but is not required to. Under the current guidance, which only came out
a month ago, the most the TDA is required to do is to consider doing
that. If it chooses not to, it need not. We therefore have a situation
in which the TDA seems to be operating under a different regime from
Monitor. This is a really serious situation to be considered, and I
suggest to the Minister that it will become a public confidence issue.
I am not making a party political speech—this is all about

does this Bill not provide for a much sharper set of actions from the

nervousness, but should the Government not consider withdrawing these
clauses and provide a clear set of rules and requirements that protect
patients effectively, whether or not they are in NHS trusts or FTs? I
do not think that the Bill, as drafted, does the job of protecting
patients. I do think that the TDA needs to be brought

Lords should bear in mind that the whole driver in all this was the
government decision that all trusts had to become foundation trusts by
2014. As a government decision, one respects that, but there were some
views in our trust that we would have been able to do it had we had a
longer period of time. I have been chairman of the trust for six years
and take some responsibility. Although I thank my noble friend Lord
Warner greatly for his comments about my custodianship —which I
hope are all true—there was an ignorance, if you will, within my
trust and maybe others. That process of going through to becoming an FT
was not as urgent as it then became with the 2014 deadline, but we
should have been making a much better aim for that. In my own trust,
the financial position was very much based around us not drawing out
cost improvements and always looking for
growth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000016">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>,

think that my noble friend Lord Warner was perhaps a bit harsh in terms
of what the TDA does. I do not disagree that maybe it should be in the
Bill—I am sure that is right—but there is a contradiction
in some of his arguments. First, absolutely correctly, 
<?notus-xml column=1651?>my noble friend has said that the TDA was set up for a
period, in order to see trusts through to 2014, as the Government
required. For failing trusts, as my noble friend has emphasised totally
and accurately, it was set up to effect some action that would move
them out of operating.
Again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>, I agree
totally with my noble friend, in that the whole point of all this, and
the whole worry for me as a trust chair, is that the services that
patients receive are fundamental. If we, or any trust, are failing,
particularly perhaps in service provision, but also in financial terms,
that is major worry.</hs_para>

have the advantage in my trust—if it is deemed to be
one—in that we have gone through the reconfiguration ahead of
and alongside the partnership.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:48:52"></hs_TimeCode> have had a
reconfiguration in place for more than 10 years. It has been put on
hold by my Government and by the current Government, but we now
understand that implementation will start to happen in November. We
have had that perhaps unique experience of being in reconfiguration and
going forward for foundation trust status, in a sense drawing those two
things together. That is quite a challenge. We are hoping to be in
partnership by April 2014 and are bringing about our reconfiguration
from November 2013. Noble Lords can imagine the challenges which that
brings to my trust, although we are complying, I think, with all the

noble friend Lord Hunt and I refer to this all the time, saying,
“How’s your trust doing?”. Therefore from our
point of view the TDA has been quite clear —perhaps because we
made it clear that we were unable to go forward in this. It
exists but, according to its remit, only to ensure that by 2014 viable
trusts will go forward to FT, and that something else will happen to
non-viable, or failing trusts—the more emotive description.
Those will either be brought under supervision, or will work in
partnership with other trusts to achieve a different outcome. As
regards supporting the amendment or otherwise, I am not sure whether
the lifespan for TDA is so short that it will have any effect on
delivering in the Bill, which has a longer-term view of what we are
doing. However, I thought it would be helpful to give some perspective
of what happens in the real world.</hs_para>

is difficult and embarrassing to find yourself in this situation.
However, for us the best outcome is that the partnership with the Royal
Free works, and that the Royal Free has come to a decision that that
partnership will be beneficial for it. Monitor will then get involved
with the Royal Free to see whether that combined trust is still viable
and whether it still meets all the requirements to ensure that
compliance fits. Our patients are receiving good care and being looked
after, and we still aim to be the best trust from which they can
receive services and get good results. However, ultimately in our
partnership with the Royal Free, patients will receive a better
service.</hs_para>

could not agree more with my noble friends Lord Hunt and Lord Warner
that reconfiguration has to happen. We had brave words about it from
the previous Government, but we did not do it. We now have brave words
from the Secretary of State, who is doing a perfect job, from what I
have seen—he is going out and seeing how it really works in a
trust: rolling up 
<?notus-xml column=1652?>your sleeves and making beds. My plea to the noble Earl is that the
Government stick to the fact that reconfiguration has to happen.
Politically, closing hospitals is dynamite. I have said that more times
from these Benches and from the Benches opposite than I can remember.
However, unless it happens, failing trusts will continue to fail. The
financial aspects of failure are awful, but the performance of some of
those trusts is not good enough for patients to be on the receiving end
of it. I thought it would be helpful to share that. I am not sure

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, in addressing this complex and very
important topic, I begin by thanking all noble Lords who have spoken in
this debate, not least those who have introduced the amendments they
have tabled. I welcome the opportunity to debate these clauses as they
form a key part of our response to the issues raised by Robert Francis
QC. They deal with difficult issues and I recognise the critical
importance of getting this
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T18:55:43"></hs_TimeCode>. I
particularly welcome the support of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for the
principles, which I can assure him have governed the
Government’s work in this area.</hs_para>

intention of the changes we are making is to deliver a strong but
flexible process for tackling quality failures to ensure that all NHS
trusts adopt a rigorous approach to maintaining high quality care. I
hope that 
<?notus-xml column=1653?>noble Lords have had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the
document my department published, in collaboration with CQC, Monitor,
the Trust Development Authority and NHS England, copies of which can be

approach we have taken is

Francis report made a strong case that the regulation of NHS trusts and
foundation trusts needed to change so that greater emphasis is placed
on addressing failures of quality. We agree. In future, roles within
the regulatory system will be simpler and clearer. The Care Quality
Commission will focus on assessing and reporting on quality, and
Monitor and the NHS Trust Development Authority—the
TDA—will be responsible for using their enforcement powers to
address quality problems. To free up time to care, the overall
regulatory burden on providers will be radically reduced. I remember
that that concern was raised from the Benches opposite when I made a
Statement to your Lordships on the Francis report. However, where there
are failings in the quality of care, there will be a stronger
response.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061289000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000028">The
CQC, through its new Chief Inspector of Hospitals, will become the
authoritative voice on the quality of care provided. It will take the
lead in developing a methodology for assessing the overall performance
of organisations in meeting the needs of patients and the public. In
doing so, the CQC will consult a range of bodies, including Monitor,
the TDA and NHS England, to ensure that national organisations are
working to a common definition of quality. The idea here is to arrive
at, if I can put it this way, a single version of the truth: a single,
national definition of quality that brings together information and
intelligence from commissioners, regulators and local Healthwatch, as
well as from the other bodies I mentioned. This new approach to
assessment and inspection will form the basis of a new system of
ratings to provide a fair, balanced and easy to understand assessment
of how each provider is performing relative to its peers. It will also
provide the basis for identifying where improvements are needed. We
will, of course, debate the provisions on ratings later

noble Lord, Lord Hunt, has tabled a number of

to the consistency of CQC’s judgment. I understand the concern
to ensure that there is transparency and consistency over how decisions
to intervene are reached, but I am not sure that it can be defined
through legislation. In part, it will be for the CQC, Monitor and the
TDA to agree and set out in guidance—something, incidentally,
they have all committed to doing. However, ultimately they must be
matters of judgment rather than the tick-box mentality that allowed the
failures uncovered in Mid Staffordshire to go unnoticed for so

health authority established under secondary legislation, we need to
take a slightly different approach to achieve that common objective. I

a document that the noble Earl’s department sent out in May,
signed up to by the TDA, Monitor and the CQC. I want to direct his
attention to paragraph 27 of that document, which I mentioned in my

policy on the relative difference between TDA and Monitor. It makes it
very clear. I shall quote from it, because this is absolutely the nub
of the

can also place a foundation trust into special administration directly,
following consultation with the Secretary of State and the CQC, on the

unsustainable”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13061289000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000034">The

primarily a role for local commissioners, supported by NHS England. In
the event that an NHS trust or foundation trust has failed to make

succeeded, special administration may, as a last resort, provide a
mechanism for dealing with NHS trusts and foundation trusts which have
become either clinically and/or financially unsustainable. Where the

Howe:</Member></B> I think the noble Lord has misled himself. The way
in which we envisage the system working for both trusts and foundation
trusts, where we have a provider that looks as though it might be
clinically unsustainable, is to encourage commissioners and the
provider concerned to come together and have a grown-up conversation
about the configuration of services. That is the first resort and it is
the normal course of action that we would expect, whether it is an NHS
trust or an NHS foundation trust. In either case, trust special
administration is going to be a last resort.</hs_para>

that, while we envisage the process of trust special administration to
be broadly the same in both instances, there has to be a difference.
The difference arises from the fact that foundation trusts are, in
statute, much more autonomous bodies than NHS trusts. NHS trusts are
still subject to directions from the Secretary of State. What the TDA
does is act as the Secretary of State’s proxy in overseeing
their quality, sustainability and governance. That is why there is a
process around referral to the Secretary of State before a trust
special administration can take place for an NHS trust,
whereas that is not the case with a foundation trust. That is because
Monitor is the independent regulator for FTs charged with
doing that.</hs_para>

need to make too much of the differences that he has purported to
identify in that document, which I will, of course, re-read in case we
have inadvertently misled the Committee. The point I sought to make was
that in no way do we envisage a material difference in the process
which will ensue from a clinically unsustainable provider, or one whose
quality is in question.</hs_para>

Warner, asked what will happen to NHS trusts that do not meet
expectations of the accountability framework published last December.
The accountability framework covers clinical and operational metrics,
governance, leadership and finance. If the TDA judges that a trust is
failing the accountability framework, it has a number of options. It
can request recovery plans—Monitor is also in a position to do
that with FTs; it will increase the frequency of its engagement with
the trust; it can commission an independent investigation; it can
review the skills and competence of board members. Again that is
something that Monitor can do with FTs. It can commission interim
support to provide additional management capacity—again that is
something that in theory Monitor could do under its licensing
arrangements. Ultimately, the TDA can exercise the Secretary of
State’s functions and terminate appointments. Monitor has
similar powers. I want to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that
there is not such a gap as he has made out in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000039">Incidentally,
the noble Lord called into question the speed of progress of the
foundation trust pipeline. I can assure him that the pipeline is
moving. It may look rather glacial from his perspective, and I can
understand why. However, even though the TDA was established only on 1
April, two foundation trusts have been authorised since
then—Kingston on 1 May and Western Sussex, which was announced
today.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_12_PT_1/D2D9A0D080238D921308B940ACADED72B62B101C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 June 2013">Wednesday,

noble Lord, Lord Warner, sounded a warning that this kind of
arrangement posed a risk that money could end up being taken away from
successful trusts to bolster poorer performers. It is precisely to
avoid that that we need to grasp the nettle in some cases as we had to
do in south London to ensure that one part of the NHS did not drain the
resources that should be shared out more equitably among the
rest of the health service. Certainly, this is not the intention of our
policy. In fact, the purpose of special administration, if it is deemed
necessary, is to ensure both clinical and financial sustainability.
When it is clear that a hospital cannot resolve quality failures in its
current form, we will no longer have to wait until a trust fails
financially before action is taken. That is why I shall talk about
special administration in more detail in a

future, issuing a warning notice to a trust or foundation trust will be
a sign that there is a serious quality issue at that trust and that
significant improvements are required. I fully agree with the noble
Lord, Lord Hunt, that it will be important to determine what
significant improvements could encompass, as proposed by Amendment 64A.
We have been clear that the new warning notices are designed to
highlight serious failings, such as a systematic failure to meet
fundamental standards. As noble Lords will remember, the fundamental
standards are a concept that Robert Francis put forward, whereby
treatment or practices in a trust could be said to be absolutely
unacceptable by anyone’s measure. The fundamental standards
themselves have not yet been defined; that process will be taken
forward in the coming months with full consultation with the public,
and we need to get that right. That is the issue underlying the
provision around significant improvements. Under the 2008 Act, the CQC
is already required to publish guidance to detail its approach to
issuing warning notices. This will be revised in light of this Bill to
include its interpretation of “significant improvement”.
That is a flexible and proportionate
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000042">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:13:10"></hs_TimeCode>
a trust receives a warning notice, just as happens now, it will be

depending upon whether they relate to an NHS trust or foundation trust,
as proposed by Amendment 65. Clause 74 amends Section 39 of the 2008
Act, which requires that a copy of the notice be sent to Monitor and
any other persons whom the CQC considers appropriate. When the notice
relates to an NHS trust, this would include the
TDA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000043">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>
have listened carefully to the noble Lord’s arguments in favour
of Amendment 66ZB regarding large providers spread over many sites.
This is not a new issue; having a regulatory system that is flexible
enough to cope with such organisations has always been critical. At
present, the CQC has to ensure that they can take a differentiated
approach and can deal appropriately with providers, ranging from large
multisite hospital trusts to care homes. This will continue to be the
case, so I feel that this amendment, while I sympathise with its
intent, is unnecessary.</hs_para>

75 introduces changes to ensure that when failures are identified,
there is a prompt and firm response. We have been clear that when a
provider receives a warning notice, the responsibility to resolve
problems will remain with the provider in conjunction with the local
commissioners, as I referred to earlier. 
<?notus-xml column=1657?>However, serious failures in the quality of care must not be allowed to
be endure, so Clause 75 makes changes to ensure that, when
quality of care at a foundation trust requires significant improvement,
Monitor can take timely action to make changes to leadership or
governance to secure improvements in those services. It amends
Monitor’s powers under Section 111 of the 2012 Act to enable it
to impose additional licence conditions on foundation trusts when the
Care Quality Commission has issued a warning notice to that trust. At
present, Monitor can make use of these powers only if there is a
failure in governance. If the foundation trust breaches those
additional licence conditions, Monitor will be able to use its powers
to suspend or remove directors or governors. The NHS Trust Development
Authority already has powers to intervene in NHS trusts or to remove or
suspend boards, as

the noble Lord is coming from with Amendment 66ZD, which proposes that

noble Baroness, Lady Wall, in her powerful speech, which
brought us to the realities of life in a very vivid way, as the noble

Lord, Lord Hunt, expressed his worry that, taken as a whole, the
Government’s approach was a recipe for limbo as regards progress
towards the necessary reconfigurations. I do not agree with that. We

the first instance, as I have explained, reconfigurations can typically
take place through discussion between commissioners and providers, and
many have. Stroke services in London are a classic example of a
fantastic series of reconfigurations that took place completely in the
public eye and have been outstandingly successful. However, in some
cases it may be clear that more fundamental issues prevent an NHS trust
or foundation trust from making the necessary improvements in its
current form. There may be a series of factors that, despite the best
efforts of the board of a trust, are inescapable. In such cases,
Clause 76 enables Monitor to make an order to authorise the
appointment of a trust special administrator on quality grounds, and
for the CQC to prompt it to do so if
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000048">The
noble Lord makes a number of fine points on Amendment 65ZF, and I agree
that the process of special administration should always be
evidence-based and transparent. This will be achieved through a number
of provisions, as I will set
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:18:57"></hs_TimeCode>. First,
before the CQC 
<?notus-xml column=1658?>or Monitor could put a trust into special administration on quality
grounds, it would need to be satisfied both that there has been a
serious failure in the quality of care and that special administration
is appropriate. If the CQC or Monitor is satisfied that these
requirements are fulfilled, it must consult the Secretary of State and
its fellow regulator before then consulting the trust in question, the
board, and local commissioners before an order is
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:19:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:18:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:19:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:19:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
Those are safeguards. They are not designed to hold up the process of a
special administration where it seems to be in the best interest, but
they are, I think, appropriate safeguards when such a radical step is
being considered. Section 65D of the National Health Service Act 2006
already requires Monitor to publish its reasons for making the order in
a report laid before Parliament. I hope the noble Lord agrees that,
given this, the amendment is not
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000049">For
NHS trusts, the TDA has a duty under secondary legislation to advise
the Secretary of State if it thinks that it would be in the interests

We therefore propose to amend the TDA directions to oblige the TDA to
make such a recommendation where advised to do so by the CQC. I hope
that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, will see that that is perhaps one of
the missing links that he was looking for. We would expect the CQC to
consider doing so where an NHS trust had failed to comply with a
warning notice, as proposed by Amendment 66, in the same way in which
it must for a foundation trust. If necessary, the Secretary of State
could exercise his powers under Section 4(2) of the Health and Social

Clause 77 is therefore needed to ensure that there is necessary focus
on the quality of services. To achieve this, Clause 77 broadens the
objective of trust special administration as it applies to foundation
trusts to include an additional requirement for services to be of
sufficient safety and quality. The objective will apply to any
foundation trust in special administration, regardless of whether the
order was made to resolve a financial failure or a serious failure to
provide services of sufficient quality. The intention is to ensure that
the CQC is satisfied that the services that continue are not only
financially viable but clinically
sustainable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000051">Clause
77 also requires that the CQC is consulted before the trust special
administrator provides a draft report to Monitor recommending the
action to be taken by Monitor in relation to the trust. The
administrator may not provide a draft report to Monitor unless he or
she has first obtained a statement from the CQC that the part of the
objective relating to the quality of the services has been met. When
considering the final report from the trust special administrator, the
Secretary of State must also be satisfied that the CQC has fulfilled
these functions. So there is, if you like, a “triple
lock” here for the quality of services.</hs_para>

reference to Amendment 67, special administration can be triggered for
NHS trusts where it is in the interests of the health service to do so.
That 
<?notus-xml column=1659?>is a far broader definition that already focuses on securing quality
services. In relation to NHS trusts, we envisage a similar role for the
CQC in providing a statement about the quality of services to an
administrator that considers the recommendations made in the draft
report. This will not require primary legislation. Instead, it will be
set out in
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000053">There

Opposition when they were in government. To establish one now would be
to create an unhelpful discrepancy between the way in which

the power for the CQC to ensure that the chief inspector, as the
guardian of quality in the system, can direct Monitor to put a
foundation trust into administration if he considers it necessary in
order to protect patient safety. To allow a right of appeal in that
instance would be to cast doubt on the chief inspector’s
judgment at what could be a most crucial juncture, if one were to
imagine another situation like that of Mid Staffordshire. While I
understand noble Lords’ concerns, I think that the approach that
we have taken is the right one when one considers that, in the future,
such action will be based on expert judgments and reserved for the most
serious failures where the priority should be securing safe and

will address the questions posed to me. The noble Lords, Lord
Campbell-Savours and Lord Hunt, asked why the Government had not simply
accepted the recommendation of Robert Francis to merge Monitor with the
Care Quality Commission. We were explicit at the outset that this was
one recommendation that we were not going to accept, because we firmly
believe that there remains a strong case for maintaining the 
<?notus-xml column=1660?>CQC and Monitor as separate organisations that fulfil distinctly
different functions. The inspection and assessment of quality of care

noble Lord, Lord Hunt, pointed to an apparent difference of treatment
between NHS trusts and foundation trusts on the one hand and private
providers on the other. The CQC’s current powers simply have not
been as effective in NHS hospitals as they have been in other sectors.
I would go so far as to say that the nuclear option which the CQC
currently has of closing down a hospital simply is not credible when
one considers that many hospitals are the only show in town in
providing services. The CQC has never exercised that power in relation
to an NHS trust. It has exercised it in relation to a care home, but I
believe noble Lords will readily see that a care home is a rather
different animal from an acute hospital, not least because it operates
in a market where very often there are alternative sources of
provision. That is why we have reshaped these provisions. It is vital
that effective and timely action can be taken where quality is found to
be lacking in our hospitals, and that the regulators have a range of
powers available to them according to the severity of the
issue.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:29:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T19:29:31"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13061289000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000175">7.30

The bodies have also committed to closer working, and these clauses

Mike Richards as the first Chief Inspector of Hospitals, and he will be
the authoritative voice of quality. These things have happened since

careful reading. I am still confused about the role of the CQC. If it

relationship between Monitor and the CQC and I am sure that is right. I
pay tribute to the new leadership of the CQC and to the appointment of
Sir Mike Richards. However, I believe that the architecture still
allows for confusion. I would like further clarification on when
Monitor and the CQC can take a different view on quality issues.
Perhaps we will come back to this on Report. I cannot believe that
Monitor will simply accept the CQC’s judgment at face value.
Surely its board will have to come to its own view on those issues.

Sacks:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for this opportunity to
discuss the relationship between business and society. I welcome in
particular the opportunity short debates such as this provide to step
back from the specifics of policy to take a wider and longer view of
the moral dimensions of economic policy. This is a very large subject
indeed, and I will hazard just a few words about it in general and then
turn to one aspect, confident that other speakers will touch on
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000068">In the
light of the G8 protests and so much else that has been said in recent
years, it is often assumed that when a religious leader speaks about
business, it is to be critical of capitalism and all its works. That is
not the case in the tradition from which I speak. The Hebrew Bible,
after all, records perhaps the world’s first economist, Joseph,
who invented the theory of trade cycles, seven years of plenty followed
by seven lean years, which has thus far proved to be a more accurate
guide to the 21st century than most other economic
forecasts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000069">We
believe that business and the market economy generally play a moral
role in society. Business is the greatest stimulus we know to human
creativity and increases the common wealth. It reduces poverty, and
poverty is profoundly humiliating. Economic liberty has a deep
association with political liberty. Trade, as Montesquieu pointed out
in the 18th century, is a deep alternative to war. Throughout history,
trading centres, such as the city of London, have been at the forefront
of tolerance and respect for difference. However, economics is always
subject to an overarching moral law. According to the Talmud, the first
question we are asked in heaven is: were we honest in business? It does
not say what happens if the answer is no, but in my mind’s eye I
see an angelic figure like the noble Lord, Lord Sugar, with wings,
saying, “You’re
fired”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000070">However,
I wish to express my concern at one specific aspect of our current
situation, namely youth unemployment. Today, unemployment is high
throughout Europe, and youth unemployment far higher still. In Britain,
the current figure is 20.7%. This is by no means the worst. In Greece,
the figure is 58%, in Spain, 55%, in Italy, 37%, and in
France, 25%. These are all disturbing figures. The real question
hovering in the background is: is this a mere temporary feature of a
low point in the economic cycle or is it likely to become 
<?notus-xml column=1664?>a permanent feature of economies in the West, as virtually everything to
do with business becomes increasingly globalised as we continue to
outsource manufacturing and service industries to low-wage economies

to be thought that high unemployment was the price we paid for low
interest and inflation rates. Is it now to be the price we pay for
global free trade? Are we condemning a significant proportion of young
people to a future in which they will never find work? If so, the price
we pay is likely to be very high indeed. There is the economic danger
of an increasingly small working population supporting an ever larger
non-working population, something that is already happening because we
are living so much longer. There is a political danger. Historically,
and in many parts of the world today, youth unemployment is a prime
cause of political instability. Above all, however, we should be
mindful of the moral, psychological and—dare I say
it?—spiritual hazards at
stake.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000072">In
Judaism, we believe that work is fundamental to human dignity. We

others”. Our ancient sages said, “Do even the most menial
work rather than be dependent on others”. Maimonides, our most

creation because it enabled the recipient to become independent of

Patten:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall make three points about where
business and society meet from an ethical point of view. First, there
is surely no iron curtain between business and society because, after
all, the shared values of business people and people in society are the
same. They try to help and look after each other, doing good not bad,
being supportive and helping people in ways that they can. That is at
least the best reading of that shared value. Equally, most
businesspeople such as my wife and me go back at the end of our
business day into society. We are not some other class. Most people in
business look to society as a haven and a home, just as most people in
society look to business to supply their needs. There is no iron
curtain of any sort there.</hs_para>

should be extremely cautious when things go wrong in business, such as
giving in to the sound bite delights of, say, bad banks and the rest,
because I fear that that will discourage a lot of those who are not bad
but good bankers. There are a great many of them, and that is why I
very much welcome what the noble Lord, Lord Sacks, said about the
ethics that drive his religion. They are sometimes very different from
those that drive mine but, with due respect to some of the
cassock-wearing classes—I entirely exonerate the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Chester—there has sometimes been a bit too
much bad bankery around, which distresses a lot of people. One has to
be careful, moderate and modest in what one says.</hs_para>

society has a lot to learn from business and big business. I recently
looked at the ethical code of an extremely successful global
corporation, which has got away without having any ethical problems in
the past two or three decades because of the high levels of ethical
training that everyone in that business has to go through. They have to
sign up each year to a final question: “Would I be pleased where
conscience meets ambition? Would I be pleased to see what I am going to
do today in the media tomorrow to be seen by my loved
ones?”.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061289000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000178">7.47

Glasman:</Member></B> My Lords, it is always an honour to participate
in a debate introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Sacks, the Chief Rabbi,
who has led my community, the Jewish community, in an exemplary way. He
has renewed our most important tradition, modern orthodoxy, and made it
relevant for the modern world. As ever, he has it completely right by
bringing our attention to the relationship between business and
society. There has been a rupture in that relationship, and it is
extremely important to reconceptualise it.</hs_para>

on the issue that the noble Lord brought up regarding youth
unemployment and the way that faith can cast light on it. He has a
unique 
<?notus-xml column=1666?>voice, but he is not alone in what he said. Two weeks ago, I was invited
to Rome, where I received a medal from the Vatican. One must understand
that, as someone who grew up in Jewish north London, receiving medals
was not something that I ever expected to happen. They would normally
have been for sporting or military activities, neither of which,
according to the comparative division of labour, was a speciality of
Palmers Green and Southgate Synagogue.</hs_para>

has a very pro-business and pro-worker agenda. Issues regarding usury
and interest rates are extremely important to that. Above all, what
faith brings, and what we neglect, is the realisation that there is no
solution to youth unemployment without bringing older people into the
equation. There needs to be intergenerational solidarity.
Traditionally, we have always put a strong emphasis on our elders. It
is essential that we retrieve the idea of vocation and bring in older
people, who should not be abandoned and whose wisdom and experience are
so important in generating the values that will be essential to earning
a living in the world and generating employment. We need to
find ways to allow older people to relate to younger people, who should
hear their stories and learn their skills. I commend the Chief Rabbi
for this
debate.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_12_PT_1/47D598526FC83502637DE0E1186D617EDF4DF896" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 June 2013">Wednesday,

three decades, our understanding has changed. We have been led through
the Common Purpose programmes of the 1990s into practical working

work as well as the wider and broader features of society, are pretty

raising

the noble Lord on introducing this debate. I became a Conservative when
working for the Child Poverty Action Group, influenced by a
distinguished Jewish politician who had a profound on Margaret
Thatcher, the late Lord Keith Joseph. I had written a wonderful paper
about family benefit, or child benefit, and how critical it was. He
read my paper when I was aged 23 or 24, and he said, “Virginia,

of jobs, of wealth creation, of innovation and of tax revenue. The
second reason is my regard for the noble Lord, Lord Sacks. As a
religious leader in this country, he has been unrivalled in his support
for business—but not just any kind of business. He has

any business—without profit, a business will cease to
exist—but the noble Lord, Lord Sacks, has repeatedly asked what
I think are the fundamental questions. What is the purpose of business?
What is a business really for? Why does it exist? His answer, with
which I totally agree, is that business is not an end in itself.
Business has to be seen within a larger framework which puts the human
person—or, as he said today, the young unemployed—at the
centre of economic life, emphasising creativity, work, integrity in the
product, sustainability of the environment and so on. That is why, as
he said, business plays a moral role in our society. I also greatly
value the theological underpinning—the Hebrew Bible—of
what he said, which is not just the basis of Jewish economic ethics but

the paradoxical
relationship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T20:09:46"></hs_TimeCode>
between business and society. Business simply cannot
survive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T20:09:51"></hs_TimeCode> without
three conditions. One is an educated workforce and skilled personnel,
which society provides. Another is a well regulated market with a civic
morality, which only society can cultivate and nurture through its
institutions. It also requires a well regulated state, which only a
good society can
sustain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T20:10:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061289000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061289000122">Those
three conditions constitute the invisible capital that business
requires in order to survive. Business depends not just on the
financial capital that businessmen produce, but on the moral, cultural
and political capital that society at large provides. Business,
therefore, is vitally dependent on society, and yet it has the constant
tendency to undermine all those three conditions on which it depends
for its survival. It is used to counting the money and therefore does
not see the value of the invisible capital that society’s moral
and political institutions provide. It takes a short-term view of
things, and institutions, moral institutions in particular, are built
over generations. It also takes an instrumental approach to life and
turns almost everything into business so that in a society such as
ours, medicine, law and even the priesthood might become a
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T20:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

hegemonic and expansionist tendency to turn everything into its own
mirror image, it inevitably undermines the capital on which it depends.
Therefore, it desperately requires a regulatory framework, which is
provided by the state. The state therefore is not the enemy of business
let alone of the market: the state provides the sole preconditions that
business requires in order to flourish. That was the big mistake made
by Mrs Thatcher and the neoliberals. They thought that they could
deregulate the economy and remove the state. In the process, they
released forces that caused the havoc that we are still experiencing.
Unless we properly grasp the relationship between business and society
and the way in which business depends vitally on the moral capital that
society provides, we are in grave danger of repeating the mistakes that
were made only a few years

Rabbi, has covered the ground well, and I thank him for inaugurating
this short but valuable debate. Regretfully, the market economy is both
hero and villain. Our task and our duty is to deal with its flaws. It
will be fatal if we do not find the cure. The market is selfish, greedy
and inward looking. Its thinking can be short term and it is

Government are clear that business, and the pursuit of profit, can be a
force for good in society by strengthening our economy and bringing
together local communities. The noble Lord, Lord Sacks, acknowledged
that earlier in his speech. At a fundamental level, businesses
contribute significantly to society by creating jobs and improving the
skills of the workforce. Many noble Lords made that point today. The

value of work, the benefit of doing business and the satisfaction that
many employees and employers gain from simply trading, which in itself

over the past three years. Some 24,000 more people are in work since
the previous quarter, which is a fantastic figure. Figures relating to
the period between February and April 2013 show that youth unemployment
was down by 43,000. The noble Lord, Lord Glasman, concentrated on youth
employment in his speech. It is an extremely important issue on which
the Government are focusing in their aim of growing the economy. The
noble Lord also made the point that, at the opposite end of the
spectrum, older workers have a valuable role to play in the workplace.
Further, since 2010, over 1 million apprenticeship starts have been
created, and provisional data show that there were 245,000
apprenticeship starts during the first six months of the 2012-13
academic year. Of those, 69,600 were in the 16 to 18
year-old bracket. These figures are very encouraging, but there is a

more than just employment. They can improve the quality of life and
well-being of employees, protect the environment and invest in a wide
range of community activities. My noble friend Lord Griffiths
emphasised that the purpose of business is more than just profits and
stressed that employment has a moral purpose. In adding to that point,
the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, defined it as a civil morality. Many
businesses actively seek to improve opportunities for young people
through apprenticeships and by supporting schools and

showcasing schemes that encourage businesses across the country to
support their local communities through corporate responsibility
activity. There are many examples of this. In 1999, Greggs, the high
street bakers, established its Breakfast Club programme within primary
schools in disadvantaged areas. I am happy to say that this now
provides a healthy start to the day for more than 10,000 children. In
2011, Greggs donated £250,000 to support existing clubs and open
additional ones in areas of need. Lloyds Banking Group’s
community investment similarly focuses on community sponsorship and
funding local charities, supporting colleagues with their local
community engagement and improving levels of financial inclusion and
financial literacy in the United Kingdom. This includes building the
financial capabilities of people 
<?notus-xml column=1676?>with learning disabilities, thereby enabling access to financial
services. Marks &amp; Spencer’s Marks &amp; Start work

be rightly proud of the many companies that go beyond their own
self-interest and undertake activities that are of benefit to business,
the environment and, indeed, society. The Government are taking steps
to encourage this. At the end of the month, my honourable friend in the
other place, Jo Swinson, will be launching a three-month consultation
on corporate responsibility with business and other stakeholders. The
Government are also committed to supporting and promoting an economy
that is comprised of a diverse range of business and organisational
models that includes the private sector, the public sector, co-ops,
voluntary groups and charities with the aim of achieving a stronger

prosperity alongside the responsible use of resources. Its focus on

jobs to ex-offenders. Some 51% of them leave with formal training
qualifications, 48% move into permanent employment and, on average,
only 15% have reoffended, which is a quarter of the national average.
Blue Sky is also a growing profitable business whose commercial income
has increased sixfold since 2007. It is helping to break the cycle of
reoffending and is challenging society’s negative perception of
offenders. Another example is Cockpit Arts, an award-winning social
enterprise based in London, which is the UK’s only creative
business incubator for designer-makers. It works with hundreds of
businesses to help them conceive, develop and deliver innovative

“industry” and “integrity” into the
workforce is important because, in turn, they create a certain
wholesomeness that leads to better well-being in society. That is a
point which is very well made. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Chester brought up the subject of the living wage. It is an important

the UN guiding principles on business and human rights. As I mentioned

UK framework for action on corporate responsibility, and we will take
full account of the UN guiding principles. The final document setting
out government and business corporate responsibility commitments will
be published in December this year. I believe that it was my noble
friend Lady Bottomley who raised the issue of ethical supply chains, as
did my noble friend Lord Kalms. The Bangladeshi factory crisis and the
horsemeat scandal illustrate the importance of promoting ethical and
responsible supply chains. The Government are encouraging businesses to
value and develop responsible supply chains. My noble friend Lord Kalms
also referred to transparency, and indeed he is correct to say that we
need to be more transparent in the supply chain. That will lead to

does the Minister think that the post has been too narrowly drawn and
represents a bit of a missed opportunity? I know from remarks he has

whether there should be a chief inspector of primary care, which I am
sure has strengthened his relationship with GPs. For my part, poking

system problem we face in the NHS is the weakness of the combined set

think of themselves as the base for community-based services. I suspect
that is a development we will regret in the longer term, particularly
if those services end up bearing a disproportionately high amount of
the overhead costs of acute hospitals. Can the Minister say a little
more about whether the Government are considering appointing a chief
inspector of primary care and whether further consideration could be
given to widening the brief of the Chief Inspector of Social Care to
embrace community health services and possibly primary care? I beg to

Richards. He commands great respect, but I wonder why it is
not in the Bill. It seems to me that the relationship between the chief
inspectors and the chief executive and the board of the CQC is going to
be a delicate one. Once you nominate somebody as chief inspector the
implication is that they are independent in their job. My experience
when I was at the DWP and responsible for the Health and Safety
Executive is that it had some chief inspectors. There was the
equivalent of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate,
although that has now gone, and the Chief Inspector of
Construction. It was felt necessary in some of the most important
sectors to have a figurehead. My understanding was that when it came to
issues to do with the regulatory function they were independent and
could not be second-guessed by the board. The relationship between the
chief inspectors and the board is very important. I wonder whether the
noble Earl’s department is storing up trouble for the future by
not making them statutory post-holders so that it is absolutely clear
in legislation what their responsibility is. I can see problems arising
in future on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000006">This

their contributions to this mini-debate on Amendment 73. We
are sympathetic to the view behind this amendment —or what seems
to lie behind it—which seeks to ensure that the new chief
inspectors will be given a place on the board of
the CQC. I echo here the praise 
<?notus-xml column=1680?>of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, for Professor Mike
Richards. I know that the professor’s cancer colleagues will
miss him in that

Lords are absolutely right about the importance of improving quality
and in particular of trying to drive up quality within primary care.
The Secretary of State announced the appointment of a Chief Inspector
of Hospitals as part of the Government’s response to the Francis
review into Mid Staffs. As has been referred to, since that time the
Government have also announced the positions of a Chief Inspector of
Social Care and a Chief Inspector of General Practice. These three
chief inspectors will sit within the CQC and lead for it on the
inspection and regulation of all registered providers of health and
adult social care. They will be high-profile positions—as the
appointment of Mike Richards demonstrates—and will speak for the
CQC on the quality of care that they find. As such, it is likely, as
noble Lords have indicated, that they will have a lot to offer the CQC
board in knowledge, experience and leadership.</hs_para>

Warner, asked about the areas that the Chief Inspector of General
Practice might cover and whether the post might be drawn
more widely. In some ways, that rather bears out my point: setting this
in stone in statute may not be the best way to make everything link up
so that the new positions work as effectively as possible. The CQC
needs to move this forward so that it can best drive up quality. It
will be for the CQC to determine the exact remit of each of the chief
inspectors. All providers of registered health and adult care services
will fall within one of the chief inspectors’ remits. Perhaps
that will reassure the noble Lords, Lord Warner and Lord Hunt. The CQC
is working up detailed proposals. No doubt it will pay attention to
what noble Lords have said. Broadly, the Chief Inspector of Hospitals
will cover acute trusts, including mental health trusts; the Chief
Inspector of Social Care will cover providers of regulated adult social
care, including care homes and domiciliary care agencies; and the Chief
Inspector of General Practice will cover GP and dental practices as
well as walk-in centres, private healthcare and independent ambulance
providers. Clearly, the CQC will look at how it gets comprehensive
coverage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000011">We
have deliberately avoided requiring that these inspectors should have a
seat on the board for two reasons. First, the aim of Clause 79 is to
give the CQC more autonomy in determining which executive members sit
on its board. This is in line with best practice, as no doubt noble
Lords will recognise. We would not wish to remove this new autonomy by
requiring that any executive, other than the chief executive, must sit
on the board. Secondly, we have designed the chief inspector roles to
be non-statutory. They are internal to the CQC, and the CQC will have
the power to design, shape and adapt the roles in a way that best
enables their operational effectiveness. I hope that that helps to
reassure the noble Lord, Lord
Warner.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_12_PT_1/C5017216F82EFAE46172B43B5E9CF8A95111E529" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 June 2013">Wednesday,

these roles as non-statutory clearly gives the CQC important
flexibility to design them to fit their method of regulation in the
fast-developing field of health and social care, without the
constraints of prescribing the functions of the chief inspectors in
statute. As these roles are not mentioned in the legislation, it would
not be appropriate to require in legislation that they should have a
seat on the board. Having said that, discussions with the CQC chair and
chief executive showed them to share the view that chief inspectors
will have much to offer the board. Their preference, subject to
appropriate board approval, is that when practicable these executives
should be appointed to the board. Given the intended importance of
these roles, we fully agree with that. In advance of the new
legislation coming into operation, I can confirm that the Secretary of

but whether she has reassured me is another question. I think the
Government underestimate the profile of the chief hospital inspector in
particular. There is no doubt that this will be a very powerful and
important post with an enormous profile. The idea that this person can
be overruled by the chief executive and the board, as this legislation
sets out, poses a problem I certainly want to think more
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000017">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T20:54:46"></hs_TimeCode>
also think that there is a gap here. Community health services are not
clearly in anybody’s remit. I am sure my noble friend Lord Hunt
would agree that if we were to identify one black hole where there is
not a great deal of data on performance and quality, it would be
community health services. It is an area that has not been probed well
by independent inspection, and as far as I can see the game plan is to
have no inspector looking into that area. Given everybody’s
concern about integration, it seems a bit of a missed opportunity for
there not to be some linking up
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000018">I want

clause, which I think the Government might describe as a Francis clause
since it clearly seeks to respond to the Robert Francis inquiry into
the Mid Staffordshire hospital problems. In fact, judging by the rigour
of the Government’s initial response to Mr Francis,
one might have thought that there would have been a series of clauses
reflecting the 290 recommendations. It would be helpful to know why the
Government consider that this is an adequate legislative response. Can
the Minister say whether there is likely to be further legislation or
whether, in effect, this is the definitive legislative response to the
Francis report?</hs_para>

the scope of the offence, including where care providers are

imposed to observe such a duty of candour on healthcare providers who
believe, or suspect, that treatment or care provided to a patient has
caused death or serious injury to inform that patient or
another duly authorised person as soon as is practicable. At Second
Reading, the noble Earl said that the duty of candour would be dealt
with through CQC registration via regulations. I am very puzzled that
such a key recommendation—it was almost the headline
recommendation—of the Francis report is not going to be dealt

Patel, has also chaired the NPSA. The key point about the NPSA is not
the organisation. It practically ran the national reporting and
learning system. This was developed by the former Chief Medical Officer
using the example of the airline industry, where airline staff are
encouraged to report near misses on the basis that they will not be
penalised for doing so, but by reporting one can learn and improve
safety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T21:03:18"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Government’s current decision was to transfer responsibility for
the national reporting and learning system to NHS England. I think they
have sub-contracted the job to Imperial College, which is fine, but I
have concerns about NHS England being the repository of the national
reporting and learning system, because the role of NHS England is
basically to beat up the system to deliver on the targets. I heard with
interest Sir David Nicholson’s rather extraordinary speech where
he presented an image of NHS England taking forward the great vision of
the future and taking everyone with it. However, those of us on the
ground see old-style performance management operating well and
effectively in NHS England, and there could be issues in the future
with staff being reluctant to report incidents because they are sent to
the management body that oversees the performance of the NHS. Robert
Francis said, first, that the NPSA’s resources need to be well
protected. He clearly recognised the importance of the national
reporting and learning system and made clear that he thought that the
responsibility should be placed under the regulator. I wonder if that
is not a sensible suggestion. I do not think it is at all satisfactory
that it remains with NHS

73B, my second, comes back to the current debate about safety and
quality in the NHS. One thing that has become clear from Mid
Staffordshire is that, in its urgency to get foundation trust status,
the board was prepared to squeeze the staffing numbers. That was surely
one of the main contributors to the poor quality of care. I do not
think we can run away from the fact that there is a direct relationship
between the number of clinical staff treating patients and the quality

Finlay of Llandaff:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a very interesting
group of amendments. I will initially address the amendment relating to
staffing requirements. I declare an interest, having been involved with
Gwent Police at the beginning of its Operation Jasmine investigation
into nursing homes. It became evident there that the staffing levels in
nursing homes—which were owned privately by a GP at the
time—fell to such a level that the care was non-existent. What
was happening was absolutely appalling. I urge the Government to ask
NICE to look at this and come up with some guidance. The biggest
problem may well be outside of the hospitals, in the nursing home and
care sector. It is not only the staffing levels and the skill mix but
about how staff are expected to behave, what they are expected to do
and their taking on broader responsibilities for the care of patients.
I am not sure whether the wording is right for the Bill itself, but it
might be helpful for NICE to come up with some guidance that CQC could
use for
benchmarking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000034">It
is important that we look at the organisational duty of candour and are
cautious so that it cannot simply get focused down and pinned on the
individual. The Government have done a great deal of work already, as
has the General Medical Council, on the duty of candour of doctors
towards patients when something has gone wrong. Sadly, however, the
medical defence unions have all found that doctors, by and
large—two-thirds of doctors have reported this—are
working in what they feel is a blame-and-shame culture in which it
becomes increasingly difficult to report errors, and 70% of them report
that they do not feel supported when they report errors. However, there
is an undoubted need for there to be a duty of candour to patients when
something has gone
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000035">One of
the clinical difficulties that arise is that in very complex
situations, however well a team functions, things sometimes do not go
the way you expect them to. It is important to be able to differentiate
that situation from one in which somebody has done something wrong,
which has resulted in harm to a patient. Therefore, I have a slight
worry about whether perverse outcomes might occur that could increase
that fear of blame and shame. However, it is important to emphasise
that 
<?notus-xml column=1686?>since April this year there is a contractual duty on
organisations providing care that advises that doctors should tell
patients when something has gone wrong. That has been a major culture
shift for many, but patients are, in fact, very receptive to being told
when something has gone wrong. I have done it myself with the team, and
the other, non-medical members of staff were astonished at how
welcoming the patient and their relatives were to being told that
something had gone wrong and what we were doing about it. There is also
already the ability to impose fines, with the recovery of up to
£10,000 from the provider and criminal prosecution for
significant or recurrent breaches of the duty of care, and, of course,
if an individual professional has failed to be candid about an error,
they should be referred for impaired fitness to practice and potential
suspension or erasure from the professional register, whether it is a
doctor or a
nurse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000036">I will
give a quick clinical example of where the situation could get
complicated. Take a patient who is prescribed a drug such as
methotrexate and is to be monitored regularly by the GP. The GP asks
the receptionist to put a flag on the system, but the receptionist
forgets to do it. The patient carries on taking the methotrexate,
becomes neutropenic—has bone marrow failure—is admitted
to hospital and is septic. The patient recovers from that, and in
hospital is told exactly what has happened. When the patient leaves
hospital, understandably very angry, and goes straight round to the GP,
the GP has not yet received the discharge letter and finds it difficult
to understand what has happened, and there have been delays in the
system so that the discharge letter was delayed in getting to the
GP.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061294000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000037">That is
the kind of catalogue within a whole team of lots of people not quite
doing it right, and it becomes very difficult to pin the
blame on someone, although undoubtedly an error occurred. That is why I
support the duty of candour on an organisation, but we have to be
careful that we do not end up creating such a culture of fear and blame
that other parts of the organisation get scapegoated and blamed, rather
than there being corporate ownership for what has gone
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000038">One of my

would like to be assured, by those who tabled the amendment, that there
is no conflict with the requirement for confidentiality in terms of
what you are told by a patient. I could see a clinical situation in
which information held by a patient might have made their care more
difficult. It might have been disclosed to only one healthcare
professional, and the patient may have said that it was not to be
disclosed to anybody else. Therefore there are complexities behind
this, so that enforcing it in law and imposing sanctions and penalties
might become
difficult.</hs_parafo></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_12_PT_1/858DEC38E7F01034CC07F795EE571561B5E6B85A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 June 2013">Wednesday,

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 77
standing in my name. I have taken a slight different approach from that
of my noble friend, but I was out of the traps a
little before him. I was trying to do something slightly different, but
I am equally happy 
<?notus-xml column=1687?>with his rather more elegant amendment on the duty of candour. Whether I
have got the wording of the amendment right is another matter, but I
was trying to link the organisational responsibility for a duty
of candour to the registration process. Therefore, that
right at the outset, as a condition of registration, the organisation
had to sign up to the idea of a duty of candour.</hs_para>

patient’s position, the duty of candour in relation to the
employee becomes very important. The patient sees individual people,
not necessarily something called an organisation. On the other hand,
for the reasons that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, mentioned, one
has to provide cover for individuals who operate in that organisation,
both to protect them from unreasonable attacks by the victim of the
mistakes, but also from attacks by the employer for blowing the whistle
on them. In this amendment, I am striving for an obligation on the
employer—the provider of the services—to have a duty of
candour as part of their registration conditions. At the same time, the
employee should be protected against unfair employment practices or
unfair criticism. One is then forced along a path—which is not
fully explained in my amendment—where the contract of employment
between the individual and the employer gives some protection to the
employee who blows the
whistle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0002.htm#13061294000043">That
is quite complicated stuff and this is a complicated area, but we have
to strive not just for organisational candour, but for some protected
way for the employee to level with people when things have gone wrong.
I think the secret lies somewhere in the contract of employment. We do
not want that routed only through doctors. In a care home, for example,
it will not be the doctors talking to the residents, their families or
whoever. We need to do more work on this. Given that this was such a
high-profile issue in the Francis report I, like my noble friend Lord
Hunt, find it surprising that we are not trying to deal with it in the
Bill, complicated though it is. We need to put some wet towels around
our heads to try to find a way of capturing this in the Bill, so it is
both fair to the employer and to the employee. That is what I am trying
to do. Whether I have succeeded in my simpler version in

when we had similar debates during the passage of the Health and Social
Care Bill. Although I would not have wished the events at Mid
Staffordshire Hospital on anybody, I am really pleased that as a result
the Francis report recommended a duty of candour. I therefore welcome
the Government’s intention to implement that duty. However, as

shall not detain the Committee long, but there are two sets of choices
that the Government have made and I am curious why they made them. The

cause a large change in people’s behaviour and it should be a

us who have been involved in complaints will know that on many
occasions patients just want someone to say that they are sorry and to
explain why and how it went wrong, because they do not want it to go

damaged have not always been treated in an honest and open way; many

suffering by those who need to know the truth and have an apology. It

hesitant about going to complain within a ward about the way that they
were being treated, they would be able to point to a document and say,
“Look, Sir or Madam, this says that that is my
entitlement”. If we can get across the fact that people have
entitlements, and that they have a right to higher standards of

have to have a process of accountability for those who work on the ward
to the patient and to the patient’s relative, being their
representative. I will not go into my idea about these signs on wards
in great detail tonight, but perhaps I will at another stage in the

73A would transfer the responsibility for the National Reporting and
Learning System from NHS England to the Care Quality Commission. We
wish to take the opportunity to underline the importance of the data
and information available through the NRLS to the work of the Care
Quality Commission. Indeed, a key component of the CQC’s new
three-year strategy sets out how it will make better use of
intelligence to inform inspections. However, I remind noble Lords that
it was only on 1 June that responsibility for the National Reporting
and Learning System was transferred to NHS England. This transfer puts
patient safety at the heart of the NHS—I heard what the noble
Lord, Lord Hunt, said, but I think it is extremely important that it is
at the heart of the NHS—and will build on the excellent work of
the National Patient Safety Agency. NHS England plans to develop a
responsive NRLS that will provide a one-stop shop for NHS clinicians,
patients and the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0003.htm#13061294000060">Additionally,
noble Lords may be aware of the Berwick review of
safety—reference was made to it—which seeks to learn
lessons from the Francis report. It will report in July on a whole
system approach to ensure that there is zero tolerance of harm in the
NHS. We will, of course, give full consideration to any recommendations
that that review might make on the effectiveness of the NRLS. In view
of these important developments and reviews, we believe that
reallocating this work now would be unnecessarily
disruptive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0003.htm#13061294000061">Amendment
73B introduces a new clause which would require the CQC to have regard
to guidance on staffing numbers and skills mix in carrying out all its
functions. I fully understand the sentiment behind this. All noble
Lords will agree that high-quality care is dependent on the people
giving it. We heard from 
<?notus-xml column=1691?>the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, about the problems that arise
when that breaks down. Clearly, the right staffing in terms of numbers
and skills is vital for good care. It therefore follows that staffing
levels and skills mix are key considerations for the CQC in regulating
quality of care. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours,
says, that is not necessarily sufficient. The CQC’s registration
requirements place a clear legal duty on providers to have sufficient
numbers of suitably qualified, skilled and experienced staff in place
for the services provided. It is the responsibility of individual
providers to be accountable for staffing levels and the skills mix of
staff in their organisations. Where a provider does not meet the
staffing registration requirement, the CQC is able to use its
enforcement powers to protect patients and service users. However, I
note what the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, said about this being an
issue which is not necessarily best placed in primary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T21:34:01"></hs_TimeCode>. The
point is to try to achieve quality, safety and
efficacy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0003.htm#13061294000062">The
CQC will shortly review and consult on its registration requirements.
We intend to amend the requirements so that they will include
fundamental standards. These will set the basics below which standards
of care must never fall. We can assure noble Lords that the new chief
inspectors that we talked about previously, based within the CQC, will
have the power to inspect and assess staffing numbers and the skills
mix as part of examining the quality of care and will be able to take
any necessary action as they consider appropriate. Noble Lords asked
whether NICE might become involved in that. We believe that the current
legislative arrangements already require the CQC to assess staffing
levels. However, we will work with NICE, the CQC, NHS England and other
partners to review the use of evidence-based guidance and tools to
inform staffing decisions locally.</hs_para>

each introduce a stand-alone duty of candour in primary legislation. We
had an extremely interesting debate that demonstrated the complexity of
the issue. As the noble Lord, Lord Warner noted, it is a
complicated area. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, illustrated that, as
did my noble friend Lady Jolly and the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours. He noted that there could be unintended consequences
such as unwanted litigation. However, my noble friend Lady Jolly said
that often all that patients and their families need is clarity and
something being admitted to. All these issues show how complicated the
area is. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, spelt that out.</hs_para>

the view that providers of health and care must be open in their
dealings with patients and service users. Our response to Robert
Francis’s report makes a clear commitment to introduce a
statutory duty of candour. I therefore wish to reassure noble Lords
that we are doing that. In particular, I should like to reassure the
noble Baroness, Lady Masham, on that point. That is what we are doing.
The route that we are taking is perhaps endorsed by the nature of this
debate. We see this as something that is better taken through by
secondary legislation. Let me spell that out. The Government intend to
introduce an explicit duty of candour on providers as a CQC
registration requirement. This will require providers to ensure that
staff and clinicians are open with patients 
<?notus-xml column=1692?>and service users where there are failings in care.
I hear the warnings voiced by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. In the
end, the aim has to be to improve the quality, safety and efficacy of
care. I note what she said about confidentiality.</hs_para>

requirements for registration with the CQC, the Government intend that
the duty of candour should be set in secondary not primary legislation.
There are very strong reasons for that. Using secondary legislation
will enable us to expedite the introduction of this duty and provide a
degree of flexibility to get the design of the duty right. I am sure
that the department and my noble friend Lord Howe will welcome noble
Lords’ engagement, bringing their own wet towels if they wish
to, as we take this forward. Secondary legislation will still allow for
full parliamentary scrutiny, given that the changes to the regulations
that set CQC registration requirements will be subject to the
affirmative procedure in both Houses. The duty itself will have the
same legal power in secondary legislation as it would in primary
legislation. There is also the additional advantage that in such a new
and important area we can refine this new duty over time, if noble
Lords’ warnings prove to be significant. That is why I commend
the Government’s preferred approach of setting the new statutory
duty of candour through secondary legislation.</hs_para>

effect of removing the power to specify the type of information and the
type of care provider within scope of the new false or misleading

This would mean that we have a criminal sanction that applies to all
information required by legal obligation, including under contract,
which would be disproportionate. It is important that the offence does
not inhibit providers from sharing information voluntarily, but we also
need to keep the flexibility to respond to new information or different
priorities for information over
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061294000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-0003.htm#13061294000067">We

start from the issues raised in the Francis inquiry. We are therefore
clear that the offence will apply to providers of NHS secondary care.
This includes NHS trusts, foundation trusts and independent sector
providers of NHS secondary care. We are giving further thought to
whether the offence should also apply to other types of providers. We
will consider whether, for example, there is a case for extending the
offence to providers of adult social care, general practice and mental
health services. We will consider this, working together with our
stakeholders, and we will of course keep noble Lords informed as to our
thinking as this moves

about the duty of candour. It has been a good debate because noble
Lords have identified the problems of a statutory duty on individuals.

Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> I thank noble Lords for the opportunity
to debate the Government’s proposals for the introduction of
compulsory foreign language teaching into primary schools in England.
As noble Lords will know, the study of languages is currently a
compulsory national curriculum subject in maintained schools in England
at key stage 3
only.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000004">In
January 2011, the Government launched a review of the national
curriculum in England. After consideration of evidence from competitor
nations, advice from subject experts and responses to the
review’s call  for evidence, the expert panel advising
the review recommended that the teaching of languages should be
introduced at key stage
2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Following
this, in June 2012, my right honourable friend the Secretary 
of State for Education confirmed that it was the Government’s
intention to include the teaching of foreign languages at key stage 2
and, in doing so, build on the good work that many primary schools are
already doing, and bring us into line with practice in many other
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000005">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:46:48"></hs_TimeCode>
will say something about why we think this change is essential.
Learning a language benefits individuals’ social and economic
prospects and the economy more widely. It improves the mind, provides
an opening to other cultures and deepens our understanding of the
world. It is one mark of an educated person and we want all children to
develop confidence and enjoyment in being able to speak another
language early in their school life.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061277000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000006">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>
is a sad fact, however, that the state of languages teaching in
secondary schools has been in decline for a number of years. One sign
of this can be seen in the fall in the numbers of those taking
languages GCSEs. It is startling to note that the proportion of the
cohort entering for at least one modern foreign language GCSE has
declined from a high of 79% in 2001 to 40% 
<?notus-xml column=364?>in 2011. Other evidence also points to a decline. For example, the 2012
<I>European Survey on Language Competences</I> highlighted the poor
state of languages ability among school pupils in England.
Specifically, in the first taught foreign language, England had
significantly more pupils at the lower proficiency levels and
significantly fewer at the highest levels than our European
counterparts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:48:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

changing this situation and improving the teaching of languages. The
English baccalaureate performance measure has already started to
address the number of pupils studying languages at key stage 4. We
believe that introducing languages earlier will improve take-up further
still and also help pupils to achieve higher levels of performance at
GCSE level and
beyond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000008">We
recognise the importance of making foreign languages compulsory at key
stage 2, as recommended by the expert panel appointed to advise the
national curriculum review. There is evidence that suggests that
children are better able to learn the sounds of new languages when they
are younger. We have also taken into account previous recommendations,
made by Lord Dearing, that the teaching of foreign languages should be
compulsory at key stage 2, and the similar conclusions of Sir Jim
Rose’s review of the primary school curriculum conducted under
the previous
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:49:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Learning languages at an early age also helps general cognitive
development. Researchers from University College London in 2004 found
that learning other languages altered grey matter—that is, the
area of the brain that processes information—in the same way
that exercise builds
muscles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000009">We
have also taken into account the international evidence that shows that
many other jurisdictions recommend the teaching of foreign languages in
the primary phase. Indeed, evidence from Europe shows that many
countries start a compulsory second language much earlier than at age
11. In Austria, France, Norway and Spain, for example, pupils will have
started to learn a second language by the age of seven. We also
considered evidence from secondary schools, which told us how difficult
it is to plan languages teaching for their new intake that builds on
what they may have been taught in primary school. This means that in
some circumstances teaching is not built on effectively when pupils
start secondary
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000010">We
were encouraged by the recent CfBT Language Trends survey, in which 97%
of primary schools reported that they were already teaching a language.
The same survey found that more than 80% of primary schools were
reasonably confident about meeting the statutory key stage 2 language
requirement from 2014. It is uplifting to see examples such as St
Paul’s primary school in Brighton, a leading school for the
teaching of Spanish, which is taught from reception to year
6.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000011">All pupils
should enjoy the benefits of learning a language for at least four
years during their primary education, which will enable them to make
significant progress. We also believe that making languages compulsory
at key stage 2, underpinned by a statutory programme of study, will
give secondary schools a much more secure base on which to
build.</hs_para>

this proposal both through the national curriculum review call for
evidence and a specific consultation exercise on making languages
compulsory at key stage 2. Responses on this issue in both exercises
were overwhelmingly positive. The large majority of respondents to the
consultation—more than 90%—agreed with the
Government’s intention to introduce foreign languages at key
stage 2. Their arguments included the view that young children have a
natural disposition for learning languages. They claimed that making
the subject compulsory was important to ensure its place in the
curriculum of all schools. They also argued that doing so would lead to
better attainment at key stage 3, and greater take-up at key stage 4,
and that pupils would benefit from a more global outlook and enhanced
career
prospects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000013">Only
a very small proportion of
respondents—3% —opposed the proposal. Their key
argument was  that languages should not be a priority for this
age group compared with other subjects such as literacy, numeracy and
science. The majority of respondents, however, were of the opinion that
all children benefited from learning a foreign language and that it
widened
opportunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000014">In
November last year, we therefore announced our decision to proceed with
the necessary legislation to make languages compulsory at key stage 2.
As noble Lords may be aware, on the same date we sought views on a
proposal to require primary schools to teach one of the following
languages at key stage 2: French, German, Italian, Mandarin, Spanish,
Latin or ancient Greek. Responses to this second consultation were
divided, but the matter for debate today is whether we should make
foreign languages a statutory subject at key stage 2. A separate order
will be laid subsequently on the proposed list of
languages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000015">We
also published, in February this year, a programme of study for key
stage 2 languages in draft, along with one for key stage 3. These
programmes set out the purpose and aims of study, as well as the
subject content to be taught. The intention behind them is that
children should enjoy learning a language, with the goal of being able
to speak it with increasing confidence and fluency, and finding ways of
communicating what they want to say. Having the confidence and ability
to use a foreign language for their purposes, as well as for academic
study, is very important. We have been extremely encouraged by the very
positive response with which these programmes of study were greeted.
Our belief that they will provide a challenging, rigorous and
appropriate standard has been supported by many
respondents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000016">On
the implementation of the proposal, we are carefully considering the
responses to the recent consultation on the Government’s wider
proposals for reform of the national curriculum. This included a
specific question asking for views on the support that schools will
need to implement the new national curriculum. Clearly, system leaders,
such as teaching schools and national support schools, will play a key
role. We are also working with subject associations, publishers and
others to ensure that high-quality support is available.</hs_para>

the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Childcare
said in her speech to the National College Fellowship Commission last
month, the implementation of this edition of the national curriculum

schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000018">Language
teaching requires expertise both in using the language and in
age-appropriate pedagogy. Many primary schools have already
successfully addressed these needs. Making languages compulsory at key
stage 2 will build on this good base and on the investment made by
previous Governments to support primary languages
teaching.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000019">We
recognise that training and continuing professional development will,
of course, be important, particularly with the new emphasis on written
as well as spoken language, but needs will vary from school to school.
The Government, therefore, believe as a general principle that schools
themselves are best placed to decide what arrangements they need to put
in place to support their staff to deliver the new national
curriculum.</hs_para>

foreign languages compulsory at key stage 2 is a hugely

consultation exercise and reflected on the feedback received, we will
publish what we intend to be final versions of the new programmes of

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
her explanation of the order. I should make it clear from the outset
that we are not in principle opposed to the requirement to teach a
foreign language at key stage 2. In fact, the previous Government led
the way on this and were already legislating for it in the Children,
Schools and Families Act 2010 when the then Opposition refused to
support it in the run-up to the general election. If our proposal on
the primary school curriculum had been allowed to continue, modern
foreign language teaching in primary schools would have been compulsory
from 2011; it will not now be compulsory until September
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:56:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000022">The
order is set against the backdrop of much broader curriculum changes
that have been subject to detailed debate and criticism both in your
Lordships’ House and in the wider education world. While I am
sure that the noble Baroness will be pleased to hear that I do not
intend to repeat all those concerns today, some of them are specific to
this discussion and I shall address those now. First, the whole process
of curriculum reform has been marked by secrecy and a lack of
transparency, which is equally true of the foreign language proposals.
The Government have carried out two consultations on this issue but the
responses were 
<?notus-xml column=367?>available only when sought by a freedom of information request, so we
have to take the summary in the Explanatory Memorandum on trust.
Nevertheless we were pleased to see that the vast majority of
respondents supported the change in
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:57:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000023">However,
we share the fundamental concerns also identified in the memorandum
about the prescriptive list of languages to be taught. It is not at all
clear how the list was drawn up and what the evidence base was to
determine that these and no other languages should be taught. Why not,
for example, include Bengali, Hindi or Arabic, or other languages with
strong roots in local communities? I was a school governor a decade or
two ago in a south London school with  a strong local
Portuguese community. Why should that school not be able to benefit
from the advantages of pupils who already have some bilingual knowledge
in their classroom?
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:58:47"></hs_TimeCode> appreciate
that the specifics are subject to a separate order and will take note
of the Minister’s justification of the list, but I would like to
return to this
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T15:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000024">Secondly,
we are concerned that the current broad aims of learning set out in the
old curriculum are being replaced by a much narrower concentration on
pupils acquiring core knowledge. We are concerned that this will have
an impact on the way in which any foreign language is taught, will
militate against developing a love and respect for other languages, and
will be replaced by a more formulistic count of words and phrases that
have to be memorised. With a technical emphasis on learning in the
curriculum, there appears to be a lack of understanding of the wider
benefits of intercultural understanding, access to a global community
and greater transferrable skills, although I was pleased to hear the
noble Baroness making some references to those issues in her
introduction. Can she provide any insight into the teaching guidance
that will be given to language teachers to ensure that pupils learn in
a broad global context?</hs_para>

are concerned at the tight timetable proposed for the implementation of
the changes. I would like some further reassurance that this has been
thought through. What assessment has the department made of the
capacity of primary schools to recruit sufficient suitably qualified
staff to teach a language by September 2014—or will it be the
case, as I suspect, that it will be added on to the teaching portfolio
of existing non-specialist staff?</hs_para>

given to the adverse effects of teaching a language badly? I speak with
some painful personal memories in this regard, having been in a French
class for three years that consisted of collectively being played
audiovisual tapes. Needless to say, it was rather too late to take any
remedial action by the time it was realised how little any of us had
learnt over that period. I have to say that maybe my grey matter has
suffered as a result of not learning that language at that time. Will
the Minister clarify what steps are being taken to boost the number of
language teachers prior to September next year to ensure that potential
teaching programmes and materials are in place and to guarantee that
quality specialist teaching exists from day one?</hs_para>

recent Ofsted report on modern languages acknowledged that significant
progress had been made under the previous Government, and that there
was a commitment of senior leaders to introduce modern languages in
primary schools. Again, the Minister made reference to that progress.
However, it also recommended that the department should consider how
best to support, both nationally and locally, the effective
consolidation of modern languages and increased liaison with secondary
schools to provide continuity of learning. How has the department
responded to that challenge?</hs_para>

Education Minister in the Commons, Elizabeth Truss, in reply to a
recent Question about the availability of resources to help with the
new curriculum, was quoted as saying that schools were best placed to
decide what teaching resources and professional development met their
needs and that it was down to them to identify their priorities. Again,
I think I heard an echo of that comment in the Minister’s
introduction. I have to say that that feels rather like passing the
buck, given that these
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:02:48"></hs_TimeCode> will be
a requirement on all maintained schools. I hope that the Minister can

a point that has been made repeatedly in other contexts: if the
teaching of a foreign language at key stage 2 is important to the
Government, how can it be right that a proportion of children,
including those who attend academies, free schools and independent
schools, are outside the scope of these proposals and therefore
unaffected by the changes?</hs_para>

comments today on the principle and practicalities of introducing a
language teaching requirement at key stage 2. However, as I have made
clear, we have considerably more concerns about the specific list of

consultation report was published on 7 February 2013 together with the

noble Baroness mentioned the choice of modern languages; we both
recognise that that is not the subject of this instrument. The list of
modern languages 
<?notus-xml column=369?>proposed reflects the languages that primary schools told us that they
were mostly likely to teach and therefore have the expertise for
teaching. Mandarin is particularly important to our future economic
success. Latin and ancient Greek were added because they provide an
important foundation for a number of foreign languages. We recognise
that the list will provoke debate. My right honourable friend has
received representations on behalf of a number of languages that are
not included, including Japanese and Hebrew, is considering those
representations carefully and will take all the points raised into

course, we are not preventing any school from teaching any language it
wants to. All children should have opportunity to learn one of the
major world languages on the proposed list; it may, for example, be a
language that they already learn at home or, as the noble Baroness has
said, a language which is prevalent in the particular school. There is
no restriction on that.</hs_para>

mentioned academies. Although there is no specific regulation for the
academies to teach a language, they will fall under the same
regulations about teaching a balanced curriculum as other schools. It
is unlikely that parents of children at an academy would not insist, if
the academy were not offering a language, that it should be part of a
balanced curriculum. Again, however, we will monitor

mentioned the effectiveness of teaching of foreign languages. I agree
that, again, we must ensure that we keep up with this. I assure her
that her grey matter does not seem to be in short supply due to her
language learning. There is of course now a great deal of technology
which can assist with the teaching of languages; although I recall as a
one-time language teacher being faced with language labs; there only
ever seemed to be one person in the school who knew how to work them
and they were almost inevitably on the far side of the sports pitch.
Some technologies have not been as useful as others. These days,
however, there are some exciting developments for helping to teach
modern languages, but they are no substitute for a good

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, these regulations concern the ban on
referral fees introduced by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders Act 2012. They make provision for the implementation of the
ban in two specific areas. First, they provide for the ban on referral
fees to apply to certain types of financial services
firm—namely, those in the insurance sector. Secondly, they
provide for the enforcement of the ban, as it applies to financial
firms, by the Financial Conduct
Authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:11:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000042">I
turn first to the rationale for the ban. In late 2008 Lord Justice
Jackson was commissioned to undertake a review of the rules and
principles governing the  costs of civil litigation in England
and Wales and to make recommendations to promote access to
justice  at proportionate costs. His report set out a number of

<?notus-xml column=371?>proposals to tackle the disproportionate costs of civil litigation. In
responding to these proposals the Ministry of Justice included
provisions to ban referral fees in relation to personal injury cases in
the LASPO Act 2012. Referral fees are typically paid by solicitors to
third parties who refer business to them. Most personal injury claims
are referred to solicitors by claims management companies. However,
other parties, such as insurers, are also often involved. In cases
where policyholders contact insurers to make a claim on their motor
insurance policy, the insurer may check whether there is a related
personal injury claim and refer the policyholder to a lawyer in return
for a fee. If the case is successful, the lawyer’s costs,
including the referral fee, would be recovered from the losing
defendant. In many cases, the losing defendant could be another
insurance company.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061277000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000043">Referral<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:12:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:12:34"></hs_TimeCode>
fee payments have increased from around £250 per case in 2004 to
around £800 per case in 2009.
Both<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:13:19"></hs_TimeCode> the Law
Society and the Association of British Insurers raised the concern that
the circular flow of money generated by referral fees incentivises and
rewards making claims and therefore inflates the cost of claims and
ultimately insurance premiums. According to the ABI, the average
insurance premium increased by approximately 10% from 2009 to 2010 in
order to make up for insurance underwriting losses of over
£2 billion in 2010, when 20p was lost in every
£1 of premium
earned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13061277000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000044">Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:13:41"></hs_TimeCode>
Justice Jackson recommended that the payment and receipt of referral
fees should be banned. A ban discourages lawyers from bringing
unnecessary claims for compensation, including unmeritorious
lower-value claims, while reducing the overall level of legal costs in
personal injury cases and related insurance costs. The Ministry of
Justice took forward Lord Justice Jackson’s recommendations.
Rules against referral fees in personal injury cases were included in
the LASPO Act 2012. The rules cover both the payment and the receipt of
referral fees. The ban captures all the main businesses involved, such
as solicitors, claims management companies, insurers and insurance
intermediaries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:14:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Under the provisions of the 2012 Act, the individual regulators in each
sector are required to effectively enforce the ban. For regulated
financial services firms, the relevant regulator is the
FCA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:14:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000045">I
will now explain the specifics of the regulation. The provisions in
Sections 56 to 60 of the LASPO Act 2012 introduce rules against the
payment and receipt of referral fees for legal services in relation to
personal injury cases. The ban on the payment and receipt of referral
fees generally came into effect on 1
April.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:17:11"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Act confers two main powers on the Treasury that are exercised through
these regulations. The first relates to the scope of the ban. The ban
on referral fees applies only to financial services firms of a type
described by the Treasury in regulations. The regulations specify the
financial services firms to which the ban on referral fees applies. The
ban is applied to those primarily conducting insurance and insurance
mediation or those in the same group as such persons. The second
relates to the monitoring and enforcement of the ban. The 2012 Act
provides for the Financial 
<?notus-xml column=372?>Conduct Authority to be the regulator for financial services firms. It
allows the Treasury to adapt the existing regulatory powers of the FCA
to this new regulatory
function.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000047">The
FCA has existing powers under the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 to supervise, monitor and enforce regulatory requirements imposed
on financial services firms. These regulations provide the FCA’s
existing powers of monitoring and enforcement to be applied, with
appropriate modifications, to the ban on referral fees. This will
enable the FCA to use those powers to enforce the ban. For example, it
can impose financial penalties where a firm breaches regulatory rules
under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. These regulations
provide for the FCA to be able to use the financial penalties power
where a financial services firm breaches the rules against referral
fees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000048">Another
example is provided in investigatory powers. Under FiSMA, the FCA can
require financial services firms to provide it with information where
this is relevant to the authority’s functions under the
2000 Act. These regulations allow the Financial Conduct
Authority to use this power to require information to be provided where
this is relevant to enforcing the ban against referral fees, as it
applies to financial firms.</hs_para>

ban on referral fees will apply to those conducting insurance and
insurance mediation and those in the same group as such persons. It
will mean that insurers and insurance brokers are likely to incur
compliance costs related to ensuring that they are not in breach of the
ban. Firms can also expect to be subject to monitoring by the Financial
Conduct Authority and enforcement action where breaches are identified.
The FCA has published a one-minute guide for firms affected by these
regulations on how it will supervise the ban on referral fees in
relation to financial services firms. Supervision of the financial
sector’s compliance with the ban will form part of the existing
supervisory regime of the FCA. For those reasons, I commend the

am always impressed by how the Government rely on Lord Justice
Jackson’s report, except when it comes to his very strong
assertion that legal aid should have remained intact. It is a very
selective approach—we are moving from apples to cherries in
terms of our botanical analogies. Having said that, we have no
objection to a ban on referral fees in general, although I am bound to
say that I was a little surprised that my noble friend Lady Hayter
reported to me that from in her experience in the consumer world, in
which she is heavily engaged, consumers apparently very much like the
referral fee system and going through a referring body to solicitors.
It was rather a surprise and, perhaps, a disappointment to me. I
declare an interest as a solicitor, although now an unpaid consultant

were certainly abuses, particularly in claims management companies but
also by the very insurance companies that have constantly pressed the
Government, now successfully, on their need to reduce the likelihood of
litigation by making it more difficult and more expensive for litigants
to obtain justice. The limits, particularly on claims of less than
£25,000 for personal injuries, will be subject to a very strict
regime in terms of costs that may well make it uneconomic for
solicitors to pursue them—but that, I guess, is a different
matter.</hs_para>

said that, there are areas in which the extension was not justified,
which I mentioned in debate on the LASPO Bill, as it then was—in

trade unions, because they are regarded in the same light as those
commercial organisations. I thought then and I think now that that

from the Explanatory Notes that the FCA has issued guidance notes to
firms affected by the regulations. I am bound to say that I could not
trace those when I looked online, but they may exist. It would have

is interesting that the Legal Services Board has also issued guidance
on referral fees. My noble friend Lady Hayter has copied to me a letter
dated 21 August 2012 that seems to have been addressed to all approved
regulators, so I suppose that that includes the Solicitors Regulation
Authority, the FSA and possibly other bodies as well—the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, or whatever. I
am not sure, and the Minister may not be able to tell me today, whether
the FCA guidance reflects the guidance previously offered by the Legal
Services Board. I note from the Explanatory Notes that there was no
consultation on this statutory instrument, which puzzles me because if
the Legal Services Board pronounced some months ago, unless the FCA
simply adopted its guidance, one would have thought that it would have
at least consulted the Legal Services Board and possibly other bodies.
I am curious about that apparent turn of

this is a straightforward matter, there has been an interesting duel
about the effect of this ban in the pages of the <I>Law Gazette

Solicitors Regulation Authority—which is of course the primary
regulatory body for the profession and will have to oversee the conduct
in the situation as opposed to the operation of the ban—has been
clear about how the position will work. Meanwhile, in the previous
article, considerable doubt was cast on the effect of the proposed ban.
I am fairly persuaded by the position that the two QCs adopt; they seem
to argue their case effectively. However, this illustrates that, even
here, there may be some grey areas that will provoke not further
litigation, hopefully, but at least correspondence and some
difficulty—particularly on the part of those involved in
understanding exactly what it is that they are required to do or, more
particularly, what they are required not to do on referral fees. I

comment. The noble Lord referred to the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,
saying that the referral fee system was supported by some people. The
thing that no one is objecting to is referrals. People are objecting to
the fact that people are now being paid probably more than £800
on average to do it. That is a heck of a lot of cash. The problem is
that it pushes up insurance payments to everyone and gives an incentive
to the referrers to refer anything because they are on a winning
ticket: if the case is taken up they get their fee, and if it is not
then they do not lose anything. That means that there is a perverse
incentive in the system for people to take cases that may or may not
have huge validity, particularly when the amount being claimed is
relatively
small<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:29:03"></hs_TimeCode>. If I am
right in thinking that people like the prospect of being referred on
but do not like the idea of paying fees, I would have thought that that
would apply to NGOs, unions and others as well. However, as the noble
Lord said, we are not discussing that principle today; the die is cast
on that
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:29:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about alternative business structures and whether they would be able to
get around the ban. As the Committee knows, the Government strongly
supports alternative business structures to increase competition and
innovation. Alternative business structures do not allow organisations
to avoid the ban but allow them flexibility to operate in the personal

Lord asked about consultation. A general consultation was undertaken by
the MoJ at the time on the Jackson recommendations as a whole, which
included referral fees. The scope for consultation here seems to be
very limited. It is a straightforward ban. Once it has been decided to
have a ban, unlike many bits of legislation where there is a whole raft
of issues surrounding implementation, this is very straightforward:
just do not do it. I am not sure what more detailed consultation could

noble Lord asked when the Government would extend the ban to other
categories of law beyond personal injury. At the moment we are very
much concerned with this area of referral fees, because they are the
main source of claims inflation. That is why we are taking immediate
action here. However, as he said, the LASPO Act 2012 includes the power
to extend the prohibition to other types of claim and other legal
services, should the need arise, but I am very pleased to say that that
is a matter for the MoJ, not the

not been uprated since. The Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act

cases dealt with under the rules of any scheme established under the

However, because the 2012 scheme launched as a relatively small-scale

changes were applied to the 2012 scheme calculation regulations to
ensure that the flat rate remained at £5. The flat rate

is intended that the increase to the flat rate made by the 2008 Act
will be brought into force later in the year, when the 2012 child
maintenance scheme is opened to all applicants. This instrument makes
certain consequential amendments as a result of that increase. The
policy intention behind the increase is primarily that the value of the
flat rate should be restored to its 2003 real value. This will
reinforce the principle that parents have an obligation to support
their children where they have the means to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000073">At
£7, the increased flat rate will represent broadly the same
value as the £5 flat rate when it began. For example, when the
flat rate was introduced in 2003,  £5 represented 9% of
the benefit of a single person over 25 years of age on
jobseeker’s allowance. The annual uprating of benefits has meant
that the same £5 represents just 7% of the benefit of a single
person over 25 years of age on jobseeker’s allowance. A flat
rate of £7 represents 10% of the benefit of a single person over
25 years of age on jobseeker’s allowance, restoring the value of
the 2003 flat

proposed flat-rate increase will also amend the percentages applied to
the reduced rate of child support maintenance payable if the
non-resident parent has an income of less than £200 but more
than £100. This will mean that the maintenance liability of
parents on the reduced rate will increase in order that the reduced
rate continues to smooth increases in liabilities between the flat rate
and the basic rate, which is used for those parents earning £200
or more. The Government are also committed to a wider review of the

regulations before us also make miscellaneous amendments in relation to
variations, which are those rules that allow for a deviation from the
usual child maintenance calculation rules in certain limited
circumstances. A variation could increase or decrease a child
maintenance liability. For example, if a parent receives unearned
income from property, savings and investments or casual earnings, this
could increase their liability. On the other hand, if they incur
special expenses, such as the cost of travelling to see a child, or
boarding school fees, this could reduce their
liability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>. I
should make clear that the changes contained in these regulations
affect only those variations that increase liability.</hs_para>

designed to work with historic income information obtained annually
from HM Revenue and Customs. The changes proposed will allow that,
where the information cannot be obtained electronically from HMRC, we
will be able to determine unearned income by reference to information
supplied by the parent in relation to the most recent tax year. This
change will make for a more efficient means of obtaining reliable
unearned income information and therefore allow for a more accurate
calculation of maintenance liability.</hs_para>

amendments will clarify that where a variation would decrease a
non-resident parent’s income for child maintenance purposes to
the point that their liability would fall to below the flat rate, even
if the variation is agreed, the amount of maintenance that the parent
will be liable for will none the less remain at the flat rate. This is
in order to strike a balance between reducing liability to take account
of special expenses and ensuring that children continue to benefit from
some financial support. It puts children first. This will also ensure
consistency between a non-resident parent who has their maintenance
reduced to the level of the flat rate through a variation and a
non-resident parent on the flat rate. A non-resident parent in the
latter situation cannot apply for a special expenses

always been the practice throughout the development of the 2012 scheme

in the flat rate to £7 is warranted. We have met stakeholder

increase to
£7<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T16:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>. We

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
introduction of these regulations. We could hardly oppose provisions
enabling the increase in the flat-rate maintenance amount from
£5 to £7, as they flow from the 2008 Act, which was the
legislation of the previous Government. The Government were right to
listen to stakeholders and to draw back from their original intent of
increasing that to £10. As the Minister has indicated, the
£7 figure will keep the amount at about 10% of the basic
over-25s JSA rate, and the increase should therefore mean more money
for children.</hs_para>

understand from both the documentation and the Minister’s
introduction that the regulations are not intended to come into force
until the introduction of the 2012 scheme, so the utilisation of gross
income in the calculation is used “for all purposes”.
Perhaps the Minister could clarify that; otherwise I will have to read
the record to see when exactly this is going to come into force. Is it
intended to refer to the time when the 2012 scheme is open to all new
applicants or the time when the 2012 scheme will have replaced the 1993
and 2003 schemes? If the latter, could he clarify now when the
Government expect that to take place?</hs_para>

the regulations cover other “consequential” matters. As
the Minister indicated, one of these is the revised rate calculation
that applies where the non-resident parent has income of between
£100 and £200. The rates in the regulations are lower
than those provided for in the 2012 regulations, and perhaps the
Minister could explain why. I imagine that it relates to the effect of
raising the flat rate but it would be helpful if he could confirm that,
as well as setting out the impact on the levels of child maintenance
liability for non-resident parents earning between  £100
and £200. I would be grateful if he could give some indication
of the range of changes—what is the smallest and largest amount
by which the future liability will differ from the past? That would
give us an indication of whether they are indeed large or small in
their impact. I would also be grateful if the Minister could confirm
what would happen to someone earning precisely £200. Is there
any danger of a cliff-edge when someone moves from below £200,
where the reduced rate applies, to £200 where the standard rate
will
apply?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061277000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000153">4.45

introduction, the Minister referred to the provisions that relate to
what happens when the department cannot get information electronically
from HMRC relating to historic income. Do the Government expect that
use of that provision will be widespread, or is it intended to happen
only in the odd case where for some reason, it does not work? That
might enable him to bring us up to date, if necessary, with what is
happening with RTI and related developments. We might also reflect on
the regulations in the context of the letter and briefing note from the
Minister dated  20 May 2013, to which he referred, which set
out the Government’s updated position on the reforms to the
child maintenance system. We look forward to seeing the detailed
response to the consultation in due course, whenever autumn
comes—although I assume that the Minister will take a seasonal
rather than climatic determination of that, otherwise I expect it any
day
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000084">It
appears that the pace at which the 2012 arrangements are to be fully
introduced has slowed, perhaps mirroring what has happened to the
Government’s benefit reforms generally, but history reminds us
of the perils of going too quickly. The Minister may want to say a bit
more in his response about the experience of the
pathfinder—albeit that it applies to only a small number of
cases. Can he tell us precisely how many? Are the systems performing as
planned? The manner in which it is proposed to deal with cases under
the 1993 and 2003 schemes remains a matter of contention, with real
concern that the closure of cases as planned could mean people dropping
out of the system altogether, and with children being the losers, but I
am sure that we will have the opportunity to return to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000085">We

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, before I aim to answer most of those
questions, it is worth briefly reflecting on where we are with the
rollout of the 2012 scheme. As the noble Baroness said, we began a
pathfinder in December which was open to new applicants with four or
more qualifying children. That has allowed us to micromanage each case
so that we are confident that our system and processes will work as we
intend. As the noble Baroness will know, we are adopting that structure
with all of our reforms so that we are really able to see what happens
as we take each person through. By definition, in the early weeks,
numbers are intentionally small. We are monitoring and observing the
results of that pathfinder so that when we open it much more widely it
will work efficiently. I know that the noble Baroness will be as keen
as I am for all those systems to work smoothly when we do them in
volume.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000087">The
timing is that we will open to new applicants with two or more
qualifying children—in our jargon, Commencement
2—later in the summer. We will move to all new
applicants—in our jargon, Commencement
3 —by the end of 2013. It is at that point that
we  will increase the flat rate of maintenance. As part of our
wider reforms, we are making good progress in implementing the help and
support for separated families initiative.</hs_para>

launched the Sorting out separation web app, which directs people to
information and support on the range of issues that they will face
after separation. We have also launched the Help and Support for
Separated Families mark, which helps parents identify the organisations
that they can trust to help them work together; and an innovation fund,
which will test and evaluate interventions designed to help separated
parents work together and reduce conflict. The first contracts in this
fund have recently been awarded to seven voluntary and third-sector
organisations, and will give around 280,000 separated families creative
and targeted help to collaborate in their children’s
interests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000089">Last
month we tabled a Written Ministerial Statement outlining important
changes to child maintenance reform. As well as the announcement of our
intention to use the £7 rather than the £10 flat rate for
the non-resident parent, we announced a reduction in the proposed
parent-with-care collection fee from 7% to just 4%. Both changes were
the product of an extended period of consultation and reflection, and
we have been at pains to ensure that our changes are seen to be fair to
both parents. On the outstanding question of how the £100 and
£200 figures work together, the reason for the different rates
is that they are on top of a different basic amount. The calculation is
done not as a pure calculation but on flat rate-plus. There are some
variations, but broadly it comes out at much the same level. Let us
take the example of a non-resident parent with one qualifying child and
no other relevant children and put them in the middle of the range at
£150. The current rate would be £14.50, which is the
£5 flat rate plus 19% of the £50. That comes out at 9.7%
of their gross income. Moving to a flat rate of 
<?notus-xml column=381?>£7, the same person would pay £16.50, or 11% of their
gross income. That is how the sum works. It is impossible to absorb
these sums verbally, so I would be very happy to lay them out in a
letter to the noble Baroness. That would make them clearer—but
broadly, that is one
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000090">The
noble Baroness asked a very subtle question about the difference
between £199.99 and £200.01. There is no cliff edge
there. There are quite a lot of factors, and some little bumps here and
there. Again, the easiest thing would be for me to write with a few
examples so that the noble Baroness can study them on paper. However, I
can say that the structure is relatively smooth and that certainly
there is no cliff edge. On how widespread we are expecting this to be,
where there is a glitch in the system and, for whatever reason, we
cannot get a particular piece of information, we are ensuring that
there is another way through. We are not anticipating large volumes on
this, but one has to have it as a baseline defence. Clearly, this is a
different system to RTI. This system was created rather before
universal credit was a gleam in anyone’s eye. We do not have
this monthly process which UC depends on. It is a different annualised
process. It will be up to a future Government at some stage to look at
whether it makes sense to use similar systems. However, there is no
relationship whatever between the systems under UC and this.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=382?>necessary, large or complex water or sewerage infrastructure projects.
They are designed to help to contain and minimise the risks associated
with their delivery to customers of water or sewerage companies, known
as undertakers, and also to UK taxpayers. Containing and minimising
these risks should correspondingly provide better value for money

enable the Secretary of State or Ofwat to specify by notice an
infrastructure project where either is satisfied that two conditions
have been met. The first is that the infrastructure project is of a
size or complexity that threatens an undertaker’s ability to

specifying the project would be likely to result in better value for
money than if the project was not so specified, taking into account
charges to customers and any government financial
assistance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000094">Once
specified, an undertaker would then be required to put the specified
infrastructure out to tender and a separate Ofwat-regulated

Without that tendering process, competitively determining the cost of

to create ring-fenced Ofwat-regulated infrastructure providers between
undertakers and large or complex projects would also help to ring-fence
their associated higher risks, and should result in more effective risk

due consideration of the public consultation, we have decided to
proceed with these regulations for the reasons that I have outlined.
The ability to enable undertakers to tender competitively an
infrastructure provider to finance and deliver a large or complex
project will be a useful tool, even if rarely exercised. Enabling the
ring-fencing of important infrastructure projects will help to attract
necessary private capital at a transparent and competitive price,

Knight of Weymouth:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister will be
relieved to know that on this occasion, unlike a previous one, I will
not seek to give contradictory views to represent the views of some of
my colleagues on this side of the Committee. This debate comes at an
inconvenient time for Thames Water but, therefore, at an opportune time
for Parliament. I will make some general comments and then delve a
little into some  of the specifics of the Thames tideway tunnel
project. In making my comments, I am grateful as ever to  the
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee of your Lordships’
House. Its third report of this Session brings 
<?notus-xml column=384?>these regulations to the special attention of the Committee on the
grounds that they give rise to issues of public policy likely to be of
interest to us. I am particularly grateful that the Committee is
willing to delegate me to take forward all those public policy issues.
It is right that we should reflect on
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000105">As
the committee points out, the Explanatory Memorandum implies that these
regulations are generic and apply to all water and sewerage companies
and large infrastructure projects that meet the criteria. That was
clearly set out by the Minister. However, the only project to which the
regulations are expected to apply over the next 10 years is the Thames
tideway tunnel. The impact assessment therefore exclusively estimates
the impact of the project in relation to these regulations. We have
debated the tunnel before, but there are issues I would like to raise
as events have moved on.</hs_para>

I will make some generic comments. The arguments put for establishing a
separate body to manage the finance, delivery and extraordinary risks
of major water infrastructure projects are reasonable. The example of
the Thames tunnel is helpful. It will cost more than £4 billion
and, while Thames Water will carry out associated investment at its own
risk, the cost of the main tunnel is a considerable financial risk to
put on a company with a turnover of £1.8 billion. Assuming that
Thames Water is well regulated and responsible, there is logic in
establishing a separate infrastructure provider to construct the tunnel
and have Thames Water effectively lease it
back.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000107">These
regulations then extend the reach of Ofwat to these providers, which is
important to ensure that the public interest is protected. The
alternatives discussed by the Minister and in the accompanying papers
are to leave things as they are or to require that the project be put
out to tender by the water company. Defra discounts the former because
Ofwat would struggle to regulate the financial arrangements when they
are bound in with the rest of the company’s activities. To some
extent, I struggle to see how it can effectively regulate the general
finances of a company and then the separate finances of a big project,
but cannot manage to do it when they are done together. However, I am
happy to believe those involved when they tell me that they cannot. I
am also happy with the desirability of a separate provider over the
complexity of negotiating  a new licence, which is the
implication of requiring the company to tender a major project.
Therefore, I am happy with the regulations as they stand in the
generality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:07:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000108">Let
me then turn to the specifics of the Thames tideway tunnel and the
figures in the impact assessment. I remind the Committee that I rent a
flat here in London very close to one of the sites for the construction
of the tunnel, so in that respect have an interest. Thames Water has
also been to see me to brief—or some would say lobby—me
about the project. I accept the basis of the company’s argument.
The capital’s Victorian sewerage system has served the capital
well, but urgently needs more capacity to meet the needs of modern-day
London. The Thames tideway tunnel will ensure that the capital has a
sewerage system fit for purpose for at least another
century.</hs_para>

world-leading cities, including Paris, Stockholm, Helsinki and

the Thames tideway tunnel. I thank the noble Lord for his views and his
insightful interventions. I thank him for agreeing that the general
approach we are taking is reasonable. That is perhaps the most
important thing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:13:13"></hs_TimeCode>

indicated in my introduction, it is important that these regulations
should be considered separately from the specific Thames tideway tunnel
project in London. In summary, the regulations enable the creation of
infrastructure providers regulated by the Water Services Regulation
Authority, Ofwat, to finance and deliver large or complex water or
sewerage infrastructure projects. They provide for the procuring,
licensing and regulating of an infrastructure provider that is separate
from a water or sewerage company. They set out how the Secretary of
State or Ofwat can specify to which projects the regulations would
apply and how they designate the company that is to become an
infrastructure provider. The regulations are intended to apply to all
such large or complex water or sewerage projects that may be proposed
in the future, where their application would be considered to result in
better value for money for both customers and
taxpayers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:14:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061277000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-gc0001.htm#13061277000116">I
turn specifically to the Thames tideway tunnel, and I think the noble
Lord has already made similar points. Climate change, population growth
and higher customer expectations of environmental standards and supply
resilience are anticipated to require larger and more complex
infrastructure than the existing regulatory regime was designed to
provide for. For example, changing rainfall patterns are expected to
result in wetter winters and drier summers—who would believe it
after last summer?—and to aggravate water scarcity conditions in
the south and the east. This may lead to an increased requirement for
potentially complex arrangements for transporting water.</hs_para>

heavy rainfall events are likely to become more frequent—that we
can all believe. In London, these events will further strain an already
overtaxed sewerage system, leading to more overflows of untreated
wastewater, containing raw sewage, into the Thames. Even after ongoing
upgrades to sewage treatment works and the Lee tunnel are
completed  by the end of 2015, just over 18 million tonnes of
wastewater will enter the Thames every year from London’s
combined sewer overflows when storm-water capacity is exceeded. These
overflows currently occur on average about once a week and have a
significant environmental impact on the river. They 
<?notus-xml column=387?>increase the likelihood of fish kills, create a higher health hazard for
the users of the river and damage the aesthetic appeal of the

proposed Thames tideway tunnel is an example of a large and complex
high-risk infrastructure expected to be constructed within the next 10
years. It is also  one of the top 40 priority
infrastructure investments  within the national infrastructure
plan 2011. Its construction would intercept storm sewage overflows and
ensure that the River Thames meets water quality objectives established
by the 2006 Thames tideway strategic study, preventing deterioration
and ensuring that the Thames remains at moderate

works would also ensure that the UK met its legal obligations under the
urban wastewater treatment directive. On 18 October last year, the
Court of Justice of the European Union found the UK to be in breach of
the directive in London since 31 December 2000 by failing to have
adequate collection and treatment facilities in place, despite our
clear commitment to major improvements to London’s sewage
collection treatment
systems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-12T17:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
currently in contact with the Commission regarding the measures
considered necessary to comply with the terms of the court judgment.
The court accepted that the Thames tideway tunnel represents a solution
to the problem of the collection system in London. The implication,
therefore, is that the tunnel represents a means to come into
compliance with the judgment. The urgency of the project is increased
by the need to comply with this

project is large, complex and high-risk. It requires engineering and
construction skills that have been rarely deployed by UK water and
sewerage undertakers, certainly in recent years. We consider projects
such as these to be better suited for delivery under a separate and

turn to the noble Lord’s questions. He suggested that Ofwat
should be able to manage the finances of a Thames Water and a Thames
tideway tunnel combined. I think the point here is that the risk
profiles of a standard water company business on the one hand and of a
tunnel construction project such as this on the other are significantly
different. Pricing against both is, therefore, different. We feel that
the tunnel is better priced as to risk in the market as it

noble Lord raised the recent comments of the Ofwat chairman. Like the
noble Lord, we agree with Mr Cox that there must be full transparency
in the finances of all water and sewerage companies so that Ofwat can
do its job and customers can obtain any benefits resulting from cost
savings. The specified infrastructure project regulations would enhance
such transparency. They enable water or sewerage companies to tender
competitively—as I said earlier, Ofwat-regulated infrastructure
providers that finance and deliver large or complex infrastructure
projects. This IP tendering process provides an objective means of
testing whether 
<?notus-xml column=388?>the financing costs of such projects are appropriate and reasonable.

noble Lord asked, effectively, why are the Government not making sure
that Thames Water pays all the tax that it should? Thames Water
Utilities Limited does pay its tax. All UK companies are allowed to
claim capital allowances when they spend on capital investment
programmes. That, I feel sure, was the same under the previous
Government. Tax relief is allowable against the capital expenditure
incurred, which reduces the tax payable, with the aim of encouraging
investment by companies. Water and sewerage companies have significant
capital programmes in comparison with their revenues. They therefore
benefit from tax allowances proportionately more than other

responsible for setting its own remuneration policy which is approved
by its shareholders in the normal way. Ofwat’s regulatory remit
is to ensure that customers get a fair deal with good service at a fair
price. Ofwat has ensured that water companies, including Thames Water,
have kept price rises in line with inflation. Fair and stable returns
for the water companies have enabled £108 billion of investment

consumer rights to minimum quality for goods and services, which are

the draft Bill reduces regulatory burdens for business, with the aim of
making markets work better. For example, businesses should have fewer
and less costly disputes with customers, because rights are clearer.
Disruption caused by unplanned enforcement officers’ visits
should be reduced by the proposed requirement to give reasonable notice

consultation, the Government today publishes their response. The vast
majority of the responses to the consultation were in favour, including
individual credit unions, trade bodies, and consumer groups. The
Government will therefore introduce legislation in the autumn to
increase the interest rate that credit unions can charge from 2% to 3%
per calendar month.</hs_para>

rate of interest to increase will enable credit unions to become more
stable over the long term, and reduce the losses that they currently
make on small, short-term loans. This means that low income consumers
will have greater access to reliable, affordable credit. Even with a 1%
increase in the monthly rate of interest, credit union loans will still
be substantially cheaper than the alternatives for many consumers with
no mainstream options. It is important to note that this increase in
the interest rate is permissive; 
<?notus-xml column=137?>it does not require credit unions to increase the interest rate they
charge but simply permits them to do so if they judge that the benefits
outweigh the costs.</hs_para>

strongly embedded in their local communities and are committed to
assisting those on low incomes. Research shows that credit unions often
appeal to low income consumers as bodies which are local, accessible
and convenient, and which are community based. Giving credit unions
more flexibility in their lending will enable them to recruit new
members, and further establish their role in helping the financially
excluded.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061264000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612-wms0001.htm#13061264000022">I

concluded that there is scope for restructuring DPTAC to ensure it is a
more efficient and effective body. I am satisfied that the savings
identified from such reforms would exceed earlier expectations. My

both intensive and extensive systems. The FAWC membership consists of a

even when they are supplied to a business. Some small businesses
operating below these de minimis limits may, therefore, not be liable
to the CCL. For example, a business consuming less than 1,000 kilowatt
hours of metered electricity per month at its premises will not need to
pay CCL on its electricity. There are also de minimis limits for other
taxable commodities under the

contribution to the successful international effort to curb piracy
in the Indian Ocean. The EU’s
Operation Atalanta Headquarters is based at Northwood, London. Its
operational commander is British and the UK has provided naval assets
to the force. The UK also provides the 1 star Commander and a ship to
the US led Combined Maritime Force, which conducts counter piracy
operations as part of its maritime security role. Additionally the
Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary have provided assets to
NATO’s Operation Ocean Shield. Piracy in the Indian Ocean has
reduced dramatically in the past 12 months, and no vessel has been
hijacked and taken to the Somali Coast since May
2012.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13061266000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130612w0001.htm#13061266000155">Profumo

ultimately decides on the line of route for HS2 and, in accordance with
