Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr George Osborne):</Member></B><B>
</B>This coalition came into office with a commitment to address with
firmness and resolve one of the biggest economic crises of the post-war
era. The action we have taken, together with the British people, has
brought the deficit down by a third, helped a record number of people
into work, and taken our economy back from the brink of bankruptcy; and
it allows us to say that while recovery from such a deep recession can
never be straightforward, Britain is moving out of intensive care, and
from rescue to recovery.</hs_Para>

we announce the latest action to secure the recovery. We act on behalf
of every taxpayer and every future taxpayer who wants high-quality
public services at a price our country can afford. We act on behalf of
everyone who knows that Britain has got to live within its means. We
have applied three principles to the spending round I will set out
today: reform, to get more from every pound we spend; growth, to give
Britain the education, enterprise and economic infrastructure it needs
to win the global race; and fairness, making sure we are all in it
together by ensuring those with the broadest shoulders bear the largest
burden and making sure the unfairness of the something-for-nothing
culture in our welfare system is
changed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0001.htm#13062665000189"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T12:35:23"></hs_TimeCode>We
have always understood that the greatest unfairness was loading debts
on to our children that our generation did not have the courage to
tackle ourselves. We have always believed, against much opposition,
that it is possible to get better public services at lower
cost—that you can cut bureaucracy and boost enterprise by taking
burdens off the back of business. In the face of all the evidence, the
opposition to these ideas has collapsed into incoherence. We have
always believed that the deficit mattered—that we needed to take
tough decisions to deal with our debts—and the opposition to
that has collapsed into incoherence too. Today I announce the next
stage of our economic plan to turn Britain around.</hs_Para>

me start with the overall picture on spending. In their last year in
office, the previous Government were borrowing £1 in every
£4 that they spent. It was a record for a British
Government in peacetime and a calamitous risk with our economic
stability. As the note we saw again this week from their outgoing Chief
Secretary put
it,</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13062665000861" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0001.htm#13062665000861">“I’m

we acted immediately. Three years ago, we set out plans to make savings
and to reduce our borrowing. Instead of the £157 billion the
last Government were borrowing, this year we are set to borrow
£108 billion pounds: that is £49 billion less in
borrowing. That is virtually the entire education budget.</hs_Para>

we have made real progress, putting right what went so badly wrong. But
while we have been acting, the challenges from abroad have grown: a
eurozone in crisis, rising oil prices, and the damage from our own
banking crisis worse than anyone feared. The truth is that we have to
deal with the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be, so this
country has to continue to make savings. I can report to the House that
the biggest single saving we have made in government is the
£6 billion a year less we are paying to service our
debts than the 
<?notus-xml column=304?>previous Government budgeted for. Bear that number in mind when you hear
the Opposition complaining about
cuts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0001.htm#13062665000193">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T12:37:58"></hs_TimeCode>
deficit has come down by a third, yet at over 7% it remains
far too high, so we must continue to take action—not just
because it is wrong to go on adding debts to our children’s
shoulders, but because we know from the global turbulence of the last
few years that the economic risks are real and the recovery has to be
sustained. If we abandoned our deficit plan, Britain would be back in
intensive care. So the figures today show that until 2017-18, total
managed expenditure—in other words, the total amount of
Government spending—will continue to fall in real terms at the
same average rate as it is falling today.</hs_Para>

Cutting money that the previous Government were spending on marketing

and public sector pay rises will be limited to an average of up to 1%

not only get a pay rise every year, but automatically move up a pay
grade every single year, regardless of performance. Some public sector
employees see annual pay rises of 7%. Progression pay can at best be
described as antiquated; at worst, it is deeply unfair to other parts
of the public sector that do not get it and to the private sector that
has to pay for it. So we will end automatic progression pay in the
civil service by 2015-16,

pay awards down and ending automatic progression pay means that, for
every pound we have to save in central administration, we can better
limit job losses. I do not want to disguise from the House that there
will be further reductions in the number of people working in the
public sector. The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that
the total number of people working for the Government will fall by a
further 144,000 by 2015-16. I know that for those who are affected that

a million posts in the public sector were forecast to have to go. That
is indeed what has happened, and we are saving £2 billion a
year, with a civil service now smaller than at any time since the war.
I also said three years ago that I was confident that job creation in
the private sector would more than make up for the losses. That
prediction created more controversy than almost anything else at the
time, including with the Opposition. The shadow Chancellor called it
“a complete fantasy”. Instead, every job lost in the
public sector has been offset by three new jobs in the private sector.
In the last year, five new jobs have been created for every job cut in
the public sector. The central argument of those who fought against our
plan is completely demolished by the ingenuity, enterprise and ambition
of Britain’s businesses. I pay tribute to the hard-working
people of this country who proved their pessimism

action, including the National Citizen Service. Ninety thousand places

government has already taken difficult decisions to reduce staff

Cockell for all he has done in showing how this can be achieved. We

decimate local services. Instead, public satisfaction with local
council services has gone up under this Government. That is because,
with our reforms, communities have more control over their own destiny.
That is because we have devolved power and responsibility to manage
budgets locally. That is because we have let councils
benefit from the tax receipts that come when the local economy grows.

set out tomorrow. Our philosophy is simple: trust people to make their
own decisions and they will usually make better decisions. But in
return for those freedoms, we have to ask local government for the kind
of sacrifices central Government are making. The local government
resource budget will be reduced by 10% in 2015-16, but when all the

analysis shows that the top fifth of the population lose the most after
this spending round, and the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies

the first in our history to meet our pledge and meet it not only this
year, but next year and the year after that. Of course, overseas
development is about more than just the Department for International
Development budget, and we comply with internationally policed rules.
The DFID budget is, however, the lion’s share, and it will be
set at £11.1 billion in 2015-16. Even in these tough times, the

includes our commitment to the national health service—an
institution that is the very embodiment of fairness in our society. The

billion—and capital spending will rise to £4.7 billion.
New medical treatments and an ageing population mean that the demand
for NHS services is rising, so we have not spared in also demanding
reform and value for money in this service. This will not 
<?notus-xml column=313?>insulate the health service from tough choices; there are already 7,000
fewer managers, and the NHS will continue to make efficiency savings.
Those savings will, however, enable new investment in mental health and
funding for new treatments for cancers such as prostate and breast
cancer. Let me respond directly to the breast cancer research campaign
in which so many have taken part. We will continue to back the charity

these are the three principles that guide the spending round: reform,

overall costs of the benefits bill. We have already capped the benefits
of individuals, and now we cap the system as a whole. Under the system
we inherited, welfare spending was put into a category called annually
managed expenditure, but the problem was that it was not managed at
all. The cost of welfare went up by a staggering 50%—even before
the crash. Our welfare cap will stop that happening again. The cap will
be set each year at the Budget for four years. It will apply from April
2015 and will reflect forecast inflation, but it will be set in cash
terms. In future, when a Government look to breach the cap because they
are failing to control welfare, the Office for Budget Responsibility
will issue a public warning. The Government will then be forced to take
action to cut welfare costs or publicly to breach the cap and explain
it to
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0001.htm#13062665000251">We

state pension in the welfare cap. That would mean that a future
Government could offset a rise in working age benefits by cutting the
pensions of older people. That penalises those who have worked hard all
their lives. Cutting pensions to pay for working age benefits is a
choice this Government are certainly not prepared to make. It is

of paying the winter fuel payments made to those who live abroad from
rising in a way that no one ever intended. EU law now says that people
living in the European economic area can claim winter fuel payments
from us, even if they did not get them before they left the UK. Paying

lending is down month on month on month. He made the number one test of
his economic credibility keeping the triple A credit rating, but on his
watch we have been downgraded not once but twice. He promised that
living standards would rise, but they are falling year on year on year.
He said “We’re all in this together”, but then he

2015, two years ahead, the Chancellor should be taking bold action now
to boost growth this year and next. Investment would get our economy
growing and bring in the additional tax revenues that would mean that
our police, armed forces and public services would not face such deep
cuts in 2015. Why did the Chancellor not listen to the IMF, and provide
£10 billion in infrastructure investment this year?
Given that house building is at its lowest level since the 1920s, why
is he not building 400,000 more affordable homes this year and next? If
the Chancellor continues with his failing economic plan, it will be for

of the 4,000 we have lost so far? Will it mean fewer Sure Start

most deprived local authorities are losing six times the spending per
head of the 10 least deprived areas?

there would be a return to mass unemployment. We have set out welfare
plans that help people get back into work. Does he support those or
not? That is the question the public will ask of him. He said in
October 2010 that we were taking a huge risk with crime. Crime is down
10% or more. He said in July that year that the university reforms
would shut out those from disadvantaged backgrounds from university,
but actually a record proportion of pupils from disadvantaged
backgrounds applied to go to university. He said, in his own words,
that the cuts to the border agency would mean we would be unable to
enforce our immigration policy. That was wrong, too. Every previous
prediction he has made, including the prediction that there would be no
more boom and bust, has proved to be completely wrong, so why would

make savings, but because of the application of the Barnett formula the
savings in Scotland are 2%. I am not saying that will be easy, but it
is not as difficult as the tasks that some English Departments face. We
are also providing more borrowing powers for the Scottish Parliament to
make its own decisions. We believe that is the right
approach—devolution, with Scotland not only having the benefit
of being in the United Kingdom and able to make its own decisions about
the investments it makes, but benefiting from the very low interest
rates that our credible fiscal policy delivers for all parts of the
Union. It is pretty clear that if Scotland were independent, borrowing
would be more expensive for the Scottish

better ports, and better rail links too—an ambitious programme

growing economy, a growing population and growing demand for transport,
which have seen rail travel double in a decade, mean that we must act.
HS2 will be the first new main rail line north of London for 120 years,
linking at least eight of our 10 largest cities, and improving services

our meeting that it is difficult for Members from north Staffordshire
to support HS2 as it stands because it may very well, on the current
modelling, reduce the number of direct trains from Stoke-on-Trent from
31 a day to just three a day. This knock-on issue is relevant to people
from Stockport all the way down to Coventry, as he will see from the

subsidy in the rail industry. However, we have to think about people
being able to get to work and what that subsidy supports. Sometimes the

for longer than I had intended to take for my whole speech. This is not
about a choice between upgrading the existing railway and building a
new one. Upgrades will not provide the extra capacity we need. The
choice is between a new high-speed line and a new conventional railway.
The significant additional benefits make high-speed rail the right
answer. Of course, big infrastructure projects are always
controversial. As I often say, the easiest thing in the world for the
Government to do would be not to build HS2 or to commit to it, but the
costs of doing so would be

that it will underpin 400,000 jobs, 70% of them outside London. It
would be a cost in prosperity. Some estimates suggest that HS2 will add
over £4 billion to the economy even before it is open. The line
is estimated to provide around £50 billion in
economic benefits once it is up and running. If we do not go ahead with
HS2, there will also be a cost in lost opportunities for the towns and
cities in the midlands and the north. I am not prepared to put up with
a situation in which someone can get to Brussels on a high-speed train
line, but not to Birmingham; to Strasbourg, but not to Sheffield; or to

reckoned to be 2.5. I also point out that the BCR tells us some things,
but not everything. For instance, the BCR on the Jubilee line was a lot
lower than that for High Speed 2. If the Jubilee line had not been
developed, a lot of the development in Canary Wharf would never have
taken place. The line brought a huge amount of investment into the area

the Member for 
<?notus-xml column=346?>North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen). We are therefore budgeting
£7.5 billion for HS2 rolling stock. To put that in perspective,
the current inter-city express programme to replace trains on the east

infrastructure is an investment in economic growth. We are investing
£14.5 billion to build Crossrail, while £11 billion has
been invested in new infrastructure at Heathrow since 2003. Over the
period of construction, the cost of HS2 will be less than 0.15% of
GDP—I repeat, less than 0.15% of GDP. This is an investment that
the country can sustain and needs. That is why tomorrow the Chief

Second Reading speech, I do not dismiss those with objections as
irrelevant. We do indeed need to design HS2 carefully, consult properly
and compensate fairly. I hope that I can reassure people about why it
is right to go ahead. Some have concerns about the impact of HS2 on the
landscape. While I cannot deny that a project of this scale will have
an effect, I believe that the positive experience of our first
high-speed line in Kent shows that the consequences can be managed
without wrecking the countryside. For instance, while not a single mile
of the M1 is in-tunnel, about 40 miles of HS2 will be in-tunnel. Of the
12.4 miles that crosses the Chilterns area of outstanding
natural beauty, 5.8 miles will be in-tunnel and 3.5 miles will be in
deep cuttings. No part of phase 2 of the route crosses any national
parks or areas of outstanding natural beauty.</hs_Para>

is also important to ensure that proper compensation is made to those
affected by HS2. That is why we have introduced the exceptional
hardship scheme although there was no statutory requirement to do so.
We believe that home owners already affected with a pressing need to
move should have recourse to compensation, but without the authority of
Parliament to incur expenditure to continue with this compensation, I
would need to consider carefully what other mechanisms, if any, we
could use. Very soon, we will start a new consultation on

come, and yet the cost would still be great, as would the disruption to
passengers and freight. It would mean that we had learned nothing from
the experience of carrying out a major upgrade of the west coast main

major transport decisions—for example, how we connect the new

judging by the number of Members present—I want to make two
particular points to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. On
the current consultation—I use that term loosely—by HS2
Ltd on the draft environmental statement, whatever the failings of the
process, at the moment one thing is clear: the area of outstanding
natural beauty, which belongs to everybody in this country, is going to
be irreversibly damaged. My first request to the Secretary of State is
that if this project does go ahead, can we have the best possible
mitigation in the Chilterns in order to protect our precious, and
highly endangered, environment to 
<?notus-xml column=360?>the utmost level? A fully bored tunnel under the whole of the AONB would
offer that protection, and I urge the Secretary of State to adopt that
option.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000624" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0002.htm#13062665000624">My
second request has I think been answered partly, because my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State accepted in his opening speech that he
will look more seriously at, and perhaps even deliver, the property
bond. The compensation scheme has been totally inadequate to date, and
the engagement of officials and Ministers often the dialogue of the
deaf, frankly. The Bill does not include specific undertakings on
compensation that would fulfil the Prime Minister’s assurance to
me that it would be timely and generous to those people adversely
affected. So I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
will look at the property bond put forward by my constituent, Hilary
Wharf, who is to be commended for her work in this area, and that the
compensation system introduced is rapid, fair and does not make my
constituents feel that the Government are wriggling to avoid paying
them a proper price for their
properties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000625" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0002.htm#13062665000625">As
you know, Mr Speaker, there are several Members of Parliament whose
constituencies are affected by HS2 who are unable to speak today, so I
want to say a few words on behalf of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr Lidington), who has worked
tirelessly to put forward the interests of his constituents. He asked
me to point out today that places such as Wendover Dean and the
Hawkslade and Walton Court areas of Aylesbury are among the worst
affected of any along the phase 1 route. He also asked me to highlight
the need for better mitigation—a request that fits in with my
own request for a fully bored tunnel. I know that you, Mr Speaker, have
regularly communicated your constituents’ overwhelming
opposition to this project and, like me, have received thousands of
letters and have similar experiences of the failure of the exceptional
hardship fund to offer adequate compensation to constituents. Likewise,
my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr

need a paving Bill? There was no paving Bill for the channel tunnel
rail link, Crossrail or the Olympics. We could continue to spend money
as we have already, without this Bill. Once it is passed, as it
undoubtedly will be, the Government can claim that HS2 is backed by the
will of Parliament. Frankly, all colleagues should be concerned about
proceeding with this project. The Bill is a blank cheque, handed over
before Parliament is in full possession of the facts, and to a
Department that is having a hard job convincing people that the project
is fit for purpose. On that basis, and because this is the first time
we have even had a vote on HS2, it is with a very heavy heart that I
say I cannot support the Government. I hope that colleagues in the
House today will support my reasoned amendment and vote against the
Bill. At this stage, I have no intention of calling votes on any other
part of the proceedings, but I will on the amendment and on Second

Louise Ellman</B> (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am
pleased to support this legislation today, which is a significant step
in securing High Speed 2. It is important to recognise that HS2 is
about having a vision for the 
<?notus-xml column=361?>future. It is about making a much-needed step change in capacity on our
railways. It is about meeting growing demand for rail, addressing
congestion on our roads and motorways, and connecting major cities not
just across this country and the UK, but potentially across Europe as
well. It has the potential to rebalance our economy.</hs_Para>

is very important that progress on High Speed 2 does not go ahead in
isolation from considering the importance of continuing to invest in
the existing classic line. Existing improvements such as the northern
hub and the electrification programmes must continue and be stepped up.
Assurance must be given that there will be proper access to high-speed
rail, and that means that more attention needs to be given to the
siting of the stations and connections to them. It is important that no
local services be reduced as a consequence of building the high-speed
rail line, and it is extremely important that the potential of
developing the freed existing lines for both freight and passengers be
addressed. That means that more work needs to take place, perhaps
through local authorities and local enterprise partnerships working
together, to make sure that proper plans are worked out so that the
existing lines freed when high-speed rail comes to fruition will be
able to be used to the maximum for freight and for
passengers.</hs_Para>

is also crucial that the potential for economic development and
rebalancing the economy is achieved. That means that we must not make
any assumptions that simply building a high-speed line will
automatically bring those economic benefits. Work has to be done, again
by the LEPs, with the local authorities and with Government support, to
develop economic strategies, regionally as well as nationally, to
support business in taking advantage of those opportunities. I was very
interested to read the results of studies instigated by local
authorities. The Core Cities study put forward by major cities in our
country identified about 400,000 new jobs that would come as a result
of high-speed rail, and Centro’s report, looking specifically at
the west midlands area, identified about 22,000 jobs that would come. I
emphasise that none of those jobs will come automatically; we need to
give attention to economic strategies and support for business to make
sure that those opportunities come to fruition.</hs_Para>

is not simply between London and Birmingham, and that the rail scheme
progresses to Leeds, Manchester and beyond. The time scale is a very

which is an important and difficult issue. Hon. Members have also
raised issues in the House relating to access to Stoke-on-Trent. The
proposals for Liverpool are not good enough and need improvement.
Important environmental issues need addressing, and the question of
compensation has been raised in the House this afternoon. All those
issues are vital and must be addressed in a reasonable way. It is
important for them to be resolved successfully because that will help

solve the problem of competing demands for use on the existing line

those who voice concern about visual intrusion on areas of outstanding
natural beauty, I simply make the point that railway infrastructure
need not be ugly—it need not be concrete blocks. Look at some of
the fantastic pieces of railway engineering and architecture we have:
the Forth bridge, the Glenfinnan viaduct, Brunel’s bridges and
tunnels—they have enhanced the landscape. I urge my right hon.
Friend the Minister of State to make HS2 into an opportunity to
showcase the 
<?notus-xml column=364?>best of British design and engineering, with bridges, viaducts and other
infrastructure that show off and augment our
landscape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:10:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000649" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000649">In
the couple of minutes remaining, I will highlight five specific
concerns and make some suggestions. The first is about the rolling
stock for the line and making sure it is compatible with the classic
network, particularly on the Anglo-Scottish services. At present, we
have tilting trains that allow conventional lines to be used at high
speed, but if high-speed trains cannot tilt, journey times on the
classic network will be lengthened to an extent that might offset the
time gains on the high-speed line. I urge the Minister to consider
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:10:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:11:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000650" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000650">The
second concern, justifiably felt by people in Buckinghamshire, is that
the line goes straight through the county with no stop. The high-speed
line will intersect with the new east-west line in Buckinghamshire. I
ask that, when the scheme is considered in full—the Y-network
and connection to the channel tunnel—the case will be reassessed
for an intermediate stop at Claydon junction. I would suggest calling
it “Milton Keynes Parkway”, but others may have different
ideas. That would enable people in the area to access the lines, which
I believe would augment the business
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000651" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000651">Only
seconds remain, so I will very quickly highlight the point, which has
already been well made, about properly connecting airports, High Speed
1 and the channel tunnel. I do not think the plans are optimal.
Finally, I urge my right hon. Friend to look at capacity at Euston,
where the tube network is already pretty crowded. I believe we need to
consider Crossrail 2, so I was delighted when the Chancellor floated
that possibility in his statement earlier today.

backtracking on all three. For a start, as has been pointed out,
£17 billion will not provide a working railway,

£2 billion—it will be a train-free zone. Nor does it
include the cost of the works at Euston needed to allow the already
overcrowded tube and local roads to cope with additional passengers and
traffic—that is probably another £2 billion.
VAT at 20% will come to about £3 billion. The original

at least rail lines connecting London, Birmingham, the east midlands,
Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester, and which connect with the existing
rail network. The “at least” phrase means that the HS2
expenditure being approved under the Bill is not limited to the cities

south-east far more attractive. This is vital if we are to help
rebalance the UK economy and increase jobs and growth. HS2 will

steered clear of. She had the good sense to realise that it is not
possible to privatise a railway system and divorce the operating
companies from the infrastructure. As we all know, privatisation has
brought no benefit whatsoever for the consumer. The subsidies now paid

Stringer</B> (Blackley and Broughton) (Lab):</Member> I will not detain
the House long. I speak as the joint chair of the all-party
parliamentary group for high-speed rail. I am therefore highly
supportive of High Speed 2. I will make four simple
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:40:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000706" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000706">First,
this country has a shocking and disgraceful record on infrastructure,
under Governments of all political persuasions. The costs of not
keeping our infrastructure up to date are much greater than the costs
of High Speed 2. We have built one new runway since the second world
war, we have the lowest motorway density in what used to be called
western Europe, the Dibden port proposal was turned down, we have only
a few kilometres of high-speed rail between the south coast and London,
and we have a much smaller rail system than we had 40 or 50 years ago.
Our competitors are investing in all those areas of infrastructure, to
our economic
disbenefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000707" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000707">Secondly,
the justification for High Speed 2 is not the speed, as has been said,
but the capacity. Having high-speed rail will cost only 10% more than
the alternative of building a brand new route and will bring the speed
benefits as well as the extra capacity. The alternatives that are put
forward by the opponents of High Speed 2 would provide only half the
benefit, while costing a great amount of time, money and disruption, as
we learned from the west coast main line build. If people are worried
about the projections that are used to justify the investment in High
Speed 2, they should consider the fact that train passenger numbers are
already at the level projected for
2021<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:42:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000708" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000708">On
the economic benefits, I am enormously sceptical of almost all economic
models. There may be disbenefit to some towns and cities. The Transport
Committee 
<?notus-xml column=372?>found that some towns in Europe that were joined to the TGV or other
high-speed routes had benefited enormously, whereas others had
disbenefited<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:43:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000709" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000709"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Garnier" PimsId="5553" UID="13062665001360" xid="1161" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665001360">Mark
Garnier:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making a convincing
argument in favour of HS2. He raises the important point that one of
the perceived benefits is that economic activity will be drawn up the
track. However, there is a risk that economic activity will actually be
drawn down the track, away from the regions to
London. Does he agree that, to mitigate that risk, it is important that
we look to build a hub airport up the track as part of the
infrastructure development of this country? A hub airport in Birmingham
would be a good alternative to what is being suggested at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:44:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000710" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000710"><B><Member ContinuationText="Graham Stringer" PimsId="4167" UID="13062665001361" xid="572" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665001361">Graham

the benefits and disbenefits, it is up to the people who run our towns

am sure that some of the arguments made against HS2 were made when

captures the likely benefits, but what we do know, from looking around
the world, is that countries that invest in their transport
infrastructure almost always do better economically. We should

that a high-speed system that will eventually join Edinburgh and
Glasgow, through Manchester and Leeds, to Birmingham and London will be
of enormous benefit to the country. I do not believe it is a perfect
system and I do not believe it is being constructed in the best way,
but it has all-party support and it can be improved. I personally
believe that we should be building north to south, as well as south to
north. I believe, as my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State
said, that we should be building a link directly through to High Speed
1. However, I do not believe that any of those problems are sufficient
to stop us investing in infrastructure that will help the whole of the

last point comes from the experience of being responsible for building
the second runway at Manchester airport. Paying compensation on the
basis of free market value at the time is an extremely costly way of
building infrastructure. Giving free market value plus 10%, 20% or
30%—whatever is appropriate—will speed up the process and
save money. I hope the Government will give consideration to that, and
to serious mitigation. If people take legal action because they think
they are being treated unfairly, and if there is blight for a long
time, that will hinder the project. It is estimated that delays in
tunnelling on some high-speed routes have cost as much as the actual
tunnelling. I therefore hope that on compensation the Government will
not be short-sighted. I hope they will deal with the problems outlined
by

Vickers:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point, but similar
points could be made about every item of Government expenditure.
Ultimately, the increased capacity will benefit the more provincial
towns and peripheral areas of our country. The network is operating to
capacity. We heard from the Secretary of State that the west coast main
line would be at capacity in the early 2020s, and similarly the east
coast main line, which has an impact on my constituency, will soon be
full.</hs_Para>

have talked about blight, but speed is essential. Yes, there can be
blight on individual properties and so on, but if that is to be the
case, the sooner we get a decision on routes, compensation and so on,
the better. Speed is also essential for the economy. We have heard,
quite understandably, that connectivity is important to the development
of our towns and cities, and that has been proved by countless reports
over time. If Hudson and the other Victorian rail moguls had had to
operate to timetables as stretched as that for HS2, I doubt whether the
network would have developed to anything like the extent it did and
from which this country benefited in the late-19th and 20th
centuries.</hs_Para>

am therefore very pleased that Sheffield is on the route, and that
there will be a station there. That has been welcomed by all parties in
the city and by those in  
<?notus-xml column=375?>the public and private sectors. There is a difference of opinion on
where the Sheffield station should be located. I understand the
argument for having a loop into the city centre, but I equally accept
that a station at Meadowhall in my constituency could have incredible
benefits for the wider city region, provided the need for connectivity
to the region is properly recognised. We do not want to hear the

get no further investment in our transport infrastructure, and that

to an ex-steelworks and to the motorway, and many people would not
choose to live there, but it is a friendly road where people know their
neighbours and family members who live nearby. They are worried about
moving, and they know that they will probably not be able to buy
another house in the local area with the compensation they will get.
They ask why they should be penalised and forced to move away from the
community that they know. Something more than the market value of their
homes would help those people. It would not have to be a percentage
increase on the market value; a lump sum in excess of the market value
would particularly help people in low-value properties who do not want

we are being asked to vote for today is the signing of a blank cheque
for HS2 Ltd for a railway that is, in my opinion, a solution looking
for a problem. This is a scheme with vast financial costs for the
taxpayer and a high human cost for those unfortunate enough to live or
to have their business on or near the proposed route. The financial
costs were initially estimated by the Government this morning as
£33 billion, but stand at over £42 billion this
afternoon, with a further £7.5 billion for rolling
stock. That is an enormous commitment at a time of austerity for a
project that will not be ready until 2033 and is of questionable
economic

certain that today’s £10 billion of additional budget
will prove to be the last? When it comes to keeping to budget,
Government rail projects certainly have a terrible record. The west
coast main line upgrade, which was initially estimated to cost
£1.5 billion, ended up costing £9.9 billion.
The Thameslink upgrade was estimated to cost £650 million in
1996, but the end costs will be nearer £6 billion on completion.
We could be looking at a project with a final bill of many tens of
billions more than the Government’s initial estimate or even
today’s estimate.

For weekend and leisure travel, for instance,

gaining any of the benefits.” If I represented a major town, I

taxpayers? HS2 does mean little curvature of the line. My hon. Friend
the Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart) said that a
high-speed track is not much more expensive than a regular train track.
That is not what HS2 engineers have told me. They said that it is very
engineering-intensive. Because it has to go in a straight line, because
there are lots of flood plains, hills and other inconveniences, and
because of the speed of the trains, the line has to go through, under

high-speed rail has an exponentially higher carbon footprint, so in

if, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton South (Mr Binley)
said, this is about capacity, why not go slightly slower but along an
existing travel corridor, so that costs and the impact can be reduced?
Fourthly, is the project going to deliver soon enough? We will have no
use of it until 2026, yet people say all the time that rail capacity is
needed now. Fifthly, does it create the maximum number of jobs? Would
another, less engineering-intensive project along an easier route,
which we could easily find if speed were not the only goal, generate
more jobs? Finally, what about both ends? Does it really make sense to
decide where the traveller ends up before we have decided on our

all that, I note the commitment of the Government and the Opposition,
who are determined to see this project built. Although I remain
optimistic that during the Bill’s progress substantial changes

I urge the Government to ensure that HS2 is much more transparent and
that they engage with communities much better than they currently are.
Communities’ ideas on mitigation must be given full and proper
consideration. The Department for Transport must prioritise the
consultation on a full compensation scheme as a matter of urgency. It
is shocking that a judicial review had to determine that the original
consultation was unfair and in fact unlawful. The exceptional hardship
scheme, to my constituents’ bitter experience, has been nothing
short of a disaster. Residents up and down the proposed line of route

homes, unable to move either home or business. I strongly urge the

statutory requirement, the Government will agree to a property bond,
and that the Secretary of State will meet with the Council of Mortgage
Lenders and the National Association of Estate Agents, among others, in
order properly to explore the options for a property bond. If banks
will not give mortgages on properties because they are blighted by HS2,

I really regret the position that many Members have been placed in by

compensation scheme to be put in place for those affected. That
makes me very schizophrenic, and it places all
Members who have strong feelings about this project in a
difficult position. I do not want to vote in favour of HS2 but I also
do not want to do anything that delays my constituents’
receiving the compensation they deserve. As this is the first
opportunity in the Chamber to vote on the principle of HS2, I shall,
with a heavy heart, have to vote for the reasoned amendment and against

be smaller as a result. The planned Old Oak interchange on its own will
not enable enough HS2 travellers to avoid the Euston terminus; we need
an enhanced role for Stratford in the east to cater for a similar

Friend is that Stratford has an international station, called the

With a twin-track link to Stratford from Camden town, and with the
proposals for Old Oak, the number of platforms at Euston would reduce
from 12 to six or fewer. Recent research shows that there would be
almost as much demand for trips to east London, docklands, Essex, East
Anglia and Kent from HS2 travellers as for trips to central London.
Using Stratford helps to cater for those needs. Perhaps the Minister
would like to talk to the leader of his local county council, who,
along with others, funded this research. His constituents will also, I
am sure, be interested in the better travel options that will be
available to them if this money is spent wisely. The interconnectivity
of Stratford is already good, unlike—where was it? The two
stations at Stratford serve 100 million passengers a year and it is the
UK’s rail hub with the sixth highest use. It has two tube lines,
regional rail services to Kent, Essex and East Anglia, and the
docklands light railway, and it is strategically positioned for Canary
Wharf, London City airport, and the Excel exhibition centre. Of course,
it will have Crossrail.</hs_Para>

existing railways, which have stood us and continue to stand us in good

should follow, rather than shy away from. Having said that, I am
concerned about pricing. Completion is a long way off, and there is a
danger of this becoming a rich man’s railway. Cost control is an

that argument goes out the window. I would only say that any business

my good constituents, but that is out of the window too. I shall merely
say that we are driving ahead with a project called Northampton Alive.
We are expected to build 56,000 houses to help ease the problems of the

Freight is a major player in the whole of our rail network. It has
grown sizeably, to the point where it is now delivering 90
million tonnes of goods each year. That rate is growing by more than
10% a year. We cannot accommodate that growth on the west coast main
line. We need another line to enhance the corridor. That is why
high-speed rail is so important, why it impacts upon the national
interest, and why it is massively important to Britain’s
prosperity and to the future well-being of my children and
grandchildren<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000819" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000819">Do
not forget the freight issue. It is vital to the debate. The second
issue that is vital is connectivity, as I indicated earlier. If we do
not have a high-speed rail link to Europe and beyond, we will miss out
massively. I am sorry if

<?notus-xml column=388?>In the long-term future we will have high-speed rail links to south-east
Asia and to the middle east, provided people there can settle down and
settle their differences. That future is what we are thinking about

what are my conclusions? High Speed 2 is vital to the nation’s
future economic well-being. It will improve rail connections between
economically important parts of our country and with our markets in
Europe and beyond. It will stop heavy lorries from Prague, Warsaw and
Bratislava messing up our road network. I want to see a more effective
rail network and High Speed 2 is a vital part of that. I pray that this

London and Birmingham, and also would go to a very sensible terminus at
Paddington, which is of course on Crossrail. At the Birmingham end,
Snow Hill is in the town centre. The station for HS2 will be away from
the town centre, so much of the advantage of speed will be lost in
extra transport from that station into the town centre, but Snow Hill

1990 British Rail, as it was in those days, freed up the line and ran a
train from London to Edinburgh with a two-minute stop at Newcastle. For
most of the journey it was a 140 mph operation. The journey took three
and a half hours—two and a half hours to Newcastle, three and a
half hours to Edinburgh—which was eight minutes faster than the
time advertised for HS2 now, so it can be done. We need to upgrade the
route on the east coast main line, which means a double viaduct at
Welwyn, so that there are four tracks at Welwyn instead of two; an
east-west flyover at Peterborough; and a flyover for the Lincoln route
at Newark.</hs_Para>

that will free up the line for a very fast, mostly 140 mph,
operation on the east coast main line, and we can get that journey to
Edinburgh eight minutes faster than HS2. It also means that we could
get a one and a half hour operation from King’s Cross to Leeds,
using the east coast main line. There is even another route to get to
Sheffield via Retford from King’s Cross, providing additional
fast capacity—not high speed, but fast. Much of that route would
be 140 mph.</hs_Para>

are sensible alternatives. They would require a bit of upgrading, such
as the redevelopment of some stations, but we would be talking about
spending a couple of billion pounds, not £50 billion or more.
They would make life much easier for everyone and free up all that
extra spending for other routes. The whole railway system, being
Victorian, needs an enormous amount of work, including electrification
and track renewal, which is needed in many
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000827" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000827">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T17:49:08"></hs_TimeCode>
also think that we need a dedicated rail freight line, built on old
track beds and underused lines, running from the Thames right up to
Glasgow, linking all Britain’s main conurbations, and capable of
carrying lorries on trains. Some 80% of freight
goes by lorry, rather than container. They cannot get through tunnels
and bridges, so it would have to be on a new dedicated route capable of
taking that kind of traffic. That is what we need to do, and it would
cost a fraction of HS2. All those other operations, when added
together, would cost much less than HS2 and provide much more benefit.
If the cost-benefit analysis was done for that, and for the other
routes I have mentioned, I think we would see that it is much more
desirable in social, economic and financial
terms.</hs_Para>

Action Alliance, 250 mph trains use three times as much power as 125

existing classic rail, which uses much less fuel and carbon, to
high-speed trains. That means that the new line will have few, if any,

people use trains regularly. As the Transport Secretary has said, 10
million people travel annually on HS1, or about 30,000 people a day;
another, say, 1.5 million people travel on all the other trains. What

argument in favour of HS2 is that current trains are too full and the
project will provide the opportunity to increase capacity. I disagree.
If trains are currently too full, why not put the prices up?
The way to make that fair would be to say to
current regular commuters, “Yes, you can keep the current rate
but a new user of the trains should be required to pay a bit
more.” That would encourage further growth and investment in
towns and cities outside London and raise more money towards the costs
of running
trains.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062665000837" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062665000837">If

proposed Crewe stop in the second phase takes place, as I very much

a Scottish MP, my views on HS2 as it affects and, indeed, benefits
Scotland, are coloured by the area I represent. The announcement of
plans to extend the high-speed rail network north of Birmingham
is welcome 
<?notus-xml column=393?>news, but it is right that all parts of the country, including of course
Scotland, should benefit from such a significant expansion of the
country’s transport infrastructure. As it stands, the plan takes
high-speed rail only halfway from London to Scotland, so there is a
real necessity to extend the network further north to Edinburgh and
Glasgow. These better services would provide benefits to the Scottish
economy of about £3 billion, as businesses in the
cities would be able to operate more efficiently, increasing their
productivity while accessing new markets and labour pools. Firms
throughout the UK would be able to look to Scotland for business
opportunities that distance and congestion had previously made less
attractive. Tourism on both sides of the border would be boosted as the
UK was opened up to faster, more convenient travel. Scotland’s
strong engineering base might also benefit from the
employment opportunities that the planning and construction of High
Speed 2 will
provide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062694000016">Importantly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:00:04"></hs_TimeCode>

undoubtedly boost growth across all of its major conurbations. It would

Paris and
Brussels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062694000017">The
argument is reinforced by reports that estimate that the regional
economic benefits of high-speed rail for central Scotland
would be about £20 billion over a 60 year period,
which compares with £5.4 billion for the west midlands. Studies
reiterate that the most cost-effective option for a rail route between
London and Scotland is a new high-speed route that connects London,
Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Such a
network would be expected to deliver up to £50 billion of
business benefits alone. That would be felt greatly in Scotland and the
north of England, as well as in the
south<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:00:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062694000018">We

be many years before England and Scotland are connected in this way.
Public opinion demands that the high-speed network be extended north of

opportunities in Leeds. There is also a willing and able work force in

away from the idea of its being a Leeds to London link. The most
important benefit to Leeds—yes, we will be able to get to London
within an hour and 20 minutes—will be the Javelin trains, which
will service a wide area of the Leeds city region and will link up, if
I can get a tram-train system put in, with the Leeds-Bradford
International airport, which is vital to the economy of Yorkshire.
Thanks to lobbying by the airport and local MPs, there are now three
British Airways flights a day to Heathrow, which dock at terminal 5.
The Javelin trains will cover the wider area, so that people in south
Yorkshire and west Yorkshire will be able to get to Leeds-Bradford
airport in minimum time, get airside and get off in New York, San
Francisco, Australia or wherever they are going. HS2 will open that up.

Lefroy</B> (Stafford) (Con):</Member> Earlier this year, hundreds of my
constituents awoke to find that the value of their homes had been
substantially reduced and those who had plans to move discovered that
purchasers could no longer get mortgages. That remains the case. The
reason was the announcement of the preferred route for HS2—a
route that followed none of 
<?notus-xml column=396?>the previously published options nor an existing transport corridor.
Furthermore, the project will not see a shovel in the ground for 13
years and will only be completed in 20 years, meaning uncertainty and
disruption for a generation.

was also a route that, I have been told, can hardly be altered, because
it is designed to take ultra-high-speed trains travelling at up to 250
mph and hence must be straight. As a result, it goes through five
villages in my constituency and comes very close to others.</hs_Para>

increase capacity, rather than speed, so I cannot understand the

come now to the business case for HS2.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:12:29"></hs_TimeCode> has been a
lot of argument about whether it is valid. I am not an expert in these
matters, but there are several things that make me sceptical. The first
is the apparent lack of knowledge at HS2 about current demand. The
second is the surprising fact that HS2 is to be largely a leisure
railway rather than a business railway. Since leisure passengers are
much more sensitive to price 
<?notus-xml column=397?>than business passengers, especially premium business, I
wonder whether this price sensitivity has been fully incorporated into
the business case. The third reason is the large question mark over
whether this is the right way to help the midlands and the north to
develop. Just this week, plans were unveiled for a vast new commercial
development at Old Oak common in London at the proposed junction of
Cross Rail and HS2. I welcome that, but it underlines the concerns of
those who worry that HS2 will simply bring more development into
London, possibly at the expense of the midlands, the north and
Scotland.</hs_Para>

there is the business case for the west coast main line after HS2 comes
into service. The line will remain an essential part of our national
transport infrastructure, so it is essential that its post-2035
business case be at least as strong as that for HS2, but I have not had
that case from HS2, despite my asking for it. Given that HS2 is so
dependent on leisure traffic, I am concerned about what will be left
for the west coast main line. Clearly, there will be an increase in
freight and some leisure, commuter and regional services, but will it
be sufficient to maintain the line without very substantial subsidy?
And if a subsidy will indeed be required, has that been factored into
the business case for
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:14:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0003.htm#13062694000042">I

midland region were allowed to fall behind while other parts of the

affected by an estimated eight years of construction works. Some will
also find themselves potentially living alongside the railway where it

the onus will be on Ealing council and Transport for London to manage

understand that some constituents fear that they will be almost
completely trapped, and will be unable even to gain access to local

about mayhem around the Hanger Lane gyratory system while the line is
being constructed, along with anxieties about the impact of an
overground HS2 through parts of north Ealing, prompted a vigorous
campaign by local residents who have demanded, at the very least, a

Secretary of State supporting their campaign, and I am delighted to say

as my constituents know—notwithstanding those local impacts and
the opposition from campaigners further up the proposed line—I
have long been a firm supporter of what I see as an ambitious and
timely project. Given that I have campaigned loudly against a third
runway at Heathrow and have used the “train not plane”
argument, how could I not be? Central to this pledge was the logic that
a new high-speed rail link improving north-south connections would
dramatically reduce the need for the airlines to lay on so many
short-haul domestic flights from some of our northern cities, which
take up so much landing space at Heathrow. The HS2 concept, however,
has always been more than just a buffer against the immediate third
runway threat. It is a project for the future, and a rare example of a
Government’s demonstrating genuine long-term
vision—something that we should be encouraging.</hs_Para>

know that the demand is there and that we need to ease the pressure, so
why not plan now? Sooner or later we will need the extra capacity, and
if we wait for 10 years we will just be doing what we have to do now in
a rush. In any case, I have always believed that a country that can be

Mowat</B> (Warrington South) (Con):</Member> I support the Bill, but
before I say why I support it let me give a number of reasons for not
building this railway. We should not build it just because we have less
high-speed track than any other country in the world. We could be right
and those countries could be wrong, so that is not a good reason. We
should not build it because the business case for HS1 to move to St
Pancras was predicated on access to the north. We should not build it
on environmental and carbon-related grounds: I think that those are
rather difficult to justify, at a time when most electricity continues
to be produced from fossil fuels. We should not even build it to try to
rebalance infrastructure spending, which over the last decade has been
10 times higher per head in London and the south-east than in the
north-west, and more than 10 times higher than in the
north-east.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000064">We
should proceed with this project if, and only if, three conditions
exist: a robust business case, clear transformational benefits, and
affordability in cash-flow terms, at about £2 billion a year.
That £2 billion a year needs to kick in as Crossrail finishes,
and I think that that is quite achievable. I cannot go into the
business case in a great deal of detail, other than to say that the
benefit-cost ratio remains higher than 2—about 2.5 for the full
Y network—and is predicated principally on capacity arguments.
The number of passengers on the west coast main line has been
increasing at a rate of 5% a year for the last 15 years.
This business case assumes an increase of only 1.6%, which is quite
conservative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000065">As
for transformational benefits, some Members have said today that the
northern cities could do better if they just invested in broadband,
while others have said that northern cities do not understand that HS2
will cause all the jobs to be sucked into London. All that I can say to
that is that the northern chambers of commerce do not agree. They have
estimated that in the north-west it will produce some 40,000 extra jobs
and £8 billion of incremental benefits, while KMCG’s
Green Gauge report estimates that there will be about 50,000 extra
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000066">I

not down, as a result of the building of the channel tunnel rail link.
People said at the time that it would be a drain, diverting business
investment from the south-east to France, where

just from London to Paris and Brussels, but soon opening up into
Holland and Germany and to other locations in Europe. My hon. Friend
the Member for Northampton South (Mr Binley) pointed out in his very

rolling stock could help enable more local services and even the
reversal of some Beeching-era cuts, but Ministers and HS2 Ltd have not
made that case. They must do so if the constituents of Members such as

Bridgen</B> (North West Leicestershire) (Con):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Speaker. I seek your advice on where the £10 billion
of extra funding, which was announced for HS2, has come from. The House
has divided on important matters without being aware of whether the
extra £10 billion will come out of existing
budgets—meaning the curtailment of existing projects—the
deficit or the comprehensive spending review. I was keen to ask the
Minister about that while he was at the Dispatch Box, but as you saw,
Mr Speaker, he was keen not to answer my
question.</hs_Para>

of order. I will deal with his second point first and his first point
second. On his second point, I am 
<?notus-xml column=415?>sure he will appreciate that this is not a matter for the Chair. Some
Ministers, when delivering winding-up speeches, are comfortable with
taking interventions, depending on time considerations and other
matters. Other Ministers decline to do so and are absolutely within
their rights, so this is not a matter for the Chair. He may wish to
pursue this matter in conversations with Ministers, and it is proper
for him to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>. On the other
point, that will come out in the course of debate over a sustained
period. The hon. Gentleman will doubtless represent his constituents
assiduously on the matter. We will leave it there, and we are grateful
to the hon. Gentleman.</hs_Para>

Lansley:</Member></B> As the House heard during the previous debate,
the Government are introducing a hybrid Bill to Parliament later this
year to allow consideration of whether the powers to construct, operate
and maintain the HS2 scheme should be granted. Given the significance
of this decision it will be clear to the House that it is essential
that Parliament has the means in place to support effective decision
making in relation to the Bill. However, it has been a while since the
last hybrid Bill and some of the rules governing this process are now
out of date. Therefore, the motions I am moving today will update this
parliamentary procedure. If I may, I will explain them to
the House. I believe that the House will not find them
objectionable.</hs_Para>

the motion for electronic deposit, the House may be aware that, along
with the HS2 hybrid Bill later this year, we will provide Parliament
with the environmental statement. This will set out the likely
significant environmental effects of the scheme and put forward
proposals for alleviating them. For a project of this magnitude, there
is a considerable level of detail involved. We expect the statement to
be up to 50,000 pages long. It is of course important that communities
can easily find out what the impact will be on their local area.
However, current Standing Orders require us to deposit a hard copy of
that document to every local authority area along the line of route. It
is estimated that each document would weigh up to 1 tonne in that form.
In this day and age, that is inconvenient for the communities involved
and wasteful of Government resources. That is why our first motion
allows for the electronic deposit of bill documentation for the HS2
hybrid Bill. That will make it easier for communities across the line
of route to find the information most relevant to their area without
having to work through an enormous document. It will also make it
easier for local authorities, including parish councils, to meet their
obligations to make the information available for public
inspection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:28:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000865" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000865">It
should also be noted that this is a permissive power. It does not
require documents to be deposited in electronic format only. HS2 Ltd is
clear that if a deposit location wants all the documents in hard copy,
they can have them in hard copy. In all cases, HS2 Ltd will make

For most people with access to electronic

navigating large documents is perfectly straightforward. In
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:30:02"></hs_TimeCode>, it is
probably easier to navigate documents of this length and complexity
electronically than in hard copy. Not least, of course, it affords
people the opportunity to focus on a local area or to do things such as
word searches. I can confirm, however, that reasonable requests for
hard copies of maps and section drawings will be met. These could be
requested either from local authorities, which will be provided with
hard copies for inspection, or directly from HS2 Ltd, which will
provide A3 copies. It should further be noted that copies of all maps
and sections will be available for inspection in both Houses. I hope
that gives the right hon. Gentleman the assurance he was looking
for.</hs_Para>

easier for people to engage with the hybrid Bill process and therefore
ensuring the most effective decision making by Parliament.</hs_Para>

to Standing Orders will incorporate a formal consultation period for
the environmental statement between introduction and Second Reading of
the hybrid Bill. Although this follows the precedent of the Crossrail
Act 2008, by enshrining this consultation in Standing Orders, we will
improve the transparency and certainty of the hybrid Bill
procedure.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan) made. The new
Standing Order requires the appointment of an assessor to prepare a
summary of the public’s comments. The independence of the
assessor will be assured, because they will be appointed by Parliament
and will report directly to it. That summary will make it easier for
Members to appreciate and represent the views of the public when
debating the principle of the hybrid Bill.</hs_Para>

56<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:34:36"></hs_TimeCode>

are told that, in the coming year, a hybrid Bill will be presented to

about when we are likely to see it appear, along with the final
environmental statement? Will we see it during the current calendar
year, or during the current parliamentary Session? Is the Leader of the
House confident that, even if the Government are able to publish the
Bill in the next year, it will be completed before the next general
election? After all, this is a huge and complex undertaking which has
generated a great deal of opposition. If it takes as long to produce
this Bill as it took to produce the much smaller and less controversial
Crossrail Bill, it would not be completed until December 2016 even if
we embarked on it today. Given that the Leader of the House schedules

publication by the Secretary of State for Transport of a draft
environmental statement and a design refinement consultation document
in May was a welcome development which will assist the consultation
process, and we have just made a decision on the initial stages of the
High Speed Rail (Preparation) Bill itself, but we still have a long and
complex way to go in the hybrid Bill procedure. It makes no sense to
undertake a complex consultation procedure on a complex and
controversial project such as HS2, only to discover that there are
plenty of opportunities for legal action and for further uncertainty or
delay because the consultation mechanisms used did not
comply with best practice, or indeed—as the Leader of the House
hinted—with the EU directive on environmental impact
assessments. If the changes outlined by the Leader of the House mean
that that risk has been mitigated, I agree that we should support them.
Of course it is desirable in principle for those affected to be made
aware of the position in a timely fashion, and to have a chance to
comment before Parliament makes a
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000897" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000897">The
Leader of the House explained that the HS2 hybrid Bill would be
accompanied by an environmental statement. He also revealed that he
expected this to run to 50,000 pages. That is the equivalent of 33
copies of Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” rolled into
one, although I am sure that it will be a more interesting read. The
environmental statement accompanying the Crossrail Bill was only 2,700
pages long. As the Leader of the House noted, once a copy of the
statement has been deposited with each of the authorities along the
route, as dictated by the current Standing Order, the weight of the
documents will be over a tonne, which is apparently the weight of 17
large trees. Opposition Members agree that it is sensible, in this
particular case, to make provision for the electronic deposit of the
environmental statement. Reassurances were needed, but the Leader of
the House very properly supplied them during his speech. I was grateful
to the Leader of the House for making it clear that if a deposit
location wishes to have the documents 
<?notus-xml column=425?>in hard copy, they will be provided by HS2 Ltd, and that the key
documents will also be made available in hard copy. I hope that that
will provide suitable reassurance that there will be fair access to the

has rightly highlighted that some key components of the environmental
statement are not well-suited purely to online publication. Detailed
diagrams and maps are often less accessible in online form, and I
appreciate—as I hope my right hon. Friend does—the fact
that the Leader of the House has been able to put on the record that
those maps and large documents will be made available in all formats,

answers to all the questions the shadow Leader of the House has so
rightly asked about these standing orders and the alterations. This is
a particularly tortuous and complex process, and because it so tortuous
and complex, it is neither accessible nor transparent to the
stakeholders and the people who are affected by it. They must be able
to understand what is required of them. I therefore ask the Leader of
the House to consider how he is going to produce explanatory notes on
this hybrid Bill process and these changes to standing orders, and make
them available, particularly to those people who have been part of the
consultations and the community forums up and down the line, but also
to the environmental organisations, many of whom contain volunteers and
others who are not familiar with our practices and procedures here, and
who certainly have no idea of how to navigate their way around the
hybrid Bill process.</hs_Para>

would like to know the date when the hybrid Bill and the environmental

much to 17 large trees, but more to 17 large white

better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:54:17"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
worried that moving to electronic tabling for something as large as
this may cause technical problems. What checks will be made on the IT
systems of local authorities up and down the line where these documents
will be deposited, to establish that those systems can take these
documents and people can navigate them with ease? It is all very well
talking about making documents available electronically; when I was
looking at the Department for Transport’s business statement
today on the No. 10 website, it was almost impossible to navigate or
download it in a timely fashion. That business plan was not very long,
but if that is the standard the Government set for the ease of
navigating documents, it does not reflect well on their IT systems. We
need to know that full checks have been made of those systems, and that
they can take the documents in question.</hs_Para>

examine the document in detail, he will consider extending the
deadline, or whether it would be possible to change the Standing Orders
to that end. A standard consultation period, as under the last
Government, was deemed to be 12 weeks. The Government have concertinaed
it and seem to be adopting an eight-week standard, which is not
satisfactory when we are dealing with something as precious as an area
of outstanding natural beauty such as the Chiltern hills. Many details

fact of the availability of the draft environmental statement for
consultation now, in addition to the Standing Order requirements for a
consultation later on. Taken together, when we make the comparison with
the consultations required for other major projects under planning
legislation, we see that this is an entirely appropriate period of
consultation. She makes a good point about ensuring that those engaging
with this process can do so effectively. As was the case with
Crossrail, hybrid Bill information papers will outline the process. I

We have made it clear that HS2 Ltd will cover IT costs for local

one that this amendment does not change. The new Standing Orders before
the House do not change that requirement in relation to local
authorities, but, as I say, it has been clear throughout that the IT

me start by explaining why there is so much excitement in the
north-east and Durham, where the Gospels are to be exhibited, about the
temporary return of the Lindisfarne Gospels to our region. The book is
simply a stunning masterpiece of early mediaeval European book painting
and the beautifully illustrated manuscript represents the pinnacle of
achievement of Anglo-Saxon Northumbrian art at the end of the seventh
century.</hs_Para>

Gospels book was made on the holy island of Lindisfarne and was
probably written between St Cuthbert’s death in 687 AD and the
death of Eadfrith, Bishop of Lindisfarne, who was identified as the
artist and scribe of the book by Aldred, the provost of the monastic
community of St Cuthbert at Chester-le-Street. A recent study suggested
a date for the Gospels of between 710 and 720 AD.</hs_Para>

book is the oldest surviving translation of the gospels into the
English language, but it is worth recognising that the Lindisfarne
Gospels’ intricate and symbolic artwork helped convey its
message to those who could not read. The Gospels were created at a time
of great change when Britain was a land of many cultures that were
coming together into an emerging national identity. The manuscript is
inspired by all the different peoples who lived in these islands at the
time: Britons, Picts, Celts and Anglo-Saxons, along with those of
Mediterranean and middle-eastern cultures.</hs_Para>

extraordinary aspect of the Gospels is that unlike most early mediaeval

first Viking raid on Britain struck Lindisfarne in 793 AD. After nearly
100 years of continuing raids, the monastic community abandoned
Lindisfarne in 875, taking with them the body of St Cuthbert, the
Gospels and other important relics. The Lindisfarne community is
believed to have travelled around for seven years before eventually
settling at the priory at Chester-le-Street, where they stayed until
995. They then moved to Durham priory with the relics of St Cuthbert,
after the dead saint revealed to one of the monks where he wanted his
new resting place to be.</hs_Para>

1069, the Lindisfarne Gospels spent a short time back at Lindisfarne to
escape the devastating raid on the north by William the Conqueror. The
book was  
<?notus-xml column=431?>then returned to Durham. In 1104, St Cuthbert’s body and other
monastic treasures from Lindisfarne were moved to the splendid new
cathedral at Durham. However, in 1536 the dissolution of the
monasteries was ordered by Henry VIII. The priories of Lindisfarne and
Durham were broken up and the Gospels were believed to have been seized
by the King’s commissioners.</hs_Para>

the Royal Academy in 1961, in Durham cathedral in 1987, and at the
Laing art gallery in Newcastle in 1996 and 2000. It took nearly two
years of negotiations, planning, organisation and effort to bring the
Gospels to the region on the last two visits. On the first day of the

the Gospels visited under the new arrangements. It took some time and
forbearance, but we are all pleased that all the partners exhibiting

thank the Heritage Lottery Fund for its grant, which has helped the

manuscript is one of the most important books in the British
Library’s collection, but it is also a treasure of world
culture, and it is a symbol of our region’s proud past and the
cultural legacy that it has created for the nation. That was recognised

everyone attending the exhibition can view the Gospels free of charge,
just as tourists and others can do in the British Library. I believe
that that is particularly important, given that the north-east is the

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:19:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods) on bringing this
important debate to the Floor of the House. Like my hon. Friend, I am
delighted to see the return of the Lindisfarne Gospels nearly to their
rightful home. I say “nearly” tongue in cheek, because
really the Gospels belong to the beautiful island, Holy island, in
Northumberland.</hs_Para>

Gospels were made on the holy island of Lindisfarne in Northumbria. The
book was probably written at some time between St Cuthbert’s
death in 687 and the death in 721 of Eadfrith, bishop of Lindisfarne,
who was identified as the artist and the scribe of the book. The
Gospels’ last visit, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:20:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) correctly
pointed out, was a tremendous success. It was in 2000, 
<?notus-xml column=434?>and on the first day the Gospels attracted almost 3,000 people, which
was fantastic. I hope that that will be repeated or even surpassed when
the Gospels come to Durham later this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000953" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000953">I
feel the need to raise a couple of points with regard to artefacts
including the Gospels, their accessibility to people throughout the
country, and fairness. The first point was touched on by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:21:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for City of Durham when she said how difficult it was to
arrange even a temporary loan of the Gospels. For many years the
British Library flatly refused to allow any temporary loan of such a
valuable asset to the north-east. That upset many people in our region.
The people in the north-east see the Gospels as theirs and were
offended by the attitude of the British Library.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062694000954" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000954">Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:21:56"></hs_TimeCode>
that these treasures belong to the people of the whole country, there
should be a much greater requirement on the national museums to loan
artefacts such as the Gospels to regions such as the north-east.
Museums do loan some artefacts and materials, but they are generally
stuff, as they see it, of lesser importance. They make people jump
through hoops and over hurdles in order to secure the loan of artefacts
such as the gospels, even on a temporary basis. The British Library
should not expect people to travel from the likes of the north-east to
London to see these artefacts. It should bear in mind the distance and
the cost, and the priority of people who want to see them.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:23:00"></hs_TimeCode> have
world-class museums in the north-east region, and facilities such as
Woodhorn museum in my constituency—a first-class museum that is
perfectly capable of housing artefacts such as the
Gospels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:23:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000955" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000955">My
second point is a simple one. Why are the national museums in London?
There are a few outposts, such as York, but generally the national
museums are in London. Again, I emphasise that they are inaccessible to
many of the people whom I represent and many in my region. We should be
looking at outposts up and down the country. The comprehensive spending
review today could spell dangerous times and possibly even the end for
many museums throughout the country. Rather than seeking funds to
extend or refurbish the London sites, why do the national museums not
create new outposts, possibly even within existing museums, to ensure
that people across the nation can see the treasures that they want to
see, and experience what other people are experiencing? Why cannot the
British Library, for example, establish a base in Northumberland or
Durham where items such as the Gospels could be displayed without
leaving the Library’s
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:24:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000956" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000956">We
are delighted to celebrate the Gospels’ return to the north-east
and also the exhibition that accompanies them, which has provided
inspiration for a number of local groups to engage with their cultural
heritage. Without being too negative, I simply say that we should make
sure that these cultural artefacts are accessible to people up and down
the country, regardless of how much they have in their back
pocket.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13062694001548" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694001548"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:24:13"></hs_TimeCode>8<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:24:24"></hs_TimeCode>.24

Manchester, which is part of the Science Museum Group, and having spent
most of last week debating the future of the National Media Museum in
Bradford, which is also part of the Science Museum Group, I can only
say that I wholly concur with the sentiments he expressed. We need to
do much more with our national museums to ensure that the regions are
not seen as somehow second class, that national museums, wherever they
are located, are on an equal footing with those in London, and that the
quality and expertise that exist in national museums outside London and
our major regional museums are as good as any to be found in

key point about the seven-year cycle is that the Lindisfarne Gospels
are part of the national collection and of international significance.
As the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) said, many other parts
of the United Kingdom would welcome the opportunity to see them. The

gospels, so that other parts of the country may see them in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062694000971" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/debtext/130626-0004.htm#13062694000971">As
the hon. Member for City of Durham pointed out, we have made great
progress. Since the Lindisfarne Gospels came into the national
collection in 1753, they have been removed only five times. They were
evacuated during world war two and subsequently moved as far as the
Royal Academy for display. The three other times since then have also
been when they have been displayed—once in Durham and twice in
the Laing art gallery in Newcastle. Now, of course, they are going back
to Durham.</hs_Para>

the hon. Lady pointed out, this is the first time in about 400 years
that the key relics from St Cuthbert’s grave, including St
Cuthbert’s Gospel, St Cuthbert’s cross, St
Cuthbert’s travelling altar and the Durham Gospels, will be
displayed together. They will be in place for three months. I am
delighted that the Heritage 
<?notus-xml column=437?>Lottery Fund has found almost half a million pounds to enable the
display to take place. I have absolutely no doubt that these
extraordinary treasures will attract tens of thousands of people from
the north-east and around the world. I look forward to making the trip

the 17th century, a parliamentary Clerk held the beautiful artefacts

me set the context for this morning’s debate. The Museum of
Science and Industry in Manchester—MOSI, as it is affectionately
known—is part of the Science Museum Group, which consists of
five museums: MOSI; the Science Museum in London; the National Media
Museum in Bradford; the National Railway Museum in York; and the
National Railway Museum in Shildon, County Durham. The SMG has an
international reputation. Collectively, its museums attract more than 5
million visitors every year—mainly school groups, but also
individuals and families. I certainly remember taking my daughters to
MOSI when they were little. I also remember my mum taking me to the
Science Museum in London; that really brought science to life for me,
and it was one reason why I ended up taking biochemistry and physiology
as my first degree.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062654000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062654000008"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:31:15"></hs_TimeCode>MOSI
became part of the SMG in 2012. It is feared that today’s
comprehensive spending review will announce a further 10% funding cut
for the group, on top of the 25% real-terms cuts it has suffered over
the last spending period.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:31:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell), who cannot be here
today, because she is on maternity leave, has campaigned
doggedly  on this issue; she even visited MOSI last weekend
with her family—they start young in the Powell household. She
has determined that, in 2011-12, the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport grant to MOSI fell to £3.9 million from
£4.88 million the previous year.</hs_Para>

SMG felt that if that was to be the level of the funding cut for
2015-16, the only option would be to close one of its museums outside
London and to scale back provision in London.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:32:14"></hs_TimeCode>The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:32:37"></hs_TimeCode>
ratio of taxpayer to commercial funding in the SMG’s existing
funding model is approximately 60:40, and reversing—in fact,
more than reversing—that relationship in such a relatively short
period threatens the SMG’s viability. I appreciate that, in the
light of the high-profile campaign to save MOSI, which has support
from, among others, fellow Oldhamer Professor Brian Cox, the Minister
seemed to have a change of heart last week, and the threat to our
regional museums has been lifted, but I would be grateful if he could
confirm that in his closing
remarks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:32:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062654000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062654000010">As
past and current leaders of the museums said in  a letter to a
national newspaper last week, the SMG museums not only hold collections
of international significance, but are vital to their host cities,
providing cultural, educational and economic benefits across their
regions. The economic importance of Manchester’s science and
innovation base cannot be overestimated, and it is confined not just to
the city centre. Greater Manchester 
<?notus-xml column=76?>is one of the fastest growing city regions in Europe, generating
£47 billion of gross value added each year, and accounting for
40% of GVA for north-west England.</hs_Para>

recent growth has been driven by knowledge-intensive and high-growth
firms. Manchester has been at the forefront of scientific development
since the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Inventions such as
Samuel Crompton’s spinning wheel, which was exploited by Richard
Arkwright, helped to establish Manchester as the centre of the global
textile industry. More recently, a small-scale experimental
machine—nicknamed “Baby”—created by Alan
Turing was the first stored-program computer to run a program, and it
was the forerunner of the modern computer.</hs_Para>

are many other famous Manchester scientists I could talk about, but I
will mention just a few. They include John Dalton, who did work around
atomic theory; Ernest Rutherford, the physicist; and Tom Kilburn and
Freddie Williams, who commercialised Alan Turing’s work. Of
course, the first commercial railway in the world also ran
from Manchester to Liverpool, and MOSI is located on the site of the
old Liverpool Road station.</hs_Para>

is no different. With our excellent universities and the development,
for example, of a regional science centre for 16 to 18-year-olds, in my
constituency, Manchester is once again being seen as a world-class
centre for research—a status reinforced by the Nobel
prize-winning discovery of graphene. The translation from research to
the commercialisation of such discoveries is aided by
Manchester’s science parks. As we have seen with the development
of industrial hubs, such as the digital sector in silicon valley, in
California, the closer research and development are to industry, and
the closer the links between them, the greater the opportunities for
the growth of new, innovative knowledge-based
industries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:35:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062654000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062654000014">Manchester
has a world-class biotech cluster, and the digital, creative and

are our new industries. From those developments, our 21st-century
manufacturing base will grow. MOSI is part of that. It showcases the

their development potential, promoting science, technology, engineering
and mathematics and inspiring the next generation of scientists,
engineers and

exciting the public—especially young people—about
science. She has also mentioned the museums’ contribution to a
science-based economy. The National Railway Museum has established a
rail academy, which is basically a training school in craft skills for
the railways. Will she join me in asking the Department to provide

impact shows both direct and indirect impacts. It is one of the top two
visitor attractions in Greater Manchester and generates a direct gross

through procurement, but there is also nearly £28 million in
off-site expenditure, generating a GVA of £8 million.

I have mentioned, after the 25% real funding cut in the last spending
round, there is the prospect of a further 10% cut in the comprehensive
spending review this afternoon, and the SMG has made it clear that if
that happens a tipping point will have been reached and activity will
have to be cut dramatically. That will include the closure of one of
its regional museums. SMG has proposed a different approach. It has
suggested, for example, moving the group from the responsibility of the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport to the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, and protecting the current funding level for
both revenue and capital. That would provide a foundation on which the
group would seek further major revenue and capital investment from the
private sector. I should be grateful if the Minister commented on those
proposals, as well as confirming that the CSR does not threaten MOSI or
the free access to museums introduced by the Labour Government. To
introduce such a threat would, as my hon. Friends have said, be myopic,

hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie
Abrahams) on securing this important debate. I first visited the then
Greater Manchester Museum of Science and Industry in 1983, shortly
after it moved to the historic Liverpool Road station site, in
Castlefield. The museum visit was with 
<?notus-xml column=79?>3rd Denton (Wilton street) cubs, and I remember being mesmerised as a
9-year-old boy by the big engines, the turbines, the wheels, the
pistons, the smell of the smoke and the steam. It was really alluring
and gave me a lasting interest in science, technology and
innovation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:44:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062654000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062654000033">Over
the years, the museum has grown, first encompassing the neighbouring
Manchester Air and Space Museum and then gradually filling the whole of
the Liverpool Road station site. For those who do not know, the
Liverpool Road station is the terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester
railway, which opened in 1830, and the museum buildings are therefore
those of the world’s first passenger railway station, here in
Manchester—or rather there in Manchester, since we are in
London, England’s second city.</hs_Para>

probably fill this Chamber, but is about as powerful as a pocket
calculator. Nevertheless, it is a Manchester first. There are also
Rolls-Royce cars. Of course, it was in Manchester that Mr Rolls met Mr
Royce and founded the company that continues to produce those cars. The
huge emphasis on science is fitting, in the city where the atom was
first split. The museum commemorates king cotton: Manchester is of
course Cottonopolis, because cotton was the industry that the
city’s wealth was built on. However, it also recognises the
downside to rapid, uncontrollable growth—particularly the
cholera epidemics of the 19th century, with the campaign for clean
water and proper sanitation. There is even an opportunity—I do
not know whether you have done this, Mr Brady—to walk through a
reconstruction of a Victorian sewer, with the smells

Museum of Science and Industry, better known as MOSI to its regulars
over the years, is a much loved local museum, and I have fond childhood
memories of it. One of the best Christmas presents that I ever had was
when I was 12. My grandad’s friend was a friend of the museum,
and he bought me membership, so I, too, became a friend of the museum.
Back then, people had to pay to get into museums, but a perk with the
friend membership badge was to get in free, so I spent many a good time
there. More recently, I have enjoyed taking my children there. I think
that such experiences are the reason that Mancunians would consider it
a tragedy for the museum to close; that is why we breathed a collective
sigh of relief when Ministers assured us, last week, that that would
not happen.</hs_Para>

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:47:40"></hs_TimeCode>. It has
uniquely interesting sections about the history of the industrial

past. As my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:47:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

is therefore a matter of some concern that in the past few months
sources inside the museum’s parent company, the Science Museum
Group, have claimed 
<?notus-xml column=80?>that the future of MOSI is under threat because of funding problems. As
a result of the previous Labour Government’s move to give free
access to important national collections, visitor numbers at MOSI
have shot up. Last year, the museum

major national centre for industrial heritage and innovation.</hs_Para>

attracting tourists and prestige, and, as we heard from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:49:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend,

The Imperial War Museum North is another national museum based in the
regions that is bringing into Trafford wharfside, and into an iconic
building at that, visitors who probably would never have seen those
collections in the Imperial War Museum in London. We enjoyed a visit a
couple of years ago to see the “Horrible Histories”
exhibition, which my kids found absolutely fascinating. We should
continue to trumpet the benefits of having national museums and
collections in the regions, so that we all may benefit from learning

speculation about MOSI’s future was met by uproar from residents
across Greater Manchester and the north of England. As we can see from
the number of colleagues here today, the speculation has been met by
real concern from most Greater Manchester politicians. The suggestion
that MOSI would be affected by the Science Museum Group’s
problems led me to write to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media
and Sport. In my letter, I outlined that the acclaimed opening ceremony
of the 2012 Olympics included a stunning segment on Britain’s
development into the global industrial power that it is today. Danny
Boyle is rightly lauded for portraying the history of Britain not just
as a succession of monarchs, but as a land built by proud working men

<?notus-xml column=81?>that history to be lost. I pay tribute to all those involved in
MOSI’s development from the early days in 1969, when the then
North Western Museum of Science and Industry opened in a temporary
venue on Grosvenor street. It was later linked to the university of
Manchester institute of science and technology, and then through the
superb vision and drive of the former Greater Manchester council, which
was instrumental in moving the museum and developing it on its current
site, the museum turned into what it is today. The museum, along with
the transformation of the county’s once polluted river valleys,
is probably the former Greater Manchester
council<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T09:53:05"></hs_TimeCode>’s

comfort to hear the DCMS announcement on the funding settlement for
2015-16, as no museums should close. Clearly, like MOSI, we await
confirmation of the actual details of the funding package, and until
those details are received, we cannot be certain of the structural
deficit that MOSI will face or of which options will have to be
considered. Opposition Members certainly hope that the

course there remains the question of what to do with the structural
deficit. The Science Museum Group is currently £2 million in the
red, which is projected to go up to £4 million, and potentially
even to £6 million, depending on the CSR announcement today.
Recent figures show that between 2010-11 and 2014-15 Government funding
for the Science Museum Group, including MOSI, has been cut by 25% in
real terms. So far, the Science Museum Group has undertaken a number of
cost-cutting initiatives, including redundancies across the entire
organisation, to try to make the necessary savings. Although it now
seems that there will be only a 5% cut to the Science Museum
Group’s budget, not the 10% cut that was envisaged, it will

Surely, we ought to be considering constructive ways to bridge that
gap. Some 5 million people visited the museums last year, and the
budget deficit is likely to be in the region of £4 million,
which is the equivalent of 
<?notus-xml column=82?>80p per visitor over 12 months. I am not suggesting for one second that
we ought to be charging entry, but surely we ought to be able to
generate more money from those 5 million people who are going through

part of the Science Museum Group since its inception and it is
instructive to consider what happened there. When charges were
introduced, the number of visitors fell to 300,000; when charges were
removed in a number of stages by the previous Labour Government,
attendances rose again and are now at the 1 million mark. When a museum
does not impose entry charges, people pay much more in the cafeteria
and the shop. There are marketing opportunities for museums, which are

have done a little bit of research in advance of  this debate.
As the Minister knows, the Opposition  are always here to help
with constructive suggestions about this Government’s problems.
It appears to me that increasingly, a lot of institutions are turning
to  the internet to supplement their funding. A range of
organisations from start-up businesses to non-profit organisations, and
even councils, are turning to what is known as crowd funding as a
cheap, easy and accessible way to raise funds. Clearly, crowd funding
is no silver bullet, but I am glad that our shadow Culture, Media and

present.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062654000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062654000071">Two
of the world’s most famous museums have used crowd funding
successfully to raise money to buy specific pieces or fund exhibits.
The Smithsonian in Washington, for example, is looking for $125,000 to
put on the world’s first exhibition of yogic art. To be honest,
I have no idea what that is, but it sounds extremely exciting.
Similarly, the Louvre runs an annual crowd-funding campaign known as
“Everyone’s a Patron” to ask members of the public
to help purchase particular pieces of art. Since the campaign started
in 2010, it has funded the purchase of “The Three Graces”
and a collection known as “The Treasures of Cairo”, and
this year it raised €800,000 to complete a set of 13th-century
ivory figures, which now form the only complete set anywhere in the
world. Given the huge amount of public support generated by the
campaign to save MOSI, maybe we could harness some of it to bring our
people even closer and get them more involved in MOSI’s future

form, as well as assurances from the Minister, which we accept in good
faith, that the Science Museum in London should not have to close, and

A few weeks ago, someone—I do not know who—tweeted that

Department is a metaphor and an adornment to the Government. We have

No. 2 concerns the introduction of charging for our national museums. I
was berated in no less an august journal than <I>The Spectator</I> for
a mildly flippant remark saying that when tourists visited out museums
free, we would fleece them in the cafes afterwards. The hon. Member for
York Central (Hugh Bayley) said that more elegantly, and the point was
well made that visitor numbers have doubled at the Museum of Science
and Industry, and many visitors who enter free spend money within the
museum. The commercial case is that charging would enable museums to
raise revenue, but they would lose a significant amount of income from
cafes, shops and other areas where visitors spend money. It is not a
zero-sum game, and charging would not simply increase revenue by the
amount charged. That is the commercial reason for introducing charging,

independently and reduce administrative burdens. That will include an
exceptional power for the sector to borrow up to £40 million a
year from the Government; authorisation to invest in non-grant income;
access to reserve funds, so that museums have the flexibility to spend
donations that they receive; the freedom to set pay, to attract the

hon. Members know, we significantly raised the proportion of lottery
funding going to the arts. An additional £100 million is going
to the arts every year under this Government. Some of that money has
been used to significantly increase the amount of funding available for
touring, so national arts organisations have the opportunity to tour
their work around the country. The Arts Council has also set up what it
calls the creative people and places fund—off the top of my
head, it is worth about £30 million—which is designed to

call costs than contract phones poorer people end up paying more to use

who are justifiably irate that ringing essential public services, such
as HMRC, results in them having sky-high bills. The answers I have
received to parliamentary questions to Departments have revealed not
only the shocking scale, but the scope of Government use of high-cost
phone numbers. Six out of 10 Government phone lines are high cost. The
Home Office, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs all use a high
proportion of high-cost phone lines. The Department for Work and
Pensions alone has 200-plus 0845 numbers. Vulnerable people are being
charged rip-off rates for contacting essential services, including
pension, work and welfare services—when talking to Jobcentre
Plus, the Pensions Advisory Service, about disability living 
<?notus-xml column=95?>allowance and attendance allowance, and so on. The waiting times for the

0845 and 087 revenue-sharing numbers are the major culprits. Calling
the numbers can cost anything up to 41p a minute, and a service charge
is included, which is paid to the Government. I am pleased that my
right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) is
here today because he has done some very important work on what he has
rightly termed a telephone tax, and the National Audit Office is also
looking into the scandal. It is simply beyond belief that people
calling taxpayer-funded phone lines are taxed again. Some Departments

true that many Departments, or the people who make the decisions, did
not know that they were making money out of the numbers. They assumed
that something starting with 08 was free, just like the 0800 numbers.
It is important that that message gets across. There are one or two
Departments that, when they found out, were fairly horrified and said
that they would change. The key thing, therefore, is that they make
that change

suggest that revenue sharing is particularly unfair, but that it is
part of a wider picture. Calling any public service on a geographic or
a non-geographic number means that people with very little
money—those with prepay mobile phones—get bills they
simply cannot afford. That covers accessing central Government services
and those of other public bodies, agencies and local authorities and,
until very recently, even GP surgeries. I was made aware of the case of
a homeless family in my constituency who clearly did not have a
land-line or a contract phone, and were trying to reach Birmingham city
council a couple of years ago. They were kept hanging on for ages, just
trying to find out if they had any chance of getting a home. How can we

answer. First, does the Minister agree with me—and, I am sure,
countless members of the public, and campaigners, such as the fair
telecoms campaign, which has done a great deal of work—that it
is fundamentally wrong to place a service charge or, to put it another
way, a telephone tax on calls to phone lines that are already funded
from taxation? If so, what is the Government’s time scale to end
its use across all Departments and
agencies?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062655000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062655000072">Secondly,
w<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T11:11:13"></hs_TimeCode>hat progress
has been made on implementing the recommendations on contact centres in
Sir David Varney’s “Service transformation”
report, which was taken over by the Cabinet Office’s Contact
Council? The report called for an exploration of the scope for single
access numbers for all non-emergency public services, which would
provide complementary support for the 999 service; more urgently, for
the implementation of a clear public sector numbering and tariffing
strategy using the 03 number range; and for the establishment of a set
of cross-Government benchmarks, such as calls answered per minute, to
improve the performance of public sector call centres.</hs_Para>

solution would need to be clear and comprehensive, and it would need to
make access to all public sector services less confusing and more
cost-effective for the taxpayer. It would end the use of revenue
sharing—the telephone tax—and establish clear numbering
criteria for different services, with essential services using
freephone for all 0800 numbers and all other services using

will the Government enforce Ofcom’s recommendations that the
costs of revenue-sharing numbers must be declared, which goes back to
my right hon. Friend’s point? What is Ministers’ time
scale for such an implementation? Ofcom has outlined an implementation
period of 18 months from when the recommendations are published, which
means organisations would not have to declare their charges until at
least 2015. We know the costs, and we know that many people are
currently confused about the price of the numbers, so why delay? The
Cabinet Office should issue directions to enforce transparency now, and

online and on to the telephone, it is important that the Government do
not ignore those sections of the population that find it difficult to
access the internet and do not have access to contract phones or

The hon. Gentleman did not mention this, but we should recognise that
HMRC, which is a hugely important Department in the context of this
debate, has already moved two of its helplines, the tax credit and
Welsh language helplines, from 0845 numbers to 03 prefix numbers to
reduce the cost to callers. It is also committed to moving all of its
personal tax, expenses

area, which was mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, is about reducing the
need for the public to use the phone in engaging with the Government.
He makes a fundamental point that we will always be in a situation in
which a proportion of the population will not be online or comfortable
with being online and will need what we call in our clunky Government
language “assisted digital”. The Government will shortly
announce plans to invest taxpayers’ money in a radical,
ambitious process to go digital by default, which will ensure that no
one is left behind and which should transform the experience of dealing
with Government—online as often as possible and practicable. We
all know the benefits of online communication, and success on that
mission will mean that we reduce the need for people to use the
telephone and be exposed to some of the vagaries, complexities and
costs that we are debating here now. It is important for that to be
registered, because the Government digital strategy, which was
published last November, sets out how we intend to redesign digital
services to make them straightforward and convenient so that all who
can use them will choose to do so while those who cannot are not
excluded. That channel shift, as we call it, will result in a reduction
in the use of call centres, telephones, post and in-person centres,
thereby reducing the problem of higher non-geographic phone charging,

needs to wait for them. There will be complex negotiations with
suppliers. There is one thing on which I should like to push him a
little further. On behalf of the user of services, the public, would it
not be reasonable to say that there are certain principles here to
which we aspire? The first is that an essential public service should
be free to the public. Secondly, phone lines should be as cheap as they
can be for other Government services. The obvious way of doing that is
using something like the 03 numbers. How we get to those points
could be the subject of detailed discussions, but, presumably, we
should be able to agree that if the call is essential, it should be
free, and if it is non-essential, it should be as cheap as it can

simplification, transparency and trust, principles are important in
terms of bringing people together, communicating and building that
trust. Some Departments need to think through quite carefully the
implications of some of the changes that the hon. Gentleman is
proposing. For example, if they cannot make a particular charge for a
service, they have to consider how they can continue to provide it. It
is reasonable to build into the process some time for them to think
through that carefully, because, presumably, the services are valued by
the people using them. The principles of transparency and of keeping it
simple and as cheap as possible are ones that we endorse, along with
the commitment to try, as far as we can, to move people to a situation
where most of this stuff is done online. We also want to make sure that
all the services that we provide to people who are not online and who
are not comfortable with that—we hope the number of those will

conditions will make a difference. The amount of time that an animal

Australia or New Zealand, we should take into account the length of

course, if it comes by sea, it is argued that the carbon footprint is

purpose of this inquiry and report is to look at the benefits of
producing grass-fed beef and lamb, to keep sustainable grass pasture
and to produce very good meat. We would not necessarily want or be able
to plough such land, and a huge amount of carbon is captured within the
soil. We took some evidence that showed that over years of permanent
pasture the carbon actually increases, so there are many good reasons

that has demonstrated, even within a country, there is significant
variation in the statistics and no way to determine whether they were
driven by different efficiencies or by different ways of producing
data. That makes any form of comparative assessment of carbon footprint
challenging and poses major difficulties for policy formulation. There
is no international consensus on sequestration—the process by
which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by pasture land
through a process of absorption and deposition in the soil, which acts
as a carbon sink. In essence, that is a natural form of carbon capture

of including carbon sequestration is highlighted by Mr Bill Grayson, a
producer who gave evidence to the inquiry. He ran four models on his
farm’s emissions. The PAS 2050 model, which does not include
sequestration, concluded that his farm was a net emitter. The
other three methods, which include sequestration, put his farm as a net
absorber of carbon. Evidently such significant differences make

have visited Brazil, where people are ploughing up a lot of the
savannah and planting soya bean and sugar beet and driving cattle
towards the rain forests and allowing them to partly destroy the rain
forests before people cut down the trees. So it is absolutely essential
that we produce in this country high-quality beef and lamb, so that we
do not need as many imports; that is absolutely clear. I will go on to

A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T14:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>chieving
consistency in the figures used should be viewed as one of the top
priorities for the industry and the Government, who should work in

if we compare the impact of livestock in the UK and in France using
nationally-produced data, our producers will be hugely disadvantaged
because French data will include sequestration. It is not very often
that I ask a Minister to look at a French system, but on this occasion
I will. We urge him to look into this issue as a priority and—if
we are to see greater co-operation between nations in our effort to
respond to environmental and food challenges—to migrate to the
model accepted in France. If the Government do not view this as a
viable course of action, they need to make a robust case to say why
not. The disparity built into the status quo is no longer acceptable in

going to graze livestock on that pasture, what are we actually going to

The reason that those cattle have been reintroduced in those areas,
which are vital for holding carbon emissions in peat bogs, is that they
trample the right sort of way—better than sheep—in that

biodiversity right as well. So the Welsh White cattle are doing a good

about not only carbon sequestration but the management of grassland,

an argument that sheep do not do the same job on certain pasture land

important to bear that in mind when considering the overall
environmental impact of agriculture. Quantifying the carbon value of
biodiversity is incredibly difficult and is not something that
life-cycle analysis takes into account. The evidence suggests that it
will be a major challenge to find an agreed way of quantifying this

ruminants in particular is a very natural gas. It may come out perhaps
too much for people’s liking, but it is very much there. We are
taking lower-quality proteins—I had better be careful what I
say—and developing them into high-quality meat. Therefore, the

will move on to the next paragraph of the report. Food security is one
of the most pressing issues for Governments across the world. By 2050,
the global population is estimated to reach 9 billion, and food
production will need to increase to meet growing demand. However, that
has to be achieved using the existing agricultural land, while making
more efficient use of water and mitigating the existing and future
impact of farming on the environment.</hs_Para>

challenge is no less great on the home front, with the UK population

This means maximising the value of available land, by getting the best
possible outcomes in terms of food production. British agricultural
land comprises many different land types, and not all are suitable for
the production of arable crops. This point was eloquently made by the

biodiversity. Biodiversity has a positive impact on the environment,

the exact amount by which biodiversity benefits the environment is also
difficult. To combat our greenhouse gases, we need more investment in
research into farming practices. For example, how big a role does
carbon sequestration actually play? We also need to educate our
producers to better understand the various issues so that they are able

farmers. The average size of a farm in Northern Ireland is between 65
and 70 acres, but there are many hobby farmers and part-time farmers.
The impact on such farmers is greater, and the impact on us in Northern
Ireland is greater

is crucial. Raising livestock sustainably is not solely the
responsibility of producers; retailers also play a pivotal and vital
role, which I hope the Minister takes on board. Retailers must enable
consumers to make informed decisions about the products they buy so
that they can take into account animal welfare, nutritional value and
environmental impact before purchasing the product. There has been much
talk in the press over the past week or two about the green, amber and
red system that tells consumers about a product’s fat content,
nutritional value and so on. That, too, will have an impact on farmers,
through the retailers.</hs_Para>

can make deals to source meat only from farms with lower emissions,
which are better for the environment and are more cost-efficient, but
they must stop squeezing the farmer with lower prices while maintaining
or increasing prices in their shops, thereby putting pressure on
farmers while increasing their own profit margins. Let us be realistic
about achievable goals, rather than squeezing the farmer every
time  we try to achieve specific targets. That is a different
story for a different day, but it comes off the back of this

that we need to answer is simple: how will we produce enough food to
feed a worldwide population of 9 billion by 2050? The answer lies with
finding more efficient ways to raise livestock that do not compromise
the needs of future generations. Enforcing a vegetarian diet would be
unsustainable because the fertilisers used to increase yields,
particularly nitrates, pollute water supplies and lead to other
consequences. We are endangering the already fragile fishing
ecosystems, and the carbon footprint of cattle and sheep is too high.
Those issues must be fully
considered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062660000057">Although
I fully understand the need to reduce the carbon footprint, it cannot
be done at the expense of farming in the United Kingdom and, more
specifically, Northern Ireland. In any consideration of the topic, the
farmers’ views and opinions must be paramount. No system will
work without their co-operation. Any enforcement of new regulations
must be informed and subsidised and cannot be allowed to affect the
cattle or the land. The Ulster Farmers Union recently highlighted an

and we cannot escape the reality that cattle and sheep produce a lot of
methane, but it has become increasingly evident that that is not a
zero-sum game; there is an increasing body of evidence showing the
significant environmental benefits associated with livestock farming.
When we look at both sides of the carbon balance sheet, we see that,
overall, methane emissions from ruminants are only one part of the
footprint of agricultural production and that cattle and sheep farming,
which have been central to our culture

issues are extremely pressing in Scotland, because livestock farming
accounts for a high proportion of land use—significantly higher
than in other countries of the UK. More than 82% of our agricultural
land is grassland, some 70% of which is rough grazing. Those are huge
carbon sinks—the Scottish Agricultural College estimates that
they represent 80% of the UK’s carbon stocks—so the
extent to which carbon sequestration takes place on grassland is very
important. We do not yet have enough consistent evidence to reach
definitive conclusions, but we know that changing the use of that land
could have very adverse consequences, not just for greenhouse gas
emissions but for biodiversity and the livelihoods of our farmers and
rural
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062660000065">In
the past, I have heard simplistic arguments for switching from
livestock to arable production, which is a total non-starter in most of
Scotland. Some 85% of Scottish land is less-favoured area, and much of
it, especially on higher ground, is not suitable for crops. Our
climate, combined with marginal land quality, makes arable farming an
unviable proposition in many parts of the country. As much of that land
is a carbon sink, bringing grasslands and rough grazing into
cultivation would, frankly, be destructive and irresponsible in climate
and environmental terms; it would increase, not decrease, greenhouse
gas
emissions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0001.htm#13062660000066">By<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:07:39"></hs_TimeCode>
contrast, a great deal can be done to maximise the sustainability of
livestock farming without compromising livelihoods. Research by
Scotland’s Rural College as part of the “Farming for a
Better Climate” initiative shows there are lots of simple,
practical steps that farmers can take to minimise and mitigate the
impact of livestock-related greenhouse gas emissions, from how they
manage grazing land to how they use fertilisers and manage waste and
slurry; there is also the kind of energy, bedding materials and feed
that they use, and even the breeds of sheep and cattle that they rear.

food production and agriculturally-related change in land use
substantially contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide.
Four-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector.
Although livestock products are a source of some essential nutrients,
they provide large amounts of saturated fat, which is a known risk
factor for cardiovascular disease. We considered potential strategies
for the agricultural sector to meet the target recommended by the UK
Committee on Climate Change to reduce UK emissions from the
concentrations recorded in 1990 by 80% by 2050, which would require a
50% reduction by 2030. With use of the UK as a case study, we

that consuming only fish from sustainable stocks, eating more seasonal
food, cutting out bottled water, shopping on foot, and some other

appreciate the intention of hon. Members who are present today
to defend the UK beef and sheep industry; but I do not think it is

look at the issues in isolation. We should begin by acknowledging that
there is a problem, and address that. I am slightly concerned that
EBLEX, the organisation for the British beef and sheep industry,
supports the all-party group, and is thanked in the report. I also note
that Weber Shandwick provides the secretariat for the group, and has
been thanked for its help in compiling the report. I do not know quite
what clients it has that have led to its interest in the issue, but I
think vested interests are clearly at work. I was going to say they are
trying to pull the wool over our eyes—I have managed to make an

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:30:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Tiverton and Honiton, went in some detail through the report, which
I will discuss in a moment. I should make it clear that I used the
example of Welsh White cattle for a particular reason. He made the
point ably in his contribution that we should consider not only issues
such as carbon reduction, emissions and sequestration, but the wider
benefits of particular livestock in certain landscapes and
environments.</hs_Para>

I gave the curious example of the fairly rare Welsh White—a
small beef animal—is that its footprint is slightly lighter than
other cattle but slightly heavier than sheep. It does a perfect job of
breaking up the upland peat bogs of the Plynlimon hills, but not
breaking up the ground too much. Combined with excellent work done by
local farmers and the Wildlife Trusts to re-block some of the drains
dug during the second world war to dry out the land so crops could be
planted, which never quite worked successfully, the breed is now
yielding great dividends. The right creature in the right habitat helps
biodiversity as well.</hs_Para>

food security and food production, as did other Members. We are

hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) rightly
challenged the farming sector with its responsibilities in terms of
climate change and carbon emissions, saying that it could do more. She
was eminently reasonable on the contribution that farming could play as
part of the wider UK and global drive to tackle global emissions. She
also widened the debate to the issue of biofuels versus food, which
other hon. Members also raised, and to diet and other reports that
challenge or contradict what we are debating. Those reports were useful
for this debate and probably deserve separate debates, which I am sure
she will seek; it is right to have challenge.</hs_Para>

than simply an applied academic argument about how we measure and
compare the carbon footprint of livestock. It is about effective
measures to improve the performance of different types of farms in
different farming sectors, and we can seek that improvement only if we
measure the right thing in the right way and make like-for-like
comparisons both within the UK and its devolved Administrations and
internationally. As hon. Members have said, it is also a matter of food
security and providing for the demands of a growing global population,
and as I am sure other members of the all-party group are aware, it is
a matter of reputational importance to the livestock sector. It
recognises the work that the sector can do and its role in reducing
carbon emissions, while putting good, wholesome British food on
consumers’ plates in all parts of the UK and increasingly in
other countries, which demand outstanding produce from England,
Northern Ireland, Scotland and
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062660000124">The

appropriateness of measurement,  the lack of consensus on
standard methodologies of measurement and the lack of comparability

well as about how carbon sequestration can and should be taken into
account with a standard approach. The all-party group has done a great
service to the House by raising those issues, so that the Minister can
respond to them domestically and internationally. I will turn briefly
to some of the specific
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062660000125">I
am grateful for the information provided to all hon. Members by the
National Farmers Union and others. One interesting dilemma within the
discussions on carbon emissions and sequestration is illustrated in
upland hill farming, which is part of my family background. The NFU
makes the good point that such farmers could be particularly
disadvantaged by how we currently measure, assess and compare carbon
impacts. Some of the hill farms are on poor land without any real
alternative uses. Such farming is also extensive in nature; it takes
far longer to raise lambs to carcase weight. The finishing period is
far longer, and generally, the vegetation and forage are of a much
lower standard. That has a significant impact. When we look at the
farming sector as a whole and say, “You’re not doing well
enough,” the question comes back, “What alternatives do
you have for that environment?” It is an interesting question. I
am glad that I am speaking up for sheep, rather than cattle, after my
earlier intervention. As we mentioned, it is also a question of the
benefits for landscape management and biodiversity of having the right
livestock in the right place.</hs_Para>

international comparators raised by the all-party group and others, can
the Minister give us an update on what progress has been made towards
standardising international measures? What is happening on the common
carbon footprinting methodology for the lamb meat sector? What is

white paper by the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef? How are
those things progressing? They and similar transnational interventions

on-farm activity and carbon emissions, where the boundary lies and

am going to introduce a few figures, which are important to the debate.
It is a fact that man-made greenhouse gas emissions represent a serious
threat of climate change. Inescapably, agriculture directly accounts
for about 10% to 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions. More widely,
including other emissions associated with agricultural production, such
as land use change, energy for fertiliser production and fuel for
transport and refrigeration of products, emissions from global food
production are far more significant, perhaps totalling 25% of global
greenhouse gas
emissions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:41:54"></hs_TimeCode>. In
the UK, the figures are rather different. Agriculture accounts for
about 9% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, and overall emissions from the
agriculture sector have decreased by 20% since 1990, while we
expect them to decrease by 12% from 2010 levels by 2025. I hope that
that puts the issue into

the country. Getting the balance right is important, therefore, and is
exemplified in specific cases. The hon. Member for Ogmore told us about
his little, sad-looking White cattle in Plynlimon. I seem to remember
that Plynlimon 
<?notus-xml column=121?>is the wettest place in the United Kingdom—it

return to our carbon footprint in this country, UK beef and lamb
producers are among the most efficient globally. In 2010, the EU Joint
Research Centre published a report showing that British beef is
produced with less than half the emissions per kilogram than beef from
Brazil. Those results are supported by research undertaken by

Brazil is produced with 33% greater emissions than beef from the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:44:19"></hs_TimeCode>. The point I
am making, because many Members have been concerned about what carbon
footprinting is all about, is that it can be a useful tool to help
businesses identify inefficiencies and emissions hot spots in order to
improve not only environmental performance, but business efficiency and

was slightly concerned by the contributions of some Members, who
suggested a serious detriment to agricultural producers in this
country, which carbon footprinting is not. Carbon footprints are not
used in international policy making; they are tools for the
benchmarking and marketing of products. In England and Wales, we do not
have Government targets for mitigation in the agricultural sector.
International emission comparisons are made using greenhouse gas
inventories that are compiled under strict guidance issued by the
Inter- governmental Panel on Climate Change. It is important to
recognise that carbon footprinting can help the industry to meet not
only our societal needs, in dealing with greenhouse gases, but its
business needs, in doing the right thing. Carbon footprints are not
intended—I can certainly foresee no such intention—to be
introduced  as targets or as something that individual
producers must
fulfil<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:45:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062660000135">Nevertheless,
the industry wants to do better. The UK beef and sheep industry,
therefore, is seeking further emission reductions through the EBLEX
product road maps, recognising that measures to reduce agricultural
greenhouse gas emissions generally increase business efficiency and

APG made some specific points. Its report draws attention to the
problems of standardisation for carbon footprinting of the beef and
sheep sector. Under the previous Government, DEFRA worked with the
British Standards Institute and the Carbon Trust to develop the PAS
2050 standard for carbon footprinting and to encourage best practice.
PAS 2050 aims to simplify carbon footprinting so that it can be carried
out by a wider range of practitioners, and provides guidance to ensure
greater consistency in
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:46:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062660000137">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:47:56"></hs_TimeCode>
report is right to point out, however, areas of uncertainty where
flexibility is needed, so PAS 2050 is not prescriptive for individual
products, although it includes the potential for industry to develop
product guidelines known as “supplementary requirements”
to ensure that consistent approaches are used and to improve
comparability of results. The dairy sector, for example, 
<?notus-xml column=122?>has produced such guidance via DairyCo, in partnership with the Carbon

APG report also calls for improved accounting of soil carbon
sequestration in carbon footprinting. PAS 2050 provides for the
optional inclusion of soil carbon sequestration in carbon footprinting,
but we might have a misunderstanding about the terminology, which I
want to address. There is a distinction between carbon storage and
carbon sequestration: carbon storage is carbon that is held by
permanent pasture or any other land management system; and carbon
sequestration is a process by which carbon is captured in that
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:48:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062660000139">Scientific<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>
understanding indicates that UK pastures represent a significant store
of carbon, but do not tend to sequester additional carbon from the
atmosphere. That is where the distinction needs to be drawn. If we
change land management, of course we have a change—perhaps a
positive one, perhaps a negative one, but one that could be either
sequestration or release of carbon—but, in a steady state, we do
not have a movement of carbon on that basis. Where management practices
are employed to increase soil carbon sequestration, the benefits are
often small, uncertain and difficult to measure. Nevertheless, DEFRA
has invested £390,000 in a project to improve carbon accounting
under agricultural land management, including work to assess the extent
to which agricultural land management can enhance carbon sequestration
in the UK, the findings of which will support carbon footprinting
studies. We expect the results to be published in the spring of
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062660000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062660000140"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:49:50"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Bill Wiggin" PimsId="4600" UID="13062660000212" xid="632" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062660000212">Bill
Wiggin:</Member></B> My understanding of what the Minister said is that
grassland is better storage than a sequestration process. However, the
business of farming for cattle and sheep means that the carbon is
captured by the grass and then moved along the food chain as the cattle
eat the grass and become food and manure. That is the sequestration
process, and that is why it is important to measure

is a greenhouse gas and has an effect on climate change. I do not

not. That is transparently the case, but it is not a distinction that
should affect our consideration of emissions. Some processes and
activities are more avoidable than others, and some have a societal
interest. The hon. Lady’s contention is perfectly respectable
and she is entirely consistent in what she says about not using pasture
land to produce animals as we do at the moment. However, society
generally does not agree with that view. Society in this country
generally wants to eat meat and wants the most efficient and effective
processes, which is why we provide research support to help the
industry to make those processes as beneficial and as least harmful as
possible, but that does not mean that people do not want to eat meat.

geography of our country is such that defendants will be allocated a

rest of rural Wales. If a defendant from Newtown was allocated a duty
solicitor in Llanelli, a meeting would require the defendant or

the prison van. It had to take him back, as it had brought only two

tenders being awarded to less able and potentially less experienced

the provision of language services. I have anecdotal evidence that the

the Government will continue to uphold everyone’s right to a
fair trial. We do, however, have a duty to look at how the system is
working, taking into account the  
<?notus-xml column=131?>taxpayer, legal aid applicants and the legal profession as a whole.
Secondly, access to justice and access to taxpayer-funded legal aid
should not be confused. We have a duty to ensure that all public
expenditure is justified. Thirdly, the Legal Aid Agency would ensure,
as part of the tendering process, that all providers were capable of
delivering the full range of criminal legal aid services under contract
across their procurement areas. Quality-assured duty solicitors and
lawyers would still be available if these changes were implemented,
just as they are

would like to outline the rationale behind the legal aid proposals and
their potential impact in Wales. In its programme for government, the
coalition set out its intention to undertake a full review of the legal
aid scheme. Following consultation, the Government’s final
proposals culminated in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders Act 2012. As well as reducing the scope of the civil legal
aid scheme, the Act made sweeping reforms to the central administration
of the legal aid system. Through the introduction of the Legal Aid
Agency, we have strengthened accountability and introduced a more
rigorous approach to financial management. We estimate that those and
other reforms will save about £320 million per year by 2014-15,
but our legal aid scheme remains one of the most expensive in the
world. Legal aid spending in Wales has increased, as it has
dramatically in England.</hs_Para>

the record, I would like to dispel a few myths, which have been
highlighted this afternoon, about the model on which we consulted. The
400 figure relates to the number of contracts the Legal Aid Agency
would tender, not the number of firms in the market or the volume of
work available. The proposals on which we consulted do not prescribe
how many lawyers would be available or how those who have the contracts
can divide the work allocated to them. The proposed model would result
in a consolidation of the market, but that

the particular needs to be met in the provision of legal aid is of
course the provision of services in Welsh for those who want them. The
Government have no intention of changing the requirements placed on
legal aid providers operating in Wales to offer a bilingual
service—I can nail that concern for my hon. Friend. That that
issue, alongside many other practical considerations, is not expressly
addressed in the consultation document reflects the fact that it will
be, as at present, given effect through the Legal Aid Agency contracts
with providers. The document does not propose any change in current
practice, but that issue has been raised by some respondents to the
consultation and we will provide simple reassurance when we publish the
Government response.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:23:52"></hs_TimeCode> well as
raising the provision of services in Welsh, a number of legal aid
providers have set out their concerns about the operation of the
proposed competition model in rural areas, including rural Wales. Some
of those concerns have been echoed here this afternoon, and I propose
to raise them, highlighting the points made, with the Lord Chancellor
to inform his decision making when the consultation
concludes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000061">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:24:54"></hs_TimeCode>
consultation sets out a model of competition to cover the whole of
England and Wales and seeks to address the needs of both urban and
rural areas. In the cases of two regions—the areas covered by
West Mercia-Warwickshire and Avon and
Somerset-Gloucestershire—it makes an exception to the rule that
procurement areas will be based on current criminal justice areas, by
combining each pair into a single area. That proposal, however, is
based on the volume and type of work, rather than the areas’
rural geography. The consultation in fact sought views on whether the
geographical arrangement of contracts it set out was the right one and
sought alternatives. We are of course open to good suggestions and urge
the profession to work with us to come up with the best solution. The
appropriateness of the model to rural Wales was raised during the

have been expressed about the Government’s decision to publish
the transforming legal aid consultation in English before the Welsh

is unfair to suggest that the Ministry of Justice has not taken its
commitments under its Welsh language scheme seriously. The Department
has committed to treating English and Welsh equally, as far as is
reasonably practicable, and that is what we did. Translating a document
of that length and complexity takes time, and it was published as soon
as it was available. In translating the entirety of the document, we
have gone further than the previous 2010 legal aid consultation. In
deciding not to delay publication of the English version until the
Welsh version was ready, we were conscious that the majority of the
target audience in Wales comprises legal aid providers required to
provide services in English, as well as Welsh. Moreover, when the
previous legal aid consultation was published in 2010, only the
executive summary was translated; the Department did not receive
requests for a full translation in Welsh and we did not receive any
responses in Welsh. We have so far identified about 10
responses to the current consultation in Welsh. That we have had
responses in Welsh reflects, I hope, that legal professionals working

consortia he mentioned, of small solicitors practices coming together,
can be realised? Finally, he mentioned 
<?notus-xml column=134?>a consultation event in Cardiff, where I know some of my local

General hospital has served the people of my constituency for 115
years. It is where my children were born, and where my granddads
received care at the end of their lives—where I said goodbye to
them—and today it is a place that is relied on by my family and
my constituents. I declare an interest in that it is where my mum, like
many thousands of local people, works. Kettering General hospital is a
huge part of the community, because of the care it provides and because
it is one of the major local
employers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:31:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
of my constituents are employed there, as nurses, doctors and auxiliary
staff, and I take this opportunity to thank them, in whatever capacity
they work. Working in our health services is demanding and, for most
health workers, not particularly well paid. The hours are long and the
demands are great, but the overwhelming majority of my constituents
receive good care, and for that we are all
grateful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000070">However,
we have to face some hard truths. The quality of care at the hospital
is not good for everyone. It is not realistic to think that 100% of my
constituents will get perfect care every time, but it is something for
which we should surely strive. All the evidence shows that too many
people do not get the care they need. Kettering General hospital
employs more than 3,000 staff, and has more than 600
in-patient and day-case beds and 17 operating theatres. The hospital
has a consultant-led level 2 trauma unit in its 24-hours-a-day,
seven-days-a-week accident and emergency department, and there are
currently two locums and five consultants who are on site
until  11 o’clock in the evening and on call until 8
o’clock in the morning. Some cases, such as severe burns and
head injuries, are transferred, often by air ambulance, to Coventry,
which has a level 3 trauma facility, but Kettering General hospital is
where most trauma patients go. It serves the accident and emergency
needs of a wide population across north

inadequate consultation on the proposals. The public gradually became
aware of them, the thrust of which was for five hospitals to go into
three for some of the services, particularly full accident
and emergency, obstetrics and maternity, and in-patient paediatrics.
The detailed model underpinning the proposals stated that the best

hospitals, recognised that communities in my constituency
and across the north of Northamptonshire would not support the
proposals. Our nearest accident and emergency would be at Northampton
general, and anyone who knows the county and understands its geography
will recognise that that is not acceptable.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:35:07"></hs_TimeCode> do not need
the independent experts—as they were called—employed by
the Healthier Together team to tell us that it is almost impossible to

coming to a standstill. There is no rail link between the towns in the
north of the county and Northampton, and the bus service is
intermittent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000076">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:35:27"></hs_TimeCode>
Department says that it expects proposals for local health service
changes to meet four key criteria: support from GPs; strengthened
public and patient engagement; sound clinical evidence; and that the
proposals support patient choice. I do not believe, nor do the hon.
Members for Kettering and for Wellingborough, that those four criteria
were met in the Healthier Together work. And it is not just in my area.
Councillor Hannah O’Neill, the deputy leader of the Labour group
on Milton Keynes council, told me that Healthier Together caused
uncertainty across Milton Keynes, that neither communities nor the
council was properly consulted, and that they were left with no
information about the future of the programme for their hospital. A
critical issue for the whole south midlands Healthier Together area is

and maternity services but in improving the health system. We need a
more integrated health and social care system. I will study the detail

need local authorities to act more quickly to get elderly patients out
of hospital once they have been treated, so that they can have the care

issue is how primary and acute care will work together in the future.
It is also about prevention, about which I heard the Minister speak
last week at an event organised by Cambridge Manufacturing, a great

am sorry to tell the Minister that instead of moving towards an
improved service, there are very serious issues at Kettering A and E.
This is a very worrying time. The hospital simply cannot cope with
demand; we have rising demand, and an ageing and growing population.
There are issues relating to the local doctor services and the
out-of-hour services, and twice this year the general hospital had to
close the doors of the A and E to patients other than those arriving by
ambulance, announcing it to the media and asking local Members of
Parliament to tell patients not to turn

is the fastest-growing town in the UK and has the highest birth rate,

number of people attending the A and E department at Kettering General

2012. That 100% increase is far greater than the rate of population
growth, and growth continued last year. We have continued growth in
Northamptonshire’s elderly population, so an increase in acuity,
for example, is to be expected, with more people with more complex
problems who really do need A and E care. The trust’s emergency
department was not designed to see that many patients. In the

significant issues around the inappropriate use of accident and

increase in the number of people waiting for more than four hours. In
April 2012, 262 people waited more than four hours, but in April 2013
that figure stood at 1,530 people. A year on, we can see how
significant the rise in the number of people waiting for more than four
hours is. Breaches of the target are largely because of patients
waiting in A and E for hospital beds to become available. Kettering
General hospital’s bed base runs very hot: 95% to 100% of beds
are full. It is therefore often bed availability in the whole hospital,

hope that the Minister will comment on the seriousness of the Care
Quality Commission report published in March. It stated that action is
needed on cleanliness and infection control, on supporting workers and,
in particular, on assessing and monitoring the quality of service
provision. In fact, so severe were its findings that it has taken
enforcement action against the

report makes mixed reading. Most patients seen by the CQC generally
commend the hospital. As I said at the outset, most people’s
experience is good, but where it is not good, it can be very
disappointing. For example, because of that huge rise in demand in
accident and emergency, the CQC found open storage of needles and
syringes, containers overflowing with syringes, and 
<?notus-xml column=139?>noisy and rusty bins in areas of the department, and
it observed that the public toilets were dirty and that floors appeared
dirty and
stained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:43:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000092">As
the CQC has stated, that situation was not because the hospital staff
were not working incredibly hard—it observed that the staff were
working with clear protocols and trying to do the right
thing—but the facility is now frankly too small for what is
really needed to serve the north of Northamptonshire. It is cramped,
which really affects the quality of
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000093">The
CQC specifically mentioned long waiting times. I have heard cases of
people waiting up to 10 hours, which is clearly unacceptable. Not only
are there the waits in accident and emergency, but, having been seen in
A and E, there are the waits to be transferred to wards in the
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:44:05"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are also knock-on effects. The CQC highlighted issues in orthopaedic
and surgical wards, where other medical admissions from A and E have
become a way of life, because the beds are needed, but those wards do
not have the staff, the expertise or the capacity to meet the needs of
the patients
transferred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:44:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000094">I
want to hear from the Minister an understanding of the pressures facing
us in Kettering General hospital’s accident and emergency, and
support for initiatives that the local chair, chief executive, trust
and staff are taking and which we are trying to support. We want to
support this incredibly important hospital.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:44:48"></hs_TimeCode> also want a
commitment to capital improvements in accident and emergency. Whether
that comes from what I understand is a dedicated fund in the Department
of Health for capital improvements for A and E that is underspent or
from the general NHS underspend, I hope that we will hear about it
today. I also hope that she will comment on the issues about how the
health system works

themes and problems are often common to all our accident and emergency
departments. Undoubtedly, many of the problems at Kettering’s
accident and emergency are exactly the same as those that have caused
so much difficulty in other A and E departments in this country. I am

hon. Gentleman has pointed out how health services are under pressure
in his constituency and having a knock-on effect at Kettering, and
those pressures are being experienced across the whole system. He quite
properly identified that the reasons for that are complex. Dealing with
those pressures means looking at the underlying causes, which the
Department has been doing by working with NHS
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:48:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000103">The
hon. Gentleman pointed out that Kettering General Hospital NHS
Foundation Trust is experiencing many of the issues that I have
highlighted. I am aware that, as he told us, the trust has not met the
A and E standard. It has struggled with that difficulty for some time.
He will know that Monitor, as the regulator of foundation trusts, has
unfortunately found that the trust is in breach of its licence in
relation to its A and E performance, as well as wider financial and
governance issues. That will cause concern not only to the people who
use the hospital, but to its outstanding
staff<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:48:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000104">Monitor
has required the trust to implement an urgent care action plan to
ensure that it can return to compliance against the A and E standard.
The deadline for that is 1 July, so it will not be long before the
trust has to implement it. Monitor is working with local commissioners
and NHS England to support the trust to meet that
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000105">I
appreciate that the hon. Gentleman feels that further investment is
needed to expand facilities at the trust to improve its position. It is
right that, as I understand it, he has had meetings with the chair of
the trust and other Members of Parliament, and that letters have been
written, to request assistance in securing extra capital funding. Some
£5 million to £10 million has been requested, so that the
trust can redevelop and expand its A and E
department.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062663000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/halltext/130626h0002.htm#13062663000106">Of
course it is for NHS foundation trusts to develop and take forward
their own capital investment proposals, and trusts such as Kettering
can apply to the Department for a capital investment loan. We
understand that the trust has allocated some of its capital budget this
year to make improvements within A and E, and it has worked with
commissioners to redesign what we call pathways to improve flow. Hot
clinics and ambulatory pathways have been developed, which divert
patients away from A and E and avoid GP admissions, which, as we know,
often stack up in the Department.</hs_Para>

the matter of whether Kettering has ever closed its doors, I am told
that its accident and emergency department has never done so, and it is
important to put that on the record. I am told that there was a period 
<?notus-xml column=141?>in February when the hospital trust effectively advised members of the
public—I think that this sounds like a sensible piece of
advice—to ensure that they only went to A and E if they had had
an accident or an emergency. In other words, to use the jargon, they
were told to use the department appropriately, because the trust had
become aware of a sudden and acute rise in people using A and E.
Actually, that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:51:13"></hs_TimeCode>
is a good message for all of us to take back to our constituents. The
department is not called “accident and emergency” for no
good reason; it is for accidents and emergencies.</hs_Para>

debate on A and E in the main Chamber, Members from both sides told
stories about people presenting at A and E when they could have gone to
the pharmacy or just taken a paracetamol. The point I am making is
that, often for understandable reasons, people attend A and E when they
cannot get the appointment they want at the GP surgery. There is this
wider issue that perhaps we do not do what we used to do in the past,
which was to self-administer, take advice from our brilliant pharmacies
or ring the GP surgery for advice before simply turning up at A and
E.</hs_Para>

I have said, meetings have taken place, and, as I understand it, the
trust has been working with local commissioners in the way that I have
described. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the new Corby urgent care
centre. I think I saw it before I was in this position—I was
there for other reasons which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will
understand—when it was in the process of being constructed. I am
delighted that it is now open. It is called an urgent care centre. To
be frank, we do not always use the best language when it comes to
naming places where patients can go. In fact, the review, which is
being conducted in the Department of Health, is looking at the sort of
language that should be used, so that people understand where they have
to go when they have a particular problem. I am delighted that the
centre has opened in Corby and is providing additional urgent care
services to the hon. Gentleman’s constituents, which should help
to ease the unnecessary attendances at the A and E department of
Kettering General.</hs_Para>

it  has robust turnaround plans in place to improve its

the high standards that we all expect of it has been a long-standing
problem in the east midlands. It is now implementing proposals to
improve the way it delivers services across the east midlands through
its “being the best” programme. That includes the
replacement of some ambulance stations, including the one in Corby. It
is creating 108 community ambulance posts, 19 ambulance stations and
nine purpose-built hubs or superstations to enable ambulances to be
dispatched from strategic points across the region to meet demand. I
know that the “being the best” proposals have been
referred to the Secretary of State by Lincolnshire county council. I do
not know whether Northamptonshire will now take the same course, but it
may not need to as Lincolnshire has already made the referral. As a
result, the Independent Reconfiguration Panel is due to advise in the

because the CQC can

says that there are issues at Kettering General hospital’s A and
E department that are in common with those in other hospitals. Finally,
I draw her attention to the exceptional case for investment in
Kettering General hospital, because of the growth in population
locally. Corby has the highest birth rate in the country; it is the
fastest growing town in the country; and the Northamptonshire area is
one of the fastest growing areas in the country, so this is an
exceptional case.</hs_Para>

measures of cycling are known to be volatile year-to-year because of
the relatively small number of regular cyclists in the NTS sample. In

the difficulty in measuring this relatively uncommon mode of transport.

delivered, within the provisions of the Business Rate Supplement Act

the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1591, there is still
ongoing conflict in Darfur, and that the security situation has
worsened since the start of 2013. A factor in this insecurity is the
continuing supply of weapons to all parties to the conflict in Darfur
in contravention of the arms embargo in UNSCR 1591. Alongside UNAMID,
the Panel of Experts established by UNSCR 1591 remains a key monitoring
mechanism, providing the Security Council with regular briefings and
reports on the situation in Darfur. The UK continues to value and
support the work of the Panel of Experts. Four individuals have been
sanctioned on the recommendation of the Panel, though the Sudanese

Wright:</Member></B> The Government has consulted on a number of
proposals to reform legal aid via the ‘Transforming Legal Aid:
delivering a more credible and efficient system’ consultation
which closed on 4 June 2013. This included proposed model of
competitive tendering for criminal legal aid services. We have been
clear we must continue to bear down on the cost of legal aid, including
the £1 billion of taxpayers’ money spent on criminal
legal aid a year, to ensure we are getting the best deal for the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062688001844" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/text/130626w0002.htm#13062688001844">The

proposed model would ensure that providers have exclusive access to a
share of the work available (and control of the case from beginning to
end). By awarding longer and larger contracts with greater certainty of
volumes, providers would have increased opportunities to grow their
businesses and invest in the restructuring required to achieve
economies of scale and scope and provide a more efficient service at a
price that offers a saving to the public but is also sustainable. This
model would result in a reduction in the number of contracts available
but gives providers the freedom to develop the most efficient approach
in delivering the service (e.g. the extent to which they use agents).
This approach would also deliver a reduction in administrative costs to
the
LAA.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062688001846" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/text/130626w0002.htm#13062688001846">In

on our assessment of the factors listed above, the LAA data for the
period October 2010 to September 2011 would suggest approximately 400
contracts with providers across England and Wales. This would mean
current providers would need to grow their business on average by
around 250% (or join with other providers to create sufficient resource
to deliver the expected caseload).</hs_Para>

would entail a significant reduction in the number of contracts in each
procurement area. A detailed breakdown of the illustrative number of
contracts based on the LAA administrative data on legal aid claims in
the period October 2010 to September 2011 in each procurement area is
set out in the consultation paper. Subject to the outcome of this

additional hearing venues across HMCTS estate, and increasing the use
of Saturday sessions, HMCTS continues to respond strongly at a national

reduce waiting times. Measures in place include ongoing recruitment of

continuous improvement of administrative processes both internally and

In line with evidence from the annual Statistical First Releases of the

slightly higher attainment at key stage 3. Once socio-economic

the research did find that some groups, such as pupils whose mothers
have lower levels of qualifications, are making less progress in rural
than urban areas. This problem is also highlighted by the recent Ofsted

Government is considering Ofsted's recommendations
and will respond in due course. Closing the
attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers is at the

premium, worth £2.5 billion per

Every child eligible for the pupil premium attracts the same

Laws:</Member></B> The Government believes that it is unacceptable for
children's achievement at school and success in life to be constrained
by economic disadvantage. This is why in April 2011 we introduced the
pupil premium: additional funding for schools to raise the attainment
of pupils who have been registered for free school meals at any point
in the past six years and for children in care who have been looked
after by a local authority continuously for more than six months. The
grant is worth £900 per pupil for 2013-14, and the total pupil
premium will amount to £2.5 billion in 2014-15.</hs_Para>

pupil premium was introduced, the attainment of disadvantaged pupils
has improved. Results for 2012, the first year to reflect the impact of
a full year of pupil premium, showed a larger than expected narrowing
of attainment gaps nationally for both key stage 2 and key stage
4.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062688002091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/text/130626w0002.htm#13062688002091">The

is no definition of an internship in minimum wage legislation. The key
issue is whether or not interns are workers as defined by minimum wage

not eligible for the minimum wage. Voluntary workers are workers,
however, they are exempt from the national minimum wage (NMW)

access to 17 public service broadcasting digital terrestrial (DTT)
channels and just under 90% of UK households are also able to receive
these and additional channels. Around 1.5% of UK households cannot
easily receive digital terrestrial television, with less than 0.5% not

constituency area are broadcast only from larger transmitters such as
the main Winter Hill transmitter near Bolton. Households in many parts

Heath:</Member></B> On 9 February, the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced a package of measures to
tackle irresponsible ownership of dogs. Included in the package was the
extension of the criminal offence of allowing a dog to be dangerously
out of control to all places; a requirement, from April 2016, for all
dogs to be microchipped; and that the new 
<?notus-xml column=312?>early intervention measures to deal with anti-social
behaviour will apply to such instances where they involve a dog. The
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill is currently before
Parliament and contains clauses that will extend the criminal offence
to all places and the appropriate antisocial behaviour measures. The
Bill will also make it an offence to allow a dog to attack an
assistance dog. I therefore consider that the necessary measures for
tackling all instances of irresponsible ownership of dogs, including
where a dog attacks another dog, are being taken forward by this
Government.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13062697000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/text/130626w0003.htm#13062697000046"><B><Member PimsId="5645" UID="13062697000837" xid="1132" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130626/text/130626w0003.htm#13062697000837">Andrew

The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these
offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with.
When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is
the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same
disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is
the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are
