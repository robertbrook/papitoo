course this House thought that that is exactly what it had done, as it

5,528? The Government are failing on this, and it is little to do with
what he has said. Given that one of the best ways of making sure that
suspected criminals are deported from this country is the European

Immigration Bill better to regulate migrant access to benefits and
public services. We will: get tougher on employers of illegal workers;
prevent illegal migrants from obtaining driving licences; and require
private landlords to make checks on prospective tenants. We will also
further restrict access to social housing and restrict migrant access
to benefits by tightening the habitual residence test and closing the
loophole that currently allows migrants without a right to work here to
access contributory benefits. With our European partners, we will also
tackle free movement abuse and its impact on social welfare and public

for his question, particularly as, like him, I have constituents who
use that trust. We have a national health service, not an international
health service. The rules governing migrant access to the NHS are too
generous and ineffectively applied, meaning that they are open to
abuse. That is why the Government propose reforming the residence test
that governs free NHS access, and are proposing options under which
temporary migrants would make a contribution before they used
our health service— either through an up-front NHS
access fee, or through comprehensive health insurance. We also intend
to end free unrestricted access to general practitioners by visitors
and illegal migrants, and to introduce measures better to identify
patients who must be

of course, leading politicians from the United States, Canada, the
eurozone and the United Kingdom. Given that those people were clearly
discussing some of the biggest issues confronting the western economies
at this time, why have we heard no statement from the Prime Minister,
the Chancellor or, indeed, the Minister without Portfolio, all of whom
attended in an official capacity? Why did none of them offer a
statement, although decisions of this kind may well have a significant
effect on UK Government policy or the livelihood of future UK

is said by some, including the right hon. and learned Gentleman, that
Bilderberg is a conspiracy. Of course it is not a conspiracy.
Nevertheless, 130 of the world’s top decision makers do not
travel thousands of miles simply for a cosy chat. Those people came
here in order to concert their plans to deal with a particularly
awkward stage in western capitalism, and in view of that we, the
public, are entitled to ask some questions and to hold them to account.

Clarke:</Member></B> The Bilderberg meeting does not make any
decisions. It does not have any resolutions. We could not possibly
reach decisions, because of the range of opinions represented there. It
is purely a Chatham House rules discussion between the people to whom
the right hon. Gentleman referred. The shadow Chancellor was there,
Peter Mandelson was there, the Prime Minister was there, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer was there, and most of us said things during the
discussion that would not have come as a surprise to any of us, because
we knew what our opinions were. We go there for the chance of having an
off-the-record, informal discussion with the range of people described
by the right hon. Gentleman, who are indeed distinguished, but who are
not remotely interested in getting together to decide or organise
anything.</hs_Para>

lies behind his question—I will take his own distinguished
claims to participation in the group carefully into account, although I

further.</hs_Para>

with the greatest respect that this is total, utter nonsense. I would
normally regard the right hon. Gentleman as not the sort of person to

political and other discussions as private individuals, under Chatham
House rules, and we do not expect everyone to go out giving a version
of what we have just said. No one alters their opinions when we are
there. As for transparency, this Government are by a street the most

classified US documents relating to the collection of intelligence by
US agencies, and questions about the role of GCHQ. The US
Administration have begun a review into the circumstances of these

therefore understand that I will not be drawn into confirming or

ISC’s work is one part of the strong framework of democratic
accountability and oversight that governs the use of secret
intelligence in the United Kingdom, which successive Governments have
worked to strengthen. At its heart are two Acts of Parliament: the
Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Regulation of Investigatory
Powers Act
2000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0001.htm#13061011000237">The
Acts require GCHQ and the other agencies to seek authorisation for
their operations from a Secretary of State, normally the Foreign
Secretary or Home Secretary. As Foreign Secretary, I receive hundreds
of operational proposals from the SIS and GCHQ every year. The
proposals are detailed: they set out the planned operation, the
potential risks and the intended benefits of the intelligence. They
include comprehensive legal advice describing the basis for the
operation, and comments from senior Foreign Office officials and
lawyers. To intercept the content of any individual’s
communications in the UK requires a warrant signed personally by me,
the Home Secretary, or by another Secretary of State. This is no casual
process. Every decision is based on extensive legal and policy advice.
Warrants are legally required to be necessary, proportionate and
carefully targeted, and we judge them on that basis.</hs_Para>

of privacy are also at the forefront of our minds, as I believe they
will have been in the minds of our predecessors. We take great care to
balance individual privacy with our duty to safeguard the public and
the UK’s national security. These are often difficult and finely
judged decisions, and we do not approve every proposal put before us by
the agencies. All the authorisations that the Home Secretary and I give
are subject to independent review by an Intelligence Services
Commissioner and an Interception of Communications Commissioner, both
of whom must have held high judicial office and report directly to the
Prime Minister. They review the way these decisions are made to ensure
that they are fully compliant with the law. They have full access to
all the information that they need to carry out their responsibilities,
and their reports are publicly available. It is vital that we have that
framework of democratic accountability and scrutiny.</hs_Para>

combination of needing a warrant from one of the most senior members of
the Government, decided on the basis of detailed legal advice, and such
decisions being reviewed by independent commissioners and implemented
by agencies with strong legal and ethical frameworks, with the addition

relationship that is unique in the world. This 
<?notus-xml column=33?>relationship has been and remains essential to the
security of both nations, has stopped many terrorist and espionage
plots against this country, and has saved many lives. The basic
principles by which that co-operation operates have not changed over
time. Indeed, I wish to emphasise to the House that although we have
experienced an extremely busy period in intelligence and diplomacy in
the past three years, the arrangements for oversight, and the general
framework for exchanging information with the United States, are the
same as under previous Governments. The growing and diffuse nature of
threats from terrorists, criminals or espionage has only increased the
importance of our intelligence relationship with the United States.
That was particularly the case in the run-up to the Olympics. The House
will not be surprised to hear that our activity to counter terrorism
intensified and rose to a peak in the summer of last year.</hs_Para>

admiration across the House for the work of the intelligence agencies.
Many former Ministers from the previous Government—indeed, there

least recognised that goes into protecting this country, so there is
strong common ground across the House on

right hon. Gentleman said that we should be able, now and in future, to
give people assurances about the law-abiding nature of the work of the
agencies, which of course is a large part of the purpose of what I have
just explained to the House. I am not saying that the agencies, anyone
who works in them or, indeed, Ministers are incapable of
error—that can happen in any organisation—but I am
arguing that there is a strong system of checks and balances. A
combination of ministerial oversight, independent scrutiny,
parliamentary oversight, the legal framework and the strong ethical
framework of the agencies themselves minimises the chance of errors
happening in any sinister
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0001.htm#13061011000265">Sometimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>
people can get the impression, when reading discussions in the media
about this, that there is a danger of a “deep state” that
is in some way out of control. There is not that danger in the United
Kingdom. Of course everyone is capable of error, but the protection of
this country’s citizens from such error is very strong indeed. I
must stress that there will always be ways of improving
procedures—many improvements have been made in recent years,
under successive Administrations—and there are always new
situations that arise in intelligence 
<?notus-xml column=37?>gathering that require additions to or the
refinement of the legal basis of what we do and the practices and
procedures by which we do that work. I do not argue at all that
everything is definitely perfect, and certainly not for all time, with
regard to whether in future there could be any improvements in
procedures in some areas, because I am sure that there could be. The
Intelligence and Security Committee will be able to look at that and
make recommendations if it so wishes, and of course within the

including section 3 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the RIPA
provisions, set out in sections 15 and 16, which regulate that

how the agencies must handle information when they obtain
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0001.htm#13061011000268">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T16:18:55"></hs_TimeCode>

him what could actually be a very helpful answer, but because
circumstances and procedures vary according to the situation, I do not
want to give a categorical answer—in a small respect
circumstances might differ occasionally. But I can say that ministerial
oversight and independent scrutiny is there, and there is
scrutiny of the ISC in all these situations, so, again, the idea that
operations are carried out without ministerial oversight, somehow
getting around UK law, is mistaken. I am afraid that I cannot be more

American citizens, who receive rigorous protection of their privacy,

Friend a specific answer about specific discussions, of course we

to make sure, as best we can, that our values and our legal frameworks

of what they are doing to protect the country. There is a strong

Acts that I have referred to, passed by Parliament, apply to all the
intelligence gathered by the agencies. The hon. Gentleman will know
that, for instance, section 3 of the Intelligence Services
Act 1994 confers particular powers and roles on GCHQ, so these things
are governed by the same Acts of Parliament. Procedures differ, of
course, in many different situations. It is because I cannot describe
all those situations in public that I cannot go into exactly what that

reassuring the hon. Gentleman or the shadow Foreign Secretary as they

There is a need to explain to the public in this country more than we
have done for decades about the role of secret intelligence, its
purpose and what it achieves. However, I do not think that will mean
that we are able to describe in detail how our co-operation with other
countries works on operational matters, for many obvious reasons. It
would make it more difficult for us to protect this country if other
people knew the exact techniques that we used. Also, other countries
would be less willing to share their intelligence with the UK if they
thought that we were not good at keeping it to ourselves. But we
certainly need to raise public awareness of the need for what we do,
and I started to do that in my speech on this subject in 2011. Perhaps
today’s statement will also have that

the many checks and balances and the strong legal framework. On all the
controversies that he lists about the past—and they are
controversies rather than necessarily facts—it would be fair to
point out that there has been a constant process under successive
Governments of improving how the intelligence agencies work. After the
controversies over the use of intelligence in the Iraq war, for
instance, we saw the Butler report, which has substantially changed the
way intelligence is presented to Ministers and the way that Ministers
decide. I referred in my statement to the creation of the National
Security Council and to intelligence being given its due but proper

our armed forces. Let me reassure the House that that is emphatically
not the proposition. If GoCo is the selected option, the GoCo partner
will manage DE&amp;S on behalf of the Secretary of State. It will act
as his agent. All contracts will continue to be entered into in the
name of the Secretary of State. Strategic direction will be provided by
a governance function that will remain within the MOD. The
GoCo’s customers will be the front-line commands and the 
<?notus-xml column=51?>MOD itself. The DE&amp;S work force will be

the GoCo is assumed to be able to recruit and reward its staff at
market rates—a critical freedom in a business that is required
to deal with the private commercial sector on a daily basis. The
proposal set out in the White Paper is for a phased transfer of
DE&amp;S to a GoCo, with checks and break points to allow us to
halt the process if it is not delivering the results we require. The
legislation and the contract will include a transfer regime that will
allow the Secretary of State to transfer the business to another
contractor, or back to the MOD, in extremis. If, at the end of the
assessment phase, a GoCo operating model is selected, we will need to
be able to move quickly to conclude a contract with the successful

and deliver far-reaching reform must also be collective. We therefore
welcome much of today’s
statement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000372" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000372">Future
procurement systems must provide value for money within financial
constraints. Better performance will come from greater professional
project management, faster decision making, fuller accountability for
outcomes and a more considered use of military expertise. Labour
supports reforms—the Bernard Gray report, on which 
<?notus-xml column=53?>today’s White Paper is based, was commissioned by the previous
Government. We have proposed a new budgetary discipline, whereby
deferred decisions that increase cost are accounted for within a
rolling 10-year cycle, and increased certainty for industry over
sovereign and off-the-shelf capabilities.</hs_Para>

Members are open-minded about how that is achieved, but I wish to be
clear that welcoming this process today is not the same thing as
supporting a GoCo in principle. There needs to be rigorous examination
of all the possible options and a robust comparison between the two
options of a GoCo model and DE&amp;S+. That comparison should rest on
the principles of ensuring value for money within programmes; industry
adhering to new targets on time and cost; maintaining parliamentary
accountability; enhancing a culture of consequence for decision makers;
and military involvement being based on tri-service working, not on
single-service rivalry. So reform must extend across the Ministry of
Defence. Too often, scope creep has led to systems exceeding identified
need, and major decisions have been pushed to the right to save in the
short term at the expense of longer-term budgetary bow wave.
Today’s challenge for Ministers is not just to determine a
management model, but to demonstrate that decades-long entrenched
behaviours are being
corrected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000374">Let
me deal with the specifics of today’s announcement. On the
assessment phase, will the Secretary of State pledge to publish the
findings of the two value-for-money studies and allow for a
consideration by this House prior to a final decision being taken in
the legislation? It is essential that Parliament, industry and our
armed forces have full confidence that strategic affordability is the
determining factor in this process. On costs, will the Secretary of
State say whether the new management team of either model would re-cost
the baseline of the core equipment programme, or would the figures
published earlier this year remain? Furthermore, in light of the
National Audit Office’s observation that the MOD’s
assessment of risk is “not statistically viable”, would
the new management be able to reform the current method of risk
assessment? On staffing, the MOD has said that current reductions will
not affect outputs. Would either management model be able to make
decisions over staffing independently from the Secretary of State? Will
he confirm that trade unions will be consulted throughout the
assessment
phase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000375" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000375">It
is essential to maximise military expertise, so will the Secretary of
State say whether he considers it preferable to change the current
ratio of military to civilian numbers in procurement within the MOD?
Specifically on the GoCo, will he pledge that senior officials
currently working on this process within the MOD will not be able to
work for the GoCo consortium without a prolonged period of purdah? Many
in the country will have a concern about the extent of a private
entity’s potential reach over public policy. So, under these
plans would a GoCo model cover the whole equipment programme, including
the nuclear deterrent? What is the time scale for the implementation of
a GoCo? That will enable us to judge when efficiencies may begin to
accrue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000376" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000376">One
of the biggest uncertainties around GoCo has to do with the ownership
of risk and whether contractors could generate private profit while
financial risk remained in public hands. For example, can the Secretary
of State say whether liability for the £468 million cost overrun

<?notus-xml column=54?>noted in the National Audit Office’s “Major Projects
Report 2012” would have rested with the taxpayer or the GoCo,
had it been

the single source regulations office, we welcome the proposal in
principle and will examine it closely. It is essential to drive
down cost where possible in single sourcing, as the Secretary of State
said. Will he say a little more about who would appoint the members,
and whether regulations would be subject to the one-in, one-out
rule?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000378">In
conclusion, we will support what we hope is a genuine competition. We
will scrutinise the processes carefully, because efficient and
effective defence procurement is essential, not just for the Ministry
of Defence bottom line, but for the remarkable men and women of our

Hammond:</Member></B> I am grateful to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:20:45"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Gentleman for his welcome of this announcement. Of course I completely
accept that the Opposition’s willingness to look at the issues
with an open mind is not the same as an uncritical endorsement of the
GoCo concept, and just in case I did not make this clear in my opening
remarks, we have not yet accepted the GoCo concept as the chosen
outcome; we are conducting an assessment. However, I think we agree
across the House—Opposition Members who have, in office,
experienced the challenge of trying to make the defence budget add up
will certainly agree—on the need for change. The intentions are
very
clear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000380" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000380">The
process that we are talking about was kicked off by the Gray report,
published in 2009. I note that the then Secretary of State has strongly
endorsed the GoCo model, which he feels is the way forward. We are
examining the case for GoCo against the baseline of DE&amp;S+. We have
two separate teams, working with Chinese walls between them, that are
equally resourced. One is trying to build the maximum
fully-public-sector case that it can, taking advantage of all freedoms
and flexibilities available. The other is working with potential GoCo
bidders to look at the value that they can deliver. At the end of the
process, we will make a
comparison.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000381" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000381">The
right hon. Gentleman talked about the cost drivers from past scope
creep. One of the clear advantages of changing the way that DE&amp;S
works is creating a harder boundary between the customer and the
company supplying the requirements, making it less easy for scope to
creep without a proper change process and proper recognition of the
costs involved. He asked me whether the baseline would be re-costed. We
do not anticipate a re-costing of the programme baseline. If we go down
the GoCo route, we will negotiate with GoCo bidders for an incentivised
fee structure, based on the existing costed programme. He will know
that an independent cost advisory service sits alongside DE&amp;S, and
will play a continuing role in independently assessing the costs of
projects and the appropriate level of risk to be attached to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000382" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000382">Unsurprisingly,
the right hon. Gentleman asked me about staffing levels in a post-GoCo
DE&amp;S, if GoCo is the selected solution. The staffing transfer would
be made under the TUPE regulations. We anticipate about 8,000 of
DE&amp;S’s projected 14,500 2015 staff numbers transferring to
the new entity, with the remainder—in 
<?notus-xml column=55?>naval dockyards, logistics, communications, and information
services—remaining in other parts of Government, or being
outsourced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000383" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000383">There
is no reason to suppose that the GoCo route is more likely to deliver
further staffing reductions than any other route. Clearly, the new
management team, whether it is a GoCo or DE&amp;S+, will seek to run
the business efficiently, and to use the freedoms and flexibilities
available to it to deliver outputs as effectively as
possible.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman asked me about the ratio of military to civilian
personnel in DE&amp;S. At present about 25% of the personnel in
DE&amp;S are military. We expect the military role, which will be
performed by secondees in the future, to focus on providing
specifically military advice to the DE&amp;S organisation, rather than
filling line management and project management roles, so I do not
expect the military proportion of staff to increase, and it may
decrease under a future
model<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000385" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000385">The
right hon. Gentleman asked me a question, the motivation for which I
entirely understand, about senior officials. Nobody wants to see such
exercises becoming a gilded exit route for senior officials, and I am
pleased to be able to tell him that the Chief of Defence
Matériel, the most senior official in DE&amp;S, will transfer to
the MOD side—the customer side—of the equation and will
be responsible for designing and managing the customer side. I cannot,
as the right hon. Gentleman knows, give him an absolute assurance that
other officials in the Department, should they choose to leave the
Department, would not at some point in the future be able to join a
GoCo, but of course there are rules and restrictions in place—a
Cabinet Office regime which has been reinforced following revelations
in <I>The Sunday Times</I> last year—and we will make sure that
nobody is able to abuse this

right hon. Gentleman asked me whether the GoCo would cover the nuclear
deterrent. It will certainly cover the procurement of Vanguard
replacement submarines. The management of our nuclear warheads is
carried out by the Atomic Weapons Establishment, itself already a GoCo.
We have not yet finally decided whether the new GoCo, if there is one,
will be responsible for managing the MOD’s relationship with AWE
or whether that will be managed directly. That will be one of the
issues dealt with in negotiation with potential GoCo
bidders<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000387" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000387">On
timescale, I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that we expect to reach
a decision in the summer of next year, with a view to the new
arrangements, whether GoCo or DE&amp;S, being stood up before the end
of
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000388" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000388">Finally,
I turn to the question of risk ownership. This is an important point
which has been somewhat misunderstood by some commentators. Clearly, it
would be very attractive to think that we could transfer the programme
risk in the defence equipment programme—£160 billion of
it—to somebody in the private sector, but the reality is that
there is nobody who has a balance sheet big enough, probably anywhere
in the world, and the taxpayer would not be prepared to accept the
price for taking on that risk, so the risk ownership in the programme
will remain with the Government and the taxpayer. What the private
sector partner will be at risk for is his fee, which will be structured
in such a way as to incentivise the delivery of the key performance
indicators 
<?notus-xml column=56?>that will be agreed with the partner during the negotiation process.
That will be designed to align the GoCo partner’s incentives
with the interests and priorities of the Department. That is where a

I suspect that, in the way that generally happens, there is a potential
win-win situation here—a win for the taxpayer in terms of lower
public expenditure and a win for the armed forces in terms of greater
capabilities being able to be purchased. I think I included these
figures in my statement, but the independent estimates are that
somewhere between £1.3 billion and £2.2 billion of
frictional costs generated by inefficiencies in the procurement system
are incurred every year. It would be a very rash man who suggested that
we can squeeze out every last pound of those, but I would expect us to
be able to achieve net gains after taking account of the cost of the

to look carefully at the issue of military project managers and at the

with a project manager and an expensive military adviser, rather than
one uniformed officer driving it forward. It is worth looking at the

£1.6 billion. What was actually done in 2010, in
relation to the submarine enterprise, was a reconfiguration of the
programme between the Astute class submarines and work on the Vanguard
class replacement submarines, which resulted in a delay to the
introduction into service of the Vanguard class, but within the overall
constraint that we have in this country of needing to sustain a
submarine yard at Barrow, and the minimum level at which we can sustain
a submarine yard is building one submarine at a time. However we
configure them—Vanguard class first or Astute class

One problem that I have seen with defence procurement is not the way in

Defence at the beginning of the process to have something more than the
standard package. There was the nonsense with the Chinook aircraft,
which were bought but never flew because the Department wanted to add
to them. Will there be more emphasis on buying standard
packages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T17:55:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061011000435" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000435"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Philip Hammond" PimsId="3733" UID="13061011000778" xid="251" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000778">Mr

there are things that we can buy off the shelf or from competitive
international providers. We recently ordered the new fleet of
MARS—military afloat reach and sustainability—refuelling
tankers from a South Korean shipyard. That decision did not go down
well with everybody, but it was sensible procurement. At the same time,
we have to maintain important capabilities that are essential to our
national sovereignty here in the UK. In those cases, we have to support
the indigenous industry. One purpose of the changes is to make

changes that are required. One he did not mention, but which is
important, is creating a hard boundary between the customer and the
provider organisation. At the moment, responsibilities across that
boundary are not as clear cut as they should be, and that allows
specification scope to drift on occasions.
Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:00:04"></hs_TimeCode> me give him
a couple of examples. We currently spend in DE&amp;S £400
million a year on external technical support because we cannot hire the
people we need. Being unable to hire somebody at £50,000 a year
means that we are paying a contractor £1,000 a day to do the
work. We expect the GoCo contractor, if we go down that route, to make
substantial early savings by hiring key technical capabilities into the
organisation, rather than by bringing them in as technical contractors.
He is absolutely right about perverse incentives. Our big challenge now
in the assessment phase is to negotiate a set of key performance
indicators and incentive payment structures that align a GoCo
contractor with the priorities of the Ministry of
Defence.</hs_Para><hs_2cGenericHdg UID="13061011000003" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061011000003">

three years, the Government have made significant strides in cutting
crime and reforming the police. Since 2010, crime has fallen by more
than 10%. This is in no small measure down to the professionalism and
dedication of police officers and police staff working day in, day out
to keep our neighbourhoods safe. The reduction in crime has been
achieved against the backdrop of a difficult financial climate for the
police, as for other public services. We have taken the decisions
necessary to restore this country’s long-term economic
well-being. We have been able to mitigate the impact of diminished
resources because we have allowed officers to focus on their core task
of cutting
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:03:43"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
thrown off the straitjacket of national targets and freed up
the front line from pointless form-filling and needless bureaucracy.
Through the introduction of police and crime commissioners, we
have revolutionised the accountability of police forces, and they are
now far more responsive to local needs and
priorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:04:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061035000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061035000007">In
the last Session, we legislated to set up the National Crime Agency
which will, from the autumn, lead the fight against serious, organised
and complex crime. The College of Policing is already firmly
established and is leading the way in ensuring that the police operate
to the highest professional standards. We are giving the Independent
Police Complaints Commission the capacity it needs to investigate all
serious allegations of misconduct. We cannot, however, afford to ease
up on our reform programme. We cannot rest while the crime survey shows
that there were 8.9 million crimes against adults last year. We cannot

would be the first to accept that legislation by and of itself is not
the answer to antisocial behaviour. What is needed is for the police,

they get out of hand. In many cases, informal, non-statutory remedies
can be used to nip a problem in the bud. There is clearly a need,

evidence they heard reinforces our view that the existing powers are
often slow, difficult to deploy and in need of rationalisation. There
are those in the Opposition who seek to characterise the provisions in
the Bill as a weakening of the powers to tackle antisocial behaviour.

certainly not the result of credible analysis of the reforms we

examination, it can be seen that in recent years there has been a
significant decline in the use of the ASBO. That is essentially because
it can take months to secure an order and because, once obtained, over
half of all orders are breached. For some, the ASBO became a badge of
honour rather than an instrument for changing behaviour, which does not
suggest it was an unalloyed success. In contrast, the criminal
behaviour order and the new injunction may contain, as well as
restrictions, positive requirements to address offending behaviour. As
a purely civil order, a part 1 injunction may be granted by a court on
the basis of evidence judged to the civil standard of proof, thereby
significantly speeding up and simplifying the application

area to determine. For some time, the Opposition have been saying that
the fact that there have not been many instances of community triggers

May:</Member></B> I understand the point my hon. Friend is making. The
point about the community trigger is that it is not just about the
individual on the receiving end of antisocial behaviour. It is called
the community trigger precisely because others in the community may be
able to exercise it, as opposed to the individual who has been
subjected to such behaviour.</hs_Para>

local agencies respond effectively, few victims would need to resort to
using the trigger, so it was not surprising that the recent pilots
showed relatively few people taking advantage of it. When agencies fail
to act, it should be possible for persistent antisocial behaviour to be
dealt with and for a response to be required from the relevant
agencies. That is real empowerment for victims and contrasts with the
Labour party’s proposal of a 24-hour guarantee, which in
practice may amount to no more than an e-mail acknowledging a
complaint. The arrival of an e-mail telling someone that their
complaint has been logged is of little comfort, and still less use to
anyone suffering from a failure to do anything about the antisocial
behaviour that is blighting their
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:20:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061035000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061035000040">For
many, owning a dog will be a source of companionship and, in the case
of working dogs, valued support and assistance. However, where owners
do not take responsibility for their dogs—by failing to clear up
after them or to ensure they are properly trained and
socialised—those dogs can become a menace, spoiling local
amenities and putting people at risk of harm. The Bill tackles
irresponsible dog owners in two ways. First, it strengthens the
provisions in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, to which hon. Members have
referred. In particular, we are extending the offence of having a dog
that is dangerously out of control in a public place to cover all
places. That will mean that the police can take action when a person is
attacked by a dog in the home. The Bill also provides that an attack on
an assistance dog is an aggravated offence under the 1991
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:21:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061035000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061035000041">Secondly,
through the new flexible powers to tackle antisocial behaviour, the
police and local authorities will be able to take preventive measures
to tackle specific local issues. My hon. Friends the Members for Thirsk
and Malton (Miss McIntosh) and for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie
Bray), as well as other hon. Members, have argued for a bespoke
“dog control notice”, but such an approach would once
again lead us down the road of having a plethora of narrowly focused,
inflexible powers to deal with particular problems. Although the
provisions in parts 1 to 4 of the Bill do not provide for dog control
notices in name, they provide for them in substance. For example, it
would be open to the police or local council to issue a community
protection notice against the owner of an aggressive dog. Such a notice
could include a requirement to attend training classes, and keep the
dog muzzled and on a lead in a public place. Alternatively, a public
spaces protection order could prohibit all dogs from a particular
locality, such as a children’s play area. Given the ability to
use such powers to target specific dog-related issues, I hope the House
will accept that there is simply no need for a separate dog control
notice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T18:22:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

her constituency in relation to dogs acting in a private place, and
there have sadly been a number of other such cases. The Government have
responded by introducing this new power, but dealing with the issue
will come down to decisions that will be taken at a local level.
Decisions will be taken by the police, local authorities and the
agencies working together when the problem of a dangerous dog has been
identified. The point about these powers is that they are sufficiently
flexible to enable people to take a decision about what will
work and what action needs to be taken in a particular circumstance.

for the college to determine what requirements it will put in place for
individuals regarding their initial ability to operate as a police

<?notus-xml column=74?>development they need to undertake as they progress through the ranks
and acquire the necessary skills. It will be for the college to look
carefully at the balance that will need to be struck to ensure that
people can undertake that training and not be put off doing so. I
believe that the College of Policing represents an important
development in the policing landscape. As well as setting standards for
training, development and skills, it will be a body in which best
practice can be shared between police forces. That will have an impact

I want to draw the House’s attention to a couple of the

Having to pass low-level offences to the Crown Prosecution Service
wastes police time. The police already deal with more than
500,000 cases a year in which people plead guilty. Under the
provisions in this part, up to a further 50,000 prosecutions for
low-level shoplifting offences will be able to be handled by the
police, empowering front-line officers and bringing swifter justice for

this part of the Bill, we have also clarified the test for determining
eligibility for compensation when someone has been the victim of a
miscarriage of justice. The absence of a clear statutory definition of
what amounts to a miscarriage of justice for these purposes has led to
repeated legal challenges and shifting case law. As well as providing
greater certainty, the new statutory test will ensure that compensation

Cooper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an important point. Community
resolutions and the purpose of the restorative justice approach, which
can be valuable in dealing with antisocial behaviour, are about getting
offenders to say sorry to the victims and make it up to them.
Yet that is exactly what we do not want in domestic violence cases. We
do not want a police-sanctioned process of the perpetrator somehow
apologising and making it up to the victim, who will then be expected
to accept and go along with the apology, as if that makes it all right.
Community resolutions should not be used for domestic violence
cases. It is still a serious matter of concern that they continue to be
used, despite ACPO’s guidance to the contrary. This is an area
where the Home Office needs to step in and make sure that stronger
guidance is sent out to chief constables and police forces across the
country to make it very clear that community resolutions should not be
used for domestic violence.</hs_Para>

cases in which ASBOs are not appropriate, but it must also be said that
in some of the most serious examples of repeated abuse, they have made
a significant difference. For example, an aggressive thug who had
repeatedly intimidated residents and shopkeepers in a town centre, had
repeatedly ignored warnings from the police and the courts, and had
breached his ASBO was taken to the criminal courts and given a
custodial sentence, but under the new system, he would only be served
with an injunction. The council would have to pursue expensive civil
action to enforce the injunction, and there would be no criminal
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061035000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0002.htm#13061035000097">Nor

the trigger is not strong enough to help. For a start—as I
pointed out to the Home Secretary earlier—although the Bill
specifies that there must have been “at least
three…complaints”, the number could be far higher. Police
and crime commissioners could decide on five, 10 or 20. The
Home Secretary said that it would be a matter for local discretion, but
that local discretion already exists. If it were simply a matter for
local discretion, she would allow people to choose to set up community
triggers, and she would not be legislating. Either she thinks that this
is a matter for local discretion and it is up to those people to
decide, or she thinks that there should be minimum standards, but
something as weak and wishy-washy as “at least
three…complaints” is not really a minimum standard at
all. This is a con. Even if the magic threshold is passed, what are
residents entitled to? A review. How reassuring.</hs_Para>

property, but that is not enough. As the Home Secretary will know, the
number of attacks has been rising, and there have been tragic fatal
attacks. In the last two years, we have seen killings such as those of
18-month-old Zumer Ahmed and 71-year-old Gloria Knowles, who was mauled
by dogs. Last week I met the family of 14-year-old Jade Anderson, who

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, a number of charities,
and the families of victims killed in dangerous dog attacks want dog
control notices to be introduced. I listened carefully to what the Home
Secretary said, but the problem is that experts have not been convinced
by her argument that wider powers can be used, and that it will not
take long to build up case law and make it easy for those powers to be
applied. Of course dog control notices will not stop every attack, but
they could make it easier for earlier preventive action to be taken.
They are working in Scotland, and I urge the Home Secretary to consider
the issue again during the Bill’s passage.</hs_Para>

guidance not be underpinned by legislation? We cannot legislate in

not only because that was the decision of the Select Committee but
because of the case of Fiona Pilkington, who committed suicide in

local youths. The Independent Police Complaints Commission found in May
2011 that she had contacted the police 33 times in seven years. They
failed to act accordingly and, as a result, she committed suicide with
her daughter. I am glad that the new Leicester chief constable has
changed things. Simon Cole has made this one of his priorities and we
have accepted his assurance that that kind of situation will never
happen again. Obviously, if we pass the Bill, that assurance will be

January, the Select Committee recommended that there should be a
national backstop of three complaints to set off the community trigger.
We believe that that would guard against people like Fiona Pilkington
slipping through the net. Of course the Home Secretary is right: we
also have to have a degree of local accountability. That has been one
of the great features of her term as Home Secretary: she sets
guidelines and a vision, and then she leaves it very much up to local
people to complete the vision. She has done that with police and crime
commissioners, to which I will come
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T19:07:04"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
we believe strongly that, unless we have a national backstop, a figure
that everyone could sign up to, there is a risk that locally people
could make their own decisions, and we would end up with the trigger
not being as great in Devon and Cornwall as it was in Somerset,
Leicestershire and Derbyshire. That is why we felt that the trigger was
important. I hope that, as it scrutinises the Bill, the Committee will
look seriously at the Select Committee’s proposals. I am
convinced that they will strengthen the Bill. That was the unanimous
view of the Select

should also, in looking at the Bill, express our concern about the cuts

We take the point that it is quite different from arranged marriage.
However, I must tell the Home Secretary that I am worried about the
allegations database that she set up, which we will look at very
closely in our next report. I have many constituents who complain that
they are being abused by their spouses and have been tricked into
getting married. They make their complaint to the Home Office and
nothing happens. They are not informed because of the bizarre belief
that they are third parties. I do not believe that someone who goes off
to a foreign country and marries somebody there, and then brings them
to this country so that they are only here because they brought them
in, and who then complains that their spouse has abused the system and
tricked them, is a third party. Of course they need to know whether the
Home Office has removed them. We have had 28,000 allegations since the
Prime Minister’s famous speech in London two years ago, when he
asked people to report these issues, and 500 arrests have been made,

have three final points, and I shall begin with the College of
Policing. I know that the Home Secretary is not interested in legacy
stuff, because I am sure she will be in post for a long time, but when
her legacy is written up, the creation of the College of
Policing—which I hope will be called the “Royal College
of Policing”, as that will give an impetus and dignity to those
we train as police officers—will be seen as an important feature
of 
<?notus-xml column=86?>her new landscape for policing. However, she ought to have ensured that
the chair of the college appointed the members of the board or had a
part to play in that, rather than appointing all the members of the
board and then appointing the chair. I know she had problems filling
that post but they have been resolved, and she has now appointed an
excellent chair. In order to give the chair greater importance, the
chair could perhaps be allowed to work with board members to co-opt
additional people on to the board, which is not doing very well in
terms of diversity.</hs_Para>

was there for the Emily Wilding Davison centenary celebrations with the
Home Secretary and you, Mr Speaker, and I heard what the

got one of the T-shirts that were on offer. Diversity is not an
apparent feature of the College of Policing board,
however<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T19:14:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
Moreover, I find it extraordinary that the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner, who represents so many police officers, does not sit on
the board, whereas the Association of Chief Police Officers does. I
have nothing against that organisation sitting on the board, but the

Home Secretary still has not told us who will hold the integrity
register for chief constables. She rightly announced that chief
constables ought to have a register of gifts they receive and jobs they
do, but after all these months she has still not told us where that
register is going to sit. In her new landscape, she has so many new
organisations to choose from, and one of them—perhaps the
College of Policing, perhaps Her Majesty’s inspectorate of
constabulary—needs to hold the register in order to give it
credibility.
Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T19:15:05"></hs_TimeCode> the
Home Secretary did not like the idea of a register for police and crime
commissioners, the Select Committee published one. PCCs were very
upset, but the fact is we just published what they put on their
websites or what they told us to put in. If we have registers for MPs,
peers and chief constables, we should have one for PCCs. We must not

Committee said that the IPCC was woefully under-equipped and hamstrung
by a lack of powers and resources. The Home Secretary has not given it
all the powers we would have wanted, but she has certainly given it a

however. People tend to refer conduct issues to the IPCC. It is dealing
with thousands of cases as a result of Hillsborough. It has an
excellent new chair in Dame Anne Owers, and it has shown a real
commitment to do good work in this area, but it cannot do that work
unless it has the necessary resources to finish the job. We thank the

up a huge amount of the Home Secretary’s time and the time of
this House. I still think it should be up to the Home Secretary to make
that decision, rather than give it to judges, because I think there are
other considerations to take into account. I do not think that she or
her successor if Labour wins the next election, the current shadow Home

the <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T19:19:12"></hs_TimeCode>core of the
Bill, however, are the antisocial behaviour provisions. It is
particularly welcome that the Bill underwent pre-legislative scrutiny
by the Select Committee. I thank the Home Secretary for taking on board
some of the suggestions that it made, although she did not take on
board all of them. The principles 
<?notus-xml column=88?>are surely absolutely right. The simplification of the toolkit used to
remedy antisocial behaviour, which can blight lives, even at a
relatively low level, is welcome. It will produce a quicker and more
coherent response, empowering police, local authorities and other
agencies, so that they can deal with the problems far more effectively
and efficiently. This issue is serious: there were 2.3
million reports of antisocial behaviour in 2012, although I suspect the
vast majority of such incidents are never actually reported. We need a
simple scheme to deal with that.</hs_Para>

has to be what we all want. It was the aim of the acceptable behaviour
contracts, and it is the right direction in which to be travelling. It
also fits in well with the Government’s general approach to the
criminal justice system, with a focus on rehabilitation. Rather than
focusing on how we punish people, there is a focus on how we can
prevent problems from happening in the first place. I am very pleased
about all that. I could talk at great length about how excellent some
of the provisions are, but the Home Secretary has done that, as have
others.</hs_Para>

improvements could still be made in a couple of areas, and there are
particular concerns about how the system will deal with young people.
In looking at antisocial behaviour the focus has always ended up on
young people; it is many people’s first encounter with the
criminal justice system. Some 40% of ASBOs were issued to 10 to
17-year-olds, who comprise only 13% of the population, and a very large
proportion of those people have mental health problems and learning
difficulties, which is a serious concern.</hs_Para>

the Bill does not yet contain enough to strengthen early intervention
or ensure that a full health and social assessment is made to go with
any of the orders that are available. I accept that that is not all
about legislation; I hope that in Committee, or through comments from
the Home Secretary, progress will be made to strengthen the
arrangements, because we want to help people with mental health
problems or learning difficulties, rather than putting them through an
inappropriate route.</hs_Para>

I mentioned when I intervened on the Home Secretary, I remain concerned
about the naming and shaming of young people. Clause 17 would disapply
section 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which restricts
reports on proceedings in which young people are concerned, in respect
of injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance and criminal behaviour
orders. That goes against the presumption of anonymity for children in
criminal proceedings and is likely to hinder 
<?notus-xml column=89?>their successful rehabilitation, particularly in this age where people
can say things online which can stay with people for ever. We want a
chance for a young person who made an error at 14 to be able to have
that removed very quickly. Article 40 of the United Nations convention

about 10 a month. Last year, I met some of my visually impaired
constituents and found out what it was like to have a guide dog: I was
blindfolded and had to follow a dog around Cambridge. I spoke to my
constituents about some of their cases. The big problem is that guide
dogs are trained not to fight back or 
<?notus-xml column=91?>defend themselves; they are trained not to run away, but to get their
owner away safely. My constituents told me about some brutal cases
where the dog had been savaged in awful ways—their guts were
hanging out, and so on—but had still tried to lead its owner
away. Such attacks were also devastating for the owner, because it
takes a long time to get used to a dog and they cannot simply be
replaced; the emotional cost is huge, too. Five of the dogs attacked
had to be withdrawn, costing the Guide Dogs charity
£170,000—money which it simply does not have. I am really
pleased that the first clause in part 7 makes it clear that attacks on
guide dogs will be considered aggravated attacks, but we need to go
much further.</hs_Para>

First, being attacked by a dog in the communal area of a block of flats

Friend the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz), the Chair of the
Select Committee on Home Affairs, who spoke earlier, I have been in the
House since 1997, and I can genuinely say that antisocial behaviour has
been at the centre of my casework, both in terms of concerns that
people have raised, and of the relief and respite that has been brought
about. This is a continuing 
<?notus-xml column=92?>process; no Government have a monopoly on virtue or
effectiveness. However, I want to emphasise that the Labour Government
made significant strides in combating antisocial behaviour, and in
putting victims at the heart of the justice system; I recall the
surprise at that in more conservative legal circles in the early days
of that Administration. Mercifully, we have moved on since
then.</hs_Para>

particularly mention the controls put in place for statutory
partnerships under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Those have been
enormously important to us in Blackpool, where partnerships between the
police, local authorities and others to tackle crime and disorder have
worked extremely successfully. I want to make a point that is specific
to my constituents and to the town: like many seaside and coastal
towns, and many inland towns with a high degree of transience, in
Blackpool, issues associated with houses in multiple occupation and the
problems faced by a minority of rogue landlords and rogue tenants have
been very much to the fore. As the House of Commons research paper
makes clear, antisocial behaviour injunctions have been valued by
social landlords; they have been used successfully against tenants in
attempts to tackle vandalism, violence, noise, harassment, and
threatening and un-neighbourly behaviour.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary made clear, none of this can be
done without resources. That is why it was very important that more
than 12,000 extra police, and more than 16,000 police
community support officers, were introduced under the Labour
Government, including in Lancashire, which has particularly benefited
from the beefed-up powers that were
provided.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000005">What
are the issues that any antisocial behaviour Bill should at least touch
on and try to address for my constituents in Blackpool? First, there is
the question of disorder, particularly in the centre of the town. As
many people know, we have millions of visitors every year. Most of them
are a delight, but a small proportion are not. The same is true of
residents. Problems such as alcohol, petty crime, drugs and general
threatening behaviour have always loomed large. Secondly, the issue of
houses in multiple occupation is really important. I praise the work
done over a long period by the public protection department of
Blackpool council, ably headed by Tim Coglan, all who have worked with
him, and the cabinet member with responsibility for housing, Councillor
Gillian
Campbell.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000006">I

Marsden:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I do not
disagree with him on the powers, which are already there. What is
important is enforcement by councils, and the resources that are
available to them. Sadly, Blackpool council’s ability to do the
stuff it would like to on alley gates has been severely
hindered over the past couple of years by substantial cuts in funding
from the Department for Communities and Local
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000011">I
want to talk about the importance of police and community support
officers, who are crucial, particularly now, when we have problems not
just with houses in multiple occupation, but with houses that are
bought at low prices when owner-occupiers move out, and landlords rent
them out to problem families. I have many examples of that. I pay
tribute to the activities undertaken in our town by the police and the
community together. I am thinking of a group, ably chaired by Mr Dave
Blacker, who are concerned about their PCSOs. Issues of funding and
what might be available from Government have come to the
fore.</hs_Para>

important issues are vandalism—Stanley park and other parts of
the town have been badly affected by it recently—metal theft,
the protection of war memorials and dumping. Those are all
issues on which PCSOs can make an important contribution. That is why
we need to look critically at what the Government are doing in the
Bill. The crime prevention injunction—the proposed replacement
for an antisocial behaviour order—is significantly weaker. A
breach of the new injunction is not a criminal offence and will not
result in a criminal record. Other proposed measures against antisocial
behaviour also appear weak. The Government’s proposed community
trigger has seemed weak in the areas in which it has been trialled, as
my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary made clear earlier. As
her colleague,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero) said, breach of ASBOs was a
criminal offence; breach of injunctions to prevent nuisance and
annoyance is not. Nor does the Bill guarantee a response from the
police or the council. It guarantees a review. In my region, the
north-west, police in Manchester recorded nearly 26,000 cases of
antisocial behaviour in 2012-13, but the trigger was activated a mere
four
times<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000013">When
it comes to tackling antisocial behaviour, the elephant in the room is
the way the Government have cut the police budget. Police community
support officers, who are so often at the forefront in tackling
day-to-day antisocial behaviour, have been hit particularly hard. That
has led to Lancashire losing 9% of our front-line officers in the first
two years of this Tory-led Government, and 500 police

shall touch briefly on knife crime, which has been a key issue in
Blackpool. The Government have, to be fair, introduced a new crime of
“threatening with article 
<?notus-xml column=94?>with blade” in public or on school premises, but the Prime
Minister told MPs in recent months that the Justice Secretary was
reviewing the powers available to the courts to deal with knife
possession, and the Lord Chancellor has said he is revisiting the whole
topic of knife crime. As my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary
rightly said, this is a Christmas tree Bill. It is unfortunate that the
outcome of those reviews has not informed the detail of the

topic of firearms has been touched on. I entirely associate myself with
the comments that have been made about the dangers presented by people
with a history of domestic violence. We know that only too well in
Blackpool from the Justice for Jane campaign, which concerned the case
of a young woman who was tragically murdered by her partner, who had a
history of domestic threatening and violence. Such
ticking time bombs need monitoring, and the Government should

legislation that would make that

I return to the subject of dangerous dogs. I have not been convinced by
what the Home Secretary said. Many other organisations—not just
the RSPCA, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, Blue Cross and the Select
Committee—feel that the proposals, rather like my 15-year-old
Jack Russell-Chihuahua cross, are somewhat toothless. Dangerous dogs
are a real problem and they need a special and specific remedy. I know
that only too well from my former colleague in the House, Joan Humble,
who almost lost the tip of her finger when canvassing in Blackpool in
2012. These Government measures, as has been said, are simply too weak.

issues can be addressed far more forcefully than they were by the Home
Secretary this evening. In particular, the public spaces protection
orders are too sweeping and vague in many respects to deal with what is
proposed. The Battersea Dogs and Cats Home briefing makes these points
far more eloquently than I can. It also makes the point that dogs that

which shocked the nation. The horrific story and her plight
demonstrated how bad antisocial behaviour could become and the distress
that it caused to victims. That tragic case highlighted the fact that
the authorities let this family down and failed to do enough to bring
an end to the torment that the family suffered.</hs_Para>

all the legislation and the introduction of ASBOs, as we heard at the

want to highlight some recent cases in my constituency. Families using
the park in Maldon road in Witham have been alarmed by groups of young
men using the children’s play space inappropriately. It is
summer and parents cannot let their children play because men are
drinking and behaving in an abusive, intimidating and frightening way
in the park. One constituent was so shocked by what happened that she
reported to me that the men had been calling over to girls, had tried
to involve them in conversation, and had offered them alcohol. We have
had recent cases of inappropriate behaviour involving alcohol and
persuasion by men in the wrong way. What was worrying for my
constituent was the response by the police. They were pretty
ineffective, remarking that because these individuals were foreign,
they did not understand that it was inappropriate behaviour, and that
they were in the park as there was no designated area for them to drink
in. That is simply not appropriate. Rather than taking action and
making the area safe, the authorities were reluctant to act. Many of us
here are parents, and I was disgusted by these events. I am pursuing
the case with the local authority and the police because I have been
left in no doubt that action should be
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T19:51:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000026">Another

called again at 11 pm as they were being kept awake, but it was not
until 1 am that the police arrived on the scene. There are many other
such incidents not just in my constituency but throughout the country.

approach to crime and criminal justice matters is to put the victim
first. I have been particularly outspoken in the past about the
disproportionality in the criminal justice system when victims unfairly
have to fight to have their voices heard. For too long the justice
system has been skewed in favour of offenders, focusing on help and
support for them while neglecting those who are most affected by their
crimes. Conservative Ministers deserve credit for refocusing attention
on victims, and the Bill goes some way to addressing past deficiencies
in the justice system. Victims want action taken promptly to protect
them from antisocial behaviour, and they also want to be involved in
decisions taken about how the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and
the courts deal with criminals. I therefore welcome the duty to consult
victims that clauses 95 and 96 place on prosecutors who are minded to
offer an offender a conditional caution or a youth conditional
caution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T19:54:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
requirement to attach to the conditions reasonable requests made by the
victim is a positive step forward. It is disappointing that this has

action is also needed on retail crime. Businesses, their owners and
those who work in them can be subjected to quite horrific incidents of
antisocial behaviour. I say that as someone who has grown up in a
family business and seen at first hand how intimidating individuals and

behave in an obscene way. Shopkeepers work long hours and are often
under considerable stress and pressure. They need to be supported, and

urge the Government to look again at clause 133 on low value
shoplifting. Owners of small shops in particular will be concerned
about what they will see as a downgrading in the way that thefts of a
value of below £200 are treated. Requiring that these be dealt
with by magistrates courts and encouraging the use of fixed penalty
notices and restorative justice methods can detract from the serious
nature of the offence. As well as the stress and pressure, there is
also the matter of the cost to the business. More often than not
shopkeepers install CCTV and spend a lot of time dealing with the
police and providing evidence. Small shopkeepers who may have invested
considerably in security measures are already disillusioned with the
police responses to crime, and theft has a serious impact on their
profit margins. Shop thefts account for about 83% of crime against the
retail sector, and the Home Office has estimated that there were
approximately 4.1 million incidents of shoplifting in 2012
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T19:58:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000034">Most
of the perpetrators will be serial and repeat offenders, so when they
are caught, victims and businesses should expect some of these
offenders to face the full force of the law, otherwise they will just
carry on offending. Less than half of the fixed penalty notices issued
for shop theft in 2011 have been paid in full by offenders. Average
thefts are valued at £88 and the majority of these thefts are of
goods valued up to £25. Introducing the £200 threshold
into law will mean that 
<?notus-xml column=98?>it is possible for almost all of those caught
shoplifting to be dealt with outside of court. What kind of message

mentioned in an intervention on the Home Secretary—the point is
worth sharing in more detail—Liverpool’s City Watch team
has used state-of-the-art CCTV both as a deterrent and to identify and
convict those who commit crimes and antisocial behaviour offences. It
is a very advanced system and it has been highly effective. As a
result, Liverpool is now one of the safest cities in the country,
according to the UK Statistics Authority. We often have
delegations—not only from across the country but from across
Europe—who visit the facility and meet the operators, who are
highly

replicated elsewhere. Given that success, I echo the sentiment I
expressed before: it would be such a shame if other local authorities

will focus the rest of my remarks on the measures in the Bill for
tackling dangerous dogs, which are covered in part 7. Perhaps it is
fate, design or just pure coincidence that it is 22 years to the day
since the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 received its Second Reading in this
House. That was a very long time ago, and it has become clear since,
particularly over the past 10 years, that the legislation has not been
up to the job. The issue was first raised with me in my constituency
just before I was elected three years ago, after the tragic death of
John Paul Massey, who was just four years old, in the run-up to the
general election. His death really affected the whole
community—some members of my community are still very much
affected. I have worked closely with his mother, Angela, to raise these
issues with the Government. It happened on 30 November 2009. Angela has
been incredibly stoic and brave in campaigning on the issue so that no
other family has to go through what her family have gone through.
Angela came with John Paul Massey’s father and representatives
of many other organisations about a year ago to deliver a letter to the
Prime Minister highlighting their concerns about the legislation as it
stands. I have been compelled by Angela’s incredible bravery to

attacks, we have to talk about responsible dog ownership. Lots of

example that my hon. Friend gave and the examples that have been cited
by others illustrate why we need to give a range of powers to the
police, local authorities and our fantastic dog wardens, who will
prevent these attacks from happening in the first place. I am seriously
concerned that the Bill as it stands is far too weak. I share the
analysis of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, which
said that these plans are woefully inadequate. Where is the support for
owners to provide them with the education they need to best look after
their pet? Where is there anything in this Bill that will properly
prevent dog attacks, specifically, from happening in the first
place?</hs_Para>

hope that the Home Secretary will listen again to the many calls to
include dog control notices in the Bill, because the wider,
non-dog-specific community protection notices, criminal behaviour
orders and crime prevention injunctions that it will introduce do not
cut it and will take far too long to implement. A dog control notice
would enforce muzzling a dog and keeping it on a lead wherever it is in
a place to which the public have access, and the owner and their dog
having to attend and complete a training course if that is felt to be
necessary. It would ensure on-the-spot action before the behaviour of
the dog or the owner escalates. It would be a more immediate measure
than the lengthy, bureaucratic processes that the Bill will introduce,
which will take far too long 
<?notus-xml column=102?>and I fear will be implemented after something very serious has
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:14:38"></hs_TimeCode>. This
approach has already been used in Scotland and has been endorsed by the

have lost loved ones to similar attacks. Just two weeks ago another

dangerous dog attacks since 2005. Sadly, the action that we are

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:17:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger) spoke very powerfully about
emotive and clearly tragic cases. I am sure that all Members of the

counter-intuitively, therefore, I would like to pay tribute to a piece
of legislation introduced by Labour. The role of police community
support officers in tackling antisocial behaviour has been much
maligned over the years, and my party opposed the measure at the 
<?notus-xml column=103?>time, yet when I look at the work of Aivaras Krochalev and others PCSOs
in my constituency who have done so much work, particularly with parts
of the community where English is not the first language, it is clear
that many of them have helped in freeing up officer time and delivering
value for money on the front line rather than sitting behind desks at
headquarters.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061043000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000060"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:18:43"></hs_TimeCode>That
is why I welcome the Home Secretary’s measures in the Bill to
strengthen some of the powers available to PCSOs. For example, it is
illogical for a PCSO to be able to disperse a group from an area but
unable to direct an individual to leave it. The Bill is right to give
senior officers discretion to tackle that. It is also illogical for
PCSOs to be able to fill out forms in those instances but not to issue
them. The streamlining of some of the powers that apply to PCSOs will
free up police officer time for doing the things that warrant officers
should be doing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061043000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000061">Following<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:19:41"></hs_TimeCode>
that logic, I want to press the Minister to consider extending PCSO
powers to take on other responsibilities. For example, a PCSO is able
to seize drugs, but not search for them. They can search for alcohol
and tobacco, and if they happen to find drugs during the course of
those searches they can confiscate them, but if they can smell cannabis
they are not allowed search for it; they have to divert the time of a
warranted officer instead. The feedback I receive from senior officers
is that that is not an effective use of police
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:20:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000062">Minor
issues can also be annoying to officers. For example, a PCSO can issue
a fixed penalty notice for cycling on a towpath—we do not have
many towpaths in my constituency, but I am sure that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:20:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) finds that to be a useful option—but
they cannot issue one for cycling without lights. There are a number of
other similar areas; I cite those two examples simply to illustrate my
argument<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:20:54"></hs_TimeCode>. If we
follow the Bill’s logic and its welcome measures on, for
example, dispersal, we will see that PCSOs could take on more powers in
tackling antisocial behaviour and that that would free up police
officer
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:21:13"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:21:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000063">Another
issue that the Bill does not tackle is that of potential
cross-departmental work to enforce antisocial behaviour measures. Last
year, there were an estimated 15,000 foreign vehicles on our roads.
Once such vehicles are here for more than six months, they have to
undergo an MOT and be insured and registered. It is illogical to assume
that every single foreign vehicle on our roads has complied with that
requirement, yet last year there was not a single prosecution of an
unregistered foreign vehicle. Part of the frustration felt by
Cambridgeshire police and others is that there seems to be
intransigence on the part of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.
It uses automatic registration recognition for stolen vehicles, but not
in relation to the licensing of foreign vehicles. That has a knock-on
effect in community tension; some people feel that they have to insure
and register their car while others do not. Clearly, discussions need
to be held between the Home Office and the Department for Transport. I
would be grateful if the Minister could write to me to confirm that he
will take on that cross-departmental work. From some of the cases that
I see at my constituency
surgery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:22:58"></hs_TimeCode>, the

area where significant time is being wasted and where
cross-departmental work is suboptimal is that of licensing. It may
surprise the House to hear that an area such as Wisbech in my
constituency has more licensed premises in the centre than a student
area such as Cambridge. Indeed, we are using existing powers on the
accumulated number of licensed premises in order to try to effect
change. It is clear that when the police make representations,
significant time is spent on compiling long reports that are then often
ignored by local councils. It would be beneficial for further work to
be undertaken by the Home Office and the Department for Communities and
Local Government in order to look at police representations and whether
the time spent on cases involving licensing and antisocial behaviour in
communities is used as effectively as

Bill’s measures will be welcome only if they are enforced. In
our rush to legislate, one of the traps that we fall into in this place
is that we suspect that just introducing a Bill on antisocial behaviour
will effect the change that we seek. It is clear that some of the
existing measures to tackle antisocial behaviour are not being
enforced. For example, an illegal rave took place in my constituency on
new year’s eve. It may surprise the House to learn that the
police were at the scene but—understandably, because of the
numbers of people present—took the view that it was not safe for
them to intervene at that point. However, even though the police were
on site when the illegality took place, and even though the business
owner took countless photos and the Home Secretary, no less, expressed
her horror and shock and desire for enforcement when I spoke to her
about the case, I discovered last week, without the police
having the courtesy to tell me, that after six months they had simply

start on a positive note and address one of the Bill’s good
features—clause 134 on the new protection arrangements for
persons at risk. The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 states
that specific groups of people, such as witnesses and jurors, are
protected if their safety is at risk from criminal conduct. The Bill
extends that further to anyone whose safety may be at risk from another
person’s possible or actual criminal conduct, meaning family
members and others who will have close contact with that person. That
is an extremely valuable
addition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000070"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:27:39"></hs_TimeCode>I
am rather more concerned about other aspects of the Bill. The Home

became a “badge of honour” to some people. I suspect that
in three years’ time, we may be sitting here deliberating how
CBOs and CPIs have become badges of honour in certain quarters. To me,
that is not the point. The point is that ASBOs worked successfully in
many areas. It was only the breach of them that was a criminal offence.

the shadow Home Secretary was right when she spoke about community

seriously, the point that the shadow Home Secretary made about firearms

the Home Secretary needs to do more to stop people with a history of

comes from a rural constituency and who met two game shooters
on Friday night and got on to this subject. Responsible gun ownership
in rural areas is totally different from firearms crime. We must have
zero tolerance of it and the law must be much stricter about the
possibility of people with a history of domestic

I fear that one of the great problems is that we are dealing with
non-equal relationships and vulnerability. The work of community
groups, support networks and third-sector groups is crucial. I worry
about how justice is to be obtained. Somebody who has been put in what
must be one of the most horrific situations will hardly just pick up
the phone, dial 999 and say, “I’m sorry, I have a
problem. I’m in a forced marriage.” Justice in this area
will not come cheap. I fear the effect of the cuts to women’s

for victims through legislation. There are other aspects, such as

tackle bullying, and a compulsory support programme aimed at parents

is a concern, which I understand, about whether Ayden’s law
would too quickly criminalise our youngsters. However, a compromise
measure could be introduced through some of the clauses already in the
Bill. It is too easy to say that bullying should be dealt with at
school, or that it is the responsibility of parents. Evidence shows
that the worst, most insidious cases of bullying take place not just at
school, but on local transport, social media, via text messages and in
areas beyond the school gate.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>I have become
interested in this issue because, as the House knows, I am still
heavily involved in girls’ football, and I speak regularly to
teenage girls about their concerns—issues that they might not
raise with their parents, peers or school teachers—and
one of those is bullying in school. Sometimes they feel they
cannot speak to anybody about it or that, if they do, nothing will be
done, so we should use the Bill to strengthen the measures in place to
tackle
bullying.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:40:43"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

know that many are concerned about criminalising youngsters by
introducing a new offence, but perhaps we should look at other
countries’ experiences. Unsurprisingly, Sweden led the way by
introducing legislation on bullying. It did not go as far as making it
a criminal offence, but it made it illegal for a school not to act.
Recently, South Africa and New Zealand have introduced anti-bullying
legislation, as too have 49 states in America. It is unsurprising that
Sweden has led the way, because it has a world-renowned bullying expert
whose research found that those who have been bullies are 60% more
likely to commit a crime by the age of 24. Tackling this at a young
age, then, could prevent people from entering the criminal justice
system later in life.</hs_Para>

said we could use the Bill to come up with a compromise. By that, I
meant that the injunctions in the Bill could be used to impose positive
requirements, as well as prohibitions, on youngsters who are bullying,
thereby providing an opportunity for professionals to intercede and
provide support, such as courses—provided by the likes of
BeatBullying and others—and family intervention, which is all
part of the campaign around Ayden’s law. As the injunctions do
not result in a criminal record, they give us an opportunity to state
in the Bill that bullying could have legal consequences while still
providing the opportunity for the bully to change their
behaviour.</hs_Para>

would be a good compromise for those wary of criminalising youngsters:
people would have the opportunity to change their behaviour, but if
they failed to do so, they could and should then enter the criminal
justice system at a later stage. I recognise the issues associated with
the definition of bullying, but those could be worked through,
particularly as we know that youngsters are now being subjected to
constant abuse, often over social media. This is a real opportunity,
then, and I would like to work with the Minister to take the matter
forward and potentially introduce amendments making it clear that, as
the Home Secretary said a few months ago in her opening remarks about
the Bill, bullying is unacceptable in a civilised society.</hs_Para>

want to make two further points. I am chair of the all-party group on
alcohol misuse, and as the Minister will be aware, many of the
representations sent to MPs in advance of the Bill mentioned the cost
of alcohol misuse to our front-line services, particularly the time the
police spend dealing with people misusing alcohol on our streets and in
our town centres at weekends—and, indeed, in domestic violence
situations, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:44:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones) mentioned. The Bill is an
opportunity, then, to strengthen the measures and give the
police the tools they need to tackle the issue.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:44:12"></hs_TimeCode>I recognise that
the Home Office is looking through the alcohol strategy consultation
and will, I hope, come forward with some proposals, but this Bill is

final issue I want to raise might sound a bit silly compared with the
other two, but it is something I feel passionately about. This Bill
could have addressed the issue of bogus charity bags, which is a
growing crime that we face in society. This is not just about the cost
of a bag of clothes; it is about giving people confidence that the
clothes they put outside their houses for charity are being delivered
to charity, and that they are not being taken advantage of by those
intent on criminal behaviour. Kent police has worked hard to deal with
the issue, partly because I have badgered it into submission. Kent
police is keen to ensure that the county becomes bogus bag-free and is
using all the agencies, partly because it recognises that organised
crime can lie behind bogus charity bags, which quite often mask other
criminal activities. The money raised goes into much more serious
crimes. The police in my area feel that if they can nip that in the bud
at an early stage, it will save them a lot more time and grief in the
long run.</hs_Para>

is some food for thought for the Minister. I hope he will consider
adding other issues to the Bill. Bullying is a key part of that, but we
also need a statement of intent on alcohol misuse, and I would like
much tougher action taken on bogus charity bag
collectors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

bravery in campaigning to change the law at this most difficult time.
As they say, Jade was a kind girl who would do anything to help other
people, and she would want them to try to prevent any other families
from suffering in the way they are suffering. As Michael says, with
210,000 attacks each year, more than 6,000 people admitted to hospital,

men were attacked in the street by another unaccompanied Staffie. Those
attacks, like the other 400 or so that took place last week, will not

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is still calling
for dog control notices to be introduced. Such notices would
give the authorities the power to intervene if concern is raised about
a dog. They would be able to instruct the owner to take a range of
actions, which could include keeping the dog muzzled, keeping it on a
lead, keeping it away from children or having it castrated. The owner
and the dog could be made to undertake training. I
believe—although not everyone agrees with me—that we
should be able to order the owner to reduce the number of dogs in a

would go part-way towards achieving that, but why not go the whole hog?

local authorities are reporting an increase in the number of abandoned

it does get rid of dog control orders, which give local authorities
specific powers relating to dog fouling, keeping dogs on a lead or
putting them on a lead when told to do so, excluding dogs from

the Government published the Bill, particularly clauses 98 and 99,

for Bolton West and for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger) who had
two of the most tragic cases. It is important to rehearse here that
since 2007 nine people have died as a result of dog attacks, of which
seven were children. The annual cost to the NHS of treating such
injuries is around £3 million. During my first ever election
campaign, I was bitten in a rather sensitive area at the top of my
thigh by a dog of immense good taste. It went unreported because the
dog was owned by a Conservative supporter, and I was not going to take
the matter any further. Some eight attacks on assistance dogs and
hundreds of livestock attacks happen each month. As we know, a number
of communications and other workers are similarly
attacked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T20:57:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000111">We

Scotland is immensely resource intensive; it is labour intensive, and I

Member for Bolton West regretted that the legislation would not cover
attacks on all protected animals, and I would refer to livestock in
that context. Many Members will have received representations from
Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, which opposes breed-specific legislation

It is also concerned about the replacement of dog control notices

hope that the Minister will give a little more substance to what was
said by the Home Secretary. She listed the six powers provided by the
Bill, including the public protection order, the community protection
order and the dispersal power, but I remain to be convinced that any
sort of order will be specific enough. The evidence given to the
Committee was very persuasive, suggesting that dog control notices are
working effectively in Scotland, and I think that it behoves the
Government to explain to the House why they have rejected them. Control

<?notus-xml column=113?>notices are very specific, relating to specific dogs
in specific areas, and I agree with the hon. Member for Bolton West and
others that their retention might prevent future tragedies. If a dog
appears to be out of control, we need to be able to bear down on its

sure that he will be nothing other than honest; that was a bad word to

made by dangerous dogs anywhere, but we have expressed our reservations
about the extent of the “householder case”, and I hope

disappointed that the Government have not taken account of the benefits
to the public of meeting the expectations that the hon. Lady said had
been raised, and the benefits to law enforcers of consolidating the
myriad legislative measures on dog control and breeding. There have
been many newspaper reports of attacks by dogs on other
animals—not just other dogs but, in particular,
horses—which are a real problem in the countryside. While we
appreciate DEFRA’s concern about the need to retain remedies in
both statute and common law, we are not convinced that consolidation
would lead to a diminution of the range of legal options available. I

concern, based on the track record of similar measures, that sometimes
local communities have felt bypassed in that process. We must ensure
that, in tackling antisocial behaviour—it is often an issue with
some of these dark, narrow alleys as sometimes the entrances and
egresses are used for criminal behaviour—there is proper

dog law reform and the Bill’s measures to tackle irresponsible

former Minister who took great pains to work on a cross-party basis to
improve Bills, is that we should please take the opportunity to get the
legislation right. I refer in particular to the issue of dog control
notices. I have not yet heard—it is for the Government to
provide this—compelling reasons why dog control notices are not
appropriate. They are backed by many of the 30 organisations, including
the police, the Royal College of Nursing, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home
and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which
still maintain that a purposeful, direct and discrete measure is needed
in the Bill specifically to deal with dog control. There are at least
two reasons for that. The first is to do with early intervention and
getting, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:07:27"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West said, to the root of the problem
before an attack takes place. That should happen when an animal
displays certain behavioural traits, when a social worker, postal
worker or member of the family has said, “There are real issues
with this animal—something should be done.” Something
could also be done early on with the owner of the animal. I am waiting
to hear a strong argument from the Minister as to why the Government
have taken that position on dog control notices. The Secretary of State
did nothing to dispel my concerns and those of many
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000126">Already

Government’s move to extend to private property the ability to
prosecute. Let us get the balance right in terms of trespassers, but
that move is welcome. It is right to encompass assistance dogs
within the proposals and we support any measure to do that. In
so doing, however, I hope we debate in Committee the aspects that the
Chair of the EFRA Committee touched on relating to equines, bovines,
cattle and sheep in the fields. Following a freedom of information
request, some fantastic analysis was done by the <I>Farmers
Guardian</I>. Many others have campaigned on the issue. They have
identified that there has been a rise in the number of attacks on
farmyard stock: from 691 in 2011 to 739 in 2012. Individual owners must
take responsibility. My family is involved in upland sheep farming, and
we have had to take direct action when dogs have been attacking sheep
on the hills. There must also be some comeback on owners who leave
their dogs out to run wild in the fields or let them off the leash. I

briefings on dog control notices have been produced by Blue Cross, the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the
Communication Workers Union and many other organisations. They
criticise the Bill because they see the four different
measures proposed in it as adding considerable administration and
bureaucracy—I wait to be disabused of that notion by the
Minister in his closing remarks, or perhaps in Committee—as
opposed to being flexible, light-touch measures that can facilitate
early intervention before an attack takes place. Crime prevention
injunctions and criminal behaviour orders, for example, both require
court hearings if requirements are imposed, and there must be someone
responsible for supervising compliance with the requirements, evidence
must be given to the court, and if the person is under 18, the
applicant must consult the local youth offending
team.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000129">When
a social worker goes into a house and they have been told by an RSPCA

same behaviour or the owner riles the dog or is clearly mistreating the
dog, that is when those steps should be taken, and quickly, without
having to go through a lengthy bureaucratic procedure. What we need are
bespoke dog control notices, instead of a generic approach. The
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee is very firm on that, as
are many outside organisations. The Minister will have to work very
hard in Committee if he wants to persuade us
otherwise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000130">DCNs
can work. There is a parallel, and it is not only provided by Scotland.
There are provisions under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 for what are
called IS87s issued by the RSPCA, and we should look at their
compliance rate. These are very flexible and easy to use. Last year
10,728 IS87s were issued, and the level of compliance was 93%. They do
work, therefore; they offer a much lighter touch and are much more
effective. If we look back to previous years, we see that the
compliance rates were 97%, 94%, 96% and 97%. I therefore say to the
Minister that there is an alternative way forward, based on the DCN

simply package this in with the wider generic package of measures that
may or may not be effective, when the police and others are looking to

want my hon. Friend the Minister to know that I have listened very
carefully to many of the contributions to this debate, and he has a
problem. He has a real problem with the measures that are supposed to
deal with the difficulties caused by dogs. We have heard incredibly

the Minister—I hope he is listening—that he needs to tell
the House why the Government do not think that the measures that have
almost universal support on both sides of the House, other than from
the Front Benchers, and that are in place north of the border should
not be included in the Bill. I understand the desire not to have a
smorgasbord of measures dealing with antisocial behaviour, but we are
talking about a specific problem, to which a specific solution exists
in Scotland and which, from the contributions I have heard this
afternoon, is effective. He will need to make it clear to the House,
although not necessarily tonight as we are not going to divide, but
certainly in Committee, and subsequently, precisely why the
Government are not in favour of introducing those measures.</hs_Para>

the problem 
<?notus-xml column=117?>of illegal raves in his constituency. I have to tell the House that my
constituency is not too distant from Cambridgeshire, despite what we
feel may be frequently thought in the corridors of Whitehall, and it
has the same problem. I was speaking only last week to some of my local
farmers who have encountered it. Anybody who has seen the aftermath of
one of these illegal raves knows that we need to have in place the
measures necessary to deal with that problem. In addition to dealing
with the questions about dogs that have been put to him by other hon.
Members, one thing that I want to hear from the Minister when he winds
up the debate is that the measures in the Bill will deal effectively
with the problem of illegal raves.</hs_Para>

I said at the outset, the principal issue to which I wish to address my

with which the Bill needs to grapple and for the Minister to
make it clear to the House that it will do that. I say that conscious,
of course, that

me begin by identifying what the problem is, because this issue is
hidden from the vast majority of Members of this House and our
constituents. Every year, thousands of people—principally the
young and, therefore, vulnerable—are affected by it. We are
talking about more than 1,000, based on the statistics we have from the
forced marriage unit, and I pay tribute to the previous Government for
supporting it when it was set up in 2005. We know from the research
that has been conducted and from anecdotal evidence that the 1,000-plus
people who contact the unit every year are simply the tip of the
iceberg. We do not know quite how many young men and women are
affected, but they deserve the protection of the law and they have not
had it south of the border in the way that Scotland has enacted
it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061043000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000138">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:19:28"></hs_TimeCode>
is therefore right that we welcome the measures in part 9 of the Bill,
which address, for the first time, the criminal nature of forcing
people to contract a marriage where one, or both, of them does not wish
to do so. This intervention that the law requires to be made comes not
just in the context of young and vulnerable adults; in the vast
majority of cases they are being forced into the situation not only by
the people they love, but by the people who are supposed to be looking
after them, caring for them and ensuring that their transition from
childhood to adulthood proceeds smoothly and in a way that makes them
useful, valuable and happy members of our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:19:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000139">As
I say, the measures in the Bill are to be welcomed. The difficulty with
the existing law, for which the previous Administration are to be
criticised, is that the system to protect those who find themselves
confronted with this problem contained in the Forced Marriage (Civil
Protection) Act 2007 was simply to have in place civil law measures,
which, in effect, led to an order or series of orders against those who
might force people into marriage.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061043000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000140">The first
problem with that—a point that the previous Government failed to
listen to—was that it sent out completely the wrong message.
Forcing someone into marriage is not only not desirable; given the
context in which it occurs, it ought to be a crime. Although some 
<?notus-xml column=118?>responses to the Government’s consultation indicated that there
might be some downsides to criminalising such behaviour, we ought to be
absolutely clear that this is not acceptable behaviour in our society,
and if it is not acceptable behaviour in our society, it ought to be a
crime in England and Wales, as it is in Scotland. Of course, other
criminal offences may be committed during the course of forcing someone
to contract a marriage, but they may not be, or they may be so serious
that there is a reluctance on the part of the vulnerable person
affected to instigate a complaint or a
prosecution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000141">The
second problem with having only a civil law system of dealing with
forced marriage is that it led to a lack of awareness on the part of
professionals, certainly in 2011 when the Select Committee on Home
Affairs reported on what precisely could be done, as a
matter of law, when a young person found themselves in this
position. The follow-on point is that once a forced marriage protection
order of some description had been obtained, as far as many
professionals were concerned that was the end of the problem, but of
course it is not necessarily the end of the problem; it is important to
see that the order and its provisions are
enforced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000142">The
third problem was that in the absence of criminality, there was a lack
of effective protection, or a lack of an effective penalty, although of
course people were put into custody for breach of orders made by the
courts. The deterrent effect of having only civil law remedies, which
were difficult to enforce and rarely enforced, was therefore
lessened.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061043000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000143">It is
important to get this point across: none of this is to attack
legitimate arranged marriages, which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:21:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Reading West (Alok Sharma) referred to in an
intervention on the Home Secretary. None of it has anything to do with
proper arranged marriages, or interferes with the customs or culture of
minority communities in this country. I understand that the original
decision by the previous Administration not to criminalise forced
marriage south of the border may well have been based on a desire not
to be seen to target minority communities. Nobody wants to target
minority communities, or to attack their culture or customs, but I have
to tell the Opposition Front Benchers that, given the problem of forced
marriage, that was an error—an error that this Government
propose to rectify, with cross-party support, in part 9 of the Bill.
That is very much to be welcomed, as is the entirety of the Bill,
subject to the points that I have made, which the Minister
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:22:46"></hs_TimeCode>will need to

As babies we are only sensory beings. When we cry, we do not know what
is wrong—that we are wet, hot, cold, tired, hungry or bored. We
just know that something is wrong. Babies rely on an adult caregiver to
meet their needs, to soothe them, and ultimately to help them learn
that the world is a good place.</hs_Para>

the first year of life, the baby’s brain will form a million
neural connections per second. Most of us receive good enough care from
good enough parents, so our brain connections will develop into a
healthy pre-frontal cortex, and we will become emotionally resilient
adults, making a positive contribution to society. However, for the
baby who is neglected or abused, the development of the brain will
literally be stunted. Not only that, but the constantly raised level of
the stress hormone cortisol, as a result of the baby being left to
scream himself into exhaustion day after day, will lead to a
significantly greater risk that they will suffer poor physical and
mental health outcomes, and crucially in relation to today’s
debate, that they will develop a high pre-disposition to high
risk-taking behaviour, such as violence, substance abuse and
criminality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:26:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061043000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061043000150">I
want to see early intervention clauses in the Bill because quite
simply, what happens to the infant before the age of two has a profound
effect on their later ability to contribute to society. Let me give
three quick examples. First, violent criminals are shown to have a high
level of tolerance to their own stress levels. Secondly, there is a
study of long-term prison inmates that suggests that they have
attachment problems stemming back to babyhood. Thirdly, the dramatic
increase in recent years of the incidence of hyperkinetic syndrome in
children points to the increasing prevalence of insecure attachment. A
lack of secure attachment to a loving adult in babyhood will lead to a
lack of social capacity in adulthood. All too often, unloved or
neglected babies go on to have no real sense of responsibility or code
of conduct, and they struggle to empathise with other
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:27:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

much of the cost to our society of antisocial behaviour could be
slashed if we focused our efforts on turning around the fate of these
individuals in the perinatal period. Supporting families that are
struggling to form a secure bond, via parent-infant psychotherapy,
family-nurse partnership, better antenatal assessment of maternal
mental health, better training for health visitors and family workers,
and more joined-up working by midwives, health visitors and
children’s centres, would all contribute to a better society.

problems once they have set in. This is the position we have got
ourselves into as a society. The cost of dealing with it is vast, and
reoffending rates are very high, so I urge the Government to take the

Leadsom:</Member></B> I have certainly mentioned some of the specific
measures. One of the big problems at the moment, which the Children and
Families Bill seeks to address—I was delighted to be part of its
Bill Committee —is the need to speed up proceedings when
children need to be taken away. All too often, when there are doubts
about whether a baby can stay with the birth parents, social workers
find it difficult to make that final decision, so the baby is
repeatedly passed into and out of care. Very often, the toddler can be
three or even older before a final decision is taken. They can
be passed backwards and forwards, with profound and
detrimental consequences for their early brain development.</hs_Para>

is at the very sharpest end where there are real doubts and concerns
about that child’s ability to stay with their birth parents. In
the less terrible cases, perhaps mum has suffered desperately from
post-natal depression, perhaps she has had previous children taken
away, perhaps she has a violent boyfriend, husband or partner at home
who is causing her great difficulty in being able to form that secure
bond with her baby. There, clearly, we need to be providing talking
therapies, not drugs. All too often, when a mum presents with
post-natal depression to a GP, she will be offered antidepressants,
which will mean that she cannot breastfeed and she becomes something
like a zombie, unable to form that vital secure bond. That has profound
consequences for her infant, as I have

Minister of State, Home Department (Mr Jeremy Browne):</Member></B>
Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to conclude this
thoughtful and extensive debate. I am grateful to the right hon. Member
for Delyn (Mr Hanson) for his largely thoughtful speech, although it
was slightly diminished by his failure to acknowledge that this
Government are presiding over the lowest level of crime since the
independent survey began more than 30 years ago. That is a painful
truth, but those of us who put the interests of our constituents before
party political debating points are proud of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000040">This
has been a wide-ranging debate. Some contributions centred on parts of
the Bill that have not been widely commented on, and there were some
constructive ideas from my hon. Friend the Member for North East
Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay) about police community support
officers and from my hon. Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire
(Andrea Leadsom) about early
intervention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000041">Large
parts of the Bill are broadly popular across the House. For example,
the right hon. Member for Delyn touched on provisions relating to the
College of Policing and the Independent Police Complaints Commission,
and we will have an opportunity to study those in greater detail in
Committee. He also welcomed the proposal, which I think is popular
across the House, to make possession of a firearm with intent to supply
a criminal offence. Of course, this country has some of the toughest
controls in the world on firearm ownership, but we are considering how
guidance can be strengthened further to take account of some of the
concerns that have been raised by hon. Members.</hs_Para>

pleased to hear widespread support—including from the hon.
Member for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones) and my hon. Friend the Member
for Keighley (Kris Hopkins), who made a forceful, emotional and
articulate speech—for the Government’s new proposal to
criminalise forced marriage. Members were right to draw the distinction
between arranged marriage, which involves the consent of both parties,
and forced marriage, where mainly young women or girls, but
sometimes—in about one in five cases—young men, are
coerced into marital arrangements completely against their will. This
is a difficult and sensitive issue, because they are usually coerced by
their parents or another close family member, so nobody underestimates
the difficulties faced by the Government, the Home Office and the
Foreign Office in bearing down on this practice. We believe that
criminalising forced marriage is the right step to take. It sends a
powerful signal, and I think it is in tune with the mood of the
country. I believe there is broad consent on those measures across the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000043">About
90% of the contributions over the past four hours or so of debate have
focused on antisocial behaviour, which is central to the Bill, and
dogs. Let me talk about those two issues in turn.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:49:24"></hs_TimeCode>I am sure that
every Member of the House who conducts regular surgeries for
their constituents or who talks to their constituents more informally
about their concerns recognises the importance that the public attach
to the issue of antisocial behaviour. My constituency is by no means an
inner-city area with high levels of crime, but antisocial behaviour is
the issue most often raised spontaneously when I ask my constituents
which of their concerns ranks
highest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000044">Antisocial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:50:21"></hs_TimeCode>
behaviour blights people’s lives and can cause profound misery.
Even though some of the behaviour does not sound of huge consequence in
the grand scheme of things—such as late-night noise, neighbours
behaving aggressively or people ringing doorbells and running away late
at night or early in the morning—it can cause great fear and
unhappiness. The cumulative effect of that behaviour can be
profound.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000045">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:51:05"></hs_TimeCode>
say as a liberal—with both a small “l” and a big
“L”—that people should be free from fear and
persecution. That should be a measure of the civilisation that our
society has attained. Many people across the country do not live free
from fear and persecution, and it is their own neighbours and people in
their community who impose that appalling state of affairs upon them.
There is an onus on us in this House to see what we can do better to
protect people in those
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000046">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>
is with that in mind that we are introducing quicker and more flexible,
but still proportionate, powers. We are de-cluttering and streamlining
the legislation on antisocial behaviour that has grown incrementally,
although with good intentions. We are streamlining the current 19
measures into six easier-to-use ones, but without weakening or
diminishing the powers of the authorities—the police, councils
and others—to assist the public. Why would the Government or any
Member of this House want to weaken their ability to do that? We
believe that the streamlined measures can be used more flexibly and
speedily, and will allow the authorities better to assist the public to
combat antisocial
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:52:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000047">There
are tough sanctions. One or two Members feel nervous about them, but we
believe they are necessary to give the legislation force and to
underpin the seriousness of this behaviour, which impacts on ordinary
members 
<?notus-xml column=126?>of the public. There are also positive requirements in the Bill. As well
as having measures to punish people and restrict their behaviour, we
want to enable them to address and correct their behaviour. We
want to see how those positive requirements can be used effectively.
That was touched on imaginatively by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:53:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch). We will certainly
consider with her and the Department for Education what steps can be
taken in the Bill or elsewhere to advance the points she
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:53:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000048">The
community trigger and the community remedy are important aspects of the
Bill. The community trigger is designed to help persistent victims of
antisocial behaviour. Often, a single incident is not devastating for
an individual—although it could be—but the cumulative
impact of incidents night after night or week after week does have a
severe impact. The community trigger will ensure that there is a
backstop in place so that there comes a point, sooner rather than
later, when the authorities are obliged to act. Ideally, we would want
the authorities to act immediately, but they will not be allowed to let
a situation drag on. So that there is no misunderstanding, I should
make it clear that the requirement in the Bill that at least three
complaints have been made is a maximum threshold, not a minimum
threshold.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0003.htm#13061046000049">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T21:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>

shadow Home Secretary described the Bill as a Christmas tree Bill, and
suggested some extra baubles she wished to hang on to what she had
already described as a cluttered Bill. It was perhaps surprising to
some Members that Labour seems to have set itself against having
streamlined, effective, new antisocial behaviour powers. Instead, we
have the normal, lazy, endless checklist of unfunded spending
commitments. The shadow Home Secretary talked about more money for the
police, more money for CCTV, more money for councils and more money for
legal aid—it went on and on. Last week’s rather
implausible effort to recast Labour as trustworthy with the national
finances has failed to survive first contact with the Opposition Front
Bench. We will see what happens, but my fear is that her vast array of
spending commitments may just become Labour’s next child
benefit: furious opposition, followed by meek acceptance that the
Government got it right and the Opposition got it lamentably
wrong.</hs_Para>

Twenty-two per cent of children in Barnsley Central live in

to success. Young people have a range of options open to them when they
reach further education, from the study of A-levels and BTECs to
apprenticeships and other vocational courses, but the Government are
making it harder, rather than easier, for young people to access
further and higher

decisions to abandon the education maintenance allowance, treble
tuition fees and remove the Barnsley-inspired future jobs fund have
delivered a triple whammy for young people in Barnsley Central hoping
to get on the career ladder. Consequently, the number of young people
in my constituency in further education is falling. In 2011-12, 8,600
young people from Barnsley Central started a further education course
of one kind or another. This was 400 fewer than in 2010-11 and 1,400
fewer than in 2009-10.</hs_Para>

reforms to the way in which A-levels are studied also threaten the

exams to make assessment linear rather than modular is likely to affect
the provision of education and skills needed by young people in later

I believe that, in order to create a level playing field for post-16
schools and colleges, we need to remove the basic funding differences.
One issue that has been debated by Members in this House is the fact
that the entitlement to free school meals in schools and academies does
not extend to colleges. Another significant difference is that colleges
have to pay VAT out of the money they receive for teaching and
learning. The principal has informed me that if Barnsley college was

I would like to touch briefly on the issue of youth unemployment.
Despite the recent figures showing that overall unemployment is going
down, the job market for young people is still extremely difficult.
Youth unemployment continues to climb with a growing number of
NEETs—those not in education, employment or training. According
to the latest figures for my constituency, the number of people
claiming jobseeker’s allowance is, at 7.4%, still higher than in
May 2010. With 900 JSA claimants aged 18 to 24—a figure up from

Government’s answer to youth unemployment was to introduce the
youth contract, aimed at providing training and skills. However, the
youth contract has been ineffective, and has failed significantly to
gain employers willing to support the scheme. Fewer than 6,000 young
people have been helped into permanent jobs—just 3.4% of young
people on the Work programme. Those left behind are often people who
are desperate for work, want to earn a living, get on the housing
ladder, start families and contribute to our town—but there are
simply not the jobs
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0004.htm#13061046000108">This
is a tough time to be growing up. There are genuine concerns about the
need to ensure that young people secure the right education, training,
apprenticeships and academic opportunities. My concern is that we are
running the risk that the talents of thousands of our young people will
go to waste. That is why we must talk up the importance of raising
aspirations among young people. Research findings have shown that low
aspirations are related to poor academic attainment and professional
achievement—and that is an all too common trend in times of
austerity. We must therefore take every single

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Skills (Matthew

not least because, as the hon. Member for Barnsley Central (Dan Jarvis)
told us, the beginning of life is full of hope. I strongly agree with
him about the need for and the benefits of aspiration and about the

those who need nurturing as well as challenging those who are ready to

unemployment is undoubtedly a challenge throughout the country. It has
been rising for far too long—its slow and sclerotic rise began
in 2004—but, thankfully, it is now falling, and in Barnsley 210
fewer people aged between 18 and 24 are unemployed than was the case a
year ago. As the hon. Gentleman said, 900 are still unemployed, but
that is the lowest figure for the last five years, and the
figure is falling year on year. Things are moving in the right
direction. While 900 young unemployed people are obviously 900 too
many, make no mistake: we are focusing four square on dealing with the
problem, as the hon. Gentleman is urging us to do. The youth contract,
which he mentioned, has helped about 6,000 people in Barnsley, and I
think that, given the youth unemployment figure of 900, the ratio is
pretty
good.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0004.htm#13061046000113">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned apprenticeships. The 75% increase in the
number of apprenticeships over the last two years to more than 1,300 is
very welcome. I pay tribute to Barnsley college, not only because, as
the hon. Gentleman said, it is an outstanding further education college
which does a huge amount of work for Barnsley and for the whole
community, but because its success rate in apprenticeships is
96%—higher than the 74% national success rate. It is outstanding
in terms of its Ofsted grade, but also in terms of results.</hs_Para>

Barnsley also benefits from being represented by a strong advocate, and
there are areas of agreement between the hon. Gentleman and me. The
first issue on which we agree is the need for more employer engagement
in education. Young people need to be prepared not just for an academic
future—important though that is—but for a life in work.
They need to understand what work is: to understand not only its
benefits but how to engage in it. It is crucial for social mobility
that we help everyone to understand what it takes to get a good job,
and to hold down a job or an apprenticeship.</hs_Para>

also of course agree on the need to support disabled people and people
with additional learning needs in Barnsley and across the country. I
agree strongly with the hon. Gentleman about removing funding
disparities. Our funding reforms for those aged between 16 and 19,
which come into force this September, remove the system that was in
place for 10 years or so, whereby funding was applied per
qualification. That meant that those who took a lot of qualifications,
who tend to be the best educated, ended up getting more funding for
their education from 16 to 19, and those who did fewer qualifications
got less funding. People in full-time education who were doing, say,
one or two BTECS, equivalent to one or two A-levels, would be funded at
about half the rate of a very bright pupil doing five A-levels. That
was wrong. We have changed that so that every pupil will be funded
according to the same formula, with the same basic rate, with
adjustments so that those from disadvantaged backgrounds have slightly
more. There are other alterations for those taking particularly
expensive courses. However, the fundamental point is that we fund per
pupil from 16 to 19. I hope that the hon. Gentleman supports
that
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T22:25:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061046000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/debtext/130610-0004.htm#13061046000116">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned the issues of VAT and free school meals, both
of which I recognise. On free school meals, we need to be careful what
we wish for. Schools have a duty to provide free school meals to sixth
formers, but they do not get funded for it. If colleges asked for the
duty and we were to be fair and have a level playing field, we would
give them the duty without giving them the funding for it. I am not
sure that that is exactly what he is calling for. We give a bursary to
support the most disadvantaged 16 to 19-year-olds, including some in
Barnsley, <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-10T22:26:39"></hs_TimeCode>who

the hon. Gentleman said about Saturday morning lessons in English and
maths was interesting. I strongly agree with him that English and maths
are crucial. All the evidence shows that, as well as being
academic skills, they are the two most important vocational skills. I
will look into what he said about Ofsted and see what the circumstances
were. Of course, Ofsted is

agree with the hon. Gentleman strongly on another aspect: the
importance of data, the league tables and the need for the tables to be
on a level playing field. We need to show not only exam results in an
equal way for different types of provider, but the various destinations
that people go to. Exams are important but they are a means to an end.
It is about what proportion of people get an apprenticeship, what
proportion of people go to university, how many get into work and how
many go on to further study. We are committed to bringing that richer,

are some areas where we do not have a disagreement of purpose, but we
do have a disagreement in terms of what the Government are doing. I
agree with the hon. Gentleman about the importance of early years and
of everyone getting a good start in life. Indeed, the Government are
bringing in the offer for two-year-olds and extending the age range for
the most disadvantaged two-year-olds to ensure that they have support
to help them to get a good start.</hs_Para>

agree about the phrase “The forgotten 50%”, which we hear
almost as an apology from some Labour Members. They have not been
forgotten by us. The introduction, 
<?notus-xml column=137?>strengthening and development of the apprenticeship proposal is vital in
ensuring that everyone gets a good start. We have made it clear that we
want to see a new norm—that young people, when they leave
school, go, of their own choice, either to a university or into an
apprenticeship. Our job in government is to ensure that high-quality
offers for each option are available, and higher apprenticeships in
particular show that, if one goes into an apprenticeship, one can
progress all the way through. I again heard at the weekend the Labour
shadow Secretary of State saying he agreed with the 50% target for
universities, but that can unwittingly push people into the wrong
choices for them.</hs_Para>

on the point about linear rather than modular exams, I entirely agree
with the hon. Gentleman about education not being just a conveyor belt
of exams, but modular exams are more of a conveyor belt. We saw last
summer the difficulties that a modular system can get our education
system into. Linear exams are precisely about testing people on what
they have achieved at the end of their studies, rather than constantly
asking them to learn for another exam and another exam, and to learn
information just so long as they can get through 
<?notus-xml column=138?>the exam and the module. Instead it is about imbuing people with a
deeper sense of what that knowledge conveys.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Mr Edward
Davey):</Member></B> The UK’s oil and gas industry is of
national importance. It plays a vital part in our economic life and
makes a substantial contribution to our energy security. For decades
the  oil and gas sector has been one of the UK’s major
industrial success stories, a key contributor to  growth, jobs
and tax revenue. The industry supports 440,000 jobs directly
or indirectly and paid £11.2 billion in direct taxes
in 2011-12, almost a quarter of all corporation taxes received by the
Exchequer. Investment in the UK Continental Shelf has risen
substantially in recent years, and investment in 2013, up to £14
billion, will reach an all-time high.</hs_Para>

barrels of oil and gas have already been produced from the UK
Continental Shelf, and  20 billion or more could still be
produced. Although peak production is now behind us, we must maintain
our momentum and make the most of the huge opportunity that the UK
Continental Shelf still represents. In addition to the economic
importance, maximising recovery of the UK’s indigenous supplies
of oil and gas will also help maintain security of supply as we
continue on our journey to a low-carbon
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1306101000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/wmstext/130610m0001.htm#1306101000015">While
investment levels are rising and the near-term prospects for the UK
Continental Shelf are strong, it is one of the most mature offshore
basins in the world, and
therefore faces unprecedented challenges that require new thinking. For
example declining exploration and production rates, ageing
infrastructure and declining production efficiency, and the risk of
premature decommissioning of key infrastructure all need to be
addressed if we are to extract the maximum economic benefit for the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1306101000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/wmstext/130610m0001.htm#1306101000016">Government
already have an excellent working relationship with the oil and gas
industry through  our pilot partnership, which has made
significant contributions to addressing some of these challenges over
the last decade. However, I have come to the view that the challenges

use of and extending life of infrastructure, production efficiency,
better collaboration across the industry, increasing the exploration
effort and maximising the use of enhanced oil recovery techniques. It
will also look at the current structure, scale and effectiveness of the
Government stewardship regime in line with the increased technical and

working. Some users have provided the feedback that the device can be
heavy to hold for long periods of time; that the battery life could be
longer and that attaching the device to a mains power supply can
restrict the user's ability to move around when presenting. The

must first have a direct connection to a licensed energy supplier and
be capable of having an energy performance certificate (EPC) produced.
In the case of park homes, the methodology used to generate EPCs does
not, at present, support the full range of park home construction types
(this is because it was initially designed for compliance with the
European energy performance of buildings directive, which does not
apply to park homes). DECC is currently working with the industry to
include a wider range of park homes in the methodology for a future
update, which should then allow those who are directly supplied by a

Javid:</Member></B> The Government’s tax policies during this
period of consolidation have impacted on different income groups in
different ways. The Government has continued to support people on low
and middle incomes, rewarding the efforts of those who choose to work
by taking real steps to make the first £10,000 of income free
from tax. Taken together, the personal allowance increases announced by
the Government will benefit 25 million individuals and
provide a real-terms gain of £443 to most basic rate taxpayers
in 2013-14. At the same time the Government's actions mean that the
richest pay more tax on capital gains, more stamp duty on their homes,
more tax on their pensions, and are less able to avoid or evade
tax.</hs_Para>

remembrance and enabling communities and individuals to participate in
the centenary in a way which is meaningful for them. The Heritage
Lottery Fund (HLF) recently launched a £6 million small grants
programme to help communities mark the Centenary of the First World War
and explore their local heritage. This builds on HLF's other programmes
that, since April 2010, have awarded £13 million to First World
War projects. This includes funding for a project where local Black and
Minority Ethnic families will be working with National Museums
Liverpool to research their family history and involvement in the war.
HLF has also been working with Liverpool City Council on potential
applications to mark the centenary. The Imperial

Featherstone:</Member></B> Weak regulatory capacity for medicines is a
significant obstacle for access to safe, effective and affordable
medicines in poor countries. Where medicines regulators lack sufficient
capacity to perform their basic functions, as they do in many African
countries, delays are caused to the registration and availability of
new medicines for HIV and other diseases. The risks of the circulation
of poor quality and dangerous medicines are also increased.</hs_Para>

supports the long-term vision of leadership by well-functioning African
medicines regulators, using transparent and accountable decision-making
processes and collaborating regionally and internationally as
regulators do in other regions, such as the European Union. Progress
has been made in recent years. Developing countries, under the
leadership of regional economic blocs, have organised to develop
regulatory strengthening plans and political support is growing. The UK
has supported a number of mechanisms which have been established in
this area. These include the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization
(AMRH) effort and the World Health Organisation (WHO) Pre-Qualification
Programme (PQP) which provides a recognised quality standard that is
referred to and used by developing country medicines regulators as well

duties on Category 1 responders such as the emergency services and
local authorities to, among other things, maintain arrangements to warn
the public, provide information and advise the public if an emergency
is likely to occur or has occurred. It also sets out how such
responders should plan for and meet the special needs of potentially
vulnerable people, including those who may have difficulty
understanding warning and informing messages. Further information is
provided in Identifying People Who Are Vulnerable in a Crisis which
provides support to emergency planners and responders to develop local
action plans for identifying groups of people who may be vulnerable in
an emergency.</hs_Para>

made no representations to the US or UN about such allegations. The

not the only purposeful activity prisoners must do. As part of their
sentence plan they may be required to take part in education or
specific treatment courses. To gain access to privileges while in
prison, offenders will have to engage with purposeful activity outlined

station at Kenilworth was noted, therefore we are minded to provide

new station's integration into the programme of wider improvement works
in the area, which are set out in Network Rail's Strategic Business

Hancock:</Member></B> Business education is important for the
Department and head teachers are encouraged to work with charitable
organisations to develop their pupils' entrepreneurial skills. Schools
have the freedom to decide how they wish to encourage business skills
and they will work with relevant organisations, including those from
charitable organisations, to provide the most appropriate opportunities
for their pupils' needs. Charities can apply to establish free schools
and Studio Schools, and can partner employers and universities to
establish University Technical Colleges (UTCs). UTCs and Studio Schools
provide innovative ways for employers and other organisations,
including charities, to help address the skills shortages identified by
employers and to give young people the skills that businesses need.
Employers make significant contributions by assisting with planning the
curriculum and providing mentoring and work experience opportunities
for young people.</hs_Para>

influence whether individuals choose to enter the teaching profession
and continue to work as teachers.  
<?notus-xml column=134?>The changes to teachers' pay, which are due to be implemented from
September 2013, will give schools the flexibility to set pay within a
broad national framework and pay the best teachers more. Schools are
best placed to develop the right package of reward and support that
will attract the right people into the profession, help new teachers to
continue to develop throughout their careers, and retain in the
profession those teachers that make the biggest contribution to the
attainment of their
pupils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061112000915" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/text/130610w0005.htm#13061112000915">We

overpayments can arise for a number of reasons if Teachers' Pensions
are not notified of a change in a member's circumstances. Invoices are
sometimes cancelled when subsequent information confirms that there has
not in fact been an overpayment of pension. Recent improvements in
Teachers' Pensions' systems now enable us to exclude these invoices,
which was not possible at the time I responded to the hon. Member's

table provides the total invoices for overpayments issued for each year
since 1997. However, overpayments can occur over a number of years, and
an invoice can relate to several previous financial years. It also
shows the amount of overpayments recovered per year, but this may
relate to an invoice issued that year or a previous year where debt
recovery has taken some time. These figures also exclude cases where
the overpayment has been secured for future recovery, for example
through offsetting of future benefits, or the placing of a charge on a
member's property when they have demonstrated that immediate repayment
would cause hardship, as defined by HM Treasury's
guidelines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061112000921" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/text/130610w0005.htm#13061112000921">The

construction industry, as explored by the House of Commons Scottish
Affairs Committee in their Interim Report, ‘Blacklisting in
Employment’, published on 16 April 2013. The practice of
blacklisting, and refusing to hire a potential employee for
discriminatory reasons, was made illegal under the Employment Relations
Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010 and we expect all contractors to
comply with this legislation. Following the publication of the Interim
Report, we will seek confirmation from all who bid for work directly
procured by the Department that they do not carry out such practices.

Boles:</Member></B> We recognise the importance of public houses and
other local services to local communities. Compared to the policies we
inherited from the last administration, the National Planning Policy
Framework provides increased protection for community facilities and
states that local planning policies and decisions should guard against
the unnecessary loss of valued community assets such as public houses.
Communities can also use the community rights we created through the
Localism Act to help protect public houses and other community assets.
This is happening through the development of neighbourhood plans and
the inclusion of public houses as assets of community value. The
Community Right to Bid has already been used to list at least 360
assets of community value, of which 67 are public houses.</hs_Para>

their council tax rate for long-term empty properties at above 100 per
cent in the 2013-14 financial year. This will help to encourage
long-term empty properties to be brought back into productive use,
increasing housing supply and improving local amenity. It will also
raise revenue that can be used to keep overall council tax bills down
for hard working families and pensioners.</hs_Para>

Alcohol-related admissions</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The number
of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by
the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48
indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of
a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to
alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable
to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found
at:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The
application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is
now available directly from HES. As such, information about episodes
estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from
previously published data.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>Alcohol

Poulter:</Member></B> Blacklisting is an abhorrent practice. That is
why, in response to the findings of the investigation by the
Information Commissioner's Office into The Consulting Association, and
subsequent consultation, the Government legislated in 2010 to prohibit
the use of blacklists. The Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists)
Regulations 2010 make it unlawful, subject to certain exemptions, to
compile, use, sell or supply 'prohibited lists', ie a blacklist.
Individuals who believe they are being excluded from employment because
of a blacklist should seek redress in county courts in England and
Wales, or Court of Session in Scotland. Other rights under the
regulations can be enforced in employment
tribunals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061115001606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/text/130610w0007.htm#13061115001606">The
creation, supply or use of a blacklist is also likely to amount to a
breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 as information about the
individual's membership of a trade union is sensitive personal data.
The Information Commissioner has the power, increased in 2010, to
impose fines, of up to £500,000 for serious breaches, on data
controllers who unlawfully process data. This can include not only the
individual or company that created the blacklist, but any employer or
agency using it for employment vetting.</hs_Para>

unlawful under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1992 to refuse
to employ a person because they are a member or not a member of a trade
union, or because they refuse to join or leave a trade union. It is
equally unlawful for an agency to refuse employment services on those
grounds. An individual can bring an employment tribunal claim within
three months of the offence taking place, or longer if the tribunal
decides it was not reasonably practicable to bring the claim in
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061115001608" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130610/text/130610w0007.htm#13061115001608">To
date, we have received no evidence that blacklisting is ongoing, though
Ministers are keen to encourage individuals to come forward with any
new evidence. The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills, the right hon. Member for Twickenham (Vince Cable), met the
Information Commissioner on 2 April 2013 to discuss how any new
evidence would be

Varied Length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is

employment without good cause, or losing employment through misconduct.

Officer who makes the decision.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>6.
Fixed Length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is

programme or carry out a Jobseeker's Direction. Payment of benefit
continues in full pending the Adjudication Officer's decision on a
sanction question.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>7. Entitlement
Decisions: These are questions on which entitlement to jobseeker's

Jobseeker's agreement is suitable, whether they are actively looking
for work or making themselves available for work. In most cases payment
of jobseeker's allowance will be suspended by benefit processing until

Fixed Length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is

programme or carry out a Jobseeker's Direction. Payment of benefit
continues in full pending the Adjudication Officer's decision on a

Entitlement Decisions: These are questions on which entitlement to
jobseeker's allowance depends. For example, if there is doubt around
whether the jobseeker's agreement is suitable, whether they are
actively looking for work or making themselves available for work. In
most cases payment of jobseeker's allowance will be suspended by

is based on a study comprising a sample of 900 volunteers, who were
