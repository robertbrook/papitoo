Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government carefully considered a
number of issues before announcing the franchising programme schedule
on 26 March. This schedule sees the commencement of a new franchise on
the intercity east coast in February 2015. This will return the
franchise to the private sector after an extended period of public
control, putting in place a long-term partner for the significant
investment that the Government will make in the east coast main line in
future

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, I have two questions. Will the
noble Earl confirm that his ministerial colleague in the other place
got it wrong when he stated that the publicly operated east coast main
line returned a lower figure to the Treasury than the privately
operated west coast? The 2011-12 figures show the opposite: £156
million was returned to the Treasury from Virgin on the west coast and
£177 million was returned from the publicly operated east coast
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>, so my
second question is this: what, apart from political dogma, inspires the
Government to propose ending the east
coast<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>‘s
successful
operation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Attlee" PimsId="3822" UID="13060477000941" xid="1061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000941">Earl
Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, on the noble Lord’s first
question, the short answer is no. During the three years to 2012, the
Treasury received £411 million and £450 million from the
east coast and west coast rail franchises respectively. This is
completely separate from the money that the DfT paid to Virgin Trains
as part of the revenue-based risk-sharing mechanism, which by its
nature is variable, so the statement that my right honourable friend
made is factually accurate. The bottom line is that the plans that we
have set out will drive improvements to rail services and put
passengers at the heart of a revitalised rail franchising
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:38:37"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
also important to remember that rail franchises are not directly
comparable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000005">It
was never intended for the east coast main line to remain in the public
sector. Indeed, when the then Secretary of State, the noble Lord, Lord
Adonis, explained in this House in July 2009 the decision to bring the

Palmer:</Member></B> My Lords, I must declare an interest, as the House
of Lords pays an enormous amount of money to get me travelling from
Berwick-upon-Tweed to here, and, indeed, my family spends an awful lot
of money on buying their tickets. Since the east coast service is
operating remarkably successfully and is working well, why is there

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, many noble Lords have privately
approached me and said how well the east coast franchise is working
under DOR. However, we need a longer-term investment plan for the
future. The Brown review finds that franchising is a fundamentally
sound approach for securing the passenger railway services on which so
many people rely. The Government remain committed to benefiting from
private sector innovation and operational experience in their
railways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Shipley" PimsId="5802" UID="13060477000944" xid="2068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000944">Lord

rail franchises cannot be compared, which may or may not

compare the performance of different operators on the east coast line?
The failure of the private sector was what made it necessary, was it
not, for the Government to intervene in the first place. Can he at the
very least explain to the House in what way the successful operation of
the east coast line under DOR has been analysed so that its successes
can, as a minimum, be pointed to when a private sector operator takes
it over, so that it can emulate them?</hs_para>

very good, because under Directly Operated Railways we understand the
franchise and DOR will be able to suggest how in future the new

is grounded in the clear, credible and specific consolidation plans and
new fiscal framework announced in the June Budget of 2010. The fiscal
mandate to achieve a cyclically adjusted current balance by the end of
the rolling five-year forecast period has ensured a flexible fiscal
response to economic developments by allowing the automatic
stabilisers to operate and by protecting the most productive public
investment expenditure.</hs_para>

That £50 billion comes after selling some of our prime assets

funds abroad think better of investing in than our own pension funds

accepted some degree of responsibility. Some flexibility in the fiscal
framework is called for, and the obvious flexibility is to extend the
planning horizon—I advise the Government on this with no
charge—to the whole length of the business cycle so that we
could have some expansionary fiscal policies now, followed, in due

40 banks that are participating in the Funding for Lending scheme,
27 expanded their lending and 13 contracted it. There was a
small net contraction—much less than in recent quarters. There

desirability of bringing forward infrastructure expenditure. That is
why last year we put in place the infrastructure guarantee programme,

Maastricht target over the period to 2017-18, even the relaxation that
the EU has agreed in recent weeks with France, Slovenia, the
Netherlands and Spain will get them back to a target of borrowing of
less than 3% by 2015 or 2016. It is therefore taking us a lot longer.

number of women MPs and Cabinet Ministers. It is also worth bearing in
mind that until 1958 there were no women in this House of Parliament.
There was universal suffrage in 1928, but that did not mean that there
were women in both Houses of Parliament. She is right about those
numbers, and most of them have come in recent times. The first thing is
to make sure that we get women into Parliament. I pay tribute to the

electorate and they decided against it for the House of Commons, but

tackling illegal content very seriously. In 2012, 255 individuals were
found guilty of the principal offence of possessing prohibited images
of children or of possessing indecent photographs. In the same year,
1,315 individuals were found guilty of the principal offence of taking,
permitting to be taken, making, distributing or publishing indecent
photographs of children. It is, unfortunately, clear that there are

convictions each year. The figures show that one in six of those
involved in child pornography will commit a sexual offence on child. We
would like to work with the Government to ensure swift and co-ordinated

important development. However, our preference is for such websites to

we can discuss these matters. The respondents to the Department for
Education’s consultation said clearly that parents feel that it
is their responsibility, with the help of the industry, to keep their

easier for them to use the online safety tools available to them if

Noakes:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a privilege to start our second
day of debate on this important Bill. Yesterday our debate was a
wonderful demonstration of this House’s ability to tackle
difficult issues with restraint and respect, and I hope that we may
continue in that vein today.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060477000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000065">There are three main
reasons why I support the Bill. First, I support it because I am a firm
believer in marriage. Enduring relationships between couples, based on
love, respect and responsibility, are good for the people involved and,
in turn, strong relationships are good for society. Couples who want to
share their lives together do not have to get married, and the Bill
will not change that, but many value the sustainability and stability
that marriage offers. I believe that marriage is a great environment in
which to raise children but, for all kinds of reasons, marriage today
is not defined by children or even by the possibility of procreation.
Marriage is a much bigger concept than that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060477000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000066">Being gay or lesbian is
not a lifestyle choice but an essential fact about a small but
significant minority. It is as natural for them to seek lifetime
relationships with a person of the same sex as it is for most of us to
share our lives with an opposite sex partner. As a happily married
woman, I will gladly extend marriage to committed couples who happen to
be of the same sex. I genuinely find it difficult to work out why other
happily married people want to deny them the privilege of marriage, and
I certainly reject the suggestion made yesterday that same sex couples
should invent their own name in place of
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000067">My
second reason is that same sex marriage has popular support. The House
of Commons Library note on the Bill makes it clear that polls can be
skewed by the questions asked, but the clear evidence from the various
polls that have asked straightforward questions about same sex marriage
is that there is a majority, 
<?notus-xml column=1060?>and an increasing one, in favour. The most important feature is that
support is huge in the younger age groups, and only those over 65 show
net opposition. I hope that noble Lords will reflect today that same
sex marriage will have its greatest impact on age groups that are
barely represented in your Lordships’
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000068">Freedom
is my third reason for supporting this Bill. We have to ask very
serious questions about why the law should deny people the freedom to
do things that they want to do. Of course, there are strong public
policy grounds for stopping people from doing all sorts of things, but
I struggle to see what public policy grounds should prevent same sex
couples from being married. If we embrace the freedom to marry in the
Bill, it will surely bring happiness to a minority. I have heard
nothing in the debate thus far that points to clear and specific harm
to other groups in
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000069">I
could have seen a public policy reason for objecting to the Bill if it
rode roughshod over the ability of the established religions to
maintain their own concepts of marriage, but the quadruple lock
arrangements in the Bill seem to me—and to the Church of
England, if I read its announcement last month correctly—to
provide robust protections for religious
freedoms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000070">Marriage
is a great institution that belongs to society as a whole, not to
particular groups. Parliament is the right place to guard access to
marriage. We have the privilege of a free vote and we must use it with
wisdom, for the benefit of society, regardless of our personal
preferences. If the noble Lord, Lord Dear, decides to divide the House,
I hope that we will respect the clear decision of the other place on a
free vote. We can then move on to the job that we are good at, as a
revising Chamber, testing all the detailed concerns that have rightly
been raised by noble Lords in this
debate.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13060477000362" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000362">3.13

Alli:</Member></B> My Lords, gay men and women have waited for far too
long to have the same rights as straight married couples—the
right to say, “Not tonight dear, I have a headache”, or,
“You don’t look fat in that dress”, the right to
tell all those wonderful mother-in-law jokes, and even, in the case of
the noble Baroness on the government Front Bench, the right to marry
George
Clooney.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000072">Before
I move to the substance of my speech, I want to pay tribute to two
Prime Ministers. I start with my right honourable friend Tony Blair. It
is his unstinting commitment to equality, taking us from the unequal
age of consent through same sex couple adoptions, the repeal of Section
28 and civil partnerships, that has made it possible for us to be here
today. I also want to pay tribute to the Prime Minister. Change
requires personal courage and, on this issue, there can be no doubt
that David Cameron has shown a huge amount of that. I also pay tribute
to the others in the Conservative Party who have joined us on these and
the Liberal Democrat Benches in our fight for equality. The vote in the
other place was a source of real pride—to see so many MPs, and
particularly so many Conservative MPs, add their voices to ours in a
free vote—and I hope that we will see the same again
today.</hs_para>

Bill is not about the right of one group against the rights of another.
It is about love. It is about who we love and about how we express that
love between one another. Marriage is not a contract based on property.
It does not belong to one group of people or one group of religious
organisations. It is not a contract that is based on financial
advantage or disadvantage. It is a contract of love and
commitment.</hs_para>

opposed this Bill have spoken passionately on the basis of deeply held
religious views. I am sincerely glad that the Government have listened
to their concerns and put watertight protections into the Bill.
However, the Bill is equally designed to allow those religious
organisations that want to marry same sex couples to do so: the
Quakers, the Liberal Jews, the Unitarian Church.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060477000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000075">Many to whom I have
spoken in the Church of England have argued that allowing same sex
couples to marry would risk the breakdown of the Anglican
communion—the African churches would pull away. Last week in
Nigeria, a law was passed prohibiting gay marriage and banning gay
organisations with a 14-year prison sentence for anyone who advocates
gay marriage—that is, people like me making arguments like
these. The church should not be opposing same-sex marriage because of
the African churches; the church should be supporting it because of
African churches.</hs_para>

same leadership that they have shown on issues such as tackling debt
and poverty. That is a fight well worth fighting. If the most reverend
Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury and others on the Benches
Spiritual support civil partnerships, then I, like many gay people,
wait with bated breath for the liturgy to allow civil partnerships to
be blessed in churches. They have talked the talk; it is now time to
walk the
walk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000077">There
are also those who say, “We don’t understand why you want
marriage. Civil partnership is different but equal”. It is an
understandable question. However, it is an emotional response. To find
the answer, they need only to have listened to those powerful speeches
of their noble friends on their own Benches: the noble Baroness, Lady
Barker, and the noble Lords, Lord Black of Brentwood, Lord Smith of
Finsbury and Lord Browne of Madingley, yesterday. Different, in this
context, is not equal. Different is different and equal is
equal.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060477000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000078">There
are also those who oppose the Bill because they just do not want
change. They have by and large opposed every change in equality over
the past 15 years. They are the people who campaigned for
Section 28, and I heard echoes of it again last night as they spun the
lie that teachers will be made to promote gay marriage. They are the
people who campaigned against same sex couple adoptions, regardless of
the interest of the child. They are the people who campaigned against
civil partnership but find no problem with it now. For them, no
argument will suffice.</hs_para>

to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dear. I am sure there are many
like me who believe that this amendment is wrong in principle. It does
not uphold the best traditions of this House in spirit or in the manner
in which it has been managed. However, the noble Lord has put his
amendment down, so vote we must. I hope that today 
<?notus-xml column=1062?>we will demonstrate to those who seek to wreck the
Bill that they will fail. I ask noble Lords to vote for the Bill
because everyone deserves the right to have their love recognised
equally by the state and because religious organisations should have
the right to marry same sex couples, but not the obligation to do so. I
hope that noble Lords vote against the amendment because it is the
right and decent thing to
do.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_04_PT_1/26D212F3E76720489FE6C27CD0F527E20258C84B" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 June 2013">Tuesday,

to enforce this debate is by evidence rather than by advocacy. Among
the five challenging and always interesting daughters that my wife and
I have between us, my oldest daughter is a 40 year-old

married, they hope—to another professional woman with one child.
Past relationships—including, in my daughter’s case,
heterosexual relationships —have proved unsuccessful and

Birt:</Member></B> My Lords, my upbringing was in the intense, enclosed
environment of post-war Liverpool Catholicism. Until I went to
university and until I was first exposed to the tentative calls for the
decriminalisation of homosexuality, I had not the slightest idea what
it was. I knew that Oscar Wilde had been imprisoned, but for what
exactly was a
mystery.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000086">I was
not alone. In the 1960s, on the first television programme that I ever
produced, I worked with Kenny Everett—a supremely talented
iconoclast, who was the programme’s main presenter. Kenny was
only two weeks younger than me. He had lived on Merseyside but a mile
away, although I had not known him, and he went to another Catholic
school just down the road from
mine.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000087">In his
teens, Kenny appreciated that he was different. He would tell me that
he had experienced stirrings in the presence of handsome young men, but
these feelings were unfathomable to him. It was not until later when he
worked in London in his early 20s, and not until after he had indeed
married, that he came finally to understand and slowly to embrace his
true nature—the one with which he had been born.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:00:25"></hs_TimeCode>In the decades
that followed I worked in broadcasting with many other people who were
gay but who would not admit it. I recall vividly that in the 1980s a
close and esteemed colleague came with tears in his eyes to tell me
both that he was gay and that he was about to die of AIDS, which,
tragically, he shortly
did.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000088">Even<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
in the 1990s, friends and colleagues who were clearly gay were
unwilling to acknowledge it, especially in public. Yet social and
cultural attitudes have changed rapidly. One of the most profound and
progressive changes I have witnessed in my lifetime is how many men and
women are now unabashed about their homosexuality, and feel free to
present their partners with pride and confidence. Openly gay couples
are now commonplace in almost every section of society and almost every
walk of
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000089">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
introduction of civil partnerships was a vital step, allowing gay

who wish to do so to match opposite-sex couples, and make the powerful
public statement of love and commitment that marriage
proclaims.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000090">On<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

feel not a scintilla of hesitation or doubt. If gay couples want that
option—that unequivocal equality with heterosexual

certainly hasten the day when homosexuality is accepted as a wholly
natural state.</hs_para>

cause me sadness. Along with everybody else who has spoken, I accept
the need for religious freedom. I accept it and I respect it. I recall
the persecution of Catholics in this country. However, I do not have to
admire the fruits of that freedom. The perspective of the other side of
the argument is that the Bill entrenches and legitimises the
discrimination that still exists in the established churches. The
notion that a gay in a civil partnership may only be a bishop in the
Anglican Church if he is celibate, for instance, I find both
astonishing and repugnant. Yet over the past two days we have heard
that there is already some diversity of opinion within the established
church on the matter of gay marriage. I do not expect to see
it in my lifetime, but the day will come when age-old
discrimination within the churches against both women and
gays—born of ancient attitudes, in different societies and in
older times—will simply wither away. The inherent
values of tolerance and respect, reflected in Christ’s essential
teaching, will one day
prevail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000092">My
second sadness is that the Bill narrowly missed an opportunity to
follow Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland and allow the growing
ethical but non-religious movement to which I proudly belong, the
Humanists, to conduct legal marriage ceremonies. That is a regret and a
missed opportunity. However, I recognise that this brave Bill
brings us one historic step closer to a better world, and I

Civil Partnership Act 2004 was to construct a legal relationship as
closely as possible to the legal relationship of married couples, and
that was successfully achieved. The principle of this Bill is to open
the institution of marriage to same-sex couples. An institution is more
than just a name: it is defined by its purposes and by the conditions
under which it may be entered. The institution of marriage exists for
the mutual support of the spouses and to provide a suitable environment
for the natural procreation of children by the spouses and for their
growth and
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:31:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000096">It
was realised long ago that if spouses were too closely related there
was a risk to their children from inbreeding and therefore the
prohibited degrees of relationship were laid down under which it was
not lawful to marry. The extent of the prohibition has varied over time
but it has always included close relationship by blood. So important a
purpose is the natural procreation of children in the institution of
marriage that the prohibition applied even when the parties were well
over the age of childbearing or unable to bear children for other
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:31:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

procreation of children may be a possibility for a man and a woman, it
can never be for a same-sex couple. Therefore a union between them,
however loving, cannot have this purpose. Therefore the union proposed
for a same-sex couple must be different from marriage since it cannot
have this purpose. Non-consummation is not a ground for declaring this
union void. A marriage is voidable on the ground of non-consummation,

between the parties. There is no such implication in the union proposed
in this Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:32:36"></hs_TimeCode>.

matters immensely to me. My own marriage has been one of the most
important and fulfilling aspects of my life, probably the most. It has
brought me companionship, support, shared experience, enjoyment and
many other benefits, including the pleasures of children and
grandchildren, over more than 40 years. I do not suppose that
there are many long-married couples who would say that their marriage
had all been plain sailing, and I certainly would not make such a
claim. But my wife and I made a commitment, to ourselves and to each
other, in front of our assembled friends and family: a public
expression of our desire and determination to make our marriage work
for the long term. That commitment, both private and public, has given
our relationship much greater strength to withstand the varied
challenges that we have
faced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000103">We in
the UK have come a long way over the years in recognising and accepting
those within our society whose preferences in love are for members of
their own sex. Many of them form stable, long-term, deeply loving
relationships, sometimes including children. So why should they too not
enjoy the full benefits of 
<?notus-xml column=1066?>marriage, with the added commitment that it implies, with equal
recognition of their status by the state and society and with that
extra resilience in their relationship that my wife and I have enjoyed?
I believe that they should, and that view has been reinforced by some
of the powerful speeches that we have heard, such as those of the noble
Baroness, Lady Barker, the noble Lords, Lord Black of Brentwood, Lord
Smith of Finsbury, Lord Browne of Madingley and Lord
Alli<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>, and by

a human institution, in the sense that its nature and responsibilities
and rights are defined by the state in statute. Those definitions, as
we have heard, have been adapted over time as the needs and nature of
the state have evolved. Of course there are also other definitions of
marriage, notably those of different religious faiths. They have every
right to their own views about what marriage means for them and their
adherents. So I welcome the safeguards included in the Bill to ensure
that no religious organisation or individual minister can be compelled
to participate in a same-sex marriage ceremony. I was reassured by the
speeches of the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, and the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, indicating that the “quadruple lock” will be
robust, although it seems odd that we are being asked by the noble
Lord, Lord Dear, to reject the Bill before this and other issues can be

also welcome Clause 8 of the Bill, which extends to the Church in Wales

couples also have the option of civil partnerships, although it is
surely anomalous for these to be available to them alone. If my wife
and I had had that option as an alternative to marriage, I do not
believe that we would have considered it for a moment, because a civil
partnership simply does not bring with it those elements of public
commitment and social recognition that are central to our view of
marriage—what the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, rather
splendidly described as the

support the Bill, not just as an equality measure whose time is right,

many fear that there will be inadequate protection for religious
organisations and individual ministers. There has been a plethora of
legal opinions on this subject and I have read, I think, all of them.
The main cause of legal alarm in this context is that the European
Court of Human Rights, or even our courts interpreting the convention
in accordance with the Human Rights Act, may penalise those who for
religious reasons do not want to be involved in any way with same-sex
marriage.</hs_para>

do not share the enthusiasm of some noble Lords for the Strasbourg
jurisprudence and have very considerable reservations about the Human
Rights Act. One of my principal quarrels with the Strasbourg court is
its repeated failure to afford individual states what is known as
“the margin of appreciation”. Where Parliament has
expressed a clear statutory intention or otherwise manifested its view
in an unambiguous way, the European Court of Human Rights should be
very slow indeed to interfere. However, despite such expressions of
purpose—for example, on prisoner voting—Strasbourg has
decided that our law is
non-convention-compliant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000111">However,
the court in Strasbourg has shown considerably more reluctance to
interfere in areas of life where religious freedoms are involved.
Article 9 of the convention guarantees the right to freedom of
religion, and I agree with those distinguished lawyers who have advised
on this point. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Kennedy, are very confident lawyers. They say that it is
inconceivable that there should be a challenge. I am perhaps not as
confident as they are—few lawyers are. However, the robustness
of the challenge so far seems to be sound. The parliamentary draftsmen,
by their so-called quadruple lock, seem to have skilfully ensured that
the Bill is as Strasbourg-proof as it reasonably can
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000112">I have
some residual anxiety because the convention is what is called in
Strasbourg a “living instrument” and there is nothing to
prevent the court taking a different view in the future, particularly
if one has regard to the rather different approach that is adopted to
precedent in Strasbourg compared with how our courts operate. However,
no Government can legislate in complete certainty that a Bill will
survive any legal challenge. It is almost certain that some litigation
will be generated by these provisions. Of course, that is not desirable
but it cannot be avoided where some who are genuinely alarmed at the
change in the law and others who are merely mischievous may seek to use
the courts. However, it seems most unlikely that these challenges will
produce any success and they should peter out in due course. I do not
agree with the scenario described by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of
Stamford, of endless litigation costing millions of pounds. He did not
identify the basis of such potential legal
challenges.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000113">As
well as concerns about religious freedom, there is a substantial body
of opinion which feels that this Bill undermines
“traditional” marriage. This seems a highly respectable
and understandable response to such a cultural change. But marriage has
changed over the centuries and from generation to generation. I
understand the anxieties of those who feel that it is being irrevocably
altered, but surely my noble friend 
<?notus-xml column=1068?>Lord Jenkin is right that marriage will not be
changed retrospectively or prospectively by this Bill. However, in our
desire to embrace equality in this context, we must be careful that we
do not create a new illiberalism. To describe those who oppose same-sex
marriage as bigoted, even in the first draft of a speech, seems highly
regrettable. Indeed, I salute the noble Lord, Lord Dear, for his
tenacity and sincerity in opposing this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000114">On the
question of civil partnerships for opposite-sex couples, the Government
have correctly changed their position to a consultation. I do not think
that a party or a Prime Minister who brings forward this legislation
can fairly be regarded as “obsessed” with gay marriage.

become less and less a matter of consequence or even—dare I

therefore particularly pleased that a Conservative-led Government are
responsible for this landmark piece of legislation. I am not making a

Brennan:</Member></B> My Lords, everything has been said on this
subject already; or nearly everything. I am going to address the House
on certain legal consequences of this legislation that I invite the
House to consider very carefully. We have been fortunate in this debate
to have heard remarkable and telling speeches about homosexual
suffering in the past, and then liberation; about heterosexual
culpability for persecution in the past, and then the sense of
penitence. These are important sentiments. They describe the feelings
of a civilised society, but they are not in themselves the foundations
of law. This Bill may have a background about love, but we are here to
make law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000119">I
have three major concerns about this legislation. The first is the
manner in which it has come to Parliament; the second is the complexity
of the consequences of making same-sex marriages lawful; and the last
is the “what next?” factor. First, how did we come to the
position we are now in? You would think that legislation based on such
controversy, such fundamental disagreement, each side respecting the
views of the other, would have required and got extensive preparatory
dialogue between government and public, between party and party, and
between us in this House. 
<?notus-xml column=1069?>In particular, there should have been pre-legislative scrutiny. The more
difficult the Bill, the more open the parliamentary process should be.
But what has happened here? In 2004 we passed the Civil Partnership Act
after seven days of debate in this House: five in Committee, Third
Reading, and Report in between. The interests of lesbians and gays were
addressed comprehensively. No one at that time, eight or nine years
ago, suggested that there should be the kind of legislation that we
have before us now. No one suggested then, in this House or the other
place, that such legislation was necessary. Have matters changed in
eight or nine years? If they have, then how, and why? What is the
difference now? In 2010, my party passed major legislation, the
Equality Act. In the spring of that year, Section 8 and ancillary
provisions dealt with the protected interests of married couples and
those in civil partnerships. No one suggested that we should introduce
the present type of legislation. If not then, why now? On both of those
occasions, the general picture presented to the public was “this
far, and no
further”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000120">We
are a Parliament of the people. We are not a Parliament just for the
people, paternalistically deciding what the law should be. We should do
our best to represent the people’s wish and will as to what the
law should be. I do not agree that the differential diagnosis of
opinion polls is the basis for objective parliamentary assessment of
what the public think. That comes from debate, electoral exposure and
inquiry. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, says that Parliament
should lead. Have a care, my Lords, when you are told that Parliament
should lead. Parliament should serve, and lead in the service of the
public. Here we are, with no election manifesto to support this change
and a tide of history that began in the past 18 months that is
described as so overwhelming that we have no choice but to accept it.
Come now, let us be realistic. This deserves much more careful debate.
“We are where we are”, say many, “let us get on
with it and do what we can”. If the amendment of the noble Lord,
Lord Dear, is not passed, we will face a Bill in Committee based on
Clause 1: same-sex marriages are lawful. The rest of the Bill is
consequential on that provision. If the Bill goes forward and someone
calls a vote in Committee on whether Clause 1 stand part, are we to
face the same criticism that that is frustrating the will of the
Commons, that the Lords should get on with revision and not delay or
even block it? I do not accept that. That is effectively preventing the
House making a considered decision of its own on the Bill. That is not
democratic. This is the other place, by the will of a Government
without mandate to call for such change and to give a free vote to it,
creating a new constitutional convention that prevents the House of
which we are Members making a block. I do not accept

second point is the complexity of consequences. Overnight and this
morning, I have totted up well into double figures the numerous areas
where amendments will be required to make this a coherent piece of
legislative drafting. I have identified at least five fundamental
differences between heterosexual marriage and homosexual marriage. We
have to deal with these questions. They cannot be cast aside because we
are concerned to satisfy the sentiment so eloquently expressed by so
many. We are here to make law.</hs_para>

there is the “what next?” factor. It is a simple argument
to propose that here is a law that says that two people of the same sex
can marry because of discrimination. Why cannot a third person demand
the same right and want to join that union of two to make it a union of
three? That is eminently simple to argue; it is based on
discrimination; and I invite any subsequent speakers to explain,
logically and rationally, why numerical limits overcome profound
principles of discrimination, if that is what we are dealing with.

there are the conscience clauses. I was reassured by the noble Lord,
Lord Pannick, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy—reassured,

there are no guarantees in the law. I have learnt after many years in
the profession, particularly as its chairman, that we are a profession
where individually we repose a great deal of confidence in the value of
our own opinions. We are trained so to argue. It would be naive to

lies ahead is the unknown. After 2004, 2010 and 2013, what will come

Elis-Thomas:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with the last point that
the noble Lord made. As for the rest of it, I understand the division
between legislatures and the people in a rather different way. If I
have one perspective, it is from First Great Western. As a commuter to
this House from Cardiff Central, I have the opportunity to reflect, as
I did last evening, as I did this morning and as I will do again
tonight. I am still a working politician, elected to the National
Assembly for Wales and representing part of a constituency that I also
represented in the other place. Therefore, I have the dubious benefit
of a dual mandate, although it seems to me that in this House a number
of us have had that experience and a number of us have forgotten it or
never had it. It seems to me that this House is in great danger of
ignoring at its peril the realities of political and social change that
is happening outside. That is what I want to
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
not going to argue about the level of opinion polls, but I am going to
argue about the significance of the size of the free vote and the

I am concerned about, as a former presiding officer in Cardiff, is that
we are faced this evening with a device of a procedural Motion. Of
course it is in order. This is a self-regulating House and we are very
well advised by distinguished officials. I am not arguing with that.
What I am saying is this: what is the logic of voting today to deny a
Second Reading to a Bill, while at the same time continually defining
ourselves as a revising Chamber? By what 
<?notus-xml column=1071?>logic can one revise a text of draft legislation, or
anything else, by deleting it? It is like pushing the delete button
before you have read the e-mail. That seems to me what this House is in

Aberdare has already referred to Clause 8. Clause 8 is very important
to me. It is the devolution clause. It was brought to us from
the Commons. It will enable the governing body of the Church in
Wales—to which I was once nominated by the current Archbishop of
Wales, and no doubt he regrets that; I no longer serve on that
body—to resolve that the laws of England and Wales could be
changed to allow for the marriage of same-sex couples according to the

be denied, and we will remain mere altar servers at the Bench of
Bishops of the Church of England. If this happens, I can promise you
that this issue will not go away. We will continue to campaign with
Stonewall Cymru, gay Christians and others for the law of marriage to
be devolved in Wales as it is in Scotland, and of course as it was in

it is now more clearly understood that marriage has a deep and profound

legitimise the creation of any child arising from that union and to
secure the cohesion and stability of the community in which they live.
It is the recognition of that fact which has led the promoters of this
Bill to include a variety of exceptions to accommodate the reality of
any gay-couple partnership seeking marriage.

discern the attitude of the young. They are understandably preoccupied
with the business of getting on with their own life and tackling the
many problems they encounter on their way. On the whole, I detect a
masterly indifference towards an issue such as this. However, I

main reason for opposing this Bill and for being disquieted about its

competitive and challenging world, need the guidance and sense of
values given by their father. All children, of whatever age, benefit
from the security, stability and discipline of a loving family home.
Children experience many pressures in school and these could be made
much worse if the sort of material I have seen being prepared by

Jay of Ewelme:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly but strongly
in support of the Bill, and will make only three points. First,
attitudes to social issues evolve, and society must evolve with them. I
spent much of my working life in the Foreign Office. Two generations
ago, women had to resign from the Foreign Office on
marrying—today, that is unimaginable. I remember how a
generation ago gay men and women, if discovered, had to resign from the
Foreign Office—also unimaginable today. As Permanent Secretary
at the Foreign Office some 10 years ago, I well remember
attending a meeting open to all staff that was addressed by Ben
Summerskill of Stonewall. He explained convincingly the benefits to us,
and indeed to any organisation, of recognising diversity, whether
gender, sexual or racial, thereby bringing out the best in individuals,
institutions and our society.</hs_para>

right and proper that we respect the right of those same-sex couples
who wish to see their relationships regarded by society as marriage. I
must say to the right reverend Prelates—and it is a rare
privilege to be able to address so many at the same time—that I
hope before long it will be possible for them to celebrate and to bless
such unions themselves.</hs_para>

second point. I myself have been happily married for 38 years. Sadly,
my wife and 
<?notus-xml column=1074?>I do not have children of our own, but we have
nieces, nephews and godchildren who are happily married. I simply
cannot see how those relationships are in any way diminished by
recognising that loving relationships by same-sex partners should also
be regarded as marriage. To share with others what we value ourselves
is surely the sign of a civilised, tolerant and, yes, Christian
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000144">That
brings me to my final point. In our society today, and in much of what
we see happening elsewhere in the world, there is a growth of
intolerance, divisiveness and conflict. The Bill before us goes in the
other direction. It recognises the richness and diversity of human
life, shows tolerance to others and reflects the evolution of our own
society, reflected particularly in the views of the young, who are our
future. It is a Bill whose time has surely come, and one that I am
happy and proud to
support.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13060477000372" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000372">4.13

Cope of Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, we have criss-crossed the
issues of principle over these two days, but I will not add to that
element of the discussion. At this stage of this long debate, I want to
stick to constitutional points. Various speeches, starting with the
courageous speech of the noble Lord, Lord Dear, have
referred to the constitutional position of the House of Lords.
Doubt has been cast, by him and others, on the validity of the
Commons’ decision. It is said that the Whips overdid it to such
an extent that we should discount the Commons’ two-to-one
support for the Bill, and should use our undoubted reserve
power to refuse to discuss the Bill any further. That view is
mistaken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000146">It
exaggerates the Whips’ influence, particularly on a free vote on
a matter of conscience, and I speak as a former government Whip in the
Commons for eight years, during two Parliaments. It also discounts the
constituency pressures on MPs. We have heard about the lack of
commitment in the most recent manifestos, but it is not the previous
election that focuses MPs’ minds on constituents’ views
when deciding how to speak or vote; rather, it is the next election
that they are looking at. That is why they pay careful attention to
constituents’ views, late in a Parliament in particular, in
politically uncertain times. There is no excuse for this appointed
House to overrule the elected House and say that the Bill is so
erroneous that we refuse to discuss it
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000147"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Waddington" PimsId="4473" UID="13060477001016" xid="1107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477001016">Lord

the House of Lords being able to contribute through a Committee stage

I have indicated, another theme of the debate is whether the safeguards
for the churches, teachers and registrars are sufficient, and whether
the Bill is properly drafted. That is for the House to consider in
Committee. The Commons Committee stage has also been criticised, but
that is not a reason to avoid a Committee stage here. It is a reason
for having one, to consider the detailed provisions with care and the

procreation are the two deeply underlying structures that exist in
marriage—the union between two families, two tribes, two
dynasties, that are linked by their bloodline thereafter for mutual

respect and interest to the passion and concerns that arise from the
redefinition of marriage set out in this Bill. I have spent the past
few months researching a television proposal on the history of various
Christian institutions, and one of the main areas of my research was
the institution of marriage. As has been mentioned by many noble Lords,
including the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, it is clear that
over the 2,000 year-long history of Christian marriage it has been open
to continual redefinition both by the church and the
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:31:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000169">I
have gone back to the early church, in which marriage was seen as a
contract between a man and a woman. It was adorned by Christ’s
presence and commended by St Paul. But for nearly 1,000 years after
Christ, there was no such thing as a church wedding; marriage remained
a civil ceremony, even for Christians. The church recognised only
baptism and the Eucharist as sacraments, which were performed inside
the church, while marriage was often performed at a slight distance
from the church building. I found proof of this in an English medieval
liturgical text, the Sarum Rite, which suggested that marriage should
take place in the church porch, rather than in front of the altar, as
happens in church weddings today.</hs_para>

the 11th century, when reforms initiated by Pope Gregory VII meant that
the church started to take control and redefine marriage in many
different ways. Most importantly, it laid down that marriage was now a
sacrament, an eternal union of a man and a woman divinely dispensed,
one of seven sacraments. The rules of marriage were changed, laying
down in canon law that it was not possible to marry within seven
degrees of consanguinity and even prohibiting marrying godparents or
their children without the church’s
dispensation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:32:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:32:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000171">The
church control of marriage broke down when the reformation swept
through northern Europe in the 16th century. The protestant reformers
once again saw marriage as a contract. In England, marriage was no
longer regarded as a biblical sacrament. In the Church of

only for baptism and the Supper of the Lord. A marriage was

principles of marriage have been continually redefined over the last
two centuries by both church and State. The supposedly lifelong nature
of marriage was redefined by the state in 1857, with the passing of the
Matrimonial Causes Act. Marriage was no longer eternal; it could end in
divorce. The church’s control of marriage was broken by
establishing a central divorce court in London unattached to the
church. At the time, this change in the nature of marriage outraged
many Anglicans, and some prominent clergy left the Church of England in
protest, but divorce is now a feature in Anglican life. It is not just
the state which has redefined marriage; so has the church. The 1549
prayer book made it clear that the wife was unequal to her husband, but
this part of the marriage contract was redefined in 1927, when the
Church of England introduced an alternative marriage service. It
removed the wife’s vow of obedience in the marriage service and
proposed instead that she should now make the same vow as her husband,
to honour and love her spouse. But the ruling stirred huge debate in
the national assembly of the church, with opposition being led by Lord
Hugh Cecil and Athelstan

way”. I acknowledge that that impression is plausible, given how
this measure has been presented, and that is why bringing forward a
measure that was not in the manifesto should have been accompanied by
the bringing forward of measures that were—for example,
recognising the importance of marriage in the tax and benefits systems.

the Family, founded by Rob and Di Parsons 25 years ago, which provide

on the need to give this legislation more consideration. We need to
check that the balances and safeguards that have been presented are
adequate, and what better place to do that than in your

informally whipped into the Lobbies. I wish that, for example, the
government Chief Whip in the other place were here to give evidence
about how uncontrollable the government Benches, in particular, are

supporting the amendment—I speak as someone who has served as a
member of the Whips’ Office at both ends—is that I think
it is a tactical mistake. Some people, including me, have some very
serious reservations about the Bill as it currently stands, and we
would like to see those tested by Members of this House, through
amendments tabled and reasoned, before we give our consent to the Bill
at Third Reading. However, we are being put in the position of having
to decide on a constitutional issue—namely, whether we should
try, at Second Reading, to close off a Bill which has come to us from
the other place with a majority of 225 on a free vote. Personally, I
should like to see the Bill proceed to Committee and Report, and then

understand why there is such opposition. Most people now accept
equality as a desirable aspect of society. Achieving this has been a
long struggle, and unfortunately there is still a criminal element
which is responsible for homophobic violence. Yet most people,
including those who oppose the Bill, would strongly deny homophobia.
They accept that we now have civil partnerships. Those of us who always
supported gay rights believe that we have won the popular argument.
Then why not accept the Government’s Bill? Why not have same-sex
marriages, if that is what two people who are deeply committed to each
other really want? Why such strong opposition? It is strong enough to

come

married woman was virtually her husband’s possession, with no
rights outside the marriage and not very many within it, and no right
of inheritance. Remember the novels of Jane Austen. Marriage has
changed in order to deal with the change in the status of women in
society. I believe that we should also come to terms with the change in
society in relation to homosexual
relationships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000192">There

been in your Lordships’ House I have come across many Bills from
all quarters of the House with which I have profoundly disagreed. But
none has made me as uneasy— and I use that word
deliberately—as this one. The Government and others say that it
is popular, but a great many of the people I know—and much more
widely, and also among those who are long-term supporters of the
Government—despair that such a measure should be brought
forward. That is because the Bill goes to the very heart of
individuals’ personal and deeply held views about what marriage
is. As the noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:49:13"></hs_TimeCode> Kennedy of

Episcopal Bishop of Aberdeen and Orkney, someone well versed in the
overall nature of marriage, whether religious or otherwise, as I sought
to organise my own thoughts about this debate. It is a view which I
share. It is that 
<?notus-xml column=1084?>the heart of marriage features both the complementarity as well as the
difference between men and women. It cannot do that between those of

expressed over the past two days, marriage is a vital, life-giving
institution in our society. It has evolved in its current form through
a long and complex process, as the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of
Culross, explained. It is an institution which recognises the
complementarity and the difference between the sexes. Marriage offers a
framework of stability for this and, when properly lived, has been
proven to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:50:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ingredients, perhaps early on comes the simple fact of companionship.
All of us who have been married learn over time that to make a

many other aspects. That is well known to those who have been married
for many years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:51:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, there are other types of companionship relationships: caring
for an aged parent, siblings living together when they are older,
coping with a sibling or friend with a disability, and so on. There are
also those who are simply friends and perhaps share a property. These
might all be examples of great dependency and, indeed, interdependence,
so might there be a case for same-sex marriage to be argued on a basis
of mutual companionship? Perhaps, but it is hardly conclusive as none
of these other companion relationships requires a marriage bond for
them to work

it not the case that the current movement towards same-sex marriages
comes not just from a given equality perspective but because of a
mistaken desire for institutionalised recognition within a time

that marriage and the special meaning that the word conveys is not the
means by which this should happen. In a same-sex marriage there simply
is not the complementarity and difference that there is between a man
and a woman that forms part of its essential structure and character.
Indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:52:52"></hs_TimeCode>, it is
the word “marriage” within this Bill that creates the
problem to some, including me. Whereas it is the foot-of-the-door

is true, as the Government have argued in introducing the Bill, that
the means by which the marriage bond has been recognised over centuries
has changed and has evolved into a quite sophisticated legal contract,
to say nothing of the religious covenant it is now. If marriage stands
for stability through complementarity and difference between the sexes,
then same-sex marriage cannot become that which it seeks to be.
Furthermore, it risks destabilising an institution that at its heart
honours
stability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:53:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000202">High
expectations are therefore placed on those who enter into the marriage
bond, and those within it should model or, at the very least, aspire
and work towards the ideals of faithfulness and security which 
<?notus-xml column=1085?>society requires for its stable balance. I would not dream of suggesting
that faithful and secure modelling of a relationship between people of
the same sex in civil partnerships does anything other than add to the
well-being of society. Indeed, it seems to me that civil partnerships
provide all that is necessary for same-sex
partnerships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:54:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
The point I want to emphasise is that no relationship between those of
the same sex can equal or match that complementarity and difference to
which I referred earlier which is found in marriage. It cannot create
another human being, and that is what differentiates, and always should
do, civil partnership from
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000203">It
seems to me, and to a great many others to whom I have spoken, provoked
no doubt by this Bill and the huge amount of mail that it has
generated, that there is a manifest and meaningful difference between
marriage and all other forms of relationship; that marriage should
remain as it is, a bond of faithfulness and security, however difficult
to achieve, but always to aspire to, legally binding and perhaps
religiously covenanted, between a man and a woman. A civil partnership
can continue to enjoy the brand of complementarity that its own
circumstances brings, one hopes to the well-being of society. But
marriage it most certainly is not and it cannot be made
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000204">I
therefore believe that this Bill is fundamentally wrong and is likely
to do considerable damage to, or certainly put at risk, a much
respected part of the way society works and achieve nothing for
same-sex partners that cannot be achieved already. It turns an aspect
of society’s norms and values on its head and changes the well
understood and accepted meaning of the word marriage in perpetuity. I
fear for the future of family life if this Bill is passed. I shall

Earl of Clancarty:</Member></B> My Lords, the great majority of young
people are baffled by the fuss over same-sex marriage. In terms of
change happening, they do not see a huge gulf between civil
partnerships and marriage, even as we need to acknowledge that the
distinction is important for gays and lesbians who wish to be married.
The latest YouGov poll for the <I>Sunday Times</I> last month had
under-40s in favour of same-sex marriage by more than three to one.
Indeed, some young people that I have talked to believe that same-sex
marriage already exists in this country, and are surprised that this is
not yet the case. Young people’s opinion is well in advance of
the legislation
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000206">There
are some in favour of the Bill who have argued that, with the
conditions attached, it takes a modest and reasonable step. I do not
entirely agree with that assessment because real progress in human
rights, which is what the Bill is about—a point made yesterday
by the noble Baroness, Lady Lister of Burtersett—always enters
new territory and is always difficult for some, if not, in this case,
for the majority of young people. The Bill will redefine marriage
but, I believe, for the
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000207">The
institution of marriage as it stands is the last redoubt of
discrimination against gays and lesbians. It reminds me of the
latter-day struggles that women have had, long after they won the right
to vote, to gain 
<?notus-xml column=1086?>access to the pubs and clubs, among other places, from which, in many
communities, they continued to be excluded—excluding them from
defining aspects of the culture. Whatever people think of marriage,
and, as we have heard in this debate, there are those who are critical
of marriage as a formal institution, the reality is that marriage is a
defining aspect of our culture. However, just as we are in the process
of restructuring our social and work meeting places, so we also need to
redefine marriage to make it a more inclusive
institution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000208">The

questionable assertion that marriage in any form is the fundamental
building block, I would argue that it is not the constituent sexes that
make it a building block but the public act of commitment by two
individuals to each other, as some brilliant, heartfelt speeches have
already made clear. We should recall Elizabeth I’s dictum not to
be making “windows into men’s souls”, a politic
plea for religious tolerance in her own time that, in ours, should
become an acceptance that there are many valid reasons why two people
wish to get married. No church, whatever its policy, should have a
monopoly over this institution, and Quakers and other churches that
wish to perform same-sex marriages should be allowed to do so. This
will be the meaning of
equality.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060477000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000209">As

those who see marriage in a traditional sense are missing the much
wider picture that unusual or even themed weddings that do not have
religious content in any formal manner are already taking place.
Heterosexual couples are introducing their own personal or spiritual
stamps on their marriages. Therefore, it seems doubly ironic that a gay
or lesbian who is a practising Christian and has been going to church
on a weekly basis over a long period of time may have no claim over
having a church marriage, whereas a non-believer has. That is a matter
for the church, though, and the speeches that we have heard over the
past two days from Christians give me hope that things will change. As
someone who is married and therefore part of the institution of
marriage, I would be embarrassed if, at the very least, the opportunity
presented by this Bill was not taken to allow others who have been
excluded to now be able to
participate.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060477000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000210">On
civil partnerships, I agree with what Peter Tatchell has said about
equality. The important thing is get the Bill on the statute book. I
suspect that it will become clear quite quickly that heterosexual
couples will be at a disadvantage over the choice of form of union that
they can opt for and that further legislation will be needed to correct
this if the correction is not included in the Bill, which would be more
efficient. It is perhaps most immediately important to ensure that
heterosexual and gay couples have the same, equal rights in terms of
survivor benefits.</hs_para>

around the House, I think it would be fair to say that most of our
marital choices have already been made, whether that means having
married once, twice or more, or not—yet. But the young people of
this country who are still to make these choices are very clear about
how they feel about same-sex marriage and what they want us to do. If
this House were to vote the Bill down—I say “were”
because I do not believe that that will happen—it would show
itself to be seriously out of touch with the youth of the country. I
support the Bill and will vote against the amendment of the noble Lord,

Conservative, with a mere silver wedding approaching, I strongly
believe in marriage as a force for good and I lament its decline in our
society. We know that married couples are twice as likely to stay
together as those who cohabit. Now we have people who want to get
married, to make a lifetime commitment, yet some of us are not sure
whether we should allow that to happen. Let us be clear: marriage and
the lifelong commitment it involves are far from easy, and a successful
marriage takes work. We do not do enough to help floundering marriages
and struggling relationships, such as strengthening them and rewarding
people for doing the right thing. We should. But stopping gay people
marrying is not part of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000214">At the
heart of this Bill is a straightforward proposition. If a couple love
each other, why should the state stop them getting married unless there
is a good reason? In this day and age, being gay is not a good
reason—if indeed it ever was. Of course, for some religions and
faiths, this goes beyond their beliefs. As a result, the Bill
specifically protects the rights of those who do not agree and does not
compel anyone to do anything. All religious organisations are free to
choose whether to opt in or out. The Bill simply allows people to get
married—a clear and simple objective, delivered in a way that
promotes and protects religious
freedom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000215">We
have heard quotes from the correspondence we have all received. I would
like to read a few remarks from an e-mail from a Church of England
vicar, well known to me, which seem to get to the heart of the matter.
He said: “I have come to the firm conclusion that there is
nothing to fear in gay marriage and indeed that it will be a positive
good, not just for same-gender unions but for the institution of
marriage generally. The effect will be to place centrally in marriage
the idea of a stable, loving relationship, rather than anything else.
Rather than this being a dramatic change, it is actually a radical
reform (in the proper sense of ‘radical’) recalling the
institution to the heart of its real meaning”. Those are wise
words and ones that I hope in due course his church and mine
will come to accept.</hs_para>

other main argument against the legislation is that it would undermine
marriage. However, I have not heard a convincing explanation of how it
would undermine marriage. Yes, it is controversial, but decriminalising
homosexuality was controversial, as was equalising the age of consent.
It was also controversial when the Labour Government rightly legislated
for civil partnerships. Once those things were done and the world did
not end, public opinion changed, and that is what will happen
when this legislation is
passed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060477000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0001.htm#13060477000217">I am
part of that changing public opinion. I am by nature a small
“c” conservative. I do not like change. There is a part
of me which longs for the simpler, safer world of my childhood.
I admire those like my noble friends Lord Fowler and Lady Noakes and my
noble kinsman Lord Jenkin who have been totally consistent in their
approach, but to be honest I am not sure whether I would have supported
this Bill 15 or 20 years ago. I was sitting on the steps of
the Throne during yesterday’s debate next to the noble
Lord, Lord Filkin, when his 2004 speech was quoted. He turned
to me and said, “I was wrong. I have changed my mind”. He
is right. Times have changed, and I have changed, and one of the
reasons why I now support the Bill is because I have children in their
twenties who, like many other young people in their teens, twenties and
thirties—whose voice incidentally has been lacking from the
national debate over the past few months—just do not understand
what on earth the fuss is about. As others have said, the polls all
show younger people to be overwhelmingly in favour of the Bill.
My own sons have said that they are proud of me, their father,
and indeed their grand- father, for supporting the Bill, and
would have been ashamed had we voted against it. We need to recognise
that for conservatism to work, we have to accept that the world
changes. If we do not, we become an
anachronism.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_04_PT_1/B28BE54245BFA982714EF312284FE2EB5D1EE4FF" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 June 2013">Tuesday,

previous Government. However, I am also proud that across all political
parties there is now a consensus that respects the right of lesbian and
gay people to celebrate their relationships. Britain can now rightly

There is no doubt that the changes that we have seen so far have helped
to shape more progressive attitudes but, in my view, far from inciting
intolerance, this measure will go a long way towards challenging it. As
my noble friend Lady Royall highlighted yesterday, a real problem
remains. There are 20,000 homophobic crimes annually and 800,000 people

parameters have changed, but up to this time marriage has not required
a legal definition because there has been an historical consensus about
its meaning. This Bill is a proposal to do away with the historical
consensus and introduce a new meaning. This was laid out more
eloquently than I could in the speech yesterday of the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Exeter. It has also been voiced to me as a
concern by the Scottish Law Society. If we have to go down this road, a

difficulty lies in the determination that there can be no difference

Marriage Act 1541, as illustrated by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick.
Indeed, as we have heard, that is just as well, otherwise we should
still be treating marriage as the transfer of the property of the woman
from the father to the
husband<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T17:33:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are the grounds for saying that Parliament should not exercise its
rights to extend the provision of marriage? It is claimed that
permitting same-sex marriage devalues marriage. That is not an argument
but rather an assertion of moral superiority. It rests in good measure
on a rewriting of history—a point well made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Neuberger, and indeed the noble Viscount, Lord Colville
of Culross—and on biblical text. The Bible has been used to
justify all sorts of discrimination that we now regard as morally
abhorrent. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury has
noted, the text of the Bible has not changed, but our
understanding has. In every sphere of life we are constantly learning,
except, apparently, in this one respect, where we cling to a view held
4,000 years ago.</hs_para>

of the debate has been conducted as if we were the first nation
contemplating the introduction of same-sex marriage. We can learn from
what has happened elsewhere. Most of the nations that permit same-sex
marriage are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights.
Their churches have not been forced to do anything by the European
Court of Human Rights that they do not wish to do. We have heard
assertions in this debate that the introduction of same-sex marriage
has led to a decline in heterosexual marriage. I have the figures here,
which are readily available in the briefing paper produced by the House
of Commons Library. Some countries have seen a decline in traditional
marriage, notably Portugal and Spain, but in Portugal that was
happening before the introduction of same-sex marriage. In Belgium the
figures for traditional marriages went up, not down. A study of the
Netherlands found that trends in marriage and divorce did not change.

Lordships’ House. I am not envious of the task that the Minister

should be proud. Today, we are not being so adventurous, because we are
proposing that the UK will soon join those countries that have now
signed same-sex marriage into law. They are Argentina, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Norway, Spain, South

To them I say that the Government have built huge safeguards into the
Bill, which, it is widely agreed, will do the job. The most reverend
Primate and the right reverend Prelates who have spoken have woven
brilliant theology and arguments against the principle of same-sex
marriage, but as the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, my noble friend
Lady Mallalieu and others have said, the state’s concept of

lawyers can always find something to disagree about, I would encourage
those noble Lords to read back the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord

Bill. Some concerns have been raised by noble Lords about the position
of teachers and faith schools in reconciling their views of marriage
with the new reality. My party is confident that the current law
achieves the right balance in securing the right of faith schools to
educate pupils in a way that is sensitive to the law of the land and
also to students, some of whom may be gay or have parents of the same
sex. I may never use these words again, but I agree with the evidence
that Michael Gove gave to the scrutiny Committee stage in the Commons.

and Lord Kerr, covered the constitutional points, and I agree with
their analysis. We have to look at the strength of feeling in favour of
the Bill in the Commons. It is remarkable that the majorities at Second
Reading and Third Reading were so large. It may serve the

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble
Lords who have spoken in the debate, and to the noble Baroness, Lady
Thornton, for her support. We have had a comprehensive debate that has
shown how this House takes its role seriously and is able to deal with
controversial and sensitive issues in a measured way that respects
differing views. What has come across strongly is that those who
support the Bill and those who oppose it essentially agree on one
crucial matter: the importance of marriage. We all agree that marriage
is a cornerstone of our society that provides stability and brings
families and communities
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T17:54:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000002">It
will not be possible for me to refer to all noble Lords who have spoken
in the debate, or to respond to all the points raised. I hope that
noble Lords will forgive me for that. However, some key themes have
emerged, and I will deal with those. A number of noble Lords,
particularly the noble Lord, Lord Dear, questioned whether the process
that had been followed for the Bill was right. My party was clear about

have conducted the process of developing our proposals in a completely

public consultation, and 
<?notus-xml column=1102?>every response and petition was accounted for and considered with the

that these were not ignored. They were all treated equally, commented

noble Lords questioned whether the Bill had had proper scrutiny in the
other place. Convention tells us that it is not for this House to
comment on how the other House conducts its business. However, it is
worth noting that the Committee stage there was completed with half a
day to spare. The Bill had two days of debate on Report on the Floor of
the House, and was passed by a majority of two to one at Second and
Third Readings. As many noble Lords argued, it is now for this House to
scrutinise the Bill in

on from process, some noble Lords queried the robustness of the
religious protections, including the quadruple lock, whereby no
religious organisation or individual minister can be compelled to
conduct a same-sex marriage; all will be free to refuse to do so. I
say, first, that I am very grateful to the most reverend Primate and
the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester for their
acknowledgement of the work that the Government have done to ensure
that the religious protections in the Bill are effective. The noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, were very
clear in their contributions about their view of the robustness of
these religious protections. However, it is only right, because in my
opening remarks I did not address some of the specific points that were
raised by noble Lords in debate, that I should now do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T17:57:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000005">The
concern was raised that the European Court of Human Rights might order
the Government to require religious organisations to marry same-sex
couples according to their rites, in opposition to their religious
doctrines. To suggest that this could happen is to rely on a
combination of three highly improbable conclusions. First, the court
would need to go against its own clear precedent that states are not
required by the European Convention on Human Rights to provide marriage
for same-sex couples, and that they have a wide discretion in this
area. Secondly, the court would need to decide that the interests of a
same-sex couple who wanted a particular religious organisation to marry
them according to their rites outweighed the rights and beliefs of an
entire faith and its members as a whole. Thirdly, the court would need
to discount the importance of Article 9 of its own convention, which
guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion. It would be
rewriting the rules not just for one religious organisation in England
and Wales but for all religious organisations in all 47 states of the
Council of
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T17:58:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000006">Some
noble Lords raised concerns that the Bill does not deliver equality.
Indeed, they suggested that it creates new inequalities and argued that
it redefines marriage because same-sex couples cannot procreate. I will
return to the definition of marriage after dealing with some of the
specific examples that were raised in this part of our discussion. The
current definition of adultery has been developed in case law and does
not cover relations between members of the same sex. At present, a
married man who has a sexual relationship 
<?notus-xml column=1103?>with another man is not committing adultery. That
would be the case only if he had sexual intercourse outside marriage
with a woman. The Bill retains this definition. Like existing
marriages, a same-sex marriage can be ended by divorce on the grounds
of unreasonable behaviour in such
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000007">As
for consummation, that is not necessary for any marriage to be lawful
and indeed not possible in some, which is why we allow for death-bed
marriages. As consummation is a historical definition associated with
procreation, it would not make sense to extend this concept to same-sex
marriages and there is no need to do so. If for no other
reason, the opportunity for noble Lords to debate these sorts of things
in greater detail is a good reason for this Bill to get more
scrutiny. I am sure that they will not be able to resist debating all
this in great

noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, asked about the law of succession and its
interaction with the Bill, and in particular whether a monarch in a
same-sex marriage could succeed to the throne and whether his or her
child, or the child of his or her partner, could succeed. The answer is
that the Bill does not change anything in relation to the law of
succession. Only the natural-born child of a husband and wife is
entitled to succeed to the throne—not adopted children, children
born as a result of artificial insemination or children born to only
one party to a relationship. That is the position now and it will

teachers has been the subject of a lot of debate and scrutiny already
in the other House. My right honourable friend Michael Gove, the
Secretary of State for Education, who would like to think that he has
the word “standards” stamped through him like a stick of
rock, was clear in the evidence that he gave to the Public Bill
Committee that there is a significant difference between a teacher
explaining an issue and promoting or endorsing it. No teacher will be
forced to promote or endorse same-sex marriage. Any teacher will
continue to be able to state their own belief or that of their
faith about same-sex marriage. However, teachers and schools will be
expected to make clear as a matter of fact in teaching about marriage

for changing the Bill to ensure that employees cannot be dismissed or
disciplined for criticising same-sex marriage, we do not consider that

an amendment by raising doubt in other areas, such as criticising
homosexuality or civil partnerships. It is lawful to express a belief
that marriage should be between a man and a woman, and it is lawful to
do that whether at work or outside work. That is a belief that is
protected under the religion or belief provisions of the Equality Act
2010, and penalising someone because of such a belief would be unlawful
discrimination under that Act. This will still be the position once the

Government’s position on this important issue of same-sex

except in the way they are formed and the way they can be dissolved if
that sadly becomes necessary. Yesterday I explained why marriage is
important to us as a society. Others referred to it as a social good.
We all agreed that the institution, the enterprise, the endeavour or
whichever word we think best to describe it is a good thing, and that
it is important. Some noble Lords, including the right reverend
Prelates on the Bishops’ Bench, my noble friend Lady Cumberlege
and others, have suggested that gay couples should have their own
institution separate from marriage. My noble and learned friend Lord
Mackay of Clashfern repeated that today, and made clear that he

separate institution, gay men and women already have their own
institution called civil partnership. Like the Bill, the arrival of
civil partnerships was a huge change. Unlike the Bill, which has 19
clauses, the Civil Partnership Act had 200 clauses and was
contested strongly in debate in your Lordships’ House. After it
was finally passed, same-sex couples had access to equal legal rights
but they remained different. Marriage remained the preserve of couples
made up of one man and one woman. It is the success of civil
partnerships that has driven greater acceptance of same-sex couples. In
an amazingly short space of time we hear people, including those who
used to oppose them, say, “We can’t believe we were all
so concerned at the
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:06:25"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Civil partnerships have led many people—indeed, the
majority—to say, “Do you know what? If civil partnership
is marriage in all but name, why can’t gay men and lesbian women
get married, if that’s what they want to do?”.</hs_para>

by definition about numbers. In 2010 the Government made a commitment
to push forward unequivocally for gay rights in the coalition
agreement. The fact that three years later we are legislating

Dear:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a long and tiring debate,
and one that has been a privilege in which to participate. I thank all
Members of your Lordships’ House who have spoken, and in
particular those who have offered such steadfast support to me, both
before and during the debate. I am very grateful. As has just been
confirmed, this is a free vote, and Peers across the House have
supported my amendment. All of them recognise that it should not be a
matter for party politics but a matter of
principle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000030">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:14:17"></hs_TimeCode>
is interesting how in the course of this fascinating debate, over two
days, the thrust of the debate, or the tide for and against, flowed
backwards and forwards. Last night, the first half of that session was
more or less in balance, while the second half of last night was
discernibly running in my favour, as it were, and today the tide has
turned and is running the other way. I make no criticism of that; it is
the random way in which the speakers list is put together. Certainly,
all of us agree that this is an issue of profound interest and
importance and one that will affect every member of 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>our society. We cannot escape the fact that the Bill will completely
alter the concept of marriage as we know it. The most reverend Primate
the Archbishop of Canterbury and the right reverend Prelates, the
Bishop of Leicester, the Bishop of Chester and the Bishop of Exeter,
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey of Clifton, and the noble
Lord, Lord Singh of Wimbledon, all explained their opposition to the
Bill and the detailed practical and theological reasons that underpin
their
stance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000031">In<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
the debate over the past two days, it appears to be an accepted fact
that the process of the Bill was seriously and unusually flawed. Nobody
has really challenged those facts, and I comment very briefly on them
because they have been repeated several times already. It is useful to
remember that there was no proper consultation or Green or White Paper.
There was no manifesto or pre-legislative scrutiny. The Government
consultation procedure was, frankly, a mockery, and the result was
rigged, because whichever way you look at it the vote was 83% against
the Bill. It was heavily constrained in its passage through the House
of Commons, with some serious doubts about the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000032">Here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:16:01"></hs_TimeCode>
in your Lordships’ House our debate strangely never came to real
grips with the consequences of the Bill should it become law. There was
very little examination or comment about the major issues of
employment, education, freedom of conscience or the rights and
well-being of children, save the one intervention that I noted
from the noble Lord, Lord Eden of Winton. Neither was very much time
spent on the inevitable impact on the existing legal framework. All we
knew for sure was that the Government had admitted that the impact on
existing legislation would require at least 8,000 amendments. The noble
Baroness, Lady Thornton, has just tried to put that into
context.</hs_para>

hope noble Lords will agree with my very unusual procedure of quoting
five lines from my opening remarks yesterday, which can be found in
col. 947 of <I>Hansard</I>. I reflected on the fact that the
last country to change the law as we seek to do was Argentina, two
years ago, and the results are just becoming apparent. A valued
commentator in that country said
this:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13060485000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000104">“It
quickly became clear that legalising same-sex marriage required a
revolution to our internal law. It impacted laws regulating public
order, identity, gender, rules of kinship, filiation, marriage, names,
marital property arrangements, divorce, alimony, parental rights,
succession, domestic violence, adoption, artificial reproductive
techniques, surrogate motherhood, liberty of conscience, criminal law,
tax law and employment law, among other
topics”.—[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/6/13; col.

there are 8,000 or 800 amendments, that is the sort of change that we
must expect as a result of the change in this

major part of the debate that we have had here focused, perhaps
unsurprisingly, on aspects of love and acceptance—and who,
really, can deny the importance of that? The homosexual community is
very small numerically but is none the less just as important and seeks
society’s affirmation and social acceptability, which it claims
would come from access to, and inclusion in, marriage as we know it.
Civil partnerships already give legal equality, as we know; what is now
being 
<?notus-xml column=1108?>sought is social inclusivity. I, like many others in your
Lordships’ House, was moved by the speeches of, for example, the
noble Lords, Lord Browne of Belmont, Lord Smith of
Finsbury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:18:37"></hs_TimeCode>, and
Lord Black of Brentwood, and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. Their
ability to speak as they did, and that those views can be accepted in
public, was refreshing and
commendable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:18:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000036">I
have been one of many who have helped in some small way to further the
steady growth of full integration of homosexuals into society from a
position of illegality, through a phase of tolerance, if you like, into
full recognition and acceptability. I am also aware of the very large
number of others in society who recognise the huge change that is being
sought by this Bill. Balancing the understandable fears and wishes of
the majority against the understandable demands of a small minority is
a difficult task, but in their haste to force this Bill through
Parliament the Government will not satisfy either group. The noble
Lord, Lord Alderdice, spoke convincingly of the dangers of forcing
legislation on to the statute book without wide consultation and
carrying all shades of public opinion with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:19:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:18:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:18:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
I wholeheartedly
agree<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:19:49"></hs_TimeCode> and have

seems to be, if not general agreement, certainly some agreement that
the Bill is in a mess, ill thought through and without proper process
or popular mandate. The noble Lord, Lord Dannatt, went so far as to say
that the progress of the Bill has to date been tantamount to an abuse
of process. He might well be
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:20:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000038">Some
argue that it should pass Second Reading and be ameliorated in
Committee. We all know that it is constitutionally proper to force a
vote at Second Reading. There are precedents for doing so, the most
recent being the Health and Social Care Bill only two years ago. We
know that such a move was endorsed by the 2006 Joint Committee on
Conventions and I recognise and endorse the usual approach in your
Lordships’ House to taking care and time to examine a Bill in
detail, but not on this occasion. The structure of the Bill is too bad
for that and I am certainly not alone in that view. A battery of big
guns in your Lordships’ House agreed with me that the Bill is so
fatally flawed that it is incapable of sensible amendment and should be
voted down now and sent back to the drawing
board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:21:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000039">Yesterday,

Lord Tebbit, Lord Mawhinney, Lord Waddington, and Lord Anderson of
Swansea, and others—all parliamentarians widely experienced in
both Houses—supported the move to vote the Bill down now. We
have heard the same today from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay
of Clashfern, the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, and—in his short
intervention—the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of
Drumlean<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000040">It
might be a bold move—it probably is—but it is legitimate,
it has a precedent and it is appropriate. Who is prepared to drive a
steamroller over the address given by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan,
himself at one time chairman of the Bar, who asked a series of
questions about what the next factors are, whether we should dwell
solely on emotion and avoid questions of law, and particularly the fact
that Clause 1 of the Bill 
<?notus-xml column=1109?>gives no room for negotiation or manoeuvre when it gets to
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:22:35"></hs_TimeCode>. All
the might of government has been thrown at this Bill. Every corner has

posing a few fundamental questions? Are noble Lords sure that the
process has been properly handled? Are they sure that the Bill has
democratic legitimacy? Are they sure that all the likely consequences
have been thought through—remember Argentina? Are they sure that
we know everything about the legal effects of the Bill? Are they sure
that there will be no later attempts to widen the definition of
marriage further, and are they happy for another Government on another
occasion to ram a different Bill through in this way? If not this Bill,
when would noble Lords vote against a Bill at Second Reading? If some
of the answers are in the negative, I suggest that we vote the Bill
down now and not waste further parliamentary time on it. I suggest that
we send it back for proper, mature research, consultation and debate
about the whole institution of marriage, taking into account, if you
like, civil partnerships for both heterosexuals and homosexuals,
because the issue is too important for all sections of society, gay or
straight, to be introduced on a whim and handled in so cavalier a

open the Committee stage debates on the Care Bill. Schedule 5 relates
to the establishment of Health Education England as a non-departmental
public body. Schedule 5 is concerned with the membership of Health
Education England and other matters to do with its
establishment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:50:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>.

education and training of staff in the National Health Service is of
course a critical responsibility, on which patients depend for good
outcomes of care. The UK has traditionally enjoyed a very high
reputation for the quality of our training and educational institutions
and for the standing of the professional staff who come into the
National Health Service. However, we should also acknowledge that there
are a number of challenges facing the UK in ensuring that we continue
to produce the right kind of people, in the right specialties and in
the right numbers, taking into account the long-term challenges we
face, not least that of an ageing
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000045">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>
received lots of briefings for this part of the Bill, for which I am
most grateful. I was particularly struck by the briefing I received
from the Royal College of Physicians, which points to trends in medical
education 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>and training. On demography, it points out that by 2033 there will be
3.2 million people above the age of 85, with the prevalence of dementia
expected to double. On social trends, people have more choice and
higher expectations. On efficiency, the economy of course will shape
services substantially and we know that, in the short term at least,
the NHS faces unprecedented austerity.</hs_para>

the Royal College of Physicians believes that many elements of the
current training structure are excellent, there is a need for change
too. Many more physicians must train in internal medicine to meet the
new needs of patients across hospitals and community services. There is
an emerging view that too many consultants specialise too soon and that
there is a need to focus more on general physician consultants if we
are to meet some of the problems that hospitals are facing. A&amp;E is
a symptom of the need for hospitals, in particular, to change the way
they are often organised in order to recognise that their key client
group are frail, older people who probably need the attention of
generalist physicians as much as speciality
doctors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:53:23"></hs_TimeCode>. The RCP
points out that the doctor-patient relationship is evolving and that
this needs to be reflected during training. It says that there should
be more flexibility for time out of training and career progression
between different grades which meets the changing needs of
the health
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:53:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000047">Every
royal college and many trade unions and patient groups have made
similar comments about the need to look at the training and
education of our professionals. We know that there are formidable
challenges with regard to nurse education. The Francis inquiry
identified a number of these. There is a real worry that
newly-qualified nurses are not well prepared to take on full nursing
responsibilities. The excellent independent report of the noble Lord,
Lord Willis, commissioned by the RCN, contains some very important
messages for us in our
debates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:54:25"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is a debate among the public and in Parliament about whether the caring
aspect of nursing has sometimes been
neglected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:54:38"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is also the issue of whether healthcare support workers lack mandatory
training and registration. I have no doubt that we will also debate
those
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:54:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000048">The
connection between this and Schedule 5 is that Health Education England
will be faced with many interesting and difficult issues. I can say to
the noble Earl that we support the establishment of HEE in statute and
I am very glad that Sir Keith Pearson has been appointed as chair of
that organisation. The noble Earl will know that he was
previously the distinguished chair of the NHS Confederation and an NHS
trust. He brings to the job a wealth of

1 seeks to delete that but I hasten to add that it is a probing
amendment. I have no problem at all with people of clinical expertise
being on the board—far from it. However, I seek assurance from
the noble Earl that one of the members appointed will be a registered
nurse. This relates also to Amendment
3<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:56:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060485000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000050">I

hope that the noble Earl will be able to respond positively. The
nursing workforce is so important to the quality of care that it is
crucial that Health Education England has nurses around the board table
both on the executive and non-executive
sides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T18:57:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Every
time there is a restructuring of NHS boards, often there will be people
who try to exclude nurses from those boards. They are mistaken. I do

also hope that recognition will be given to the needs of those staff

point. How are the needs of healthcare assistants going to be met if

in the health service, many of whom are not qualified in the
traditional sense of being professionally registered, have a crucial
role to play. I had hoped that Health Education England would be
concerned about the identification and development of those managers. I
remind the noble Earl that there is a big problem in recruiting chief
executives to NHS bodies, perhaps because their length of stay is
almost as bad as that of football managers. That tells it own tale
about the job. I hope that Health Education England will consider that
it has some responsibility to look at how the managerial cadre can be
developed and trained, and how they can be given some security in their
jobs and reassurance about what will happen to them if they need to
move on from one organisation to another.</hs_para>

Amendment 5 deals with the appointment of the chief executive of Health
Education England. Can the noble Earl tell me why the Secretary of
State has to give his approval to the appointment of the chief
executive? We have debated this matter before. If the Secretary of
State appoints the chair and the non-executives, why can he not trust
the chair and the non-executives to do an effective job? I point out to
the noble Earl that in Clause 79, in relation to the CQC, there is a
provision that actually excludes the Secretary of State from appointing
the CQC chief executive. Why it is different for the CQC as opposed 
<?notus-xml column=1116?>to Health Education England? Am I to take it that
Health Education England is considered to be less independent than the
CQC?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000055">I also
ask the noble Earl to consider my Amendment 5, which would
subject the chief executive appointment to Health Select Committee
scrutiny. I know that current scrutiny by Select Committees tends to be
of the chairs of organisations but, in view of the importance of the
work of Health Education England, would it not be worthwhile for the
Health Select Committee to be able to undertake scrutiny of that
appointment? It would be an effective substitute for the Secretary of
State’s
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000056">My next

it intended that HEE employees will be engaged on NHS terms and

final amendment, Amendment 7, concerns paragraph 12(2). It is really a
probing amendment. It concerns the status of Health Education
England’s property, which is not to be regarded as property of,

amendment specifically concerns the membership of Health Education
England and the need for it to include at least one person with
expertise in research and another in education and training. I will
save my remarks on research until we debate later amendments, but so
far as education and training are concerned, my fear is that in the
drive to meet workforce requirements and staffing numbers we will lose
out on standards and quality. This amendment simply makes more explicit
the need for input on the board of someone who has particular expertise
about education and training, and the maintenance of

will make another point now to save making it later. I believe that
there is a conflict, not easy to resolve, between the desire to provide
sufficient numbers of trained staff locally—as determined, quite
rightly, by local providers—and the need to maintain national
standards. For example, in medicine it is vital that a cardiologist,
orthopaedic surgeon, general physician or trained nurse is trained to a
national standard that is recognised everywhere. It is not acceptable
for a local provider to decide what training should consist of, but
they want someone whom they can rely on. It is vital that there are
national standards and hence there is a need for someone at the Health
Education England level who has the expertise to look at how those
standards can be set.</hs_para>

workforce planning is concerned, I have lived through innumerable
efforts at medical workforce planning and found them to be fraught with
difficulty, largely because it takes so long to train doctors: five or
six years as undergraduates, then another five or 10 years of
specialist or general training. Predicting need for different types of
doctors 10 or 15 years downstream is far from
straightforward. The noble Earl kindly sent around a document on a
mandate from the Government to Health Education England. However, I
fear that the section entitled “Excellent Education”,
with its emphasis on training multipotential individuals working in
teams across all health sectors—important though that
is—de-emphasises the need for specialists. That prospect fills
me with apprehension—that five years downstream we will have a
health service lacking essential parts. I fear that the right balance
between the need for general across-sector care and specialist
care may be tipping too far in these particular aspirations. In any
event, for the moment, I will press for the placing of relevant
education expertise on the board of HEE, as suggested in this

the theme that permeates this Bill. The driving principle of reforming

compassion and respect for people.</hs_para>

remember our debates of last year when, recognising the importance of
education and training in the NHS and public health, we inserted into
the Health and Social Care Act a clear duty on the Secretary of State
to ensure that there is an effective education and training system.
This Bill delegates that duty to Health Education England. This means
that Health Education England will be clearly accountable to the
Secretary of State for ensuring that there is an effective education
and training system in place for healthcare workers in England. Health
Education England will provide national leadership for workforce
planning,

backdrop to all that is the changing face of healthcare provision. The
way health services are provided is expected to change significantly
over the next few decades, with more care provided in the community and
an increased emphasis on public health. This cannot happen unless we
equip the workforce with the skills and knowledge to do this. To do it
successfully, the local and national infrastructure needs to be in
place to plan and commission effectively. That is why the creation of
Health Education England and the local education and training boards is
so
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000079">It
is vital that the board of Health Education England has the necessary
skills and experience to oversee the delivery of its important
functions. In recognition of this, the Government have already
strengthened the Bill, following pre-legislative scrutiny, to place an
explicit requirement, in paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 5, on Health
Education England to recruit members with clinical expertise. The
specific nature and description of the expertise and specified numbers
are to be set out in regulations. That amendment has been well received

have members with clinical
expertise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060485000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060485000080">The

helpful to explain our thinking around the Schedule 5 requirement. This
sub-paragraph was added to the Bill following pre-legislative scrutiny
to place an explicit requirement on Health Education England to ensure
that there is clinical expertise on the Health Education England board.
It also responds to responses to the consultation on the Bill, which
touched on the importance of Health Education England having access to
professional leadership. This will give Parliament and bodies
representing the professions the necessary assurance that the Health
Education England board has access to the appropriate knowledge and
understanding in making decisions that impact on professional education
and training. It also provides the basis for a clear duty in the Bill
for both the Secretary of State and Health Education England to make
appointments of clinical experts, which can be developed subject to
regulations. For example, the regulations will specify what we mean by
“clinical expertise” and allow greater flexibility to
specify any detailed requirements. It will also allow changes to be

undoubtedly important for Health Education England to have access to

the great strengths of Health Education England over previous
arrangements is that it has a remit for all the professions, bringing a
strengthened approach to multi-professional education and training.

profession-specific education and training issues covering medicine,
dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, healthcare science and the allied health

the decisions they make that impact on health professional education

England, with the networks of employers working through the

whole workforce engaged in the delivery of healthcare and public

Health Education England special health authority. In making
non-executive appointments to the Health Education England board, the
Secretary of State will source the skills and expertise that are
required to ensure the Health Education England board can function
effectively. The chair and non-executive directors will do likewise in
making executive appointments to the board. That approach has worked
well for the recruitment of the current HEE special health authority
board, which has three members with clinical expertise, including a 
<?notus-xml column=1122?>doctor. I should also mention that two non-executive appointments are
still to be completed. In recruiting for those, we are looking for a

now turn to Amendment 5. The Bill already requires the consent of the
Secretary of State to the appointment of the chief executive of Health

other chief executive officers across the health system and seems
proportionate for a body of this size and nature. In addition to
approving the appointment of the chief executive, the Secretary of

for the role of Parliament, the Bill makes provision for Health

that non-departmental public bodies have robust governance and

6, which again I realise is a probing amendment, poses a question about
the terms of remuneration of HEE’s employees. In establishing
HEE as a non-departmental public body, it is important that it is given
the appropriate levels of autonomy and independence to carry out its
important education and training functions without day-to-day
interference from Ministers or the Department of Health. Yes, it needs
to be held accountable for the use of its resources, and the Government
are committed to holding it to account in an open and transparent way,
but I hope noble Lords would agree that it is important for a body of
this nature to have the ability to determine the pay and remuneration
rates for the people it recruits and employs, including its executives.
That does not mean that it will not be subject to any constraints. I
can reassure the committee that as an arm’s-length body of the
Department of Health, HEE will be subject to the rules and controls
covering the use of its budget, and to procedures applicable to
senior appointments and levels of remuneration. These are the very same

7 is another probing amendment. The provision which the noble Lord has
questioned is important. It clarifies that Health Education
England’s property is not to be regarded as property of, or held
on behalf of, the Crown. This is a standard provision that applies to
other arm’s-length bodies in the health system. It allows Health
Education England to make arrangements for its own property and office
needs. It needs to do so to support the staff it employs nationally and
across the local education and training boards. It would not be
practical for any other body to hold this responsibility. Of course,
Health Education England will work with other bodies to look for
savings on estates, information technology, human resources and in

has said in reply to the debate. I understand that under
secondary legislation he is 
<?notus-xml column=1124?>considering putting a registered nurse on the board. Some assurance on
that would be very helpful. In my experience working with
clinical commissioning groups, when they were appointed and there had
to be a nurse on the board, and the last person to be appointed
in many cases was the nurse. There was a feeling that it was hard to
find a nurse who would make such a contribution. Some very talented
young nurses are coming on-stream, but when one talks about a clinical
presence on a board, so often, it is interpreted as a medical person on
the board. We seek to ensure that a working nurse will be on
those boards. If my noble friend can reassure me that he will consider
that very carefully when drawing up the regulations, I will be very
pleased<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T19:32:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T19:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000002">I

Education England’s board will need to have access to a

it was not until we started discussing the regulations that we saw what

not be the necessary time available for the regulations to be drawn up
in draft. However, I will take back the strength of my noble

taking part. It is the role of noble Lords always to ask the Government
for draft regulations but, alas, I fear that we may not see them. If we

let me say that the Government’s reflection on the Joint
Committee’s recommendation with regard to clinical expertise,
and the change that has been made, is welcome. I listened with care to
the noble Earl when he said that the needs of Health Education England

why that is best left to regulation. That makes sense, but I cannot
believe that there will ever be a time when research and nurse
representation will not be important. I ask the noble Earl to give that

consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000013">I

The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, and I have lived through many
restructurings and they always start with the premise that there will
not be a nurse on the board. Then, after argument and sometimes
experience, it is discovered that you need to have a nurse. I would
have thought that the Francis report, at its heart, focused a 
<?notus-xml column=1126?>lot on nursing experience and leadership. I ask the noble Earl to give
this further consideration. It would be a very visible sign that the

am glad that the noble Earl picked up the point about non-registered
staff and managerial staff. It is not just in the health service. In
the further education sector there is a similar problem, with only a
limited number of people applying to be college principals. We need to
think very hard about what we can do to give greater support and
encouragement to bright young people coming through so that they aspire
to take on these top jobs. No one should underestimate the pressures
that those leaders are under, but we really want good people. I endorse

importance of the global fund. I saw the global fund at its beginning,
when Richard Feachem was the director. Over the past decade it has
developed into one of the chief means of combating HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis and malaria around the world. It has helped in the
dramatic progress that has been made, particularly in the past five
years, and that progress has been truly dramatic. In HIV, the number of
people on anti-retroviral treatment worldwide has increased from 1.4
million in 2007 to 4.2 million today. In 2007, there were almost 3
million TB cases detected and treated; today the total is 9.7 million.

result is that, with all three diseases, a record number of people are
now receiving treatment. To give the example of HIV/AIDS, which I know
best, well over half of the people in sub-Saharan Africa who need
anti-retroviral treatment are now receiving it. Incidentally, that is
probably a bigger proportion than for some countries now in eastern
Europe—it just shows how the balances change—whereas for
TB in sub-Saharan Africa, the figures for those being successfully
treated are higher than for
HIV<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T19:46:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000022">Not
all these improvements, it should be underlined, can be put down to the
global fund. National Governments make a massive contribution
themselves. I was in Cape Town a month or two ago and, to take South
Africa as an example, it finances much of its own programmes. The years
of neglect have been followed by an inspired effort by the South
African Department of Health. The result is that, over the past five or
six years, life expectation has already improved and increased by
something like five years. Furthermore, we should never forget the
massive contribution that the United States makes bilaterally through
the President’s emergency fund—a fund started,
incidentally, not by Bill Clinton but by George Bush, which will stand
as a tribute and lasting memorial to him. If it was not for the United
States, I think that the world would be in a terrible mess as regards
these funds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T19:47:15"></hs_TimeCode>. So
we can say, so far so
good.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000023">However,
there is another way of looking at the figures. We can also look at the
death toll from these diseases now, and we can look at the new
infections that are taking place every day throughout the world, 
<?notus-xml column=1128?>not just in Africa. The most recent figures show
2.7 million deaths from AIDS and TB-related causes, and
660,000 deaths from malaria and related causes. By any standard, that
is a devastating loss of human
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T19:47:57"></hs_TimeCode>. Here we
come to the crunch point. I pay tribute to the increases in financing
that there have been, but if financing continues just at its present
level, the prospect is that there will be many more new HIV infections
and fewer TB patients receiving care. In other words, we risk going
backwards. One reason for that is the growth taking place in the world
population; another is the particular nature of HIV. For some diseases
it is possible to give a course of treatment, for a patient to recover
and for his place to be taken by a new patient; but HIV is not remotely
like that. There is still no cure. It is a lifelong condition. Patients
stay on that treatment and, other things being equal, the cost will
rise as new cases come forward for
treatment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T19:49:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000024">That
is not to say that we should not seek further efficiencies in
programmes. We should certainly do that. Incidentally, as far the
global fund is concerned, in spite of some of the criticism that it has
had, it actually has a very good record in this area. I remember seeing
an example of that in Kiev in the Ukraine, where the global fund took
the decision that the Government should hand over their responsibility
in various aspects to an NGO, the HIV Alliance. The result was a
dramatic reduction, an economy, in drug costs. The costs of the
antiretroviral drugs which were being bought came down by something
like 25
times.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000025">We also
need to persuade national Governments to increase their direct
contributions to their own epidemics. It is certainly not enough for
some countries to rely as heavily as they do on outside finance. Of
course, when that happens it is fuel for those who
argue—wrongly, in my view—that international aid should
be cut back, but let us remember that this is not the easiest
time to make that case and to ask Governments to add to their
aid programmes. The fact is that however you look at it, it is very
much in everyone's interests that the budget for the global fund is
increased. The fund is a vital part of the world’s fight against
three killer diseases. If we start to go backwards, that obviously
affects the lives of millions of people around the world but, more, it
also means that the epidemics continue to spread. That in its
turn will mean even more money to combat them and bring them under
control.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060490000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000026">The
global fund has estimated that over the next three-year period of
2014-16, it will need something like $15 billion—a substantial
increase, certainly, on what is now being spent. However, if the result
can be a decisive and irreversible improvement, that is a very
considerable prize indeed for the world. No one seriously doubts the
global fund’s figures; most significantly, they are not
challenged by the United States, which is by far the biggest donor in
the fund. That was confirmed to me last week when I was in Washington
talking about these
things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000027">What
we in this country therefore now await is the British
Government’s response. When I was Health Secretary, I harboured
an ambition to make the United Kingdom a model of how a nation should
respond, particularly, to HIV. We have made progress along that road
but I think that no one would say today that it is a model. We spend,
for example, far too little on 
<?notus-xml column=1129?>prevention and on publicising not only the threat of
HIV but the way in which it can be combated. However, we have
maintained a good record in our contribution to the global fund. I hope
that the Minister will now be able to put some more flesh on those
bones. The US has set an example; we need also to set an
example.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000028">I
have two last points. First, I very much hope that the global fund will
continue to support the efforts to develop a vaccine for both HIV and
TB. We have seen what a vaccine can achieve on polio and there are some
encouraging signs, as in Thailand, that the prospect of developing a
vaccine is not as far-fetched as some critics argue. The problem is
that the development time for a vaccine is far in excess of the
lifetime of any Government or three-year programme. It is nevertheless
a goal which is most certainly worth pursuing. I say that in particular
because of my second point. What stands in the way of so much progress
in these areas is stigma and discrimination. A further effort is most
certainly required there. Stigma infects gay and lesbian people, those
with HIV and those with TB. It means that many people around the world
are reluctant to come forward for testing. A vaccine would cut through
all that. It is therefore, again, a goal which is worth
pursuing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000029">If I
may say so, tonight there has been a historic vote in this House. We
have sent out a clear message that we in this country believe in
equality of treatment for all. That was a massive message, which was
underlined by the majority. I believe also that we are united,
irrespective of which way we voted on that debate, on the
criminalisation of homosexuality being abhorrent. I hope that that
message goes out equally strongly, but I put it to the Minister that it
would be even better if tonight she could set out the British
Government’s plans to help the global fund fight one of the most
important health battles that the world now faces. That is a historic
battle and this country could make an important and valuable

came face to face with the scourge of HIV/AIDS about 10 years ago, in
Soweto in South Africa. I was taken to a hospice and clinic run mainly
by volunteers and funded by donations from the local community. At that
time, victims of HIV/AIDS whose illnesses had reached their final
stages were being cast out into the street and left to die. The hospice
volunteers went out into the townships each and every morning to bring
in the abandoned and the dying, and to provide them with clean beds and
nursing care during their last days and hours in the comfort of the
hospice. I recall standing by the bed of a desperately ill young woman,
possibly still a teenager, searching for some words of comfort or
solace. Beyond speech, she just looked up with despairing and
frightened eyes. It was yet another human tragedy unfolding.</hs_para>

the hospice had the main task of mobilising the community, particularly
those from the families of HIV/AIDS victims, to be trained in basic
healthcare procedures. The concept was to 
<?notus-xml column=1130?>provide a core of basic healthcare support for
HIV/AIDS victims in their homes. At that time, the clinic
had trained over 350 volunteer community healthcare
practitioners, working with the families in the townships. During the
same visit, we met with the leaders of the Johannesburg chamber of
commerce to be briefed on the impact of AIDS on the economy. The
heaviest toll was being taken in the extractive and heavy haulage
industries, where the death rate was so high that employers had to
expect a complete replacement of their workforce every four years. A
lack of education and of access to antiretroviral drugs and a
reluctance to be clinically tested all added to the difficulties in
attempts to contain the epidemic. As the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, said,
South Africa has made great strides since then but, as he also pointed
out, the drugs are not a
cure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0002.htm#13060490000033">A little
later, with a delegation to Botswana, I visited the local
research centre in Gaborone, established and funded by the Gates
foundation as part of a multimillion dollar project to combat the
spread of HIV/AIDS. At that time, I recall that more than 35% of the
population in Botswana were infected by the disease. The project was
having some success, particularly among the young in the more remote
areas of the country. A problem was that as their health improved under
the Gates drug regime, there was a trend to return to a
pattern of unprotected casual sex, in the mistaken belief that they
were now cured, so the educational aspects of the programme had to be
revisited.</hs_para>

Government have maintained the commitment to £1 billion over the

she was admitted to hospital and had surgery and medicines. Then, of
course, she was sent home to complete the treatment, and home for this
13 year-old girl is one room on the back of a family property that she
shares with her mother. She was discovered in this place by one of the
visitors from the diocesan medical team. She was unable to go to
hospital by bus because the surgery on her back made that journey
virtually impossible. Taxi drivers refused to take her because, as the
noble Lord, Lord Fowler, said, there is a stigma about having TB and
she is regarded as dirty. Quite frankly, she would not have the money
for a taxi anyway. The diocesan medical team picked her up and began to
visit her. They did very simple things: hygiene, transport, education
for her and her mother about management of the treatment and
co-operation. What the doctor calls a very small amount of targeted

pledge to the global fund, which is already operating in 151 countries.
I also ask the department to look hard at what more can be done to
enhance the training of rural health workers, particularly in
prevention. The Touch Foundation, at the moment only in America, works
in Tanzania, supported also by the Vitol Foundation in this country.
The work to prevent disease and to get early diagnosis has meant a much
better use of the resources that we get from the global fund. We can be
very grateful to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the $650
million that it has given since 2002, and it has now given a promissory
note for another $750 million. However, we can make the money work only
if we have people on the ground to communicate with those who do not
understand why these diseases develop so

the new funding model of the global fund we have a real opportunity. I
understand that it is to be piloted in nine countries, which have not
yet been disclosed. It will try to get a greater alignment with country
schedules and their priorities and to focus on the countries with the
highest disease burden and lowest ability to pay. It will make it
simpler for the implementers and the global fund, will mean greater
predictability of process and financing and will have a real ability to
elicit full expressions of demand and to reward ambition. The global
fund can do that. However, the new funding model will work only, first,
if it is financed, and secondly, if there is a translation of what you
can do with the money through the people

new drugs only if those on the ground know when, how and in what

First, that we have early notification from the department of what it
can give to the global fund but, secondly, that we now focus a lot more

said and emphasise the importance of the global fund in the fight
against tuberculosis. Ninety per cent of international donor funding to
fight TB comes through the fund, mainly because it is such an effective
institution but also because TB does not get the profile or attention
warranted by the devastation it causes. It is a disease closely
associated with poverty, and 90% of cases are in developing countries.
In 2011 there were almost 9 million cases of TB and the disease killed
1.4 million people. That is scandalous when you think that the majority
of cases are curable with a course of cheap antibiotics.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T20:15:18"></hs_TimeCode> are 22
high TB-burden countries in the world today, of which six are totally

its work on malaria, TB, HIV/AIDS and preventing mother-to-child

Through<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T20:16:21"></hs_TimeCode> the

be, they will not be able to reach and relieve all the suffering with
which they contend. That is because homosexuality is a criminal offence
in some 78 countries. Where homosexuals are criminals, HIV cannot be
fully relieved or curtailed. The statistics are stark. In Caribbean
countries where homosexuality is not against the law, of every 15 men
who have sex with other men, one is infected with HIV. In Caribbean
countries where homosexuality is criminalised, the rate of infection is
one in four. So we come back to the deep-seated problem of

naturally direct our concern principally to the countries of
the Commonwealth. In 42 of the Commonwealth’s 54 member states,

infinite sadness of us all, that has not led to a widespread acceptance
of the case for decriminalisation. In some countries the situation has
got worse. Last week the Nigerian Parliament passed a harsh anti-LGBT

recent challenges; the noble Lord, Lord Collins, referred to this. The

2011, the Global Campaign for Aid Transparency ranked the fund fourth
in their “Publish What You Fund” data, and in 2012 the
global fund ranked joint third. That is very encouraging. As my noble

press reports in 2011 claiming fraud and corruption caused the fund to
examine its systems and procedures. It became apparent that the reports
were exaggerated and extrapolated from audits that the fund itself had
published. None the less, they triggered a series of events, including
the cancellation of the fund’s 11th round of applications for
funding. A high-level independent review panel was established to look
at the fund’s fiduciary controls and oversight mechanisms. The
panel concluded that the fund’s purpose was right and that it
had achieved significant results, but that it had outgrown its original

The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby asked about civil

society recipients in parallel to Governments. My noble friend Lady
Chalker asked about the training of health workers. As she probably
knows, the global fund supports health workers, including through
general health system strengthening and through the countries’
own national programmes. She was concerned that there should be better

These two amendments seek to make sure that Clause 84 and Schedule 5

mental health and the health of people with learning

This parity of esteem, putting mental health on a par with physical
health, must be a key principle carried through HEE’s work and
in the education and training of healthcare workers, and it is
important that the Bill specifies this. Why is that? It is because the
lack of parity continues to have a massive impact. The most recent
psychiatric morbidity surveys show that, despite theoretical parity
under existing legislation, only a minority of those with a mental
disorder in England receive any intervention, in stark contrast to
other disease areas, such as cancer, almost all of which have some
intervention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T20:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Rix:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 10, but I should like
to clarify one or two points in the wording. It is possible for a
person with a learning disability to have a physical health problem. It
is also possible for a person with a learning disability to have a
mental health problem. But that is not the main cause or even sometimes
the basic cause for their particular condition, which is learning
disability. I would therefore have preferred the wording of paragraph
(a) of Amendment 10 to have been “learning disability”.
The same situation arises in paragraph (b) of Amendment 10. People with
a learning disability have a learning difficulty. That is natural.
However, there are plenty of people who are not learning disabled who
also have a learning difficulty. I would like to have seen
Amendment 10 include learning difficulties and learning
disabilities, but I actually support the general thrust of the

disability can be made quite

<?notus-xml column=1146?>community settings and domiciliary settings, where the notion of
continuing professional development was non-existent. People were
finding an immediate barrier to even asking questions about doing
things in a better way. The way you overcome that is by doing exactly
what it says in this amendment. You put at the very heart of your
organisation the fact that you continue to develop. Even preceptorship,
the year after training, was given scant regard in many places because
the nurses were so busy doing their day-to-day tasks that there was not
time for management to put it in. My argument is that without putting
in that training, you are less efficient, you give poorer care and
ultimately the whole organisation suffers. I hope that my honourable

difficulties. I am disappointed that the Minister is resisting this
issue of inclusion. It would underline the importance of parity of

Willis of Knaresborough:</Member></B> I speak to Amendments
15 and 36 in my name and those of the noble Baroness,
Lady Emerton, and the noble Lord, Lord Patel. On Amendment 15, one of
the most daunting tasks for Sir Keith Pearson and his staff at
Health Education England is the challenge of workforce planning. I do
not believe that anybody has done that right in the health service
since its creation. The noble Lord, Lord Turnberg, rightly pointed out
that it takes a good five years to get a junior doctor. It takes
10 years to get a consultant. For senior consultants, we are
probably talking about 12 to 15 years. For anyone to sit down in
Richmond House or elsewhere and start to plan what is going to happen
in 10 to 15 years is an incredibly difficult task, and no
one has managed it
yet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#13060490000138">Secondly,
looking ahead, if 10 or 15 years ago you were planning a workforce, you
would have automatically said that we need a supply of certain groups
of professionals and that, provided we can get that supply, we will be
reasonably okay. We can bring in a few from abroad, usually the
Commonwealth, and often denude the poorest countries in Africa of their
health staff and get the nurses from the Philippines. That enabled us
to get
by.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#13060490000139">What we
are doing now—I think that the Minister is acutely aware of
this— is planning for a health and care service the like of
which we have never seen. There will be research
developments, especially in areas such as genomics and regenerative
medicine, which will create cures for major debilitating diseases and,
at the same time, give us innovative ways of dealing with
people’s long-term chronic illness in their homes by
self-management. Therefore, the professionals and the care support
workers for those professionals working within the NHS have to be of a
calibre and to have a flexibility the like of which we have never

have tabled Amendment 15 because HEE needs all the support that it can
get in obtaining representation to support it to look ahead. By that, I
am talking about the research base. We have to consider what
medicine will look like, what cures will look like and what the
demographic requirements will be in 10 or 15 years’
time—or even in five years—to plan the workforce. I hope
that in reply, the Minister can reassure the House that there is that
sort of long-term planning for a workforce not like today’s. We
are not planning the workforce of yesterday with different numbers, we
are looking at a totally different workforce for the

36 is a probing amendment to gain assurances from the Minister that HEE
will receive representations from organisations other than the medical
royal colleges. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill specify only medical
royal colleges in paragraph 515. We therefore ask that that be updated
to reflect all royal

the Francis report, one of the criticisms of the Royal College of
Nursing—I refer to it specifically—was that there was a
conflict between its role as a trade

Government and Health Education England have an opportunity to
challenge it on that role and to make sure that it steps up to the mark
as a royal college. Only by doing that will it actually serve the
nursing workforce to its true extent. We have seen that with the
medical royal colleges, and, by including royal colleges in this
particular amendment, which would include the Royal College of Nursing,
we are sending out a challenge to the RCN that it, too, must be part of
this game rather than a

Wall of New Barnet:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, support Amendment
36. I just want to pick out something that the noble Earl mentioned a
little while ago in response to another question from me. He mentioned
the work being done by Skills for Health and Skills for Care. Certainly
in the context of this amendment—which, I agree, is a probing
amendment—alongside the royal colleges and the other
professional bodies, the work that Skills for Health and Skills for
Care are doing is hugely important. Can the noble Earl enlighten me on
what relationship Health Education England will have with those bodies?
For instance, the noble Lord just referred to what the future looks
like and what Skills for Health in particular is doing alongside Skills
for Care. It is looking at what provisions there are for
apprenticeships inside the health service, which is hugely important
and allows people to develop from smaller roles to bigger roles over
time. I wonder how, in the scheme of things, that relationship exists,
how close it is and what influence Skills for Health and Skills for
Care have, so that they are not working in opposition but are working
integrally with what HEE is
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T21:22:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#13060490000144"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" PimsId="1076" UID="13060490000259" xid="1755" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#13060490000259">Lord

organisations from which HEE must seek representations: the CQC and
Monitor. I imagine the noble Earl will say that they are implicit in
the generic list of bodies in Clause 89(2). However, it would be good
to hear a little bit about how the noble Earl expects HEE to work with
the two core regulators for the health service, the CQC and Monitor. In
a sense, the CQC will, on a very regular basis, be picking up issues to
do with staffing and staffing levels. Equally, Monitor will be
concerned with financial issues. Of course, the two sometimes do not
run easily together, so it is very important that HEE has very close

have already referred to my interest as chair of a foundation trust,

the local level, the people in the driving seat should be the people

services have been divorced from decisions about training commissions.
That is one of the reasons why I believe there has been such a problem
with the ability of people coming out of universities and other
education institutions to practice when they get into the field. Having
the people who provide services round the table is a very important
development.</hs_parafo>

the provisions in relation to Health Education England. Then in Clause
91(5), people involved in education may be appointed to a
LETB—but, by implication, if they may be they do not have to be.
My Amendments 40 and 42 to 46 really seek to ensure that LETBs have a
broad-based membership. Surely, it should be mandatory to have the
involvement of education providers and health workers who are not
professionally registered. My noble friend Lady Wall made that point
very well
indeed.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060490000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#13060490000148">Also,
where are the representatives of patients and carers? After all, they
understand the output of the workforce. Surely, they ought to have a
place around the table as well when it comes to these decisions about
training commissions: where they are placed, what the demands are and
what the monitoring is. Again, I would replicate the argument about
nurses that we had on the membership of HEE. In some sense, we could
have grouped those amendments together because it is the same argument:
that around the table of the LETB, you must have some senior nurses
when so many of the discussions of the LETB will be about the quality
of nurse training.</hs_para>

representative of the LGA made a very strong point about the potential
role of health and well-being boards, which are concerned not just with
public health but with how well the whole system is integrated. I very
much agree with that, so I would have thought that a LETB would be well
advised to have the chairmen of relevant health and well-being boards
around the table to discuss issues of staffing. I hope that the noble
Earl will give me some reassurance that in establishing LETBs as

and if I can give him any further information during the course of our
debates I will. Equally, the LETBs have strongly established
connections with professional regulators and professional bodies. For
example, the postgraduate medical and dental deans, who are now an
integral part of the LETBs, work very closely with the GMC and medical
royal colleges in the management and quality assurance of training for
junior doctors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T21:33:59"></hs_TimeCode>.

the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wheeler, seeks

Commission plays an important role in assessing the quality of
healthcare services, and in so doing it assesses their ability to
deliver services safely and effectively. In doing so, it will consider
whether healthcare providers have suitably skilled staff and in the
right numbers. It will need to work closely with Health Education
England to share findings and evidence to support improvements in
education and training. Health Education England will also be able to
share information on the effectiveness of providers in supporting
clinical placements and training programmes to support the Care Quality

Willis of Knaresborough:</Member></B> Perhaps I may interrupt the
Minister and come back to the important point made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Wall. In responding the Minister has yet again
constantly referred to what I would call professional organisations.
There are nearly 1 million healthcare support workers in the care and
the health sectors. Many are untrained. Most are unregulated and
unregistered. The two organisations that are providing basic skills,
Skills for Health and Skills for Care, were dreamt up within the
department. They did not widely consult before they put their forward
their proposals for training programmes. The Nursing and Midwifery
Council was never asked about the standards for Skills for Health. Will
the Minister say who will be consulted about training the people who do
so much of our basic social and healthcare—those who are called
healthcare support
workers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060490000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#13060490000172"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13060490000266" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#13060490000266">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> I fully recognise the importance of the healthcare
support worker sector. I can reassure my noble friend and the noble
Baroness, Lady Wall, that 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>Health Education England will be working closely with the sector skills
councils, Skills for Health and Skills for Care. I note my noble
friend’s scepticism about those bodies, but I do not share it.
They have done a pretty fine piece of work and the fruits of it will be
apparent over the coming months. HEE will need to do that if it is to
perform its role as fully as it should to plan and shape the
development of the entire workforce. If by some mischance it were to
neglect that aspect of its work and not focus on improving training
standards for the health and care support workforce, it would lead to a
very unbalanced and unsatisfactory position. Therefore, we are very
clear that this should be part of the remit of Health Education
England. I hope that that is sufficient reassurance for noble

is required for the Scottish health service. The same may be the case
in Wales which has big problems in attracting junior doctors. There
needs to be a UK-wide view of education and training and I hope that
the HEE has both the remit and the encouragement of Ministers to work
across those

ask HEE to give specific focus to arrangements for end-of-life care.
The noble Earl has taken part in a number of debates on the Liverpool

policy behind the pathway, although I know that a review is being
undertaken, but more about the way in which that has been interpreted
by some organisations. It suggests that more is required in relation to
the training of staff in end-of-life care. I am sure that in Part 1 we
will come back to the issue of social care provision for end-of-life

into the death of Tina Papalabropoulos. Tina was 23

<?notus-xml column=1160?>and had a learning disability. She died on
30 January 2009 at Basildon hospital in Essex. The ombudsman
found that the hospital did not give her the treatment she needed or
even meet her basic care needs. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated

this year, the confidential inquiry into the premature deaths of people
with learning disabilities in the south-west reported on its study of
the deaths of 233 adults and 14 children with a learning disability. It
found that 42% of the deaths were premature and that 37% would have
been avoidable if good quality healthcare had been provided. On a
national level, this equates to over 1,200 adults and children with a
learning disability across England whose deaths should have been
avoidable with good quality healthcare. This comes as no surprise to
many. The Department of Health highlighted the issue back in its
Valuing People and Valuing People Now strategies, and the excellent

series of recommendations for improving care for people with a learning

what Amendment 14 is suggesting, and maybe express some reservations.
If I have read it wrongly, I apologise. It is important that Health
Education England takes official guidance into account, but we have
this dilemma in my own trust about what the Francis report is saying.
To have a national edict about what staffing levels ought to be, and
the ratios and numbers of staff as well as the skills mix, is not
really ideal from the point of view of people operating in the health
service, particularly in hospitals. Times change throughout the day on
hospitals and on wards, and different levels of skills and different
grades of staff are required at different times. You would have to have
a permutation that was so huge that it would be less than helpful to
have a national edict. I would be concerned that we should take notice
of official guidance, but nothing more than
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T21:59:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T21:59:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T21:59:19"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T21:57:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T21:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306051000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#1306051000015">I

deliberations on the Bill, and it is very much in line with what we
talked about for a long time in our consideration of the Health and
Social Care Bill—the change that is happening as we speak, the

will share an anecdote with your Lordships. In a discussion with a
previous director of nursing in my own trust, I asked her, with my

equipped and skilled to follow Margaret Wall or another patient out and

should be looking at how holistic care, which is what I think is being

to people from Health Education England recently, I was struck by the
desire in the Francis report about the whole issue of practical
training. When a significant amount of the training of medics, doctors
and nurses is carried out in practical situations, one asks how you can
get the sort of situations that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, referred to.
When nurses spend 50% of their time in practical situations, how do
they come out of their training not ready to be deployed in certain
areas? To be fair, when you see the time and the effort that is put
into mentoring in many of these settings and the quality of that
mentoring, you start to 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>realise that there is a big problem. I hope that on
Report we can bring back some of the issues relating to mentoring, or
at least get some satisfaction from the Minister that this issue will
be taken incredibly seriously in health education. If it is not, we
will continue to have people who in theory are trained well but in
practical terms are really not as fit for purpose as they should be.

echoes the thoughts behind Amendment 27. I particularly welcome in
Amendment 27 the idea of having a 10-year plan. In fact, five years is

both healthcare support workers and nurses, the mandate, which was
helpfully provided by the Minister before this debate, sets out a
strategic national role in relation to medicine, dentistry and pharmacy
in paragraph 5.2.6, and proposes a five-year workforce plan for
“smaller specialties and professions” in paragraph 5.2.7,
but provides little information on how the nursing workforce or the
healthcare support workforce is to be undertaken and implemented. Does
that not tell us all we need to know about what the priorities still
are? While we have good words within the Bill, we do not have anything
within the mandate that backs them up in a real sense. Midwives and

and the 31st child had to go somewhere else. You realise that,
depending on the setting, you can do all sorts of different things.
What we must not do is tie down the hands of high-quality management in
being able to deploy staff in the most appropriate way. What matters is
getting the mix of staff absolutely right. I hope that we will return

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I will deal briefly with two of the
amendments in this group. I will deal first with Amendment 11, which
was tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. The explanation for this
provision in the Bill is essentially that it is a safety net to enable
an extension of HEE’s activities in future, and to ensure that
this has the Secretary of State’s prior consent. HEE can carry
out other activities relating to the education and training of
healthcare workers, or relating to the provision of information and
advice on careers in the health service. However, we believe that to
avoid undue mission creep it is perhaps advisable for the Secretary of
State to be content that Health Education England is branching out in
new
directions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306051000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-0003.htm#1306051000033">Regarding

24, tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Rix and Lord Touhig, seeks to amend
Clause 87 by inserting a new requirement on the Secretary of State to
consult on the mandate prior to publication. The Government are
absolutely committed to openness and transparency in the way they
establish and manage ongoing relationships with arm’s-length
bodies. In establishing Health Education England and the local
education training boards we have consulted extensively with partners
and stakeholders to shape the new system, with a formal public
consultation and focused reports produced by the NHS Future Forum, the
Health Select Committee and the Joint Committee that scrutinised the
draft Bill. As a result, there is widespread support for the creation
of Health Education England and a solid platform to build on in
shaping the new arrangements. Last Tuesday, the Government published
their first mandate for Health Education England. This sets out clear
national objectives and priorities for HEE, backed by a £5
billion budget to support investment in education, training and

following feedback in consultation and at pre-legislative scrutiny, in
Clauses 87 and 93 to reflect the importance of HEE and the LETBs taking
a long-term perspective on workforce planning and education and
training. It is the Government’s expectation that all workforce
planning, be it national level planning by HEE or local planning by the
LETBs, should be based on a well informed, long-term workforce strategy
that looks at needs over the next five years, 10 years or
beyond. Any workforce strategy to be credible and deliverable has to be
developed in partnership with those partners and stakeholders who have
a stake in it. The very same principle applies to the development of
national workforce priorities and outcomes and the Government are

33 and 14, which seek to amend the Bill to require HEE to have regard
to any official guidance and standards on staffing numbers and skill
mix. HEE must work with commissioners and healthcare providers to
ensure that workforce plans focus not only on how many staff are
required but the breadth of skills required to deliver safe services.
These plans need to be integrated with service and financial planning
so that the needs of all patients and local communities can be met.
Individual healthcare providers are best placed to determine how many
staff they need to employ, the skill mix required across the various
teams and how they need to deploy them to support services and so on.
It is the responsibility of individual healthcare provider boards to be
accountable for staffing levels and the skill mix of staff in their
organisations. Where changes are planned to the size and shape of the
workforce, including the skill mix, healthcare organisations must
provide assurance that the safety and quality of patient care is
maintained or 
<?notus-xml column=1166?>improved. The process should include clinical involvement, leadership

that staffing is clearly not just about crude numbers and not just
about nurses. It is also about how the staff work and ensuring that the
right staff are in place to meet the needs of the patients whom they
are looking after. Again, it is local healthcare providers that are in
the best place to decide how to configure those staff in the right way
and to ensure better outcomes and value for money. It really depends on
the skill mix, the clinical practice and local factors. I think we
would say that it is right that nurse leaders should have the freedom

19 seeks to amend Clause 86(2) to add to Health Education
England’s main functions the promotion of the importance of
practical based training in the education of clinicians. I
wholeheartedly agree that practical experience while training is
essential to ensure that clinicians have the necessary skills to
deliver high-quality and compassionate care and have the correct values
and behaviours to practise in the NHS and public health system. It is
the responsibility of the professional regulators to ensure that the
right standards are in place for professional education and training.
Practical experience is already a requirement of the professional
regulators. Nursing students, for example, are required by the Nursing
and Midwifery Council to undertake half of their training in a practice
setting. The GMC also expects every medical student to gain practical
experience of working with patients throughout their degree. We have
placed a strong duty to secure continuous improvement in the quality of
education and training on Health Education England. HEE is already
working with the professional regulators, as I have already mentioned,
to ensure that the Bill remains clear and simple. However, we have not
specified the integral elements of the training programmes to which
this duty applies. I would add, though, that the need for practical
experience is one of the key priorities that the Government have set
for Health Education England Special Health Authority in the mandate.
Health Education England will work with the LETBs and healthcare
providers to deliver high-quality clinical and public health placements
that provide students and trainees sufficient time working with
patients to gain experience.</hs_para>

reassure the noble Lord that, where appropriate, Health Education
England will take a national lead in the planning and management of
education and training activities. The Bill already makes provision for
this in Clause 94(2). The HEE Special Health Authority has already
taken on responsibility at national level for crucially important 
<?notus-xml column=1167?>arrangements to manage recruitment into foundation and specialty
training programmes for junior doctors. Where there are controls on

important that HEE works closely with the other UK nations in
developing workforce plans and shaping education and training. It will
be important for it to take a UK-wide perspective and, where
appropriate, an EU-wide or indeed global perspective in planning for
the future and reforming education and training. I refer the Committee
to paragraph 17 of Schedule 5, which enables Health
Education England to exercise corresponding functions on behalf of the
devolved authorities. The special health authority is already working

sympathise completely with Amendment 28 and I wholeheartedly
agree that there should be equality of funding for education and
training across England. Moving to a tariff-based system for funding
clinical education and training would enable a national approach to the
funding of clinical placements and would provide a more level playing
field between different providers. It will ensure that providers are
reimbursed fairly for the education and training that they deliver and
are incentivised to provide high-quality clinical placements to their
students and trainees. For consistency of opportunities across the

discussed with electoral stakeholders the timing of absent voter
signature refreshes in Great Britain in 2014 and 2015 during the
transition to IER. As noble Lords will know, we have provided that the
2013 annual household canvass period, which would otherwise have taken
place between July and December 2013, will now run from 1 October 2013
and result in a revised register being published by 17
February 2014 in England and by 10 March 2014 in Scotland and Wales.
Noble Lords will remember that we discussed this previously.
Thereafter, the Government’s plan is for the transition to IER
to begin in the summer of 2014 in England and Wales, with the first
transitional canvass published at the usual time for revised
registers—by 1 December 2014. Following confirmation that the
referendum in Scotland will be held on 18 September 2014, the
Government intend that the transition to IER there will take place
after that poll. The 2014 canvass period in Scotland will be postponed
to begin on or around 1 October 2014 and finish with the publication of
the first transitional canvass there early in 2015.</hs_para>

was a general concern among electoral stakeholders that combining an
absent vote signature refresh with canvass activity during this period
could be confusing for electors. Electors, for example, could receive
from their ERO a letter that confirms their registration and explains
that no action is needed to remain registered and to retain their
absent vote but at the same time be asked to provide a fresh signature
for absent voting purposes, where failure to respond means the loss of
the absent vote. Therefore, having the refresh before these letters go
out will provide a more logical and understandable sequence.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:35:31"></hs_TimeCode> Government
have listened to the views expressed by the EROs and agree that the
interests of voters would be better served by moving the signature
refresh scheduled for January 2014 in Great Britain to take place
before the 2013-14 household canvass.</hs_para>

discussions with the Scottish Assessors Association, we propose that
the signature refresh scheduled for January 2015 in Scotland should
also be moved to 2013 to avoid the possibility of it occurring at the
same time as IER activity by EROs there in January 2015. The signature
refresh in January 2015 in England and Wales is to be left unchanged as
this issue only arises only for Scotland.

and then I will ask my noble friend one or two
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:38:50"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Electoral Commission has asked us to ask for certain assurances from
the Government. The explanation given by my noble friend covers what it
has said but others may refer to that. The proposals as set out seem
entirely sensible as a practical way of getting to grips with the very
complex and quite large number of processes that local electoral
registration officers have to carry out to introduce individual
registration. Moving the date of the five-yearly renewal of postal
voters’ signatures seems
sensible<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000014">While
we are talking about postal voters and signatures, it seems a
reasonable opportunity to ask my noble friend where the Government
stand on a number of related issues. I hope that he will bear with me
on this. First, what was the result of the first round of getting fresh
signatures after five years, which I think started earlier this year,
in January, and took place in the spring before this year’s
local elections? I am interested in the proportion of people throughout
the country who have postal votes. My noble friend can define
“country” as he wishes. I am interested in England but
also in knowing what happens in other parts of the United Kingdom. What
proportion of the people who 
<?notus-xml column=172?>previously had postal votes submitted new signatures, and so maintained
their registration, and what proportion fell out for whatever reason? I
am interested in whether that information is available at the level of
electoral registration authorities—that is, local authorities
and district
councils<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000015">Secondly,
to what use are the signatures put when people send in their postal
votes? Is the information available, or will it be available, on how
many postal votes are not counted due to the information on the postal
vote statements, which are submitted with the postal votes, not
matching? That is, if the signatures on the application for postal
votes, whether it is the original application or the refresher we are
talking about today, do not match the signature that is submitted with
the postal vote; or, indeed, if the dates of birth or the electoral
numbers do not match, which is quite possible. Is that information
known? In other words, do we know for each election that takes place
how many postal votes are not rejected or even counted but are put to
one side and not put into the count? Clearly, that is an
indication of people losing their vote, either because they have made a
mistake or because of electoral fraud. Given that this is the basic
reason why signatures were introduced for postal votes, it seems to me
that having that information would be very
useful<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000016">Thirdly,
if the returning officer in an election is concerned that discrepancies
of the kind I have just been talking about could be a result of
electoral fraud, is the Government’s advice to him to
investigate those further, to refer them to the police or just to put
them to one side and ignore
them<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000017">One
of the things that I have been going on about in your Lordships’
House for some time is the need for a system to inform electors if, for
any of the reasons we have been talking about, particularly
discrepancies regarding signatures, their vote is not being counted. If
an elector does not know this is happening—for example, if there
is fraud they may not know that they are being defrauded, or if there
has simply been a mistake— they are being deprived of their vote
for reasons that might technically be their fault but are certainly not
deliberate on their part. That does not seem very
fair<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I
understand that the Government intend to give advice to returning
officers on this matter. Can my noble friend tell me when that might be
done?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000018">To put
this in context, in the county council elections this year in my own
borough of Pendle, which is part of Lancashire where there are six
county council seats, the operation of the elections and the counting
of the votes took place at borough level. In total, 302 postal votes
were returned but not counted because either the signatures or the
dates of birth did not match. My noble friend said that dates of birth
do not degrade or change. I am not sure what “degrade”
means in this context, but it is a nice word. However, it is not
entirely true because people born in third-world countries, including
Pakistan, may not know their date of birth, so what they put down may
be a bit arbitrary. Often they write 1 January of the year in which
they think they were born, but they might not even give that date.
Dates of birth may not be known and people do not get them right all

can be a mismatch of signature, a mismatch of the date of birth, or
both, or the ballot paper may have been returned in an envelope whose
number did not match. As noble Lords will know, it is a complicated
system. There is a little envelope and a big envelope and they must
both have the same number on them. No fewer than 61 postal votes were
rejected because they were wrong. In fact, quite a lot of votes come
back in the wrong envelope because, for example, an elderly couple
might mix up the envelopes and ballot papers. People on the ground will
keep those to one side and try to match them up as best they can. Even
so, some are not counted. It worked out at around 4% of all the postal
votes that came in. That was the position in just one recent

accountability, to be given the full details concerning Wales in the

the question of getting fresh signatures after five years, we do not
hold this information centrally. I hope it will be considered helpful
that, according to my team, one ERO spoken to has told us that in his

refresh notification, some 1,800 did not respond and 565 said that they
no longer wanted one. That gives noble Lords a level of the turnover in

There were a number of questions and some of the answers are coming at
me from the Box faster than I can absorb them. I was asked whether it
would be inconvenient for the signature refresh to be run during
August. We recognise that it is not ideal, but it is essential that
absent voter signatures are refreshed before the earliest time that
EROs may start the 2013 annual canvass, which we have previously agreed
will be from 1 October. For reasons that I have explained, the
Electoral Commission has indicated that it is content with the policy
objective and the drafting of the signature refresh regulations. We
will, of course, monitor very carefully how this goes through, and if
there is too much difficulty or too much failure to respond, we may
have to adapt and try again. I rehearsed previously the reasons why we
wish to start the household canvass earlier.</hs_para>

will have the flexibility to write out absent voters in the period from
1 to 19 August 2013. In line with the existing provisions for signature
refreshes, EROs will give absent voters six weeks to respond from the
date they are written to, with a reminder sent if necessary after three
weeks. That seems to me to cover most of the people who are likely to
be written to, although I have promised my wife that after the 2015

for minor works—that is, proposals for works to overhead lines

this regime. Such works may have a total project value of around

the exemption in Section 16 to include overhead lines of less than two
kilometres in length and projects to increase the nominal voltage

physical infrastructure. This means that determination of applications
for such minor works will in future be made by my right honourable
friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, under
Section 37 of the Electricity Act 1989. We are, in practice,

development consent for minor works.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:09:00"></hs_TimeCode> is because
these regulations under the Electricity Act 1989 are not prescriptive,

however, that there are less stringent requirements. Consents under
both the Planning Act and the Electricity Act are determined by my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State. Under both regimes, the
public will be consulted. The Electricity Act regime requires
applicants to notify local authorities of applications for consent
under Section 37 and publication of proposals in local newspapers for
applications for consent of lines with a nominal voltage of not less
than 132 kilovolts. If a local authority objects to any proposal
submitted under the Electricity Act, it will go to public inquiry; and
the Secretary of State may determine that, even if there are no
objections by the local authority, the application should be the
subject of a public inquiry. In determining whether to hold a public
inquiry, my right honourable friend will consider any objections from
persons other than the relevant local
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000056">However,
it is important that we make a clear distinction between projects that

transferring only applications for proposals for works to overhead
lines of less than two kilometres in length or those which would
increase the nominal voltage on an existing line without significant
changes in that line’s infrastructure. These are projects that
are unlikely to contribute significantly to national electricity
network infrastructure. I estimate, based on applications over the past

grappling with the detail of the Planning Act 2008 when it went through
this House, particularly the new planning regime for nationally
significant infrastructure projects. We were told that the main reason
why the regime had to happen was that such projects were all taking too
long, the system was all too bureaucratic and difficult, and we needed
a new streamlined regime that would be a lot quicker, less bureaucratic
and less expensive. It is slightly ironic that in this instance at
least, it has turned out not to be the case and we have to revert to
the status quo ante. Perhaps we will find some other matters on which

does not remove any lines from planning; it merely transfers
installations from falling within the Planning Act 2008 to being
assessed under Section 37 of the Electricity Act 1989. The Explanatory
Memorandum states that approximately 21 applications for consent for
electric lines at 132 kilovolts or greater and 17%, or 15 in
number, are for projects of lengths of under two kilometres. The
Minister’s department considers that lines of under two
kilometres should not normally be considered to be national
infrastructure projects. The memorandum then speaks admirably
concerning the disproportionate nature of the provisions that then fall
due. However, is the Minister confident that simply assessing projects
on the basis of length is enough to assess whether significant, albeit
nationally significant, issues will not come into play? I realise that
a number of respondents to the consultation argued for excluding any
line under 15 kilometres in length. Can the Minister clarify whether
among the responses to the consultation there were any environmental
implications, bearing in mind that Article 2(b) of the order inserts
new subsection (3A), which provides that subsection (3)(ab)(ii) does
not apply where part of the line is in a SSSI or a European

Memorandum is comprehensive and clarifies excellently that there will
be no transitional costs as both of the regimes are familiar to
developers who, following this order, will be far more willing to
undertake improvement projects as a result of the reduction in time and
costs consequential on the transfer to Section 37. I agree that the
level of 132 kilovolts is intended to facilitate local consultation
where electric lines might well have a significant impact and is not
intended to determine whether an electric line is nationally
significant. Is the Minister extending this argument to the question of
length, as mentioned

be covered in overhead lines. The different treatment for project in

about the reasoning behind the length of 2 kilometres. We find that
proposals for works over 2 kilometres for 132 kilovolts or greater
voltages are more likely to be nationally significant, because they
generally contribute to the national network to help provide
electricity to everyone. Minor works are not nationally significant and
will probably amount to routine maintenance or to work on the existing

asked whether there would be a cost saving to be brought in with the
“one in, one out” policy. Yes, it will reduce the cost to
companies of complying with the regulations and will reduce the cost of
application fees with total benefits to companies of around £1.2
million, which is a significant sum to those companies. He also asked
about the linkage of new subsection 3A, on developers avoiding costs,
to the letter to the Minister of State at DECC from the Energy Networks
Association. The impact assessment indicates that two applications for
132 kilovolt lines were withdrawn, and one project was subsequently
undergrounded at an additional cost estimated at around £1
million so that it could be completed within six 
<?notus-xml column=182?>months. There would have been an extension of time had it involved
overhead lines. The other project was re-engineered to fall within
existing exemptions, but it meant that that additional work had to be
carried out at additional cost. It is safe to say that there are
difficult ways of getting around it unless you incur those extra
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:22:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000069">Finally,

restrictions to any country joining the European Union in the future.

movement rights are a fundamental aspect of membership of the European
Union and the internal market. However, the accession treaty makes
provision for member states to apply transitional controls on labour
market access for up to seven years to ensure an orderly transition to
the enjoyment of full free movement rights. The restrictions that these
regulations apply are similar to those which the UK already applies to

Government have not made an estimate of the number of Croatians who may
migrate to the United Kingdom. Given the variables, including the
economic situation and the decisions of other member states, a reliable
forecast is not possible. Croatia is a small country and not
traditionally a source of migrants to the United Kingdom. There is
little reason to expect a large influx after 1 July. However, in the
light of previous experience, it would be rash not to take the
precaution of applying restrictions, particularly if other member
states do so. Germany and the Netherlands have confirmed that they will
apply restrictions to Croatian nationals after 1 July.</hs_para>

restrictions that these regulations put in place are as restrictive as

effect of the regulations is that Croatian nationals will generally
have a right to reside in the UK as workers only if they have obtained
permission to work from the Home Office in the form of an accession
worker registration certificate. They will have no right to reside by
virtue of being a jobseeker. In line with our obligations, there are
some exceptions to the requirement to obtain permission to
work—for example, those who have worked legally and continuously
in the United Kingdom for 12 months, and certain family members, will
have free access to the labour market. The regulations also provide for
the most highly skilled to be granted free access to the labour market
from the
outset.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000075">Where<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:27:03"></hs_TimeCode>
permission is required, a Croatian national will need to obtain this
before they commence employment. In order to obtain an accession worker
registration certificate, a Croatian national will, as now, normally
need to be sponsored by an employer who has been licensed by the Home
Office under the points-based system arrangements. Points-based system
criteria will apply, which means that Croatian nationals will normally
obtain permission to work under tier 2 of the points-based system only
when they are offered a job that is skilled to National Qualifications
Framework level 4, meets minimum salary criteria and for which resident
labour is not available.</hs_para>

prevent Croatian workers obtaining permission to work where they have
skills that are in short supply and will benefit the UK economy.
However, they will reduce the risk of uncontrolled flows of workers
coming to undertake low-skilled work or to take work for which British
workers are available. The regulations do not place an upper limit on
numbers but the requirement that a Croatian national must have an offer
of employment that meets strict criteria will restrict numbers. To put
this in context, only 90 Croatian nationals were admitted to the United
Kingdom in 2012 for the purpose of work under the points-based system
criteria.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060480000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000077">It
is necessary that these transitional measures are backed up by
proportionate enforcement powers. As with the measures applied to
prevent the illegal employment of non-EU nationals, the regulations
will make it an offence to employ a Croatian national where the worker
requires permission to work but does not have it and will provide the
Secretary of State with the option of imposing a civil penalty as an
alternative to prosecution. They will also make it an offence for a
Croatian national to take employment in breach of the regulations. In
such cases, liability to prosecution will be discharged by payment of a
penalty.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13060480000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000193">4.30

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for that explanation, which answered a few of my questions, which I
know he is always pleased to do. I wish to clarify a couple of points
by asking a few questions. The Minister mentioned a seven-year
transition period, yet the order refers to  a five-year
transition period and 2018. I assume he referred to seven years because
there is a possibility of extending the transition period for a further
two years at another date, but this order is for only five years. In
case I have misunderstood, will the Minister clarify that?</hs_para>

enforcement regime regarding those who come from another country and
try to work. Is it the same as the regime for other employment visa

transitional arrangements. As the Minister acknowledged in his
comments, we brought them in for Bulgaria and Romania. I fully
understand why it is not possible to get an accurate assessment of the
numbers involved, but the Minister said that this order is being
brought forward today because of the fear of uncontrolled flows of
workers from Croatia to the UK. He also said that there is no
anticipation of large numbers coming to the UK. That seems somewhat
contradictory. Has there been any assessment of the numbers involved,
or was the assessment that it was not a large number and the order is
just to minimise the risk in case that is wrong? It is not quite clear
as the Minister’s comments were contradictory. If there has been
some assessment, I am interested in the flows in the other direction.

points, from what has been said today and from comments made by other
Ministers in the past, is the Minister able to clarify the
Government’s longer-term position on free movement within the EU
and say whether there are any plans to change the rules on it? I noted
the Minister’s comments about unskilled workers from Croatia or,
indeed, any other country when local workers are available. On that
point, which is slightly tangential but very relevant to this
discussion, how can we ensure that unscrupulous employers do not
illegally employ those who are not 
<?notus-xml column=185?>entitled to work in this country and exploit them by doing so? I am
thinking of things such as ensuring that the minimum wage is paid and
that health and safety regulations are taken note of because cutting
back on those issues is one way that unscrupulous employers exploit
foreign workers and therefore undercut and undermine the local workers
to whom the Minister referred. Will the Minister give us an assurance
that the Government will not weaken those protections, and that when
they are not upheld they will take action?</hs_para>

contradictory comments. I recognise that it is difficult to make an

term “uncontrolled flows” when he was talking about 
<?notus-xml column=186?>the need for this and then said he did not expect large numbers. That
was the point I was making. The two comments seemed contradictory. I
was trying to square the circle on that. I hope I was clear that we

Obviously, where transitional permits are actually applied for, we know

pleased that the noble Baroness noted HMRC’s assault on minimum

Operation Pheasant was designed to seek out exactly this problem in the
part of the world in which I live, and successfully identified
weaknesses that we do not want to see. After all, an exploiting

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach):</Member></B> My Lords, we are concerned here with further
secondary legislation required to amend the Extradition Act 2003
(Designation of Part 1 Territories) Order 2003 and the Extradition Act
2003 (Designation of Part 2 Territories) Order
2003.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000097">The
background to this order is that it is necessary given the accession of
the Republic of Korea to the European Convention on Extradition and the
accession of Croatia to the European Union on 1 July 2013, from which
time it will operate the European arrest warrant procedure. In
addition, this order amends the time allowed for India to provide the
necessary documentation following a person’s provisional arrest
to reflect the terms of the bilateral extradition treaty in place
between the UK and India. Therefore, three separate countries are the
focus of this
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000098">To take
these matters in sequence: first, the Republic of Korea is now a party
to the European Convention on Extradition. This requires that
extradition requests from the Republic of Korea be dealt with under
Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003, which in turn requires that the
Republic of Korea be designated for the purposes of that part. That is
what this order does. In addition, in line with the provisions of the
ECE, this order ensures that when the Republic of Korea sends an
extradition request to the UK, the request need be accompanied only
with information—not evidence—which would justify the
issue of an arrest warrant in a comparable domestic
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000099">The
second country involved is Croatia, which, as we have already debated,
will on 1 July accede to the European Union. We have considered the
particular aspects relating to transitional arrangements. From
1 July, EU extraditions to and from Croatia will cease to
take place under the ECE and will instead fall under the European
arrest warrant procedure, the EAW. It is therefore necessary to
redesignate Croatia as a Part 1 territory to ensure that we comply with
our obligations under the framework decision on the
EAW.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000100">The third
amendment relates to our extradition relations with India. The
Extradition Act 2003 provides for a procedure known as a provisional
arrest, whereby in urgent cases a state can ask for a person to be
arrested in advance of sending the full papers making up the
extradition request. Section 74 of the Act states that following a
person’s provisional arrest, the extradition request must be
received by the judge within 45 days, unless a longer period is
designated by order. This allows the Secretary of State to provide for
a longer period, where necessary, to reflect the terms of a bilateral
treaty.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060480000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000101">The
UK concluded a bilateral extradition treaty with India in 1992, which
has been in operation since 1993. Article 12 of the treaty specifies
that following a provisional arrest the request should be received
within 60 days. The UK considered that extradition with India was
governed by the London Scheme for Extradition within the Commonwealth.
Accordingly, India was not included in the list of territories in
Article 4(2) of SI 2003/3334. However, we subsequently learnt that the
Indian authorities regard the bilateral treaty as the vehicle for
extradition between our two countries. This order ensures that this is
reflected in our legislation by 
<?notus-xml column=188?>setting out that in the case of India the judge must receive the papers
within 65 days of the person’s provisional arrest. This allows
for India to provide the request to the Secretary of State within 60
days, as the treaty provides for, and for the Secretary of State to
have five days to certify the request and send it to the appropriate
judge.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060480000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000102">I hope
that noble Lords will understand the background to this collection of
separate provisions within a single statutory instrument. The various
amendments to the order are necessary to ensure that the United Kingdom
can comply with its particular obligations under the relevant
international extradition arrangements. I hope that, given my
explanation, the Grand Committee will consider the order
favourably.</hs_para>

that the Government are equalising the time allowed for the extradition
procedure in the UK with that in India, but I am not clear why it is
necessary. The Minister said that the Indian Government understood that
to be the position. Are we changing it because there was a
misunderstanding in 2003 when it came through? I would have thought
that we would want to move to extradition as quickly as possible, and I
am not clear whether this is extending or reducing the time made
available, because nowhere in the order or the Explanatory Notes could
I find what the time was before it was 60 days. Obviously it has been
changed to 60 days from something, but I do not know from what. If it
is in the Explanatory Notes, I apologise, but I could not find it when
I was looking through them. It would be helpful to have that
information on why it is coming through now. Has the current timescale,
whatever it is, been in place since 2003 or did it exist before
that?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060480000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000105">I was
very pleased to hear the Minister give such a positive explanation for
and account of the European arrest warrant, which is something he and I
have discussed before. I know the Government are reconsidering this
issue, which has caused enormous concern to others in Europe as we
extradite through the European arrest warrant and apply for extradition
through the European arrest warrant. Can the Minister tell me how many
times the UK has used the European arrest warrant for extradition to
and from the UK? As the Government are bringing this order forward
today, they clearly regard the order and the extension of the European
arrest warrant to Croatia as helpful and desirable. Croatia will be
subject to the European arrest warrant but, on the other hand, the
Government 
<?notus-xml column=189?>are now considering withdrawing from all the police and justice
measures, which include the European arrest warrant.</hs_para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach):</Member></B> My Lords, the order before us today will apply
certain provisions of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984,
commonly known as PACE, to criminal investigations conducted by
immigration officers. The direct application of these powers to
immigration officers for the first time reflects the increasing
incidence of immigration officers taking on criminal investigations. It
does not affect existing administrative powers of detention, which will
continue to be used for the vast majority of immigration operations
under the Immigration Act 1971, so criminal investigations are the
focus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000112">The
order will also apply to designated customs officials and to persons
detained by designated customs officials. This includes powers of
arrest, search of premises and seizure of evidence as well as
obligations in respect of persons detained on suspicion of having
committed customs offences. It will also repeal part of Section 22 of
the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, which provided for
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (Application to Revenue and
Customs) Order 2007 to apply to designated customs officials
undertaking criminal investigations in England and Wales. This was the
legislative vehicle that afforded PACE powers to customs officials who
transferred from HMRC to the Home Office in
2009.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000113">At that
time, the commitment made to Parliament was that this was to be a
temporary measure pending the coming into force of one order that
applied to both immigration officers and customs officials within the
Home Office. This is the order before noble Lords today which will
fulfil that undertaking made to Parliament. The reason that, to date,
these powers have applied only to customs officials undertaking
criminal investigations and detention derives from the time when
customs work was an integral part of HMRC. The increasing incidence of
immigration officers taking on criminal investigations as part of the
focus on tackling immigration crime has made it necessary to extend
some of the criminal investigation powers that currently apply to
police and designated customs officials to immigration officers. These
criminal investigation powers will be used only where the criminal
prosecution of an individual is realistic. It is normally in the public

application of PACE provisions to immigration officers will deliver
both operational and resource benefits. At present, police and
immigration officers on immigration enforcement teams often work in

different sets of powers, derived from PACE for the police or the
Immigration Acts for immigration officers. This dual approach causes
confusion and accountability problems as well as having a negative

different

Lords will be aware of the Home Secretary’s recent announcement
of the creation of a separate immigration enforcement arm of the Home
Office whose remit is to tackle any abuse of our immigration laws and
to encourage compliance. It is individuals 
<?notus-xml column=191?>within this new entity who investigate immigration crime alongside their
colleagues in Border Force, who deal with customs crime, who will
benefit from this order. For the first time, it will place all
appropriately trained criminal investigators on the same legislative
footing regardless of their background and remove any confusion about
the legal basis of their actions. In addition to simplifying the
operational landscape, the application of PACE to immigration
investigators will deliver direct benefits in the form of added
powers  to tackle crime. Specifically, these will be the
ability to seize evidence under Section 19 of PACE and the ability to
apply for search warrants in respect of special procedure material
under Schedule 1. Powers of search under Sections 18 and 32 are also
much simpler in application than their equivalents in Part 3 of the
Immigration Act 1971, which is currently the only legal basis on which
search powers are available to immigration enforcement
investigators.</hs_para>

longer term, the application of PACE provisions to immigration officers
will provide operational flexibility and build capability within
immigration enforcement through their professionalising investigation
programme, thereby reducing their reliance on the police. Designated
customs officials in Border Force will continue to have access to PACE
powers as a result of this order but will now do so under the same
legislative vehicle as their immigration officer counterparts. Not only
will this reduce possible confusion in circumstances where officers are
dual-qualified to act as both an immigration officer and a designated
customs official, but it should also negate any need to seek any
further enabling or provisional powers in the event of future
structural change.</hs_para>

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, again, I am grateful to the
Minister for his explanation. As I understand it, the order before us
extends the powers of arrest, search and seizure to immigration
officers and customs officials. The Minister will be aware that, in the
interests of effective policing, we have called for these measures to
be introduced. Clearly, given the kind of investigative work,
particularly on issues such as human trafficking and facilitating
illegal immigration, it is appropriate, as the order states, that
officers should act within a PACE-complaint framework. That will now
include customs and immigration officers. We support that.</hs_para>

disappointed if I did not ask him a couple of questions. Paragraph 7.4
of the Explanatory Memorandum refers to mixed investigative teams with
the National Crime Agency, which makes  
<?notus-xml column=192?>sense if they are looking into serious organised crime relating to
immigration issues or human trafficking. Does that mean, for example,
that all customs or immigration officers acting in a joint team on an
NCA investigation would have the same powers as the police officers in
that team and that they would retain those powers? If it does not, can
the Minister say anything about the differences? I assume that
additional training would be required for the officers to ensure that
they know the additional powers that they have and how they can
properly use them.</hs_para>

the joint teams, the NCA—as the Minister will know—will
not apply fully to Northern Ireland because of a difficult situation
which has arisen, which the Government could have done more to resolve
early on, if I am honest. I am curious whether these powers and this
order will also apply to customs and immigration officers in Northern
Ireland, given that the NCA will not operate in that way in Northern
Ireland. If the Minister could given me answer on that, it would be
very helpful. I notice our Northern Ireland spokespeople are here today

there is only a partial transfer of responsibility and that National
Crime Agency functions will still be exercised in Northern Ireland

something that I tried to jot down quickly—I am not sure that I

noble Baroness. I had it clear in my mind if it was not clear in my
exposition. Each of these specialist elements—police, customs
and immigration—are enforcement agencies operating in their
particular way. Immigration officers hold their powers totally
independently of these other powers. Each agency derives its powers
from PACE in an independent fashion. However, it clearly makes it a lot
easier, when they are working together, to have powers deriving from
the same source, which they do not have at present. The noble Baroness
was gracious enough to admit that the 2009 Act needed to put
that right at some point in the future. This is the moment at which we

inaccurate entries on the current register. In her wind up can she give
the Committee some up-to-date figures as to what in her opinion the
accuracy level of the register is at present? It is a continuous
process but people perhaps become less exercised by it and do not

definitely an
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000139">With
regards to the reference that you are going to support research by
NISRA into alternatives to the 2021 census, I think many people felt
that the census was an extremely costly process. The information also
decays very rapidly with time. Ten years is a long time in public
policy and needs change. If it is possible to have a more accurate and
running figure when one is making public policy and spending decisions,
there is merit in that. Quite frequently we had to make decisions on
the basis of previous censuses which obviously were very inaccurate by
the time we got to them.</hs_para>

one issue to which I want to draw the Committee’s attention is
that of confidentiality. We all know about the Census
(Confidentiality)(Northern Ireland) Order 1991 but I have to tell noble
Lords that there is considerable anxiety among many people that the
spread of information—the number of agencies from which the
information is both drawn from and goes to—means that a very
large number of people have access to it. No matter what is said, given
that lip service is always paid to confidentiality, I am not clear
about what is actually being done about this, so I would be grateful
for an indication of what processes and decisions to implement it are
in place. The fact is 
<?notus-xml column=196?>that people are still being targeted and, sadly, we have seen evidence
of that over the past six months. A number of people are nervous about
having their names appear on the electoral register, and yet they are
under a legal obligation to provide information for electoral purposes.
That information will be spread around a large number of public bodies
whether they want it or not. In the past, I have listened to Ministers
say that it is an issue and they are looking at it but I am unclear as
what has ever been done about it. It is an extremely difficult problem
to solve. Once information is passed to public bodies, it is in the
system where loads of people have access to it, and it is not clear to
me how that information is controlled.</hs_para>

inaccuracy. It is in the interests of democracy that we make the

increase the turnout; in fact, they would probably do the reverse.

census information in a different way. The recommended changes to the
canvass form that he referred to are in the primary legislation
currently before the other place: the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous

government. The form will be designed by the Electoral Commission. In
my view and that of the Government, that is very much more satisfactory

shall go back to the census and the issue about confidentiality raised
by both noble Lords. Part of the benefit of information sharing with
NISRA is improving its ability to obtain information relevant to the
census. Confidentiality is a difficult issue, as the Northern Ireland
Office is very aware. There was a public consultation on anonymous
registration, and provisions on it are currently being considered. It
is important to bear in mind that people do not have to have their
address advertised on the register in order to have the right to vote.
They have a legal obligation to register to vote but do not have to
have their address advertised. I emphasise that NISRA deals with census
material under conditions of secrecy and confidentiality. Its staff are
trained to a very high standard in this and are under considerable
regulation in the way in which they handle that data, for the reasons
that noble Lords outlined in their concern about confidentiality. The
concern about sharing data is not new. It has existed for some time and
therefore is not associated with these
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000150">Finally,

is with regret that I propose that this system be renewed for a further
two years, but I do so with the knowledge that there remains in
Northern Ireland a serious threat from a small but dangerous minority.
They have no mandate but seek to drag Northern Ireland back into the
past. Their targets are police officers, soldiers and prison officers,
but their attacks are felt by the wider community, many of whom face
disruption on a daily basis.</hs_para>

prison officer David Black, in November 2012, by a group referred to as
the “new IRA” was an unwelcome reminder of the continuing
threat posed by dissident republican terrorists. This new grouping
primarily consists of members of the Real IRA, Republican Action
Against Drugs, which conducts brutal shootings against nationalist
members of the community, and a number of unaffiliated individuals, who
we believe have connections to the fatal attack against Massereene
barracks in 2009.</hs_para>

Northern Ireland and its counterpart in the Republic of Ireland, the
AGS, continue to thwart the efforts of such groups. Across the island
of Ireland, 173 arrests and 64 charges were made during 2012. There
were also 18 convictions of individuals involved in planning and
participating in attacks. So far this year, there have been 63 arrests,
32 charges and 18 seizures. Many more attacks have been
thwarted and disrupted.</hs_para>

that there are means available within the criminal justice system to
allow the perpetrators of these attacks to be brought before the law.
We must recognise that Northern Ireland is still unfortunately in a
unique situation, and the non-jury trial provisions provide a unique
solution to a small number of cases. Noble Lords will know that jury
trials in Northern Ireland are not safe from disruption by those
involved in terrorist activity. Public galleries are at times crowded
with members of the public. The close-knit nature of society in
Northern Ireland means that jurors are vulnerable to intimidation. This
can result in, at best, a partisan
verdict.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000157">I
thought it would be helpful if I outlined the processes involved in
order to obtain a non-jury trial. The Director of Public Prosecutions
issues a certificate which allows for one. The DPP can issue a
certificate for a non-jury trial only if he believes that one or more
of four statutory conditions, which are laid out in Section 1 of the
Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007, are met. Condition 1
is that the defendant  is, or is an associate of, a member of a
proscribed organisation. Condition 2 is that the offence was committed
on behalf of a proscribed organisation or that a proscribed
organisation was involved. Condition 3 is that an attempt
has been made by or on behalf of a proscribed organisation to prejudice
the investigation or prosecution. Condition 4 is that the offence was
committed as a result of, or in connection with, religious or political
hostility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T17:35:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

aware that a proscribed organisation is one that is concerned with
terrorism. It can also be seen that the four conditions relate
specifically 
<?notus-xml column=199?>to the circumstances of the offence and the defendant. Furthermore, the
DPP must be satisfied that there is a risk that the administration of
justice might be impaired if a jury trial were to be held. There is a
clear distinction here between this system and the previous Diplock
court arrangements which were in place prior to the Justice and
Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007. The Diplock system saw all
scheduled offences tried by a judge alone. Today, there is a clear
presumption that jury trial will take place in all cases. Certificates
are issued only when absolutely necessary in the interests of the
administration of justice and where the particular statutory tests are
met.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060480000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000159">Noble
Lords will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T17:36:55"></hs_TimeCode> also
wish to be aware that not all cases proceed to a non-jury trial. The
PSNI holds no right to stipulate that a non-jury trial takes place, and
the Director of Public Prosecutions acts with discretion and
independence in deciding whether to issue a certificate. Hence the
number of non-jury trials in Northern Ireland remains relatively low.
So far, in 2013, the DPP has issued just eight certificates for
non-jury trials and one request has been refused. In 2012, 25
certificates were issued and three were refused. However, while they
are low, these figures are still significant and show the ongoing need
for non-jury trial.</hs_para>

know that this is now the third such renewal of these provisions and
there is some concern about that. I am also aware that during the last
renewal in 2011, noble Lords expressed concern about the limited
consultation that was held at the time. I can, however, inform noble
Lords that prior to taking a decision on the renewal of the provisions
this time around, the Northern Ireland Office canvassed opinion from
the main stakeholders linked to the operation of non-jury trials in
Northern Ireland. This included the PSNI, the Department of Justice,
the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service, the PPS in Northern
Ireland and the Office of the Lord Chief Justice. The consensus among
all of those stakeholders was that the present threat environment is
not dissimilar to that surrounding the previous renewal and, as such,
all were in favour of renewing the provisions as they currently
stand.</hs_para>

return to full jury trial in all cases in Northern Ireland, but this
should happen only when the security situation permits and your
Lordships will know that we are not there yet. Given the current severe
threat from Northern Ireland-related terrorism and its bearing on

question. At one point the noble Baroness said that all stakeholders
who were consulted accepted the need for the continuation of these
arrangements. The document actually says that the majority of
respondents to the consultation accepted the need for the continuation
of these arrangements. Is it possible to be told a little more about
the arguments of the minority and how strongly they were stated, even,
if possible, where they came from and, indeed, if this represents any
difference of view among the political parties? However, as I said in
my opening remarks, I regretfully agree absolutely with the Government
that the situation in Northern Ireland at the moment is such that it is
necessary to continue with these arrangements. I hope very much that it
will not be too long before the Minister can come to the Dispatch Box

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, I reluctantly agree with the noble Lord,
Lord Bew. We are considering a two-year renewal. Given the length of
time that would have to elapse before what any of us would consider
normality could resume, it seems to me inevitable that this measure
will have to be renewed, at least for the proposed period. The fact is
that while the number of trials is not large, it is significant, and it
is the nature of the trials that is really the issue. I do not see any
grounds for believing that we are at a point where a renewal of this
provision could be refused in the foreseeable future. That is most

noble Baroness referred to the murder of Mr Black towards
the end of last year. Perhaps the Committee is not aware of the number
of terrorist attempts that have been made since then, to say nothing of
what was done in the year or two years before the death of
Mr Black. We should put on record our thanks to the security
services for the number of terrorist attempts that have been
interdicted. We also should thank the Irish police for the co-operation
that we are receiving from them and for the very effective actions that

within the past few weeks there have been a number of very significant
attempts. Within the past few days there was an attempt to kill police
officers in Belfast. It is inconceivable that if those people were
apprehended, you could conduct a trial as if we were in the Home
Counties. I have to say with regret that, in view of some events that

many decades because it has kept civilisation and the rule of law

alternative but to continue to renew this measure. However, I ask the
noble Baroness to consider this: if the intention of the initial
legislation in 2007 was that it should be short-term, and we continue
to renew it in two-year bites, is someone going to judicially review
this whole thing and say, “That was not the original intention

all noble Lords and noble Baronesses the reluctance, but nevertheless
acceptance, to proceed with the renewal of the order. It is entirely

Randerson:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their

by the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy. We would all agree that we very much
hope that this will be the last time that this order has to be

shall start with the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Bew. I was
perhaps not clear in what I said. There was a two-stage process in the
consultation. The Secretary of State canvassed opinion among
stakeholders and, having taken those initial soundings, she decided to
hold a formal consultation. It was formal but limited in the number of
organisations that were consulted and the response rate did not
indicate that there was any burning concern in a number of
organisations. Three of the responses from the organisations did not
agree with the renewal, although one of them was a group of academics
in Australia which was not a formal part of the consultation. The
reasons given by the people who live in the community directly affected
by this were largely to do with there being a lack of evidence of
intimidation. Of course, one is struck by the fact that if this system
is working well, it prevents intimidation, and therefore, it if has
worked successfully, there will be little evidence of intimidation. For
example, the director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice
expressed frustration at the lack of available evidence of juror
intimidation and questioned the degree of discretion afforded to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in issuing the certificate. The tenor
of the reply was concern that there was no
evidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000175">I
share the concern expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Empey, about the
current violence. It is worth pointing out that there is a large number
of unsuccessful attempts at violence and terrorism. I shall give some
examples. So far this year, in relation to national security attacks,
there have been 68 arrests, 32 charges and 19 seizures. That is a sign
of the success of the PSNI operation. The noble Lord raised the
possibility of judicial review. It is always a possibility, and the
Northern Ireland Office is aware of it. I will ensure that the point is
made to the Secretary of State and that she is aware of the noble
Lord’s
comments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000176">The
noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, asked about loyalist attacks. The concern
about terrorism is primarily about dissident republicans but, of
course, there is another issue about loyalist unrest, the nature of
which we saw during the flag protests, which became violent on a number
of occasions. There were death threats and violence against the police,
and a considerable number of police were injured in the early days of
those protests. We need to be aware of the issue, in that there is a
different face to concern in both those
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060480000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-gc0001.htm#13060480000177">Finally,
we have to bear in mind that in Northern Ireland people are
particularly vulnerable to paramilitary intimidation. It is greater
than it is in the rest of the 
<?notus-xml column=203?>UK because, as noble Lords know very well from their
own experience, people live in small, close-knit communities. It is
particularly easy to identify those called for jury service, which is
at the heart of the problem. We have to be concerned about the
intimidation 
<?notus-xml column=204?>or potential intimidation of jurors by people representing both sides of
the community. I commend the order to the

our presence in Afghanistan reduces, our requirement for the support of
local staff is also reducing. The Government recognise the contribution
and commitment of all local staff. They have played a vital role in
contributing to our shared goal—a more secure, stable and
prosperous Afghanistan. Without them, the UK’s contribution to
the international mission would not have been possible. We pay tribute
to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and those who have been
injured whilst working with
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000005">The future
of Afghanistan lies in the hearts and minds of such people, who have
done so much to move their country forward. Having invested so much
already, the Government want to encourage local staff to stay in
Afghanistan and to use their skills and knowledge to make it stronger,
better able to meet the challenges ahead and to seize the
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000006">For
this reason, we have decided to implement a generous package of
training and financial support for our locally engaged staff in
Afghanistan. It will provide local staff with up to five years of
training or education in Afghanistan in a subject of their own choosing
and a living stipend for the full period of training based on their
final salary. Staff who prefer not to take up the training package will
be offered a second option—a financial severance payment which
represents 18 months’ salary. This will be paid in monthly
instalments. These options aim to encourage local staff to develop
valuable skills and knowledge in Afghanistan so they can go on
contributing to a brighter future for themselves, their families and
their
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000007">The
Government acknowledge that some local staff, such as interpreters,
have worked in particularly dangerous and challenging roles in Helmand.
In recognition of this unique and exceptional service to the United
Kingdom, these local staff and their immediate families will be offered
a third option—resettlement in the UK. In order to help them
adjust to life in the UK, they will be offered initial assistance and
accommodation including access to benefits, as well as support in
seeking
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000008">To
be eligible for resettlement in the UK, local staff must have routinely
worked in dangerous and challenging roles in Helmand outside protected
bases. Seriously injured staff, who might have qualified had their
employment not been terminated due to injuries sustained in combat, are
also included. Local staff who were contracted by the UK, but who
mostly worked for Danish or Estonian Forces and who meet the criteria
above, are also eligible. This approach has been agreed with the Danish
and Estonian Governments.</hs_para>

clear in our desire to recognise the efforts of local staff, and have
balanced this against a range of other factors.
These include the cost of any scheme, and the potential impact on the
UK and on Afghanistan of resettling large numbers of people. In line
with previous similar policies, qualification for this redundancy
scheme is limited to those local staff who were in post working
directly for HMG on 19 December 2012, when the Prime
Minister announced the drawdown of UK forces, and who have served more
than 12 months when they are made redundant. Those whose employment
ended before this date, and those whose employment was ended
voluntarily or for disciplinary reasons will not be eligible. In total,
we estimate that around 1,200 local staff will qualify for a redundancy
package. Of these, we estimate that up to 600 will be eligible for
resettlement, although they may choose to stay in Afghanistan to help
build its future, supported by the training and financial
packages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000010">Further

from the redundancy package, we recognise our obligations to any local
staff who face real threats to their safety or that of their immediate
family as a result of their service to the UK. Our existing
intimidation policy will remain in place for all local staff,
regardless of their date and duration of employment. This ensures that
local staff who face real threats to their own and their
families’ safety, now and in the future, are supported. The
policy offers relocation within Afghanistan and, in the most extreme
cases, the possibility of resettlement in the UK. We are currently
reviewing the policy to ensure it continues to provide a fair and
robust system of assessing threats to, and ensuring the protection of,
our local
staff.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000012">The UK

goal of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees. We remain

EU emissions were already down 17.6% on 1990 levels (Reference:
European Environment Agency);</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>but we should
also learn the lessons from 2008 package—the EU climate deal for
2020 was not sufficiently ambitious, and the renewables target was the
product of a time when renewables badly needed a catalyst. The EU has
moved on since then; we need to see a new deal on greenhouse gas
targets that is ambitious, but which has flexibility to let countries
follow their most cost-effective decarbonisation
approach;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>looking to 2030, the EU should
adopt a unilateral EU target for 2030 of a
40% reduction on 1990 levels. In the context of an ambitious global
climate agreement for the period beyond 2020, the EU’s target
should increase to up to a 50% reduction on 1990 levels;
and</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>we believe that the best way to deliver
our low- carbon goal is through a binding GHG target
and a strong EU Emissions Trading System, with flexibility
for member states to pursue a wide range of options to decarbonise in
the least-cost way. While we strongly support renewables to 2020 and
beyond, we do not believe a binding EU renewables
target would be cost-effective, fit well with our electricity market
reforms which incentivise low-carbon generation in a technology-neutral
way, or be in line with the Government’s commitment to
sector-neutral and least-cost emissions reduction. We support EU action
where appropriate to enable increased levels of renewables, such as a

measures may have a longer timescale before realisation. This new
initiative will include legislative measures and we are expecting the
outcomes of this debate to inform this package of measures which will

to the House that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for
Health and I have asked Professor Chris Elliott, of Queen’s
University Belfast, to lead an independent review into the integrity
and assurance of food supply networks in response to the
vulnerabilities recently exposed by horsemeat fraud. I am pleased that
he has accepted, subject to the necessary formalities being concluded
with Queen's University
Belfast.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000084">On 15
April (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 13WS) the House was informed that
it was our intention to take forward a strategic review of the
horsemeat incident and its implications for the food chain and
regulatory framework. We have since concluded that the review should
examine food supply networks more widely. We have therefore asked
Professor Elliott to provide advice to me and my right honourable
friend the Secretary of State for Health on issues which impact upon
consumer confidence in the authenticity of food products and any
systemic failures in food supply networks which could have implications
for food safety and public health. We expect him to make
recommendations to support improvements in current systems and to
improve consumer
confidence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000085">The
review will begin shortly and I anticipate it will take nine to 12
months to complete. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State
for Health and I have asked for interim advice in December and for a
final report by spring 2014. We have also asked Professor Elliott to
provide emerging findings on the European aspects of the review so that
we can continue to influence action at a European level and effectively
engage in the European Union
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060455000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604-wms0001.htm#13060455000086">The
reviewer will in due course issue a call for evidence
seeking information and views on the integrity of the food supply
network, any vulnerabilities and how assurances might be
strengthened to support consumer confidence. Food fraud is completely
unacceptable and consumers have every right to expect their food to be
correctly described. In response to horsemeat fraud, investigations
continue at a number of sites across the UK and Europe.</hs_para>

the Food Standards Agency commissioned Professor Pat Troop to conduct
an independent review of that organisation’s response to
horsemeat fraud. Professor Troop will be reporting her emerging
findings to the Board of the Food Standards Agency at its open meeting
later today. My right honourable friend the Health Secretary and I
expect any strategic findings from the Pat Troop review to be

Senior Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local

Warsi):</Member> The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)’s
report of 21 February states that Iran’s declared purpose for
enriching uranium is for fabrication of fuel for its nuclear facilities
and research reactors. However, as the IAEA report notes, as of
February 2013 Iran already had just under 6000kg of uranium enriched up
to 5% and 167kg enriched up to 20%. This is enough enriched uranium for
many years’ worth of fuel. We therefore assess that continuing
enrichment by Iran and the expansion of its nuclear programme—in
violation of UN Security Council Resolutions and Board of
Governors—has no plausible civilian
justification.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13060482000534" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604w0001.htm#13060482000534">Israel</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Question</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="13060482000587" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604w0001.htm#13060482000587">Asked

However, last year saw a dramatic decline in pirate attacks off the
coast of Somalia to just 35, with the number of ships seized falling by
over 80% compared to the previous year. The last successful hijacking
was in May 2012 and so far this year there have been three unsuccessful
attacks. This is the combined result of continued military naval action
at sea, greater shipping compliance with industry best management
practice and increased use of embarked private security companies.

pirates, 54 hostages remain in pirate hands, often subjected
to terrible conditions with no knowledge of when, or even if, they will
be released.</hs_para>

the land as underlined by the recent Somalia

prosperity and rule of law. The UK continues to play a leading role in
providing such support. For example, the Regional Anti-Piracy

Newby:</Member> The Reyhanii attacks were the deadliest terrorist
attacks in modern Turkish history. Fifty one people died, and many more
were injured. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs, my right honourable friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr
Hague), condemned the atrocities and offered the UK's condolences to
those affected. We do not yet know who carried out the attacks. The
Turkish authorities continue to investigate and it would be
inappropriate to speculate at this
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060482000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604w0001.htm#13060482000316">These
attacks will not change our policy on Syria, and will only strengthen
our commitment to find a peaceful political solution to the conflict.
Turkey shares this common aim with the UK. We have worked closely with
Turkey since the beginning of the civil conflict in Syria, particularly
on co-ordination of support to the opposition. As a key member of the
Friends of Syria group, Turkey will have an important role to play in
the build up to the Geneva CE conference and
beyond.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060482000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604w0001.htm#13060482000317">We
welcome Turkey's generous provision of refuge for hundreds of thousands
of Syrians who have tied the violence and their efforts to minimise the
impact of the conflict on regional stability. We should pay tribute to
the Turkish people, who are showing their hospitality to huge numbers
of refugees while enduring outrageous bomb attacks, such as the one
that we saw a taw days ago. In order to support the refugee response,
the UK has provided over £6 million in humanitarian aid in
Turkey, including £1 million to the Turkish Red
Crescent.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13060482000561" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130604w0001.htm#13060482000561">Universal
