That is why the Government and regulators have jointly announced a

there is a great lack of financial understanding among a lot of
ordinary people, such as me, as to exactly what rates of interest are
being charged? I then read in today’s paper of the worry about
the shortfall that might occur with all the young people getting
mortgages. The reason is the same: if interest rates go up they will
find that they are out of pocket. Does he not think that it is terribly
important for us to try to see that everyone has a degree of
understanding of what they are letting themselves in for? People get
terrible shocks with this payday lending in

point. This is precisely why the summit will, I hope, be helpful in
highlighting the concerns. However, I stress that the Government have
been taking some tough action and have given 50 firms—90% of the
market—12 weeks to change their business practices or risk
facing legal requirements or the loss of their licences. Two have
already told the OFT that they are surrendering their licences. Since 6
March, the OFT has revoked the licences of three firms engaged in
payday lending and has three further investigations
open.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:09:53"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mitchell" PimsId="1929" UID="13062661000313" xid="1349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000313">Lord
Mitchell:</Member></B> Noble Lords will be as horrified as I was
yesterday to discover that the leading online payday lending company
has raised the interest rate on its loans from 4,214% to 5,853%.
Religious leaders, community leaders and Members of both Houses of
Parliament have begged the Government to cap interest rates, but they
continue to refuse. Why is this? Could it be that some of the
shareholders in some of the payday lending companies are also some of
the donors to the Conservative

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> The Government remain very concerned by
the evidence of harm in the payday loan market, but we do not think
that the current evidence points to a cap on the cost of credit as a
solution at this time. The Bristol report on high-cost credit indicates
that a cap could have unintended consequences and risks harm, such as
reducing consumers’ access to credit and leading to crime,
lenders imposing new charges outside the cap, and less understanding
shown to customers. Therefore, we do not agree that this is right or,
indeed, that a ban would be
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:11:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elystan-Morgan" PimsId="3108" UID="13062661000315" xid="1811" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000315">Lord
Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, I will raise a purely legal
point. Does the Minister accept that under the Consumer Credit Act 2006
there is substantial protection—potentially, at any
rate—for a debtor who would otherwise suffer injustice? Under
that Act, a judge is entitled, where he considers that there are unfair
provisions in the loan contract or that the lender has acted in an
unconscionable way, to deprive that creditor of relief or to rewrite
the contract to make it fairer. Can the Minister show the House that
such matters are brought constantly to the attention of judges,
particularly district judges, who deal with these matters, so that such
cases of gross unfairness are properly dealt

issue of continuous payment authorities. The Government have real
concerns about the way in which payday lenders can access money from
their customers’ bank accounts. We have been pressing the
industry on further transparency, and payday lending codes commit
lenders to explaining clearly what a CPA is, how it works and how to

confess to being somewhat—a little—encouraged by it. The
choice of lawyer is an essential part of our criminal justice system,
as of course is the presumption of innocence. Does the Minister agree
with his right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor’s
justification of the proposal to abolish choice of lawyer, given in a
recent interview in the <I>Law Society Gazette</I>? That seemed to be
based on the absurd principle of “too thick to pick”. Or,
does he agree with his right honourable friend the Deputy Prime

We have never hidden the fact that part of what we are doing is because
of financial constraints. The legal aid budget has to take its share of
the burden of our spending cuts but we are trying to do that in a way
that retains the fundamental access to justice. We have consulted very
thoroughly. We have had some 16,000 responses, which we are working
through. We will try to come back with constructive proposals, so long

system, the most expensive single criminal legal aid case in 2010-12
cost the taxpayer £8.5 million. Under our present system, this
would reduce to £6 million. The total cost to the taxpayer of

hope that the legal profession will engage with us in a constructive

constructive debate about this. However, since the noble Lord has
raised the common agricultural policy, perhaps I should say that it was
Labour’s leadership in the last round of CAP reform that cost us
€550 million in disallowance and led us to the disastrous
administration of the single farm payment. We, by contrast, are
tackling another immensely complex negotiation on flood insurance in a
measured and sensible way. We have to balance the interests of those at
high risk of flood, wider policyholders and taxpayers, while the ABI is
a membership organisation with a lot of interests to represent. The
noble Lord asks about an opportunity to debate the eventual outcome. I
would be pleased about that; it is not my role to guarantee it, but I

given considerable thought. However, international comparisons provide
no clear model. The state-backed national disaster insurance system in
the US was in debt to the taxpayer by $17 billion even before Hurricane
Sandy struck. Emergency legislation was required in January 2013 to
increase the fund’s borrowing by $9.7 billion when the scheme
was days from running out of money, to enable claims to be paid. So we

Lord’s first question, the ABI, in its letter to which we
referred when we last debated this subject a month ago, has expressed
confidence that we will be able to conclude this before the end of
July, and I have every confidence in that. We need a solution that
provides affordable insurance, as the noble Lord said, for those at
risk, but that does not place unsustainable costs on wider
policyholders or the taxpayer. Obtaining insurance might involve some
householders shopping around or going through specialist brokers if
flood risks are significant. In terms of help for householders, in July

authorities on the flood risk associated with new developments, which
is used to develop strategic flood-risk assessments. During 2012-13,
99% of planning objections raised by the Environment Agency were
amended in line with the advice of the NPPF. Where development is
allowed because the risk is low, the proposed development should be
designed to ensure that it is safe even in a one-in-1,000-year-scale

regulations governing GM crops. These regulations were designed to
provide fair and predictable market access for products that have
undergone a rigorous, case-by-case safety assessment. In practice,
polarised views across EU member states mean that the scientific
evidence is often ignored and crops remain stuck in the system. It is

Taverne:</Member></B> I should declare an interest as founder of the
charity, Sense About Science. Over 14 years ago, several reports from
the Royal Society, supported by every single national academy of
sciences in the world, concluded that GM crops were no danger and
caused no harm to human health or the environment. Since then, the
enormous expansion in the cultivation of GM crops outside Europe and
especially in emerging countries has strongly reinforced that
conclusion. Will my noble friend convey to the Secretary of State
congratulations on basing policy on
evidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:32:01"></hs_TimeCode>? Will
he assure us that the Government will stand firm against the

areas in the world that are going to be badly affected by this because
the plants do not produce seeds on the same basis as current crops. I
suggest that in all discussions that go on about this, particularly
with the European Union, steps should be taken to ensure that the
people who are going to make a lot of money out of these GM crops, such
as seed merchants, do something to help those people in other areas in
the world who will not be able to do the usual agriculture they have at
the moment. We just cannot lose sight of that. I would like him to make

world as it is, not as we would wish it to be, so this country has to
continue to make savings. I can report to the House that the biggest
single saving we have made in government is the £6 billion a
year less we are paying to service our debts than the previous
Government budgeted for. Bear that number in mind when you hear the
Opposition complaining about
cuts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000069">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>
deficit has come down by a third, yet at over 7% it remains far too
high, so we must continue to take action—not just because it is
wrong to go on adding debts to our children’s shoulders, but
because we know from the global turbulence of the past few
years that the economic risks are real and the recovery has to be
sustained. If we abandoned our deficit plan, Britain would be back in
intensive care. So the figures today show that until 2017-18, total
managed expenditure —in other words, the total amount of
government spending—will continue to fall in real terms at the
same average rate as it is falling today.</hs_para>

task before us today is to spell out what that means for 2015-16. Total
managed expenditure will be £745 billion. To put that huge sum
into context, consider this: if government spending had been allowed to
rise through this Parliament at the average rate of the past three
decades, that total would have been £120 billion higher. This
Government have taken unprecedented steps to achieve that expenditure
control. Now we need to find £11.5 billion of further savings. I
want to pay a personal tribute to my right honourable friend the Chief
Secretary for the huge effort that he has put into delivering them.
Finding savings on that scale has not been easy. These are difficult
decisions that will affect people in our country, but there never was
an easy way to bring spending under control. Reform, growth and
fairness are the principles. Let me take each in
turn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000071">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>
will start with reform and the obligation that we all have in this
House to ensure that we get more for every pound of taxpayers’
money that we spend. With the help of my right honourable friend the
Minister for the Cabinet Office, we have been combing through
Whitehall, driving out costs, renegotiating contracts and reducing the
size of government. Cutting money that the previous Government were
spending on marketing and consultants, reforming government IT and
negotiating harder on behalf of the taxpayer have already saved almost
£5 billion. In this spending round, we will find a further
£5 billion of efficiency savings. That is nearly half of the
total savings we need to
achieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000072">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>
are reforming pay in the public sector. We are holding down pay awards,
and public sector pay rises will be limited to an average of up to 1%
for 2015-16. However, the biggest reform that we will make on pay is to
automatic progression pay. That is the practice whereby many employees
not only get a pay rise every year, but automatically move up a pay
grade every single year, regardless of performance. Some public sector
employees see annual pay rises of 7%. Progression 
<?notus-xml column=741?>pay can at best be described as antiquated; at worst, it is deeply
unfair to other parts of the public sector that do not get it and to
the private sector that has to pay for it. So we will end
automatic progression pay in the Civil Service by
2015-16, and we are working to remove automatic pay rises simply for
time served in our schools, NHS, prisons and police. The Armed Forces
will be excluded from those
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000073">Keeping<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>
pay awards down and ending automatic progression pay means that, for
every pound we have to save in central administration, we can better
limit job losses. I do not want to disguise from the House that there
will be further reductions in the number of people working in the
public sector. The Office for Budget Responsibility has forecast that
the total number of people working for the Government will fall by a
further 144,000 by 2015-16. I know that for those who are affected that
is difficult. That is the consequence of the country spending far
beyond its
means.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000074">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>
I presented the spending round three years ago, I said that about half
a million posts in the public sector were forecast to have to go. That
is indeed what has happened, and we are saving £2 billion a
year, with a Civil Service now smaller than at any time since the war.
I also said three years ago that I was confident that job creation in
the private sector would more than make up for the losses. That
prediction created more controversy than almost anything else at the
time, including with the Opposition. The shadow Chancellor called it
“a complete fantasy”. Instead, every job lost in the
public sector has been offset by three new jobs in the private sector.
In the past year, five new jobs have been created for every job cut in
the public sector. The central argument of those who fought against our
plan is completely demolished by the ingenuity, enterprise and ambition
of Britain’s businesses. I pay tribute to the hard-working
people of this country who proved their pessimism wrong.</hs_para>

this spending round, the Treasury will, as one would expect, lead by
example. In 2015-16, our resource budget will be reduced by 10%. The
Cabinet Office will also see its resource budget reduced by 10%.
However, within that we will continue to fund support for social
action, including the National Citizen Service. Ninety thousand places
will be available for young adults in the citizen service next year,

government will have to make further savings too. My right honourable
friend the Communities and Local Government Secretary has set an
example to all his colleagues in reducing the size of his department by
60% and abolishing 12 quangos. He is a model of lean government, and
has agreed to a further 10% saving in his resource budget. But we are
committing to more than £3 billion capital investment in
affordable housing and we will extend the troubled families programme
to reach 400,000 more vulnerable families who need extra support. We
are proving that it is possible to save money and create more
progressive government. That is the right
priority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000077">Here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>
is another of the Government’s priorities: helping families with
the cost of living. Because we know that times are tough, we have
helped to keep 
<?notus-xml column=742?>mortgage rates low, increased the personal allowance, cut fuel duty and
frozen council tax. That council tax freeze is due to come to an end
next April. I do not want that to happen, so I can tell the House today
that because of the savings we have made we can help families with
their bills. We will fund councils to freeze council tax for the next
two years. That is nearly £100 off the average
council tax bill for families, and brings savings on these bills for
families to £600 over this Parliament. That demonstrates our
commitment to all those who want to work hard and get
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000078">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>
is one more thing that we can do to help with the cost of living in one
part of the country. For years, Members from the south-west of England
have fought on behalf of their constituents who face exceptionally high
water bills. Nothing was done until we came to office. Now we have cut
those water bills by £50 per household every year until 2015. My
honourable friend the Member for Camborne and Redruth and many others
have campaigned to extend that rebate beyond 2015. I am happy to
confirm today that we will do that. Taking money out of the cost of
government and putting it in the pockets of families—that is
what we mean by
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000079">Local<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>
government has already taken difficult decisions to reduce staff
numbers, share services and make savings. I pay tribute to Sir Merrick
Cockell for all he has done in showing how this can be achieved. We
were told by the scaremongers that savings in local government would
decimate local services. Instead, public satisfaction with local
council services has gone up under this Government. That is because,
with our reforms, communities have more control over their own destiny.
That is because we have devolved power and responsibility to manage
budgets locally. That is because we have let councils benefit from the
tax receipts that come when the local economy grows. Today, we give
more freedom, including greater flexibility over assets, and we will
drive greater integration of local emergency services. I thank my
honourable friend the Member for Bournemouth East for his fresh
thinking in this area, which has helped to inform us.</hs_para>

are also embarking on major reforms to the way we spend money locally
through the creation of the single local growth fund that Lord
Heseltine proposed. This will be £2 billion per year, which is
at least £10 billion over the next Parliament. Local
enterprise partnerships can bid for that sum, and the details will be
set out tomorrow. Our philosophy is simple: trust people to make their
own decisions and they will usually make better decisions. But in
return for those freedoms, we have to ask local government for the kind
of sacrifices central government are making. The local government
resource budget will be reduced by 10% in 2015-16, but when all the
changes affecting local government that I will set out are taken into
account, including local income and other central government funding,
local government spending reduces by around
2%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000081">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>
set out today the block grants to the devolved Administrations. Because
we have prioritised health and schools in England, this feeds through
the Barnett formula to require resource savings of about 2% in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Scottish 
<?notus-xml column=743?>resource budget will be set at £25.7 billion, and Scotland will
benefit from new capital borrowing powers of almost £300
million. Being part of the UK means that Scotland will see its capital

about the impressive plans to improve the M4 in south Wales that my
honourable friend the Member for Vale of Glamorgan and others have been
campaigning for. The Northern Ireland resource budget will be
£9.6 billion. We have agreed to provide an additional
£31 million in 2015 to help the Police Service of Northern
Ireland tackle the threat posed by terrorism. Those police officers do

finances of the Ministry of Defence. We will continue to ensure we get
maximum value for money from what will remain, which, at over 2% of our
GDP, is one of the largest defence budgets in the world. The defence
resource budget will be maintained in cash terms at £24 billion,
while the equipment budget will be £14 billion and will grow by
1% in real terms thereafter. We will further reduce the civilian

right honourable friend the Prime Minister has rightly been clear
throughout, however, that he is not prepared to see a reduction in

pound go further. While making savings in his budget, he has managed to
expand our network of embassies in the emerging world and focus his

ever before. Now we will provide future strike prices for low carbon.
We are restarting our civil nuclear programme when other countries are
unable to continue theirs, and now we are providing guarantees for new
nuclear. Our exploitation of gas in the North Sea is already second to
none. Now we are making the tax and planning changes that will put
Britain at the forefront of exploiting shale gas. We will provide our
country with the energy of the future at a price that we can afford.
Taken together, this should support over £100 billion of private
sector investment in
energy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000099">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>

just the physical infrastructure we need to compete in the 21st
century. We need the intellectual capital, too. This country needs to
invent, pioneer and export around the world. That means backing the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which helps us to do
that. And it means taking tough decisions about what we should support.
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills has agreed to a reduction of 6% in the cost of
the department. That means that we are making savings to student
maintenance, keeping grants but not increasing them, and the cost of
the central department will also be cut further. That means that,
within the reduced budget, we can put more money into apprenticeships
and continue with the dramatic increase in support that we have
provided to exporters through UK Trade &amp;
Investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000101">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>
are not going to shift medical training and research out of that
department, because they are working well where they are. And in that
department too, we can shift from day-to-day spending to a huge 9%
increase in capital investment. That includes a huge investment in
science. Scientific discovery is first and foremost an expression of
the relentless human search to know more about our world, but it is
also an enormous strength for a modern economy. From synthetic biology
to graphene, Britain is very good at it and  we are going to
keep it that way. Today, I am committing to maintaining the resource
budget for science at 
<?notus-xml column=747?>£4.6 billion, to increasing the capital
budget for science in real terms to £1.1 billion, and to
maintaining that real increase to the end of this decade. Investment in
science is an investment in our future. So yes, from the
next generation of jet engines to cutting-edge supercomputers, we say:
keep inventing, keep delivering; this country will back you all the
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000102">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>

work force to make it happen. Because of our ongoing reforms to our
universities, they are now better funded than before. People will
remember that the reforms to higher education were bitterly contested
in the House. We remember the scaremongering about fees, and the claims
that they would destroy social mobility and put off students from
poorer communities applying. And what has happened since? We now have

education and skills of its children. Because of the tough decisions
that we have taken elsewhere, we have been able to invest in education
and accelerate school reform. When we took office, our country’s
education system was falling behind other parts of the world. Now,

have applied our reform principles in education too, freeing schools
and teachers to concentrate on teaching and turning the majority of
secondary schools into academies. In this spending round, that momentum
of reform will grow. The Department for Education’s overall
budget will increase to £53 billion and schools spending will be
protected in real terms, fulfilling the pledge we made at the beginning
of this Parliament, for all of this Parliament. We will transfer power
and money from town halls and central bureaucracy to schools, so that
more of the money for education is spent on education. So, while grants
to councils and spending on central agencies are reduced, the cash

up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000105">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>
can announce today that schools spending will be allocated in a fairer
way than ever before. School funding across the country is not equally
distributed; it is distributed on a historical basis with no logical
reason. The result is that some schools get much more than others in
the same circumstances. That is unfair and we are going to put it
right. Many MPs on both sides of the House have campaigned for that. My
honourable friend the Member for Worcester has been a particular
champion in this Parliament. Now, the lowest-funded local authorities
in this country will at last receive an increase in their per-pupil
funding as we introduce a national funding formula to ensure that no
child in any part of our country is discriminated against. We will
consult on all the details so that we get this historic reform right.
The pupil premium that we have introduced also ensures that we are fair
to children from low income backgrounds. It will be protected in real
terms, so that every poor child will have more  
<?notus-xml column=748?>cash spent on their future than ever before. The capital
budget will be set at £4.6 billion in 2015-16, with over
£21 billion of investment over the next

will invest in new school places. We will fund 20 new studio schools as
well as 20 new university technical colleges, as they are outstanding
new vocational institutions. Free schools are giving parents the
opportunity to aspire to a better education for their children. The
Opposition have said that they want no more of them, but we will not
allow such an attack on aspiration to happen. Instead, we must
accelerate the programme and bring more hope to more children. That is
why I can announce that we will fund an unprecedented increase in the
number of free schools. We will provide for 180 great new free schools

education settlement is also consistent with the third and final
principle of this spending round—fairness. It is not possible to
reduce a deficit of this size without asking all sections of the
population to play their part, but those with the broadest shoulders
should bear the greatest burden. The Treasury’s distributional
analysis shows that the top fifth of the population lose the most after
this spending round, and the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies
is unequivocal that the richest 10% have paid the most. In every year
of this Parliament, the rich will pay a greater proportion of income
tax revenues than they did in any one of 13 years under the
last Labour
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000109">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:48"></hs_TimeCode>
it comes to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, despite the fact

world’s poorest. I know that not everyone believes we should
fulfil our commitment to spend 0.7% of our national income on
development—but I do. I am proud to support a Government who are
the first in our history to meet our pledge and meet it not only this
year, but next year and the year after that. Of course, overseas
development is about more than just the Department for International
Development budget, and we comply with internationally policed rules.
The DfID budget is, however, the lion’s share, and it
will  be set at £11.1 billion in 2015-16. Even in these
tough times, the decisions we make mean we keep to our
commitments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000111">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:48"></hs_TimeCode>

institution that is the very embodiment of fairness in our society. The
NHS is much more than the Government’s priority; it is the
people’s priority. When we came to office, the health budget was
£96 billion; in 2015-16, it will be £110
billion—and capital spending 
<?notus-xml column=749?>will rise to £4.7 billion. New medical treatments and an ageing
population mean that the demand for NHS services is rising, so we have
not spared in also demanding reform and value for money in this
service. This will not insulate the health service from tough choices;
there are already 7,000 fewer managers, and the NHS will continue to
make efficiency savings. Those savings will, however, enable new
investment in mental health and funding for new treatments for cancers
such as prostate and breast cancer. Let me respond directly to the
breast cancer research campaign in which so many have taken part. We
will continue to back the charity research support fund and look into
making it easier for these organisations to benefit from gift
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000112">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:48"></hs_TimeCode>
older people do not just use the NHS; they also use the social care
system. If we are honest, they often fall between the cracks of the two
systems, being pushed from pillar to post, not getting the care they
should. None of us here would want that for our parents or
grandparents, and in a compassionate society, no one should endure it.

said in the 2010 spending review that the NHS would make available
around £1 billion a year to support the health needs of people
in social care. It worked, and saved hundreds of millions in the
process. Last year, these improvements meant almost 50,000
fewer bed days were lost to the NHS. So today, I can announce that I
will bring together a significant chunk of the health and social care
budgets. I want to make sure that everyone gets a properly joined-up
service where they will not have to worry about whether a service is
coming from the NHS or the local
council.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000114">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:43"></hs_TimeCode>

night to spend the weekend in hospital because we cannot look after
them properly in social care. By 2015-16, over £3 billion will
be spent on services that are commissioned jointly and seamlessly by
the local NHS and local councils working together. It is a huge and
historic commitment of resources to social care, tied to real reform on
the ground, to help end the scandal of older people trapped in
hospitals because they cannot get a social care bed. This will help
relieve pressures on A&amp;E, help local government to deliver on its

these are the three principles that guide the spending round: reform,
growth and fairness. Nowhere could these principles be more clearly
applied than in our approach to welfare. Two groups of people need to
be satisfied with our welfare system: those who need it who are old,
vulnerable, disabled or have lost their job, whom we as a compassionate
society want to support. Then there is a second group: the people who
pay for this welfare system who go out to work, pay their taxes and
expect it to be fair on them,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000116">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>
we have taken huge steps to reform welfare: changing working age
benefits with universal credit so that work always pays; removing child
benefit from the better off; capping benefits so that no family out of
work gets more than the average family gets in work. 
<?notus-xml column=750?>And we have been making sure that benefit payments do not rise faster
than wages. The steps we have taken will save £18 billion a

we propose to do three further welfare reforms. First, as I said in the
Budget, we are going to introduce a new welfare cap to control the
overall costs of the benefits bill. We have already capped the benefits
of individuals, and now we cap the system as a whole. Under the system
we inherited, welfare spending was put into a category called annually
managed expenditure, but the problem was that it was not managed at
all. The cost of welfare went up by a staggering 50%—even before
the crash. Our welfare cap will stop that happening again. The cap will
be set each year at the Budget for four years. It will apply from April
2015 and will reflect forecast inflation, but it will be set in cash
terms. In future, when a Government look to breach the cap because they
are failing to control welfare, the Office for Budget Responsibility
will issue a public warning. The Government will then be forced to take
action to cut welfare costs or publicly breach the cap and explain it
to
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000118">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>
will exclude a small number of the most cyclical benefits that directly
rise and fall with the unemployment rate to preserve the automatic
stabilisers: housing benefit, tax credits, disability benefits and
pensioner benefits will all be included—but the state pension
will not. I have had representations that we should include the basic
state pension in the welfare cap. That would mean that a future
Government could offset a rise in working age benefits by cutting the
pensions of older people. That penalises those who have worked hard all
their lives. Cutting pensions to pay for working age benefits is a
choice this Government are certainly not prepared to make. It is
unfair; we will not do it and we reject those representations
completely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000119">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>
new welfare cap is proof that Britain is serious about living within
its means: controlling spending, protecting the taxpayer and being
fundamentally fair. Today we are introducing a limit on the
nation’s credit card. The principles enshrined in the cap apply
to our second reform today. We will act to ensure that we stop the cost
of paying the winter fuel payments made to those who live abroad from
rising in a way that no one ever intended. EU law now says that people
living in the European Economic Area can claim winter fuel payments
from us, even if they did not get them before they left the UK. Paying
out even more money to people from all nationalities who might have
worked in this country years ago, but no longer live here is not a fair
use of the nation’s cash. So from the autumn of 2015, we will
link the winter fuel payment to a temperature test; people in hot
countries will no longer get it. It is, after all, a payment for winter
fuel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000120">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>
third welfare reform I announce today is about making sure we do
everything to help people get into work. My right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has changed the national
debate about welfare, and has comprehensively won the argument. He has
committed himself to finding a further 9.5% of savings in his
department’s running

looking for work. Only then will they receive their benefits. Thanks to

we are here today is because of this Government’s economic
failure. They have been forced back, begging for more: more cuts to the
police, more cuts in the

failed on living standards, growth and the deficit, and families and

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to put both the spending
review and the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, into context.
He said a great deal about a failed economic strategy. We inherited
one. Any of us who have worked with the management challenges of a
significant budget would recognise that in 2010, when this Government
came into power, spending was out of control. This spending round
represents a continuing exercise in getting our public finances back
into shape. This Government and the officials working in this area
should absolutely be commended. They laid out a very clear plan in 2010
to deliver £80 billion of savings through to 2014-15. Sixty-five
per cent of that—just over £50 billion—has already
been delivered and the rest is on target. Therefore, the purpose of
this spending round is to make a further £11.5 billion of
savings, which have been thoughtfully and effectively made based on the
criteria, as the noble Lord pointed out, of reform, growth and
fairness. Within that £11.5 billion of savings, we have of
course made some extremely tough choices. There are no easy choices in
this current environment. We have protected the priorities that we
promised and laid out at the election—those relating to health,
schools and overseas aid.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062661000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000137"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>The
principles underlying how we have dealt with each department have
revolved around making sure that the departments work and operate on a
highly efficient basis with the right number of people, with the right
degree of automation, with the right degree of procurement, and with
commercial skills being brought to the purchasing decisions they make
so that we can get our costs down and operate efficiently. That is true
right across the departments and it is where those savings have come
from<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:50:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of reform. Probably the most significant reform laid out in this
programme is that we are establishing a new £3.8 billion health
and social care pot to be shared between the National Health Service
and local authorities to make sure that the services between hospital
and the home are much better delivered and so that we can take care of
people who need that help. We do not want the situation where somebody
is delivered into a hospital bed on a Friday night because there is
nowhere else for them to go and they are sent home again on a Monday
because we cannot take care of them over the weekend. That is 
<?notus-xml column=755?>the kind of service reform that we have been talking
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>, and that

us? It will mean that by 2015-16 we will be well down the path of
taking public expenditure as a proportion of total expenditure back to
a sensible level. It should be back to just over 43% from the 30-year
high of 47% or 48% in 2009. By the end of our consolidation in 2017-18,
it will be back to 40%. That is the repair that this Government have
had to undertake because of the spending profligacy that took place

by a third as a percentage of GDP and is set to continue falling to
below the pre-crisis level by the end of this Parliament. Most
interestingly, the biggest saving that we have made is on our debt
interest costs because we have got borrowing under control. Those costs
are £9 billion lower than was forecast in the Budget of 2011.
For me, that is probably the most telling statistic. Of course, we
introduced savings on welfare bills through the Autumn Statement

the situation with respect to capital spend and perhaps I may exchange
some statistics. Effectively, through each of the fiscal events, the

it by increasing borrowing, and that is absolutely the right strategy
to pursue. The sum involved is £10 billion over this

</B><B>Deighton</B><B>:</B></Member> I absolutely share the noble
Lord’s experience that economic forecasting is a hazardous art
form. However, if done thoughtfully, it gives us the basis for creating
a long-term plan against which we can make the best decisions possible,
given the information we have. One of the things that I have been
working on with the Chancellor is to take a longer-term perspective,
particularly of our capital budget, and to have that budget as a
foundation for our long-term fiscal management rather than being the
bit that gets added on at the end. That is what results in the stop-go
approach to investment which has plagued us for many years. For me,
what it rather reflects is a shift in priorities to deal with the
things for which you need to create a longer-term planning horizon, so
that we can get the investment side of what we are doing sorted out
over the right kind of
horizon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000170"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Stoddart of Swindon" PimsId="4150" UID="13062661000390" xid="1452" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000390"><B>Lord

to a point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, about quantitative
easing, or the printing of money, there is of course the fact that the
Government have saved £9 billion because of low
interest charges. Those savings have been made at the expense of
interest rates on savings, particularly those on pensions. Pensioners
have been very badly hit because their expectations, and indeed their
pensions, have been lowered for the future. Is it not a shame that some
of the most vulnerable people in our society, such as the pensioners,
have been made very much poorer in order to finance government
spending, which is still far too
high?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000171"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="13062661000391" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000391">Lord

of lower interest rates is lower returns to savers. That absolutely

policy, and indeed the monetary policy of every major nation. One

which this Government have striven to protect, looking at the

MacGregor of Pulham Market:</Member></B> My Lords, we launched our
inquiry in February 2012, when it seemed likely that there would be a
referendum on independence in Scotland in autumn 2014. Since then this
has, of course, been confirmed. We did so because we were concerned
that, on what was widely recognised as an 
<?notus-xml column=762?>issue of momentous consequences not only for the people of Scotland but
for the rest of the UK, it was vital that such a vote should be based
not only on sentiment and patriotic fervour but on a full understanding
of all the implications. At that time, these consequences had simply
not been fully analysed, let alone widely exposed to public debate. We
did not make the case for or against independence. We did not go into
the constitutional or legal issues on the referendum process. We
focused entirely on the economic implications, primarily for Scotland,
but which are just as important for the rest of the UK as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000180">The need
for a properly informed debate before the referendum seemed to us to be
all the greater as it became clear that if there were a yes vote for
independence, it would probably take years to separate the Scottish
economy from the rest of the UK and for it to negotiate entry into the
EU as a new state. This would cause great economic uncertainty and
possibly damage to Scottish businesses in the mean time. In our view,
all the key issues and consequences needed to be fully explored
beforehand, and not left to negotiations
afterwards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000181">We
heard from 44 witnesses in all, including British and Scottish
Ministers, academics, trade unions and local authorities, with a wide
range of opinions on business, finance and politics. We heard evidence
in Glasgow and Edinburgh, a first for the committee. One disappointment
was that some Scottish companies from which we would have liked to have
taken evidence declined to do so. One witness described there being a
possible “climate of fear”, with witnesses having fears
about the impact on their business of speaking out. Another
disappointment was the First Minister’s declining to give
evidence himself before the Committee, much as we pressed him to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000182">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>

our inquiry progressed, it helped to shine increasing light on the
economic implications of a yes vote and what they might entail. As we
reached the drafting stage of our report, the British and Scottish
Governments have each started to publish their own analyses of the
various economic implications, which we warmly welcome. Much more needs
to be done, however, if the Scottish voters are to make a fully
informed choice in October 2014, and the wider British
public—and I do mean the wider British public—are to
understand the implications for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:20:39"></hs_TimeCode>. As the UK

turn to some of the main issues and, given the time available, can only
highlight the key ones. Some are already much clearer than when we
embarked on 
<?notus-xml column=763?>our report. For example, it became apparent during our inquiry, not
least because of the exchanges that we had with the President of
EU Commission, President Barroso, and then of the
UK Government’s own analysis, that in the event of a yes vote
Scotland would become an entirely new state and that the continuing UK
would retain the rights and obligations of the UK as it currently
stands. This is important particularly in the context of the EU, but,
for Scotland, it would also apply to many other international bodies
and treaties. Indeed, it was during our visit to Scotland that the
Scottish Government’s claim to have legal advice to the contrary
was blown

the complexities in particular of negotiations with the EU and the need
for unanimity of all member states in the EU in accepting a new member,
it must be extremely unlikely that these negotiations would be
completed by the spring of 2016, as some hope, and there is no
certainty of outcome. Meanwhile, there would among other things be
great uncertainty for Scottish companies operating internationally, for
inward investment to Scotland and for other sectors of the Scottish
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:22:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000186">One
particular impact is on international trade. Most of our business
witnesses spoke of the importance of being within the EU. One
particular advantage was stressed by some chief executives of
Scottish-based international companies, who spoke of the benefits of
international trading deals done by the EU for their companies. The
significance of this is underlined by the launch of the negotiations
for an EU-US trade agreement at the recent G8

that it is likely that economic and fiscal plans of a separate Scottish

see how the UK Government could extend central banking services to an

its tax and spending policies. Crucially, we argued that this, along
with the continued use of sterling by an independent Scotland in
monetary

turn now to the other paper that the UK Government have so far
produced, published last month, on financial services and banking. Time
prevents me from going into detail—others may wish to do
so—but, again, we are in broad agreement. We agree on the
significance of Scotland’s financial sector to its economy and
the fact that 90% of its customers are located in the rest of the UK;
on the need for a separate Scottish financial regulator for an
independent Scotland, adding to compliance costs and complexity for
Scottish financial institutions; and on the fact that the assets of the
whole UK banking sector, including Scotland’s banks, are around
492% of total UK GDP whereas, by contrast, Scottish banks would have
assets totalling around 1,254% of an independent Scotland’s GDP,

of these are key considerations for the Scottish electorate. As the

North Sea oil and gas, there is a broad equivalence between
Scotland’s gain on North Sea oil revenues and what it would lose
from abolition of the Barnett formula. I notice that the noble Lord,
Lord Barnett, is in his place, and this is interesting for many of us
in your Lordships’ House who have been arguing, one way or
another, that the Barnett formula needs to be resolved in the near
future. An independent Scotland, curiously, would resolve the question,
although we would still have to worry about it if the independent vote
did not say yes. However, that is not an answer to the Scottish issues.
One of our witnesses, Professor McCrone, said that, on the expected
geographical division, which we in our committee accept, about 90% of
revenues would accrue to an independent Scotland. On the other hand,
there is substantial volatility in oil prices, uncertainty over future
oil revenues and the need to deal with substantial North Sea oil
decommissioning costs. It is no long-term

separate financial services compensation scheme for Scottish financial
institutions. An independent Scotland will need to handle the difficult
questions of the ensuing public sector debate as a consequence of
looking at the division of assets and liabilities, with volatile tax
revenue, the loss of risk-sharing with the rest of the UK and no record

compelling evidence to our committee. The UK Government’s
position is that it is for the Scottish Government to set out for the
Scottish people how the defence of an independent Scotland would be
arranged and, for the rest of the UK, the UK Government cannot
prenegotiate the deals of independence ahead of the referendum. We
certainly recognise the security aspects and are clear that any
post-referendum negotiation would be huge, lengthy and complex on
defence issues. We are also clear that the defence implications, not

substantial contingency planning is already under way in the Ministry
of Defence. Others may wish to comment on defence in greater detail

regard this as a critical point. The debate is becoming much clearer
and better informed, particularly since we took evidence and completed
our report. The UK Government have produced very helpful and detailed
analyses of some key issues and we look forward to more. However, there
is still this issue about not discussing the negotiations in advance of
the referendum. One argument has been that that should wait until after
the negotiations, but one problem is that could make it very easy for
many of the people intending to vote in the referendum to vote
“yes”, on the assumption that all the negotiations would
take place afterwards and that there would then be a second vote

address this issue of the red lines and they should undertake to do so
well before the referendum. That is the upshot of our report. There is
some very helpful analysis in it and it will continue to stand the test
of time as we get towards the end of the negotiations. It is on the

McFall of Alcluith:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, in this debate. I am open to
intervention if need be on that issue. I thank him for his
chairmanship. Allied to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord
Steel, the committee deliberately visited both Edinburgh and Glasgow,
and spoke to the leaders of every party, including the former
Chancellor, to the leader of Glasgow City Council and to business
people. The only person missing was the First Minister. He would not
come along to engage in the debate. That was an omission from the
Scottish Government on this very important
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000206">The
debate in Scotland will centre around two themes: identity and
economics. On the issue of identity, there is an assumption that if one
feels intensely Scottish one will vote for independence. The paradox is
that the debate in Scotland will not be about how Scottish one feels
but how British the people of Scotland still regard themselves. That is
according to the Scottish Social Attitudes survey. So it is about the
degree to which people in Scotland still share some sense of
fellow-feeling with those living elsewhere in the United Kingdom. That
will be central to the choice that is made. It is important that we
highlight that in the debate in this Chamber today. It will come down
to whether Scots feel that they can assert their Scottishness by
parting with the unionist part of their
soul.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000207">Michael

conclusion on identity is that both sides need to engage. If this is

Lord to read paragraph 9 of that letter, because more pressure needs to

has characterised the debate in Scotland and elsewhere to date is the
lack of good information. That is why it was wise of the Economic
Affairs Committee, under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord
MacGregor, to start this debate. At the beginning, there was a sparsity
of information, indeed a reluctance to talk, on the part of business.
Rupert Soames, the chief executive of Aggreko, which was based in my
former constituency and started life as a very small company—a
two-man business—and is now a FTSE 100 company, built
his new headquarters in Dumbarton. It was the last thing he did before
I stood down from the House of Commons. He told the Committee that if
business opens its mouth, “bile and ire” rains down on
people, the language is intemperate and business people feel that there
are better things to do than be hauled over the
coals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000211">The
situation is now changing, and one thing that we have to remember is
that the tone of the debate will matter greatly. Michael Ignatieff said
that the referendum in Quebec produced fracture and division. We want
to minimise that, because we have to live with each other after this
referendum. That tone is still very important, but the uncertainty
remains and I am glad to see that the CBI, the Scottish Council for
Development and Industry and universities have been participating in
this debate in asking the
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000212">Along
with lots of others, I have no doubt that if Scotland decides to become
a politically independent nation, it can do that, but the crucial
question is how much economic independence Scotland will achieve. Jim
Sillars, a former leader of the SNP, says, “Not very
much”. That is why he rejects the proposals by the present SNP
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:44:07"></hs_TimeCode>.

make.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062661000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0001.htm#13062661000213">Over the
past 25 years, the Scottish National Party has adopted the stance of
supporting an independent Scottish pound, then the euro and now the

is a millstone around the Scottish neck. That is a most inauspicious
start to a monetary union between Scotland and the rest of the United
Kingdom. If we go ahead with this, it will raise the most complex
problems of cross-border monetary policy, taxpayer exposure and
multiple financial regulators. We have only to remember the crisis in
the financial services in Scotland in 2009, when both our major banks,
RBS and the Bank of Scotland, were bailed out to the tune of 211% of

monetary union can come about only on terms agreed by the UK

area that affects us is the issue of the single market in both domestic
and European terms. If the integrity of the domestic single market has
to be maintained, a lot of thought must go into the relationship
between manufacturing and the financial sector on both sides of the
border. I mentioned Aggreko. The chairman of Aggreko said that for his
FTSE 100 company, it would impose a permanent layer of additional
complexity, with headquarters and manufacturing in Scotland and listing
elsewhere. We received a lot of evidence from the financial services
community, particularly in Edinburgh, on that point, because 96% of its
financial products are sold elsewhere in the United Kingdom, with 4%

issue of the single market in Europe will also matter. I know that the
noble Lord, Lord Kerr, has written extensively on the subject and made
very wise comments on it. We have to assume that there will be a smooth
entry, but there are big question marks over whether there will be.
That smooth entry might provide some reassurance, but it will not
provide much if the EU imposes tougher membership conditions relative
to those of the rest of the United Kingdom in, say, financial
regulation and employment law. The question that that sparks is: will
that weaken Scottish competitiveness with the rest of the United
Kingdom?</hs_para>

issues that raise problems that cannot be foreseen, although their
outcome can be discussed, are the effect of independence on the
financial services industry, which is of such importance to Scotland.

issue that has been addressed by the committee, which is the attitude
to currency. We have heard, even from those who are not necessarily
favourably disposed towards the European Union, that the eurozone needs
to have greater regulatory authority, fiscal uniformity and acceptance
of centralisation of the management of the economy. That has some
lessons for those who are thinking in terms of a separation of Scotland
from the United Kingdom. I do not see how the First Minister can
proclaim his desire to be part of the United Kingdom currency and have
some kind of currency union without accepting that we will have to have
monetary policy controlled by the Bank of England. The report raises
the question of whether the Bank of England could readily accept that
role or a regulatory role if it does not have control over the
direction of the economy and taxation. Frankly, these questions are not
answerable in terms of the prediction of policy, but they are important
issues that ought to be discussed by those who are considering what the
future might bring.</hs_para>

We have to consider carefully how to get these messages across so that

criticism of the UK Government’s position, in reality we did not
call for or indeed suggest detailed pre-referendum negotiations. We
asked both the United Kingdom Government and the Scottish Government to

have raised. By so doing, it was our wish to inform the people of
Scotland and provide for them proper understanding of both the probable

for a minute or two on two topics: business and the economy, and
defence-related jobs. As the noble Lord, Lord McFall, mentioned, CBI
Scotland remains greatly concerned with matters that it brought forward

of a hard border between the nations, to the overseas markets in which
Scottish businesses will receive consular support and how; Royal Mail,
or its Scottish successor, continuing to be subject to the universal
service obligation; and the transitional arrangements that are
envisaged for diplomatic representation at the European Union prior to
entry, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and so on. Its last
paper lists many issues which exercised the membership. I think some
noble Lords said that 60% were very unsure. All of these are, of
course, exacerbated in this rather infamous phrase now “the
climate of fear” that is clearly engendered—a phrase

impression that your Lordships’ committee gained of a conspiracy

thankfully, four most notable exceptions which helped to inform our

the business enterprise of Scotland. They need and we—the rest
of the United Kingdom—need, good solid information. I say again

should remember how that happened. It came into being because of a
financial crisis: something like a quarter of the money in circulation
had been invested in the Darien scheme and the Scottish economy was no
longer able to sustain that level of financial shock. The Scottish
economy could not get access to the single market that was England and
her Commonwealth. It was a trade deal. From the English point of view,
it was a way of ensuring the succession of the Protestant monarchy,
which was a matter of some controversy and of great national security
because of the Jacobites.</hs_para>

are the two matters that come out of this report as being threatened
absolutely by the break-up of the United Kingdom now—from
Scotland’s point of view, not England’s. The size of the
Scottish economy relative to the English one makes it less important
for England. Why would Scotland want to give up access to a single
market—the rest of the United Kingdom—where most of its
goods and services are sold? Why would it, after what we have been
through since 2008, wish to remove itself from the security of the Bank
of England, the Treasury and a larger country? Why on earth would it
want to become so dependent on the revenue from North Sea oil, which,
as the report points out, is a very substantial part of the revenue for
Scotland as an independent nation, whereas as part of the United
Kingdom it is a smaller part and therefore less vulnerable to
fluctuations in the oil price? If that sounds like an academic

They are refusing to say what the levels of stamp duty will be until

will know that stamp duty on houses up to a threshold of
£250,000 is 1% in the United Kingdom. In the consultation paper,
the Scottish Government propose, as an example, that stamp duty should
increase to 7.5% on any amount over £180,000 and 9.5% on
properties worth more than £250,000. That is the first effect of
these tax-raising powers. To say that an independent Scotland, with the

question with no certain answer. The committee’s report
identifies and sets out a number of crucial long-term issues, such as
the choice of currency, the regulatory framework and the fiscal
position and a range of transitional challenges. However, in the
absence of detailed negotiations between the Governments in London and
Scotland or a clear statement on red lines by both Governments, the
outcome on all these matters remains, sadly, uncertain, which is far

that they do not know enough to take a view on the implications of
independence for their businesses. Both Governments need to heed the

be more than a noisy beauty parade. A position paper setting out the UK

witnesses were in general agreement that, assuming that the split of
assets and liabilities was in line with its share of the population and
that 90% of oil and gas revenues accrued to Scotland, an independent
Scotland would, at the outset, take its place alongside countries of a
similar size, such as Denmark and Finland, as a prosperous, stand-alone
country. To reach that position, however, some very difficult
challenges must be addressed both during the transition and in the
longer term. Based on 2012 figures, Scotland would assume a public
sector debt of £93 billion, rising to £185 billion when
pension liabilities, PFI liabilities and other liabilities are
included. This is equivalent to 123% of GDP. Transferring the debt to
Scotland in today’s challenging sovereign debt markets would be
complex and fraught with enormous difficulty. There is also the
continuing need to finance the annual fiscal deficit of some £18
billion. The Scottish Government must set out their detailed plans to

unstable whereas transfers under the Barnett formula are relatively
secured. Professor Kemp pointed out that oil and gas tax receipts were
vulnerable not only to prices and depletion but to the gearing effect
of price and investment levels

uncertainty of income stands in contrast to the certainty of
expenditure. Scotland, with free care and free tuition, already bestows
a generous level of expenditure on its citizens—a generosity
which will be compounded by having a faster rise than the rest of the
UK in the share of over-65 year-olds relative to the workforce. The
interplay of these factors leads to a higher risk of serious fiscal
imbalance. What upsides does an independent Scottish economy have to
offer to compete with these downside risks? Will the Scottish economy
perform better if there is a greater degree of autonomy? First Minister
Salmond and Mr Swinney believe so. Scotland, they say, would not have
followed the Chancellor’s policy of cutting back on public
investment and infrastructure and would have had the flexibility,
subject to convincing the bond markets of course, to increase
investment allowances to promote private sector investment and achieve
a rebalancing of the economy.</hs_para>

regions. He cited many examples of successful local and regional growth

need to address the concerns of Scottish business. Uncertainty is no
friend of business or inward investors. The refusal of many Scottish
businesses to give evidence was indeed disappointing. Those companies

referendum might have handed a buttress to the SNP campaign for
independence. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton was clear about the
importance of the single market to Scotland’s important
financial services sector. An ebullient Rupert Soames, CEO of Aggreko,
who has been referred to, pointed out that although his HQ was in
Scotland less than 10% of its business was there, and that if Aggreko
is to continue to thrive it needs a single market and the benefit of an
EU trade agreement. Mr Soames went on to say that the beneficial impact

about the plans to replace those jobs and redeploy the skills. Other

manufacturing personnel could amount to an additional 30,000. We had
the benefit of the noble

that UK government support for RBS amounted to more than 200% of

his reply to the Committee's report, if Scotland were to separate from

create additional difficulties for financial services firms and
increase costs for households and businesses in areas such as pensions,
ISAs and insurance. It could also mean that consumers living in

spending per head in Scotland is higher than in the UK overall. It is
not clear why it should be, although one understandable factor is
geographical size—and then, of course, there is the Barnett
formula. In 2011-12, spending in Scotland was 11% higher than in the UK
overall. If Scotland became independent, that level of public spending
as a share of the UK’s budget would not continue. As we have
heard, oil revenues might make up the difference, but they could be
uncertain and would fluctuate. The best estimates are that the Scottish
sector would receive net tax revenues from oil production of between
£5 billion and 
<?notus-xml column=782?>£10 billion a year. The difference in revenue between years could
of course be substantial. If the division of the physical assets was on
a geographical basis, 90% of oil reserves would be in Scotland and,
broadly speaking, the tax gain would make up the loss of the Barnett
formula, although people would need to be
clear—again, as we have heard—about the
consequences of decommissioning costs. Overall, it would seem that in
the past five years the average annual tax revenue from oil and gas has

will follow on from what the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said,
right at the end. Independence is a misnomer for what is proposed.
There is no way that Scotland is going to become an independent
country. It could become a separate country and exist as one—
although to what extent that is possible and how successful it would be
is not yet known—but it would certainly not become an
independent country. If it wants a sterling area, it will be subject to
the Bank of England, and if it is to have its own currency—which
I will come on to—and wants to join Europe, it will be subject
to all the rules and regulations of Europe. Even if it stays out of
Europe, it will be in the same position as Norway, with most of its
laws having to abide by those decided in Europe, over which it would

certainly be no velvet divorce—it will be a very nasty

the latest opinion polls. I have detected a feeling that separation is
better than the status quo, but they do not know what separation is. At
a time when the SNP has made a number of changes of position on
fundamental issues as it struggles to find a coherent set of positions

us please have some answers from the Government. What will be the

Can my noble and learned friend give a definitive statement that there

friend Mr Osborne, has hinted that he does not think it is in the
interests of either Scotland or the UK, but there needs to be a
stronger statement than that. Mr Salmond has, on a number of occasions,
made his demand for a sterling area a prerequisite for 
<?notus-xml column=784?>a settlement on the disposition of assets and liabilities. We need to be
absolutely clear whether the Government will negotiate on a sterling

billion, based on current figures, if you add pensions and
other such costs. Indeed, the public sector debt will increase, so the
figure will be somewhere between £185 billion and £213
billion, in round figures. Whatever the figure, it is a colossal sum of

going to vote on separation in September next year, need to know that

One of the arguments for independence is that it will of itself set

turn to the use of campaign metaphors. The “no” campaign
would have us use the divorce analogy while “yes”
campaigners use the metaphor of the family growing up and going their
own ways. Noble Lords will generally be familiar with the risks of
entering into a marriage and of selecting a career. Neither can
political independence be risk free. There seems to be a presumption in
the report that the SNP will form the Scottish Government in 2016. I
suspect that Labour may well form the Scottish Government, somewhat

Scotland needs to emerge from its 300-year constitutional sleep.
Clearly, the limited powers granted in 1998 were the early stages of
that awakening. Our neighbour and comparator country, Norway, emerged
in 1905 from a 400-year constitutional sleep. After becoming one of the
poorest countries in western Europe, look at it now. The key is that it
achieved democracy before it obtained wealth. It decided in 1990 to set
up a sovereign wealth fund. The United Kingdom decided not to do so,
thereby depriving Scotland of any choice in the matter. I am confident
that there will be more constitutional developments in favour of
Scottish autonomy irrespective of the actual referendum result. After
all, the status quo is not on offer as the Scotland Act 2012 will be
implemented between now and 2016. There must be more such developments
because a sustainable, permanent settlement is needed. Economics,
though significant, must follow the new

cynical and thought that I would add the comments of the famed
Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Colbert, who said that the art of taxation was
to pluck the feathers from the goose until it either does not squeal or
you get away with it. Colbert, who lived from 1619 to 1683, was chief
minister of Louis XIV. He finished that aspect of his life

Whether the individuals total 4,000 or 2,500 I could not be

the amount of income tax they paid was £2.1 billion. That seems
a fair amount. Simple arithmetic shows what is being paid by these
individuals. The Scottish variable rate has been mentioned and is part
of the calculations referred to by my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie.
If this system is put into effect it will mean that each and every
taxpayer in Scotland may well have to fill in not one, but two tax
returns. The Scottish variable rate, as presented now, will have
differing rates and allowances.

Scotland in 1962 and earned and unearned income. Earned income is
spelled out in the Scottish variable rate in the Scotland Act and

unjust to my noble friend Lord Forsyth, but he indicated that one of
the many thoughts he had was that every pensioner south of the border
would scuttle north of the border because their pensions and other
non-earned income would not be subject to the Scottish variable rate. I

looking at the fashion in Kirriemuir on a winter day. However, I am
immensely grateful to my noble and learned friend, who has given so
much help so far. Will he now confirm to me that pensions will be part

West of Spithead:</Member></B> My Lords, to my mind the separation of
Scotland would diminish the defence and security of all of us. The SNP
statements on defence just do not stack up. The complexity and cost of
establishing a new Ministry of Defence, all of the administrative
functions and intelligence, logistics, medical support, training and
procurement organisations are absolutely huge. Just looking at the
intelligence world, for example, would a separate Scotland want a GCHQ
equivalent? Having worked in that world for a time, I can assure your
Lordships that this is hugely difficult to create and hugely expensive.
Would it have an SIS? Again, there are huge complexities in doing
something like that. Would Scotland be part of the Five Eyes
arrangement? I have severe doubts, because the Americans would not be
at all happy to have a country in the Five Eyes which has said the sort
of things about nuclear that the SNP has said. Bearing in mind all of
those costs and with the money that, by any calculation, one could see
being available for defence in a separate Scotland, the front line
would be dramatically smaller than the figures that the SNP has talked

talk of Denmark as a comparator is nonsense. Denmark at one stage had a
very large military and over many, many, many years has reduced it, so
the infrastructure was all there and all those things were there. That

forces available. There would be massive job losses, to my mind, at
Faslane, 
<?notus-xml column=791?>where jobs would be down from about 8,500 to, at a
maximum, about 500 if you consider the force level that Scotland will
have in terms of ships. I believe that there will be massive job losses

there will be no money, or tiny amounts, for procurement in Scotland.

what my noble friend Lord Caithness said about the First Minister

supported the euro. We were told that sterling was a millstone around
Scotland’s neck, but then it supported sterling, either by a

to see that the eurozone cannot exactly be described as dream currency

Rogart said. It was mentioned too by the noble Lord, Lord Hollick, who

important industry for Scotland is oil and gas. My noble friend Lord
Shipley and the noble Lords, Lord Lipsey and Lord Hollick, referred to
this. They made the point that wherever this valuable resource is, the
revenues are volatile and in long-term decline. The UK has a broad and
diverse enough economy to be able to absorb this volatility, but it
would loom larger in a Scottish economy that would be less able to
absorb it. My noble friend Lord Forsyth asserted that the First
Minister would clearly want the United Kingdom to bear the
decommissioning costs and quoted the Minister who, when asked on 25
April last year whether Scotland would take these costs on, said that
the answer was yes. That contrasted with what his Energy Minister,
Fergus Ewing, said on 17 April, which was that the UK had a moral and
certainly a legal obligation to be responsible for the decommissioning
of these rigs. Within a period of 10 days, there had been a
diametrically conflicting view of what the position would be on these
costs. It is incumbent on the Scottish Government to be a bit more
direct in giving answers to these

interrupting my noble and learned friend again, but is it not a matter
of choice because the decommissioning costs are given by tax relief on
the tax revenues? If the oil becomes part of Scotland’s assets,
it is not a matter of choice whether it meets the decommissioning
costs; they would have to be met because they would be part of the tax
regime. Otherwise, it would be too expensive to take the oil out of the
ground, in which case the revenue would be
zero.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062681000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062681000041"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="13062681000093" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062681000093">Lord

Lords, including my noble friend Lord Caithness and the noble Lord,
Lord Hollick, mentioned the assets and liabilities. Clearly the
division of liabilities and assets would be a significant part of any
negotiations to create a new state. In the case of Scotland and the
rest of the United Kingdom, it would have to be settled by negotiation.
Unpicking the 
<?notus-xml column=797?>United Kingdom’s institutional and governmental infrastructure
framework would be a huge task, and it is impossible to say with
confidence what the outcome would be. Although there are some general
principles of international law that could impact upon this matter,
there is no clear set of rules in international practice about the
precise allocation of national debt in these circumstances, but there
would be an expectation that an independent Scottish state would take
on an equitable share of the UK’s national debt. How an
equitable share would be calculated is open to question, although I
think the Finance Secretary Mr John Swinney accepted that there would
be that obligation when he gave evidence to your Lordships’
committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062681000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062681000043">Europe
and Scotland’s place in Europe also featured in the report and
in our debate. Again, we know that if Scotland leaves this union, the
rest of the United Kingdom would be a continuator state. That was set
out very clearly in the first Scotland analysis paper that we produced.
The United Kingdom as a continuing state would maintain the same set of
terms and conditions, rights and responsibilities that we enjoy today
in Europe, NATO and the G8. Scotland would be a new state and would
have to seek to join all those international bodies. That is a fact
that the Scottish Government initially sought to deny. With regard to
Europe, they said it would be seamless, automatic membership. Now, in
the face of the evidence, they publicly accept that they would have to
negotiate their way in. We could debate this. There are differing views
about how that negotiation would take place, but there can be no doubt
that it would be a very difficult negotiation. As the noble Lord, Lord
McFall, pointed out, there would be no guarantee of an exemption from
euro membership, or from Schengen, as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr of
Kinlochard, stated. My noble friend Lord Caithness asked about the
share of the rebate. It is impossible to say what the share of the
rebate would be or whether the European Union would even grant any
rebate to the Scottish Government. It would be a matter of negotiation
not with the United Kingdom Government, although as a member state we
would have a part to play in it but, after the accession of Croatia
next week, with 27 other Governments, and there is no guarantee about
the outcome of such negotiations.</hs_para>

Perhaps more fundamentally than that, I belong to a Government who
represent the whole of the United Kingdom. If we were to have that kind
of pre-negotiation, I suspect it would not be possible for my right
honourable friend the Chief Secretary to be part of it because, in the
event of independence, he would have a different standpoint. He is a
Scot. You would then have part of the United Kingdom Government perhaps
debating against another part. My noble friend Lord Caithness might
expect me, as someone who is 
<?notus-xml column=799?>resident in Orkney, to have an interest in that too, and I might not be
able to take part either. I cannot think of anything that would better
suit the argument of those who want to break up the United Kingdom than
that those who want to maintain the United Kingdom spend the next 15
months arguing with each other about what the negotiating position
would be. This Government believe in a United Kingdom. If there are
negotiations post a referendum, someone will need to represent the
interests of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but that cannot
happen before the referendum. We believe in the integrity of the United

this issue today, I was reflecting on the fact that we set up our
committee in February 2012. We are now halfway towards the vote, and so
many of the issues that we debated today are clearly not understood by
the electorate outside in either Scotland or England in the way that we
have understood them today. I take comfort from the fact that our
report has identified very nearly all the key economic issues on which
Scottish voters will have to make up their minds before—or
when—they vote. I do not yet take comfort from the fact that,
certainly among English voters, they still do not realise that there
are many issues that will have great implications for them in terms of
a Scottish vote. I will come back to that in a moment. I also do not
take comfort in the fact that so much more effort still needs to be

from the UK Government. These are all good issues. I slightly differ
from him in that I think that English electors need to be made much
more aware of the implications for them, and ensure that the UK
Government protect them from the serious consequences in relation to
defence, currency and the many other issues that we have identified
today. That awareness does not yet exist among people in the rest of
the UK. I understand his point about not entering into
pre-negotiations, but there is a difference between that and
identifying the issues that will be crucial for the rest of the UK if
the Scots vote for independence. That is what I and my committee are

before they vote. As I said, my noble friend’s wind-up speech

Cope of Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, I was delighted to be
appointed to this Select Committee and honoured to chair it. I have
long thought and argued that SMEs—small and medium-sized
enterprises—are the single most important variable in whether
our economy is successful, and that the Government have a duty to do
what they can to help them
succeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062681000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062681000056">Economists
argue, particularly on days like today, about what the Chancellor of
the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England should do. That
is interesting but not the real clue to whether our grandchildren will
live in prosperous times. I am an accountant and have seen some
companies falter and others flourish because of the enterprise,
long-sighted decisions and flair of the people who run them. These
days, it is no easy task to run an SME at a sustained 
<?notus-xml column=801?>profit. Regulations of every kind stand around you to prevent you doing
the wrong thing. However, a positive attitude matters—spotting
the opportunities and making the right decisions on time. If we can get
the climate for SMEs right, if our entrepreneurs are motivated and
successful and if sufficient of our young people have the optimism to
take responsibility for their own future and for employing others, we
will prosper as a nation. If we value our SMEs, we lay the foundations
of the future. In particular, if our SMEs can export, we can thrive in
world markets and pay our way in a vastly changing
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062681000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062681000057">Our
committee was set up to see if government could help more. The
initiative came from my noble friend Lord Popat, and we are grateful to
him for that. He served on our committee until he was—as one can
see—rightly appointed to the Government. The noble Lord, Lord
Mitchell, was also promoted to the opposition Front Bench from among
our ranks. The committee members have proved to have huge practical
experience in running businesses of very varied kinds. Two of our

I found serving on the committee most encouraging. Wherever we
went—we travelled widely across the UK and a bit in Europe,
too—we met vigorous businesses, many of which were taking
advantage of the Government’s various programmes of assistance
and finding them valuable. In south Wales, Concrete Canvas impregnates
fabric with cement so that one can line a ditch or erect a hut with
fabric that turns into concrete when you wet it. It is selling that all
over the place, including to the MoD for use in Afghanistan. Viv Parry
from Leeds opened up a market in New York for her Exquisite Handmade
Cakes, although she was allowed to take over only a sample of the tin
she sells them in, not the cakes. Noble Lords will understand that they
are food products. Who would have thought a few years ago that a
combination of plasticine models and sheer wit would give rise to
Aardman Animations, which we met in Bristol and which sells all over
the world, including in China? We give other examples in our report. We
had to pick only a few and I have picked those, which is unfair.
However, I wished to give some examples.</hs_para>

of ways in which UK Trade &amp; Investment—UKTI—and other
government agencies help SMEs, both directly and, most importantly,
through local enterprise partnerships, chambers of commerce and so on.
Our message to SMEs, if there is a single message, is, “If you
have a problem, share it. Don’t be frightened of the undoubted
complexities of exporting. Take them on and get advice”. Our
main criticism of UKTI was not the services it delivers but the fact
that it is too little known and therefore too little used. In the case
of UK Export Finance, the very low take-up of its programmes shocked
us, and very little use is made in the United Kingdom of the European
Investment Bank facilities to support SMEs.</hs_para>

the ability of SMEs to borrow from them. We also heard of other options
for funding, which are available and growing. The Government’s
agencies, including UKEF, the coming business bank, Funding for Lending

problem. We shall see in the next few years how successful this proves

be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062681000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062681000061">In the
time available I will mention briefly three of the other specific areas
that concerned us: languages, intellectual property and the Bribery
Act. Languages are important in exporting. As we all know, English is
very widely spoken in the world and for that reason we are not good at
speaking other languages. Some businesses in very expert sectors said
that they needed no other language. Clearly, however, in most sectors
people prefer to buy from someone who speaks their own language. We
drew attention in our report to the fact that these days the United
Kingdom has a high degree of linguistic diversity as a result of
immigration. We should use that fact more to help exports. I also think
that more careful thought about how languages are taught could prove
valuable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:59:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

protection is ever more important as the world gets smaller. The
Government have been negotiating hard internationally and stepping up

vagueness of the Bribery Act 2010 also proved a controversial issue. In
the two years since it came into force, there have been no
prosecutions, but it has caused constant worry to exporters about just
what is permissible. We want more clarity about all this and suggested
post-legislative scrutiny to find out what the authorities and others
concerned think the Act means and promulgate it more
widely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government’s attitude, shared, it seems, by the House of Commons
Justice Committee, is that until the courts have pronounced, there is
no value in having post-legislative scrutiny. In other words, we have
to wait until some particular businessmen are selected to spend months
and no doubt much money being dragged through the courts over some
practice deemed doubtful in this country, but normal in the country in
which they were trying to sell. Meanwhile, everyone concerned becomes
thoroughly inhibited when selling in some markets by comparison with
their
competitors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:01:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062681000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062681000064">It
has been an interesting time for me and I want to thank all my

The noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, did the same, when she, too, suffered
in the snow and ice. We had an excellent adviser in Professor Robert
Blackburn of Kingston University, one of the most entrepreneurial
universities in the land. By the way, in case any noble Lords read the
small print in some of the Sunday papers, I should make it clear that
they advised me as chairman what I might say, as you would expect, but
I chose what to say and bear sole responsibility for my words. Our

the importance of SMEs, I think our most important recommendation was
Recommendation 1—that the Government should report back, not
only now, but in a year’s time. I am delighted that the
Government have committed themselves to do this in 2014 and 2015. We
are promised further debates then. In that way, I hope, the work of our

world of business is changing in other ways. There are other ways of
exporting which may be more suited to particular companies or markets
or products. Franchising, licensing the product, licensing the
know-how, the patent, the trademark—is UKTI helping with this?
There was very little evidence of this. Perhaps another way is for UKTI
to be more selective and to try to nurture new export
sectors—those sectors where the UK has a competitive advantage.
Last November the Chancellor, in his address to the Royal Society,
listed eight such sectors that would receive special encouragement and

Incidentally, the single state of Bavaria exports to the United Kingdom
more in value than the whole of the United Kingdom exports to Germany.
For 60 years, it has had its own local state-backed
investment bank, which makes export finance one of its priorities.
Surely this must be one of the reasons for its success. What is
happening to our Government’s business bank, and will it be as
local as the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, would obviously like it to be?
In fact, aiding and encouraging local firms to export could well be
part of the Heseltine proposals to localise business services by

it is not easy for small companies to export. There is the

the get up and go—the will and the initiative—to do it.
In small and medium-sized companies, exporting often depends on the
personality of just one 
<?notus-xml column=805?>or two people, irrespective of the benefits and financial rewards that
exporting brings to the business. So how do you identify these people
and these companies? There is a supplement in today’s
<I>Financial Times</I> telling us how. Firms using big data identify a
potential customer for their style of clothing or people who like a
particular kind of holiday or food. Could not UKTI write an algorithm

Coussins:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to comment specifically on
Chapter 6 of the report, which deals with the topic of languages and
culture. I declare interests as vice-president of the Chartered
Institute of Linguists and as chair of the All-Party Parliamentary

Select Committee on taking language skills seriously as a mainstream
issue. This makes a very welcome change from the approach that we often
see, which is either to overlook language skills or, at best, to
mention them as a footnote. However, since the report’s
publication, two new authoritative pieces of research have been
published—a new report from the British Academy and another,
only two weeks ago, from the British Chambers of Commerce. I think that
if the committee had had the benefit of these two latest studies, its
recommendations might have been even stronger and had a slightly
different focus. The Government, of course, do have this advantage, so
I hope that in his reply the Minister will comment
on how they might update their response to the
recommendations on languages in the added light of the recent
findings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000016">It
was disappointing that the committee received mixed evidence on the
importance of foreign languages and that in some sections of British
business there is still an outdated belief that English, vital thought
it is, is enough. The latest British Academy report shows how ingrained
monolingual attitudes are not only harming the export potential of
current businesses but standing in the way of developing a strong
supply of language skills for the next generation by preventing
successful functioning of the market for language

is true that some surveys show very small numbers of firms identifying
languages as a barrier to export growth. However, the British Academy
points out that discrepancies in findings can be accounted for by
differences in the sample and profile of respondents, whereas in
Kingston University’s more focused study 
<?notus-xml column=806?>of SMEs’ approach to doing business overseas, <I>The
</I><I>eXport</I><I> Factor</I>, issues relating to language and
foreign cultures were seen as the biggest barrier of all, cited by 31%

recent report from the British Chambers of Commerce showed that the
proportion of non-exporters who would like to trade internationally has
risen slightly even since the Select Committee’s deliberations.
Its latest survey covered 4,500 businesses, more than 90% of them
employing fewer than 250 people and three-quarters fewer than 50. The
BCC calls the extent of the language deficit “sobering”,
pointing out that 70% of respondents had no foreign language ability
for the markets they served, and that the deficit is greatest in the
fastest-growing markets. For example, only 0.5% had any ability in
Russian or Chinese. With the importance of market growth in Latin
America, it is equally shocking to me that 64% speak no Spanish, never
mind Portuguese.</hs_para>

impact of this on the bottom line of business, and therefore on the
UK’s economy and competitiveness, is plain and was clearly
recognised by the Select Committee. The UK could be missing out each
year on contracts worth between £9 billion and £21
billion, whereas firms that proactively use their language skills and
the cultural knowledge that goes with them achieve on average 45% extra
sales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000020">The
report acknowledges the weakness in the argument that English is enough
because it is the universal language of business, pointing out that
only 6% of the world’s population consists of native English
speakers. Even the dominance of English on the internet is declining.
In the past decade, the report tells us that web content in English has
increased by 300% but that content in Chinese has gone up by 1,500%, in
Russian by 1,800% and in Arabic by
2,500%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000021">There
is also a circularity in the argument that English is enough because,
as the report points out, UK companies tend to trade only or mainly
with other English-speaking markets. Therefore, the lack of language
skills is self-limiting and constraining. We are cutting ourselves off
from opportunities for growth by being blind to the languages
barrier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000022">A
perfect example of that is the languages industry itself. This sector
includes interpreting, translating, language-teaching tools such as
text books, CDs and online resources, subtitling, dubbing, web
localisation and much more. In 2009, the EU published the first ever
study of the size of the language industry, estimating its value at
€8.4 billion and on target to double to €16.5 billion by
2015. The study makes recommendations to help businesses to seize the
opportunities to benefit from multilingual competence. SMEs in
particular are advised, for example, against assuming that localising a
website into the language of a target market is enough to generate
sales, and EU member states are urged to introduce compatible
statistical measures to help foreign language planning. I should like
to ask the Minister whether this particular recommendation is what the
Government had in mind when they said on page 9 of their response to
the Select Committee report that they were developing a metric to
quantify the problem. Can the Minister say what that metric might
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:19:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Minister to comment further on the recommendation that UKTI should make
a priority of dispelling misperceptions to do with language difficulty
and help SMEs to deal with the problem. I find this recommendation a
little unsettling because it is not clear to me whether the committee
regards the employment of native speakers and outsourced translation
services as the best strategies. I would be concerned if it were or
indeed if that were the opinion of the Government. The report
overstates what can be done with technology and native speakers and is
not quite strong enough on the importance of developing the UK’s
own capacity on languages. Every native speaker employed for their
language skills acts as a disincentive for UK nationals to develop
their own.</hs_para>

committee indicated just how bad the UK is in comparison to its EU
partners. It is pretty much bottom of or worst at every type of
language skill you can measure. The take-up of languages at GCSE has
halved since they were made optional after the age of 14 in 2004. The
boost provided by the introduction of the EBacc seems already to have
run its course, with last year’s take up showing no increase
over the previous year’s. Although I am in strong agreement with
the Select Committee in welcoming the Government’s move to make
languages compulsory in primary schools from 2014, this will certainly
not be enough on its own to redress the country’s language
deficit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:20:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

schools do not necessarily match the ones business says it most needs,
nor do they build on the existing linguistic diversity of many pupils.
Added to which, as the report says, we need a cultural shift in
attitudes within businesses, too. The British Academy says businesses
underestimate their current and future needs and do not invest enough
in the training and management of language skills. In the light of such
enormous opportunities for growth if only SMEs could scale up their
language skills, can the Minister say why the Government will not
consider introducing financial incentives for such training as proposed
by the British Chambers of Commerce? I acknowledge the wide range of
support services available through UKTI should companies know about
them and have the good sense to choose to access them. However, it
seems to me that something more proactive and innovative is needed if
our SMEs are to seize their fair share of global growth in a
sustainable way and not just adopt a quick fix approach to the language
deficit.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_26_PT_1/DCF5A605EEE2DD06B6CC15AF70650206E25D21F2" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 June 2013">Wednesday,

Cohen of Pimlico:</Member></B> My Lords, I would also
like to thank the chairman of this committee, who has paid such
graceful compliments to me and to the clerk. It must have
been pretty discouraging for the chairman to have his treasured clerk
and a senior member of the committee both flat on their backs sending
him comments on the report from hospital on mobile phones. I commend

should like to talk about one of the missing links in all this, which
is the shortage of actual bank lending for small and medium-sized
companies. The committee’s subtitle was Roads to Success: SME
exports—Select Committee on Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.
However, as a witness from one of the big banks observed, the companies
best equipped to export were those that were well managed, profitable
and solidly financed—qualities that you would want in any
company, but even more so in a small company launching itself on the
less predictable and more difficult field of exporting, particularly
exporting outside the
EU<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000041">So
far, so reasonable and I am sure that we can all agree about the need
for well managed and well financed companies. But what part are the big
commercial banks —RBS, Lloyds, HSBC and
Barclays—playing in the financing of SMEs? Our report
identified major discrepancies between the banks’ fair words
about lending to SMEs and what the SMEs’ experience had been. I
quote the
report:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062684000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000057">“Few
SMEs had a kind word to say about banks”.</hs_quote>

noted that lending, even to SMEs with full order books, strong
collateral and strong cash flow, had dried up. Onerous guarantees were
being demanded, including that directors put their houses up as
security, which is lazy
banking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:33:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13062684000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000042">Most of my colleagues
on the committee and I were, on the whole, inclined to believe the
SMEs’ account of the relationship. Our own experience as well as
external facts support the SMEs’ views on the matter. Even the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills described the
banks as having had a collective nervous breakdown in the financial
crisis. If they had had several different nervous breakdowns it might
have worked better, but they had exactly the same one. It involved
reacting identically by cutting their costs—to be fair, in the
only way that a bank can cut its costs quickly—by making savage
redundancies, drawing in regional networks and sucking all the 
<?notus-xml column=811?>power back to the
centre<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:33:51"></hs_TimeCode>. That
leaves authority and a great deal of regional expertise vested in
people who do not know their customers and whose authority in many
cases is limited to a lending power of something like £50,000,
which does not get you very
far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:34:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

clear—to us, at least—that a good many managers were
simply terrified to lend except on a rock-solid covenant. They are
petrified of making the bank’s position worse. They wish only to
do their best for head office and to follow its agenda of getting rid
of any loan or customer viewed as even slightly doubtful, and of
raising the prices being charged to less doubtful customers. UKTI, we
began to observe, was beginning to perform a secondary and very useful
role of wandering around finding bank financing for people. That is
interesting, but not what it was set up to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:34:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000044">The
banks, of course, are not doing this for fun or all of their own
volition. In the valedictions given to Stephen Hester, the
retiring—I suppose we are calling it that—CEO of RBS, the
Government’s agenda is clear. He was praised for cutting costs,
for terminating less than solid lending and for getting more profit
from his better lenders. That is commendable if you are, as he was,
trying to save a bank and return it to profitability. However, it is
absolutely not useful if you want to coax small and medium companies to
grow and
prosper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000045">In
all this, as in other matters, all the big banks, including those that
the taxpayer does not largely own, have been doing the same painfully
pro-cyclical things, such as cutting down on regional staff and
centralising and standardising their procedures to the point where it
is doubtful that the Archangel Gabriel and staff would have got a loan,
at least if they applied in Hull or in Liverpool, even with a personal
guarantee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000046">Again,
much of this has been at the Government’s behest. If you demand
that very large amounts of regulatory capital be held against business
lending, banks will seek activity where less capital is required, such
as investment management, as UBS did, or safe-as-houses, low
loan-to-value mortgages, which is where many banks are
going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:36:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000047">The
banks are not only swinging in line behind the Government’s and
the regulator’s wishes but adding a few refinements of their
own, such as seeking personal guarantees to support lending and charges
on directors’ own houses. Nothing more inhibiting to enterprise
could be managed and the worst of it is that they all do the same
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:36:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000048">What
we need is either a radical change sparked by the Government—who
else?—or a new banking system. So far, the Government’s
offer has consisted of exhortation, which is never useful in my
experience, an embryo bank, which may well be useful but we do not know
yet, and the Funding for Lending scheme. This fund would be fine if it
is not also hypothecated on lending on housing. It is pretty clear that
the bulk of this cash will inevitably go to mortgage lending. It is
easy, can be secured on bricks and mortar and you get the equivalent of
a personal guarantee with it because there is a person living in the
bricks and mortar who really wants to hang on to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:37:35"></hs_TimeCode>. I think an
anxious bank  
<?notus-xml column=812?>manager struggling to do safe profitable lending for his employer would
much prefer mortgage lending to business lending to SMEs; why would
they
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000049">The
signs of a new and more useful banking system—more innovative
and differentiated—are beginning to appear but they are small
and delicate. I hope that the business bank announced by the Government
will be useful, but it is far too soon to tell. There are other hopeful
but small and new organisations such as the Funding Circle and
experiments in crowd funding. We also heard from Bibby Financial
Services, which took an amazingly robust view of its ability to get
good loans for its customers from some of the 600 foreign banks with
branches in this country. Those are all useful, but none will secure
enough lending for serious growth any time soon. For that, you need
your country’s big commercial banks back in business, spreading
out again into the regions and no longer terrorised by their recent
history or some ill considered
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000050">Meanwhile,
it is to be hoped that more equity funding will fill at least some of
the gap. Very few companies get by without any equity base and in these
hard times companies are looking to equity to fill some of
the void left where bank lending should be. I commend a
couple of government schemes—the Enterprise Investment Scheme
and the small companies investment scheme. They enable high taxpayers
to invest up to £100,000 per annum more or less free of tax and
have been the foundation of a lot of start-up companies. Again, this is
not the revolution, but it is a
help<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:39:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

needed. We heard, discouragingly, that other private sector sources of
venture capital have slumped to the point where about 60% of venture
capital raised last year came from government sources as opposed to
about 10% from government sources in
2007<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:39:45"></hs_TimeCode>. I would
guess that we were no more than holding our own in raising private
sector venture capital for privately held
SMEs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:39:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

better as you approach the public markets. I am a director of the
London Stock Exchange and, as such, responsible for the AIM market. If
a company is big enough to get on to AIM, it typically increases its
turnover by 37% and employment by 20% in the first year after admission
to the market. There are other important advantages to do with
visibility which make growth and exporting easier for SMEs. Wearyingly,
it is also true that it is much easier to get a bank loan if you are a
publicly quoted
company<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:40:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062684000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062684000053">Equity
can never be the whole story. Entrepreneurs, the life-blood of the
SMEs, are often very unwilling to give away as much equity as
present-day conditions require. I suspect they are, like all of us,
waiting for things to get better before they try to raise money. On
present form, we could be waiting some time and that is a tragedy for
the people we met in the regions and for many others who
could expect to be cheerfully and gainfully employed. We need our big
banks now, not cowering behind the barricades of the regulators in
London. They all need to get out

to this House and join your Lordships, I leave home and come to a
different atmosphere, but until last year I had never been tempted to
go speed-dating to fill up my time. However, last year I was, and I
took a trip down the M4 to a speed-dating service in Bristol, organised
by UKTI, as a member of one of the companies that I am associated with.
I went to a hotel where there were some 40 advisors from
different nations, right across the globe. I spoke to people from
Austria, the Netherlands, Ethiopia and Argentina. There was a fantastic
variety; some of them were Brits who were based in embassies, but many
were foreign nationals based in our embassies—and it was really
exciting. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:42:38"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Selsdon, has mentioned some of these occasions. We
spoke to around 10 of these advisors; it was very well organised, and
we have followed some of those up. I will come back to that

congratulate UKTI on that experience. The great thing about the
Passport to Export programme was that it had a good balance to it, and
it gave you opportunities as you went through it—not completely
at the taxpayer’s expense. You had to contribute to it yourself,
so you took some responsibility for the outcomes. You met other people
in different sectors who had gone through those experiences before, so
you learnt and found out about the export business. Information
barriers and risks were explained and taken away, so you had a much
better ease into that market. This is all essential for smaller
companies and organisations.</hs_para>

also a member of a Local Enterprise Partnership in the south-west. Some
research done on behalf of LEPs more broadly was very factual and
pointed; in reality, the factors which determined whether an SME was a
good exporter were whether it invested sufficiently in research and
development, and whether its products and staff were knowledge-led. It
helped if it was in a cluster of businesses in the area that thought in
a similar way, and whether that cluster had connections to other growth
areas in the globe. However, the key factor as to whether you were
going to be good at exporting was, I regret to say, size. The larger
you are, the more you are able to commit resources and be able to
negotiate barriers to moving out into export
markets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:44:48"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
one of the things that, in terms of my work with the Local Enterprise

am going to commit complete heresy in this forum. In some ways, SMEs
have acquired a sainthood in British politics and beyond over the last
15 years. They are an incredibly important part of our economy, but
most of them are risk-averse, lifestyle businesses; they deal only with
local, not even national markets. I would accuse the so-called
entrepreneurs—although we used to call them “capitalist
pigs” when we were students in the 1970s—of not actually
playing the role which their staff, their colleagues and employees
deserve, which is to grow those businesses. There are huge
numbers of exceptions in Cornwall, where I come from, and the noble
Lord, Lord Cope, mentioned some fantastic examples of successful
businesses that export and work worldwide, through the internet or
whatever. I would disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, when he
said that we should concern ourselves with  
<?notus-xml column=814?>those businesses that cannot get their heads around
IT. If they cannot do that, they should either not be in business or
should be written off as potential exporters. Let us concentrate on
those entrepreneurs who really want to move forward, take sensible
risks and give their employees the opportunity to develop their
careers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:46:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:46:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000006">I
come to the message that I want to put over this evening. We talk a lot
about corporate business, which I was privileged to be a part of in the
early part of my career, and SMEs, but we forget the mid-sized
businesses and some of the medium-sized businesses at the top end of
this category. Companies that have a turnover of £10 million to
£100 million and have 50 to 500 staff account for only 1% of UK
businesses but they have 20% of business turnover and 16% of employees.
This says something about their efficiency and how they work. I
congratulate the CBI, for which this is not natural territory in our
minds, for bringing out a report called <I>Future Champions</I> around
this area. Was this a clever invention? No. If we look to Germany or
even to France, we see that this sector of business is the engine of
their economies. The Mittelstand—and it sounds as if the
committee went and saw some of this—is the engine of the German
economy and is excellent at exporting. Those businesses tend to use
local supply but export globally; they think globally, but act locally.
They tend to have quality products, niche markets and highly skilled
employees, which gives them a higher earning capacity. They tend to be
more in the manufacturing area, which causes rebalancing. Most
importantly, for people like me who come from the regions, they are far
more geographically dispersed than large businesses and, perhaps, some
small businesses as well. They also tend to allow their staff to have
real career progression within the organisation. If things are
difficult, they tend to have deeper pockets and financial
substance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:48:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:46:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000007">France
and Germany have learnt the importance of that sector in driving their
economies forward, yet we hear almost nothing about it in the UK. The
noble Lord, Lord Haskel, is absolutely right about KfW, the big bank
which helps promote these, SMEs and green technology. I welcome the
attempts of BIS to start that sort of process here as well. I ask the
Government not to forget the middle-sized business community in the UK,
which could be an excellent area of growth and export. SMEs are vital.
The good news is that the company I went speed-dating with in Bristol
will, next week, be recruiting its first person to concentrate on
exports. I am pleased to say that she is a Spanish-speaking Brit, and
that the company will be looking not just within the European mainland
but to South America. Do not forget the middle-sized companies and let
us make sure that we help the SMEs which want to move forward and take
their staff with them, but let us leave the lifestyle ones to get on
with
life.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T19:50:12"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

of the experience we have gone through are that there are lots of
success stories in the report. Clearly, there is no question about that
but, at the same time, underlying it there is relatively poor overall
performance by our SMEs, particularly when compared to many other
countries. One country that we obviously looked at closely was Germany.
In Germany, there is a strong commitment of business organisations
towards the well-being of SMEs and a strong community feeling that SMEs
matter and help each other. The noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, who I shall
speak about later, said that he was in Mumbai recently and ran into no
fewer than 150 people representing German commerce there. They were
helping SMEs and larger companies to do business there.</hs_para>

regional governments and regional banks has been referred to. It is
very powerful, particularly in Bavaria but right across Germany. There
is a supply chain made by large companies for small businesses. Seven
days a week, a train leaves Munich and heads for Shanghai, over the
trans-Siberian railway line. It is full of cars and components made by
BMW’s small businesses. The understanding of the supply chain is
great in Germany as well. The careful nourishment of SMEs generally
came across. While it is certainly bureaucratic, it is effective. The
Mittelstand miracle, which the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, has
mentioned, was invented by Bismarck 140 years ago and is a huge driving
force in the strength of the German economy. There is also a strong
emphasis on localism, which I will come back to. I am in cahoots with
the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, on this agenda.</hs_para>

with Britain, where we have lots and lots of start-ups—that is
not bad—but far too many failures at an early stage. That has
been endemic for many years in this country because of a lack of
training, engagement and understanding about what those businesses are
taking upon themselves when they go into it. Sporadic government
interventions are constantly changing, not just on this but right
across the piece. Successive Governments have turned the course of
events, which makes it difficult for businesses to follow them. There
was the initiative that the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, had with
Business Links. Some of us had mixed feelings about them, but that idea
has gone and something else has come in their place. The other element
in our businesses is their inability to grow beyond employing two or
three people. In Germany, that element is to be ambitious and grow to
employ five, 10 or 20 people. That does not happen here.</hs_para>

fine for Rolls-Royce and the big companies, but is it realistic for
most SMEs? They will have to tackle the tariffs and trade barriers that
are there. They will have to tackle the political instability which we
are seeing in Brazil, and may see in India and South Africa, and tackle
the transactional complexities of dealing with those
countries—never mind the corruption and bribery which exists in
many of those countries, which people at least have to reckon with in
doing business there,  
<?notus-xml column=816?>and never mind the distance or, particularly, the language, which is
more acute in those countries than in Europe. There are also, of

with small businesses doing business within the European Union which,
even if it is in the doldrums today, still shows that we have an
inadequate share of that market. That is so right across the piece but
particularly with SMEs. Small businesses do not have tariff problems or
trade barriers to deal with there. They have one set of market
regulations which, for the most part, work reasonably effectively. The
rules within the EU are pretty tough on corruption, so you do not have
to worry about that. There is now substantial growth in the eastern
countries of the EU and an increasingly accessible infrastructure,

in the past.</hs_para>

take your Lordships to Antwerp, Hamburg or Amsterdam, all of which have
thriving trade right on our doorstep. There is widespread dismay and
disbelief among many small businesses about talk of full withdrawal

found in our discussions of the Government’s support for SMEs
that UKTI is well thought of, but not sufficiently widely recognised

patronising business, they are beginning to think that businesses have
something going for them. I suppose that they may be looking after
their own careers by doing that, but it is better. However, too much
attention is applied to larger businesses. It is too easy for civil
servants and ambassadors to talk to the head noises in Rolls-Royce,
which can look after itself. The attention should be directed more
towards the smaller businesses. There is a need for more communication
with small business. I certainly find this in the LEP, which has a job
to improve the communication with small business about what is offered
by the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000016">The
noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, mentioned the finance issue. I will not say
very much about it, except that it is a confusing picture. Lots of SMEs
have told us that they are charged penal interest rates, that the
security demanded of them is excessive and that the banks do not seem
to want to do business. The banks, on the other hand, say,
“Nobody is coming along to borrow money from us”. I think
there is a bit of truth on both sides; not as many people want to
borrow as we would like.</hs_para>

devolution. There is no question that the ideas of the noble Lord, Lord
Heseltine, are widely supported by business. There is more local
support for SMEs through the LEPs than anywhere else, and the LEPs are
crucial in getting SMEs off the ground. It is certainly my main
priority to have the relationship with the SMEs as the driver for the
local 
<?notus-xml column=817?>economy. The banks have also got to learn about devolution. We learnt in
our studies that a local bank manager—at any rate, one in my
area—is not allowed to authorise more than £50,000 to a
small business. It otherwise has to go through the computer to the
central system to make that judgment. Banks need to think about
restoring the power and authority of local bank managers, to give them
the discretion to make business judgments face-to-face with businesses,
rather than relying on computers to do the job for them.</hs_para>

businesses do to help themselves in this? Time and again, we find the
situation is that local authorities and businesses are saying,
“What are the Government going to do for me?”. That is
important, but what can businesses do for themselves? First, big
businesses must look more to small businesses for innovation. That is
where the innovation has come from in the past. Big business must
recognise that and search out those businesses which are innovating and
support them. Secondly, small businesses should collaborate much more
with each other. We saw some excellent examples of collaboration in
Wednesbury, which I should say is also promoted by UKTI, where
high-tech small businesses in the aerospace industry that are trying to
get into the American market were working together to establish a base
in America. That is the only way you can do business in America, and it
was working very successfully.</hs_para>

that we saw being really successful had just got on with it. They had
nothing to do with government. They did not even know where the
Government were but they were getting on with it, mainly because they
had a great idea which they believed in. They had the up and go that is
so necessary. Nothing can compare with the flair, innovation and
leadership in achieving business success, whether the business is big
or small. The Government must do all they can to support these policies

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Cope of
Berkeley, for the courtesy and patience which he exhibited in great
measure throughout the Select Committee’s work. It was the first
opportunity that I have had to be on a Select Committee in your
Lordships’ House and it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Cope, for his consideration. We were also
extremely well served by a very active and dedicated staff. As has been
pointed out, due to the accidents that we seemed to attract, there was
a sense of embattlement as we came towards the preparation of the
report. Members of the committee and staff seemed to be dropping like
flies. However, they all rallied round—even from hospital
beds—to produce the report. That indicates their commitment. I
would also point out that, as I am sure all noble Lords will know,
nobody puts words into the mouth of the noble Lord, Lord Cope of
Berkeley. What he says, he says for
himself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000022">I
should like to touch briefly on the finance from a slightly different
point of view. As was said by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, there are
two sides to this story. I was recently invited to chair a meeting of a

<?notus-xml column=818?>business forum in London. A representative of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales was present and we looked at
alternative sources of finance. In this country we are heavily
dependent on bank finance, which accounts for about two-thirds.
However, that is not the case in other countries, such as the United
States. We now have things such as Funding Circle and peer-to-peer
lending, and new opportunities are out there.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062687000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000023">What<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
struck me most on that occasion was a story relayed by the accountants.
They had carried out a survey of SMEs, asking them how much preparation
they did before putting a business case to their banker. The average
answer was two days. I was shocked by that. The fact is that banks
should not agree to all applications from SMEs, and in fact that is
part of the reason we got into difficulties ourselves. I remember being
in business and paying at one stage an interest rate of 22.5% on
business loans. Can one imagine what would happen in this country if
interest rates began to rise to any extent? We have been living in a
fool’s paradise, believing that you can have money for next to
nothing. It is not going to be like that for ever. SMEs must sharpen up
their act. No matter who you are, putting a business case together in
such a short space of time is totally unrealistic and, in fact,
reckless.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000024">As
was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Cope, we were shocked by the
statistics given to us by UK Export Finance. Of course, most of the
work that it was doing when it came to see us in the summer of last
year was for Rolls-Royce and BAE, which we fully understand. When we
pressed the organisation, we discovered that at the time it was helping
17 SMEs. I know that since then it has appointed regional
representatives, and it is widening its scope and trying to make its
services more available. However, I would be very interested if the
Minister could update us on how that process is going. Are the regional
representatives settling down? Are they actually helping to deliver the
growth that we all
want?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000025">The
other area I want to mention is training. The noble Baroness, Lady
Coussins, gave us a very interesting speech on language. The committee
heard a lot about that, and I think we have lots of lessons to learn
there. However, other qualifications are necessary, over and above
language. I declare a non-pecuniary interest as a vice-president of the
Institute of Export, a charity which was established in 1935. It is the
only professional body in the United Kingdom offering recognised,
formal qualifications in international trade. It seems to me that if
you are going to drive a car, you get a lesson in how to drive. If you
are going to become a mechanic, you learn and you serve and
you become a mechanic. If you are going to export, why should it be any
different? Why should you not learn the ropes? Why do you not get
qualifications in it? Why do you not learn what is involved in
international trade? Having that knowledge enables you to avoid many of
the pitfalls. These qualifications are recognised by Ofqual, and they
are not hugely expensive. There are short courses, and they can be done
by distance
learning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000026">It
is essential to have that basic skill as taking on exports can be a
very difficult business. People are afraid of not getting paid and they
do not know the 
<?notus-xml column=819?>customs in a local area. As the noble Lord, Lord Cope, pointed out in
his opening remarks, with the change in the population mix in this
country, people came to the committee to offer their services, because
they had connections in some of our future key markets. There are
people living in this country who are dedicated to doing business and
we are not actually using that expertise which is on our own doorstep.
We need to ensure that people get these
qualifications.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000027">The
whole business ethos and the culture in this country have been
anti-business for a number of years. I know the Minister has tried very
hard during his term of office to change people’s minds about
that. At the end of the day, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord
Selsdon, it is true that we have a huge trade deficit, but a country
which is economically weak is weak from a defence point of view, is
weak from an international point of view and is weak from an influence
point of view. We need to get that message to our schools and get mums
and dads to say, “Well, there could be career opportunities
here”. I think it is a matter of drawing all of those things
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062687000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062687000028">I
would like the Minister to tell me what progress has been made with UK
Export Finance, and what advice he and the Government would give on
trying to promote the acquisition of suitable international trade
qualifications. This would ensure that when people in SMEs knock on the
door they have the expertise and they know what a customer is. That
knowledge is somewhat lacking in this country. I have often felt that
we have to readjust, because we should be an outward-looking nation. We
can survive only if we can trade and move in and out, keeping our
inlets and our outlets open. We will succeed only if that is ingrained
in people at a much earlier stage throughout the education
system.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_26_PT_1/E972F1AE76FC9051AFED673C9E6F630D3EB02CCD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 June 2013">Wednesday,

the contribution of SMEs to export-led growth acquires a new imperative
when one looks at the structural shift taking place in the UK economy.
The 1.3 million increase in the business population, from 3.5 million
in 2000 to 4.8 million in 2012, has been mainly driven by SMEs. Over
that same period the number of large private sector enterprises
decreased by 10.2%, falling from 7,200 to
6,500.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000003">SMEs
are acquiring an increasing importance in the UK economy and delivering
the step increase in exports that we so badly need. Finance to
exporting SMEs must be assured. It is beyond dispute that bank lending
to businesses has fallen, but the causes of this decline are contested.
The noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, said that there did not appear to be a
definitive answer as to whether the decline is due to a lack of supply
from banks or to limited demand from businesses. What the report did
identify, as my noble friend Lady Cohen mentioned, was the extent of
the complaints by SMEs and executives about the insufficiency of loans 
<?notus-xml column=820?>and other services from the banks on “reasonable terms”.
The distinction between the finance available for loans and the terms
under which it is available may in part explain why some banks, such as
RBS, argue that supply is not the problem, while at the same time
exporting SMEs frequently argue that it is insufficient supply on
“reasonable terms” which is at fault. Contributing to the
problem are bank lending practices such as setting punitive charges and
interest rates; onerous guarantees; exclusion of certain overseas
markets from loan approvals; and the exclusion of certain activities
from loan approvals. The replacement of relationship banking, where
loan applications are judged on their merits, with a centralised,
formulaic approach to lending decisions, is also part of the
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000004">A
pervasive formulaic approach may be a consequence of banks’ need
to strengthen their balance sheets, comply with tighter regulations and
reduce their risks, but it has to be confronted and addressed if SMEs
are to access the finances needed for exporting. A return of local bank
managers is unlikely to improve the position unless they are
also empowered to have the discretion to decide on loan
applications.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000005">On
Funding for Lending, billions may be drawn down by participating banks

that the Government should study how banks assess the credit risk of

was pleasing, therefore, to see the recent announcement by the OFT that
it is bringing forward its review of banking for SMEs. The proposed
scope of the OFT review includes whether SMEs have access to services
that meet their needs and represent good value and whether there are
types of SME that face particular difficulties and, if so, why. I
acknowledge that the industry is working towards a voluntary disclosure
regime, but as the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
observed, increased disclosure of lending decisions by the banks is
crucial to enable policy-makers to identify markets, communities and
geographical areas currently not well served by the mainstream banking

Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I convey the apologies of my
colleague, the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, who served on the committee
and was intending to speak this evening, but she has been invited by
Barclays Bank, no less, to have dinner with some senior directors. She
thought that it would be a good opportunity perhaps to influence or
change their
views.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000014">After<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:16:01"></hs_TimeCode>
the Second World War, the then Government urged businesses to either
export or die. I suggest that this motto is as important today as it
was 60 years ago. Indeed, the accelerating effects of globalisation,
combined with increasing competition from the world’s emerging
economies, have, if anything, increased this maxim’s
resonance.</hs_para>

not have as large a percentage of businesses exporting as do our
neighbouring competitors such as Germany, France or Italy. If we could
increase the number of exporting firms to the EU average, we would go a
long way to reducing Britain’s trade deficit, a shortfall that
we have shouldered almost every year since the end of the Second World
War. Why is it that the French, the Italians and the Germans are able
to export more than
us?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000016">It is
imperative we ensure that we are doing all we can to encourage an
export-led recovery. We therefore established this Select Committee on
Small and Medium Sized Enterprises to see which steps could be taken.
It was my first Select Committee and it was a privilege to sit on it. I
pay tribute to the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord
Cope, and the committee staff’s professionalism. It should also
be mentioned that
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:17:42"></hs_TimeCode> was the

months of collecting oral and written evidence and visiting exporter
“success stories”, our <I>Roads to Success: SME

improvements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000018">The
committee rightly concentrated on the wider benefits of increasing SME
exports, but of course exports are also invaluable to each individual
company. It is crucial we get more firms exporting; it is essential
that we encourage those that already do so to look to new and

markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000019">I was
taken with some work carried out by the University of Glasgow which
looked at the benefits to their own business of those individual
companies that exported. The most striking statistic they found is that
businesses setting out on their export journey achieve on average a 34%
boost to their company’s productivity; that is, a rise of over a
third in their first export year. The university’s
research also found that these exporting businesses were 12% more
resilient to weather tough economic times and, finally, that such firms
are also better at
innovation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000020">When
you export to a range of countries, you need to be aware of the
different tastes, needs, fashions, cultures and, indeed, foibles of
each market. The lessons learnt are so powerful that almost
every firm that begins to export also witnesses an increase in its
domestic sales. The result of these learning processes is that firms,
having been exposed to the competitive world of international trade,
spread best practice here in the UK.</hs_para>

have four engines of growth: government spending, consumer spending,
investment and trade. Government and consumer spending is not likely to
rise significantly, so the importance of getting more firms both to
export and to invest in their technologies, plants and equipment is the
only way in which the UK can pursue the growth we so desperately
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

found that there is plenty of help out there for firms. UK Trade and
Investment, as we have heard, is worthy of considerable note. As we
also know, many businesses are members of trade  
<?notus-xml column=823?>associations, chambers of commerce and support
organisations such as the Institute of Directors, the Confederation of
British Industry and the Federation of Small Businesses, to name a few.
All these organisations must pledge—and have pledged, I
hope—to increase exporting. I very much hope to see UKTI and UK
Export Finance blowing their trumpets even louder to promote the
services that they can
offer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:22:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000023"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:21:13"></hs_TimeCode>The
UK currently exports half its goods and services to the other
26—soon to be 27—European Union states. This is good
news, although it is largely to be expected in our quota-tariff and
free-trade economic area. However, that 50% goes to a group of nations
that together represent only 7% of the world's population and only 18%
of the world's GDP. Furthermore, this group of nations is potentially
shrinking, not growing. We need to seek out new markets wherever they
are. We have to take advantage of wherever growth is emanating from. I
was pleased to learn that, for the first time, UK exports to China
averaged more than £1 billion a month between February and
April. We must remain optimistic about our SME exporters, and those who
can must help SMEs on their journey to further growth.

Taylor of Warwick:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Select Committee
and, of course, its advisers for this excellent report. I wish to focus
mainly on paragraph 6, which concerns language and
diversity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:22:50"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is no doubt that exporting is vital to economic growth. A number of
young people were sitting in the Gallery watching this debate. That
reminded me of the tragedy of more than 1 million young people
unemployed. For their sake alone, we need to increase growth, and that
must come from increasing
exports<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:23:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000025">My
noble friends Lord Cope and Lord Teverson and the noble Baroness, Lady
Coussins, all mentioned the language problem, which we can no longer
ignore. The National Centre for Languages has produced a report called
<I>Talking World Class</I>. It asserts that language gap leads to a
trade gap. It criticises the lack of language skills that we have in
this country. It was quite shocking to see the research produced by the
European Commission that the UK has the lowest number of people able to
speak other languages in a league table of 28 European countries.
According to the report, 80% of export managers in the UK cannot
communicate competently in another
language<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:24:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000026">In
the year to March 2013, the annual export value from all regions in the
UK fell, except in two regions: East Midlands and West Midlands. It
cannot be a coincidence that, for example, UKTI East Midlands has been
proactive in taking advantage of the diversity of its workforce. Its
initiatives include developing the understanding of the business
culture of the country which it visits on trade missions. It organises
day-long language and culture sessions for people travelling overseas.
It liaises with translators, interpreters and training providers. It
identifies opportunities to use overseas students. There is an annual
international communication masterclass, which is a day-long seminar,
attracting about 100
delegates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:25:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=824?><hs_para UID="13062692000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000027">Understanding cultural
and linguistic diversity, both domestically and overseas, is key if we
are to increase trade and exports. There have been several reports in
recent years demonstrating beyond doubt that diversity is good for
business. It is not just about equal opportunities. Diversity produces
new ideas, new markets and new customers. The Federation of Small
Businesses, the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute for
Small Business Association have produced ample evidence for this. As
for immigration, immigrants are on average younger, more highly skilled
and more likely to be of working age than their host counterparts.
Black and ethnic minorities in Britain are now having a real impact on
small and medium-size businesses. I give as an example my home city of
Birmingham. Only last summer, Prince Charles presented a Jamaican
bakery company, based in Birmingham, with the prestigious UK Small
Business of the Year award. Indeed, Prince Charles was so keen to test
the evidence that the company sent a few of its delicious pasties to
Clarence House for, shall we say, closer scrutiny. The owner of that
company had left Jamaica with his family in the 1960s and started a
very small bakery in 1988. Now it has a factory employing 50 staff and
supplying the five major supermarkets. We need to utilise the skills of
men such as that. About 12 miles from Birmingham is Wolverhampton.
There, another Jamaican started a medical technology company in 2004.
Now it has 200 employees and has produced award-winning equipment such
as a device to reduce the risk of deep vein
thrombosis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000028">I
should point out that I have no connection with either of the two
companies but each is another success story. They were immigrants who
came to Britain with nothing. Immigrants are coming from more countries
than in the past, including Poland, China and India. In our business
community there is potentially more access to different language skills
and knowledge of different cultures when it comes to trade delegations
representing Britain abroad. Through our universities, we have access
to overseas students who can help us bridge the language gap that the
noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, spoke about. We know that Mandarin is
now very much the language of business and we have Mandarin speakers in
our localities. We need to capitalise on their skills and
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000029">Many
in the small business community have the energy and ambition—the
get up and go as the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, described it—but
lack awareness of the help available to them. While I am pleased that
the Department for Business and BBA have a national mentoring portal,
Mentorsme.co.uk, there is evidence that the small business community is
unaware of these kinds of facilities. I am very impressed by the Get
Mentoring project where small business owners can get free access to
experienced business people for advice. But the small business
community is not aware of that and more needs to be done to publicise
these excellent
initiatives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0002.htm#13062692000030">My
next point may surprise noble Lords but, in my submission, faith groups
can play an effective role in promoting small business both here and
trading abroad. A new report, <I>Faith in the Community</I>, provided
fresh insight into the role of churches and other faith groups, and the
ways they can liaise with business. The report 
<?notus-xml column=825?>contains information from 150 local authorities
which shared how church and other faith groups help them
carry out many of their tasks, especially in liaising with local
business. Many black and ethnic minority businessmen have their roots
in the churches, and indeed in mosques and temples. Again, I urge the
Minister to look at the faith groups and churches, because therein lies
a tremendous reservoir of talent that it seems is being
ignored.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000031">There
is one Government policy of great concern to the Caribbean business
community: the air passenger duty. This tax is charged on every airline
ticket from the United Kingdom. The problem is that it is based on a
price-banding system related to the distance to a country’s
capital city. That means it can be cheaper to fly to more distant
locations in the United States than to destinations such as Jamaica or
Barbados. The levy is set to rise each year by the rate of inflation,
pricing many in the UK Caribbean community out of being able to travel
to the region on
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000032">The
Select Committee did not have a lot to say about diversity
but the issue is crucial to Britain’s future economic growth.
The Prime Minister set a target of doubling UK exports by 2020. Does
the Minister feel we can attain that target? This is an excellent
report but it has to be acted upon if the target is to be
achieved.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_26_PT_1/85C7B3A8CA0FF29296FC6F8832F5D8D1738CF34D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 June 2013">Wednesday,

Mitchell:</Member></B> My Lords, I was a member of this Select
Committee when it began its hearings. I was getting myself all fired up
to contribute to a subject that means a great deal to me when the rug
was pulled from under my feet. On my giddy elevation to the
Front Bench, I was ordered to stand down from the committee. Of course,
I had no option—the rules are the rules—but I was sad to
leave.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000034">That
said, it is with great pleasure that I welcome the opportunity today to
debate <I>Roads to Success</I>. What a tour de force it is: forensic,
totally focused and clearly written. Throughout its pages the very
clear fingerprints of its chair, the noble Lord, Lord Cope, are
distinctly visible. From these Benches, I congratulate him and his
colleagues on producing it. I have two reservations, which I would have
pushed had I been on the committee. First, the digital revolution is
barely addressed. Secondly, I am not convinced that it reaches out to
the new, young entrepreneurs—those who dress in T-shirts and
jeans, and are for ever plugged in to their music. That apart, I am
much heartened by its
contents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000035">I
very much hope that the report will attract the attention it deserves
within government but somehow I doubt it. The truth is that Select
Committee reports produced by your Lordships’ House get scant
attention in the corridors of Whitehall. I have had the honour to sit
on several Select Committees. On each occasion, noble Lords are chosen
to serve and have impeccable backgrounds, the witnesses are grilled and
the clerks and advisers are of the highest calibre. The reports
produced, just like this one, are outstanding—but what happens?
They disappear into the bowels of the relevant department and
eventually the Government produce their answer, just as they did for
this report. It is always the same. It is obfuscatory, avoids the 
<?notus-xml column=826?>recommendations and sends the report back to Parliament with the clear
intention of kicking it into the long grass. This is not an attack on
the parties opposite. It also happened when we were in government. So
often Ministers and their civil servants regard our Select Committee
reports as a pain to be endured and they treat us accordingly. This is
my second rant in your Lordships’ House today. Enough is
enough—it is time to stop. This high horse will be ridden no
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000036">When I
was in my 20s—light years ago—I remember an advertisement
in Piccadilly Circus. The noble Lord referred to, “Export or
die”. I remember, “Either exports go up or Britain goes
down”. As I remember it, there was a little flashing Union Jack
underneath it—nothing new there. Low exports and low
productivity have been the bugbears of our post-war economic
performance. Small businesses are critical to our economy; everybody is
agreed on that. They employ 60% of our workforce and—a hugely
important point—they are the route back into employment for many
of our long-term
unemployed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000037">Much
of our time is spent looking for ways to support the UK’s small
businesses; encouraging them to export is a good way of doing this. New
research from the Enterprise Research Centre shows a clear correlation
between exporting and growth in businesses of all sizes, and we have
touched on that this evening. EU companies that export grow twice as
fast as companies that do not, and internationally focused SMEs are
three times more likely to introduce an innovative product. My view is
that it is in the mindset of a management that is interested
in new projects and developing in all areas, not just
exporting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000038">Today,
we rightly focus closely on the many important recommendations made in
the report. However, we should also look at ways to encourage
innovation in British companies, given this strong link between
companies that innovate and those that export. The latest EU figures
suggest that the UK is currently 32nd out 35 countries when it comes to
innovative products and processes, and 25% of UK SMEs are innovative,
compared with the EU average of 34%. Recent figures from the Big
Innovation Centre, which works with government, higher education and
industry, illustrates how the difficulties of getting finance stifle
innovation.</hs_para>

innovative firms looking for finance in the period 2010-12 received
none of the credit that they wanted. There is no shortage of statistics
to support the diagnosis that the lack of support from our financial
institutions harms businesses in the UK. We know about this, it is
discussed almost every day in your Lordships’ House and it is a
big problem that we have in this country. The report shows that the
three-month average rates of lending to small businesses have been
negative since August 2011. Looking at the Bank of England figures, I
also count only three individual months over that period when net
lending to small businesses has been
positive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062692000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062692000040">The
lack of small business lending harms innovation and exports. We need a
laser-like focus on improving access to credit for these companies. The
Government’s expansion of Funding for Lending this April was a
positive step, but it is clear that to resolve the market failure at
the core of this issue, we need to be more 
<?notus-xml column=827?>radical and look at structural change. Many noble Lords will no doubt
have shared my surprise on reading that between March 2011 and August
2012, UK enterprise finance helped 31 companies, of which 21 were SMEs.
Noble Lords could be forgiven for thinking that a couple of zeroes had
fallen off these numbers.</hs_para>

Will the Minister please tell us whether there are any plans to
co-ordinate the activities of UK enterprise finance and the Business
Bank? The case study within the report of Alderley plc, the engineering
business that felt that it was being harmed by credit decisions being
made in London rather than regionally, is compelling. It is a scenario
that we often hear about and was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Young of Graffham, in your Lordships’ House yesterday. The end
of relationship banking has harmed small businesses, which find that
instead of local bank managers who understand them and can use judgment
about whether they should have credit, decisions are now made on a
centralised basis, which is often also computerised. Ticking the boxes
is not the way to proceed.</hs_para>

committee’s recommendation that more attention should be paid to
SMEs when the Government draw up trade agreements. The EU-US trade

Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills &amp;
Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Green of
Hurstpierpoint):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin where everyone else has
by congratulating my noble friend Lord Cope on securing what I believe
passionately to be an important debate on trade and investment relating
to small and medium-sized businesses. My noble friend has long
supported British business and British exports, as, of course, have all
the committee members. He and his committee undertook the inquiry
thoroughly and asked searching questions not only of my officials and
of businesses and business support bodies but of me and my colleague
and friend the Business and Enterprise
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000002">Of
the 23 recommendations in the report, I think that I can say truthfully
that we agree. We have essentially fully accepted all of them, with one
or two exceptions where we may not agree with the specific
recommendation but absolutely share the intent behind what is proposed.
Above all, on recommendation 1, which concerns a report back next year
and the year after, I am happy on behalf of the Government to endorse
and accept
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000003">This is
an important topic for us all. More than one noble Lord has called
attention to past advertisements saying “We export or we
die” or, “Exports go up or Britain sinks”.
Briefly, I go back even further than that, prompted by the
recent Diamond Jubilee of the Queen’s coronation, to remember
that in 1953, the UK’s total exports were just £3.6
billion. Last year, they were £488 billion. More importantly
than the nominal figures is that in 1953, the value of exports to UK
GDP was about 10%; it has now risen to 30%, which reflects how Britain
is participating more in an increasingly international economy. The bad
news is that Germany’s percentage is more than 40%, so we may
have come some way since the 1950s, but we still have some way to
go.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000004">A number
of noble Lords have referred to the various targets and challenges that
we have set ourselves: those of doubling trade exports by 2020, getting
100,000 new SMEs into international markets, again by 2020, and
doubling the client base of UK trade in investment from 25,000 to
50,000 by 2015. We are well on track 
<?notus-xml column=829?>with the last of those. The client base of UKTI is growing
rapidly. The target of doubling exports by 2020 is a challenge.
Frankly, if we got somewhere near it we should feel extremely pleased.
It would involve increasing exports as a share of GDP to over 40%,
which is where, as I have just mentioned, the Germany economy now is.
This is not a completely unfeasible challenge, but it is certainly a
demanding
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000005">I assure
the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, that we shall take this report very
seriously. I am not going to allow it to gather dust. There are a
number of important suggestions in it. There is repeated reference in
it, and in comments by noble Lords, to the awareness issue. UKTI gets
good satisfaction ratings. They are not as good as they could be and
could be better, but they are in the mid to high 70s. I would like to
see them at around 90%. Dissatisfaction levels are low, at around 6% or
7%. This is clearly a case of “good but could get
better”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000006">The
level of awareness is not satisfactory. For UKTI this is in the mid
50s. For UKEF it is in the 20s. This is not good enough. It is a
priority for me and the Government to ensure that we raise awareness of
these important services that are available. In particular, as we speak
we are running a pilot marketing programme in the north of England to
raise awareness of UKTI and UKEF. I will be analysing
carefully the results of that pilot when they are complete in the next
few weeks. If we get encouraging figures, we will consider extending
that advertising campaign to the rest of the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000007">In
the short amount of time available to me, I will try to cover a number
of issues that have come up in your Lordships’ comments,
especially language, intellectual property and the reference that my
noble friend Lord Cope made to the Bribery Act at the start. I say to
the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, that I share her passion for
languages. I am a linguist by origin. This was admittedly a long time
ago, but I strongly believe that not only do we need to invest more in
languages, but that investing in languages improves your English. To
paraphrase Rudyard Kipling, what does he know of England who only
England knows, or what does he know of English who only English
knows?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062698000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000008">This
important area is quite complex. It is unrealistic to expect an SME,
unless it has a Chinese speaker, to be able to gear itself up in
Mandarin to the point where it can speak business Mandarin in pursuit
of business opportunities in China. We must be realistic about what is
achievable. We have recently updated a brochure on language management
strategy. We will continue to work on it. I would like to write to the
noble Baroness on some of the complexities of the language issue. There
are some long-term issues about the teaching of language in schools,
and noble Lords are aware that the Government have recently focused
much more attention on this. That will take quite a long time to pay
dividends. In the mean time—and I do not just mean in the mean
time—we need to celebrate the fact that, because of the
diversity in this country, we have a terrific language base on which to
draw, in terms of skills that can be brought in for marketing, for
example, with an appropriate language attached to it. I assure the
House that we take the issue of languages seriously.</hs_para>

properly of concern to a number of noble Lords. The noble Baronesses,
Lady Coussins and Lady Drake, made a detailed analysis of some of the
issues that we face. Given my former career, I am perhaps better placed
than many to reflect on the weaknesses of commercial and business
banking in this country. From that experience and from my experience
going round this country in the past two and a half years and meeting
businesses of all shapes and sizes, there is indeed an issue. It is
quite plain that there are circumstances where companies with
legitimate financing requirements cannot get financing because the
normal templates are being required and inadequate imagination is being
applied to the
topic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000010">What I
think has happened over not just the past three or four years of the
financial and economic crisis but over the past 20 years is that the
skill base of business banking in high street banks has been
deteriorating. This has happened partly because average career bankers
with a reasonable dose of ambition have wanted to head either for the
excitements of corporate and investment banking or for the sexy end of
the retail banking market and did not see themselves as spending the
rest of their career in a relationship management role in, let us say,
Rotherham. The central functions have responded by disempowering those
relationship managers, so we have the result that the noble Baroness,
Lady Coussins, commented on. If I have some good news, it is
that all the CEOs with whom I have regular dialogue and the
heads of commercial banking are focused on this and are determined to
address the problem. I hold regular round tables with the banks under
the auspices of the British Bankers’ Association. The general
problem, I have described. In international trade, in particular, there
is even more of a problem with the skill base. They are focused
on that. The challenge is that it will simply take time to
turn the supertankers.</hs_para>

need to be doing two things—first, to ensure that as it gets
going the business bank is able to challenge them on the way in which
business lending is provided and, secondly, to encourage new
challengers. There are some new challengers. There are a number of new
challenger banks, and a number of noble Lords referred to
the various other techniques for financing that are gaining some
traction, although I do not believe that those other financing sources
can ever be an adequate alternative to, or substitute for, a properly
run business banking presence on our high streets. This is an important
issue, and we will continue working at it.</hs_para>

regard to UK export finance, I can report, first, that there is an
awareness issue, to which I have already referred, and secondly, that
new products are beginning to get more traction. Like noble Lords, I
have been extremely disappointed by the take-up. I put it down to a
considerable extent to lack of awareness. We have therefore put export
finance advisers in every English region and in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. We had one in place in each of those areas by the end
of last year, and I have just authorised a doubling so that it will go
from one to two in each of the regions, plus in each of the devolved
Administrations. I have also started putting export finance advisers
in key locations overseas. We have one in Singapore, 
<?notus-xml column=831?>we are going to have one in Dubai, and I have authorised the
recruitment of further EFAs in other markets of importance to us around
the world, in Brazil and in Africa, where I think we need one in the
Francophone part and one in the Anglophone part, on the ground at that
end, whose job is, first, to help incoming British companies, and
secondly, and very importantly, to negotiate sponsor credit lines with
the sponsors of big infrastructure projects around the world so that
British companies can get access to finance as they seek to win
business as part of those infrastructure projects. So we are on that
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000013">It is
early days to tell what quantitative results this is going to have, but
there is anecdotal evidence. The most recent was at lunchtime today
when I was with the Suffolk Chamber of Commerce, which reported that
the presence of the UKEF financial adviser is making quite a lot of
difference to a number of its members. I hope that we will have more
specific hard evidence when we report next
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000014">My noble
friend Lord Cope raised the important issue of intellectual property.
The British Government will continue to work hard at lobbying in
international fora for better protection and recognition of
intellectual property. As I think the House is aware, we have started
putting intellectual property attachés in some of the key
markets—China and Brazil—and will look at how that is
working in the course of this year. We will consider expanding this
coverage at the end of this year if it looks as though it is delivering
value to British companies that are worried about theft of intellectual
property as they go into those
markets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:55:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000015">Finally,
I assure the House that I take this report very seriously, as do the
Government, and that this is a long-term commitment. If there is
anything in public policy which needs to be treated with a sort of
apolitical consistency over the years, this is it. As a number of noble
Lords have mentioned, we have lived with a constant weak trade position
in all of our working careers—I can safely say that. It has not
got any better of late; again, one or two comments have been made about
the first quarter, which was not good. We suffer from the headwinds
from the eurozone. Roughly speaking, our exports are still growing
quite nicely to the emerging markets, but they were down in the
eurozone. We have a long way to
go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T20:55:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000016">I
find myself saying regularly to my ministerial colleagues, to my
official colleagues, to the media and to anyone who will listen, that
this is a marathon, not a sprint, and we have to stick at this as a
national collective effort over at least the next 20 years. The good
news is that we can do it. I mentioned that I travel round this country
a great deal—I visit each English region and the three devolved
Administrations at least twice a year. I have seen businesses from
every sector, of every shape and size—some of them the mid-cap
companies—and I see companies that are taking on the world. As
the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, said, it is fun to do that. If you are
not the kind of person who finds other countries and cultures fun and
interesting, you will never be a successful exporter. You find these
people across the range of the sectors of our economy. This is not just
about high-tech or manufacturing but about all sectors.</hs_para>

finally—I say to the noble Lords, Lord Haskel and Lord Mitchell,
that clearly the digital economy is becoming more important. We are
obsessed with making sure that the support that we provide to small
businesses takes into account the increasing importance of digital
trading. That is partly about ensuring that they know how to use online
trading and that they think about language in the design of their
websites—all those kinds of things. It also involves
participating in the negotiations within the European Union about the
implementation of a digital single market. There are still too many
barriers to cross-border digital commerce in the single market and we
need to work hard at that.</hs_para>

international trade negotiations, the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, asked
about the state of play on the US-EU negotiations. The truth is that we
have only just started. Clearly, it is as important to SMEs as it is to
the rest of the economy that we do our best to complete a successful
free trade agreement with the US, as well as with Japan—another
major country with which negotiations are under way. This will be a
difficult and, I suspect, quite a long haul, even though we are
publicly committed to achieving heads of agreement by the end of next
year if we possibly can. We all know that the prize is huge, and the
prize for SMEs is very significant. We should never forget the linkage
between that and the importance of realising a full single
market within the European Union. If we are to complete a deal with the
Americans, they will demand a deal that covers the full single market,
so we have a job of work to do, not only to negotiate with the US but

European Union enlargement. I am conscious that the comparatively late
start to these proceedings may have led to some attenuation of the
speakers list and, possibly, compression of the debate. Nevertheless, I
am pleased that this debate is so timely, given the immediate accession
of Croatia as the 28th member of the European Union; the first
accession to the rotating presidency by Lithuania since its accession
in 2004; and the imminence of the possibility of discussion about
future accession and enlargement at the upcoming European Council later
this week. This is a very timely
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T21:02:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000023">The
European Union has a long history of enlargement. Our country was part
of the first and what is still the largest wave of enlargement when we
joined what was then known as the European Community at the same time
as the Irish Republic and Denmark in 1973. Since then, there has been a
steady stream of countries seeking to join the European Union. We are
now about to embark on our seventh enlargement with Croatia. There are

is formally a reactive process. It is for individual countries to apply
to become member states. However, the Union has always had an
enlargement agenda, because enlargement is an integral lever for
development and has been accepted as such both in the founding and
successive treaties. The current agenda has two main drivers: the
first, safeguarding stability and security within wider Europe; and the
second, achieving economic prosperity and growth. I believe those two
objectives to be intimately connected. Historically, enlargement
has<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T21:04:51"></hs_TimeCode> had a
transformative power. I would evidence that by the political changes

of the EU set out three key standards that a candidate country must
meet to be eligible for membership: political, economic and the ability
to take on the obligations of membership. Although these were devised
in anticipation of central and eastern European enlargement, we were
persuaded that they still represent the right starting points for any
future enlargements. In acknowledging this, we were critical of the
Union’s failure to apply the criteria rigorously in
the cases of Romania and Bulgaria, which meant that on
joining they were not at a point where they could meet the full
obligations of membership. This, in turn, led to the creation of
somewhat unsatisfactory post-accession instruments. The Copenhagen
criteria are helpful and should not be
weakened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000029">The
road to accession for candidate countries is, rightly, not just the
warm political one; it also involves significant legal,
technical and administrative work. The first step of the official
enlargement process is an application for membership. After
granting official candidate status, the European Council must take
a unanimous decision to open formal membership negotiations.
A candidate country then conducts negotiations with Ministers and
ambassadors of the Union Governments regarding the European
Union’s body of secondary legislation—the so-called
acquis communautaire. There are 35 chapters of the acquis, such as
justice, freedom and security, judiciary and fundamental rights, and
freedom of movement for workers. Necessary reforms must be implemented
and demonstrated, and we support the rigorous approach to this that has
recently been shown. The requirements made of countries have continued
to grow and, while this is justified, the Union must take care to
ensure that the burden of work it places on candidate countries is not
insurmountable—criteria should be strictly necessary, taken in
good faith, and should be consistently applied across the
board.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000030">I do
not wish to dwell on events in any particular country, but I would say
that experience shows that we have far greater influence over our near
neighbours and candidate countries when it is clear that together, as a
Union, we are serious about enlargement and serious about
conditionality—that is, that real reforms are followed by
concrete progress in the accession process and that there are also
consequences when there is any regression. Yesterday, at a European
conference in Dublin, we heard from Valentin Inzko, the high
representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, about the importance of
developing in that country a political 
<?notus-xml column=835?>culture of tolerance and compromise. With his great experience, the high
representative was very clear about the importance of that
conditionality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000031">The
Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance seeks to provide financial
support for aspirant countries’ reforms. We were disappointed to
note the many instances of failure to convert funds from commitments to
actual spending, and so we recommended that the next IPA should focus
more on the strategic aims of the enlargement policy and the needs of
candidate countries. Furthermore, a more rigorous approach must be
taken to any backsliding over reform, with the Union being willing to
slow or halt the enlargement process and turn off the funding tap. If I
may express a personal view slightly beyond the remit of our
report, I am increasingly attracted to the option of offering western
Balkan countries in particular an opportunity to work together on what
might be termed self-help projects to which an appropriate degree of
challenge money could be made available by the Commission, with the
countries themselves being the generators for this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000032">The
Union must learn some tough lessons regarding the resolution of issues
between countries. The entry of Cyprus in 2004 without reconciliation
or conclusion between its Greek and Turkish populations has led to a
continuing entrenched dispute. That has diminished the Union’s
leverage in encouraging both sides to reach a settlement. It is
distressing and it is difficult to see the best way to handle disputes
such as this. On the one hand, using Cyprus as an example again,
resolving the dispute was rightly not a condition of joining the Union,
otherwise Turkey would simply have gained a veto over its membership.
On the other hand, without a resolution having been found,
Turkey’s accession process has itself become more challenging.
The Union must strive to find a way to keep disputes between countries
from slowing down or halting the enlargement process altogether, while
also encouraging practical solutions. There are a number of very
substantial disputes that must be resolved before the accession of the
current aspirant countries. I welcome the plan for normalisation of
relations between Serbia and Kosovo, which has been agreed under the
auspices of the High Representative and Member of this House, the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland. This has opened the way for both
Serbia and Kosovo to move forward along the road to eventual
membership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000033">I
have already touched on the political and economic advantages of
enlargement. In spite of the economic crisis, the new member states
from 2004 and 2007 have seen rapid economic growth after joining.
Similarly, compliance with the requirements of accession means that
political and, indeed, business landscapes are often changed for the
better, with a healthier balance of power between domestic parties and
an increased role for opposition parties being fairly common features
in new member states.</hs_para>

enlargement are also two-way between old and new member states: the
Union is better equipped to deal with its neighbours, and existing
member states see economic benefits from the expansion of the number of
consumers in the single market. United Kingdom exports to central and
eastern European 
<?notus-xml column=836?>countries almost trebled between 2001 and 2011,
reaching close to £14 billion in 2011. I am sure other Members
will want to speak in greater detail about the risks to certain policy
areas represented by enlargement but I shall, for now, limit myself to
suggesting that it should be possible to overcome such issues and they
should not be seen to deter, let alone to act as a bar, to any future
enlargement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000035">Debates
about enlargement and the future of the Union more generally, often
tend to focus on a perception that free movement of labour might prove
a risk to domestic labour markets. We heard compelling evidence that
this was not the case and that migrant workers had often filled gaps in
the labour markets of older member states that were otherwise unfilled
by nationals. However, it would be remiss not to acknowledge that there
have been some negative impacts from the free movement of persons. For
example, the relocation of businesses to exploit cheaper labour costs
may have impacted on member states economically, and there is
undoubtedly a risk of non-workers travelling to receive social security
benefits. However, the free movement of workers is a treaty right and
an important element of the European Union’s internal market.
Member states need to communicate generally the many advantages to
their populations and to work collectively to address any genuine
concerns that remain within the existing policy frameworks and within
those broad
objectives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000036">Turning
to the future of the enlargement process, it is right that the Union
should have a rigorous process for the admission of candidate
countries, not least to ensure that necessary reforms are introduced
and entrenched. The eastern partnership countries must undertake
significant reforms before they can be considered for candidacy, but
equally their desire to be considered should not be forgotten in
discussions about future enlargement. I hope that the eastern
partnership summit to be held in Lithuania in November is helpful in
this respect. We recognise that there is some reticence regarding
future enlargement, and we recommend, frankly, that the Commission and
national Governments together do a better job of explaining its
benefits and warning of the costs of non-enlargement. It is not a
cost-free exercise to remain with the status
quo.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000037">In
conclusion, the Union has a long history of supporting enlargement. One
could almost argue that it is within the DNA of the Union to
promote enlargement. That is the process that we in the UK have long
been associated with and from which we have benefited. Lessons must be
learnt from recent experiences, but the current economic crisis and
debates about the future role of the EU should not distract us from
this important enlargement agenda. The future economic and political
stability of Europe in many ways depends on it and it is an intimate
part of that process. I beg to

to me, “You are one of the usual suspects on Scottish

obviously, it was because I wanted even more to participate in this
debate this evening. There is a connection. If the people of Scotland
were unwise enough to vote for separation in September next year,
Scotland would have to join the queue for accession as a new member. We
deal with this in our report. We point out that it can take a very long

benefits—the greater stability that we have in Europe as a
result of the strengthening of the European Union. Conditionality has

democratise, to ensure the rule of law in their countries and other

the report expresses some concerns about the loss of momentum on

I take in particular the case of Turkey. My own view is that recent
events in Turkey have increased rather than decreased the need for
Turkey to move towards EU membership. Whether it is any likelier or not
is a different matter, but I certainly think that it would help. The

Turkey<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Can the

have two caveats in relation to enlargement. The first, as we say in
the report, is that there should not be a rush to agree to countries
being allowed in as members without sorting out difficulties first. The
noble Lord, Lord Boswell, mentioned Cyprus. That teaches us that border
disputes must be resolved first. This is a message to Serbia in
particular which I hope goes out loud and clear. It is a precondition
of Serbia’s ultimate membership that the dispute over its claim
to Kosovo is resolved. Bulgaria and Romania remind us that we should
not rush to agree membership until all the acquis have been complied
with. We should not expect that they can be sorted out
afterwards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T21:21:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

second caveat in relation to enlargement is a personal one, probably
not shared by all—or any—of the other members of the
Select Committee. Europe is not infinitely elastic on the eastern side.
The northern and western boundaries are clearly defined by
the oceans, the southern boundary is defined by the
Mediterranean Sea, but the eastern boundary is not clear. I
have personal reservations about countries self-defining
themselves as European and then being accepted as long as they satisfy
the acquis. We should not be straying into taking
over—annexing, in effect—what are essentially Asian
countries just because they want to classify themselves as
European and be members of the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T21:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062698000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#13062698000045">We
then come to the question of differential membership: flexible
geometry, two-tier, associate membership or however you would like to
describe it. Our Prime Minister sometimes seems to hanker after some
kind of associate membership for the United Kingdom but the
Government’s response to our report, thankfully, rejects a
permanent alternative to full membership. Perhaps, if I am not asking
too much of her, the Minister could explain this apparent schizophrenia
coming from the Government. Perhaps it is because she is in one party
and the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is in another or some such underlying
effect. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, tells me they are joined at the

to keep well within my time, all of this assumes that we stay in the

greatly from European Union membership and that, as an important
corollary, other countries benefit from the United Kingdom being a
member of the European Union, which is not an unimportant matter. The
isolationist, Little Englander argument of UKIP is exactly the same as

they have been a fundamental motor of that process and that wish to
include states, rather than to put to the side or exclude them from the
European Union and its predecessors. I certainly believe
that process should be spread, if perhaps not everywhere. In
fact, in researching for this debate, I noticed one thing
which I had forgotten: that Morocco was rejected when an application
was made, I think quite rightly. I believe that we should
extend European Union membership and candidature, if not as far as
possible, then certainly to the east. Perhaps I slightly differ
in that from the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes. As long as the
states meet all those criteria, we should extend it whether
it is to Ukraine or Moldova and even to Belarus, if that
could ever be the case, or Armenia. I agree that there may be certain
issues in going slightly further east, but that should be our aim. All
organisations, as we know, eventually start to move backwards if they
are not moving forward.</hs_para>

said, one very important area that came out of this report is that
ultimately there is no alternative to full membership. Those states

and the neighbourhood policy for the south and east, none of

find I am very critical of how one area has been handled in the
European Union. That is the way in which we have been very selective
about the timing of candidate countries. When it comes to Turkey, its
first application was made in 1987 and 12 years later, in 1999, Turkey
became a candidate country. To date, we have opened 13 chapters and
closed only one, so there is all that uncertainty. Turkey is a very
important economy and candidate country, and Europe is mismanaging that
process. Frankly, the worst case of all, which shows all the specific
European divisions, is Macedonia. Its application was made in 2004 and
its candidature was agreed in 2005 but the number of chapters
opened—let alone closed—still stands at absolutely zero.
That is utterly unacceptable. We know why this situation exists. It is
again because of boundary disputes, particularly name disputes, between
that country and an existing member state. We must make sure that we
are far more consistent about that.</hs_para>

years ago I went to a conference in Brussels on enlargement, arranged
by the then-Belgian presidency. I went with the noble Lords, Lord
Harris and Lord Bowness, and the conference was very well attended. We
debated enlargement fatigue, and that idea was of course rejected by
the delegates. There was a great feeling that we should move forward
with enlargement, particularly with the western Balkans. There was only
one difficulty with that conference. No parliamentarian from Germany
turned up, and not one from Spain. There might have been one from
France, but none from Italy. It was an example of how for many of the
larger nations, particularly those towards the west of Europe, the
enlargement agenda had greatly receded. We need to stop
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306271000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306271000008">As we
approach the anniversary of 1914, it is so obvious that I again risk a
cliché by saying that the travails of Europe from 1914 through
to 1989 started in the western Balkans. If there is a sacred mission
for Europe, it is integrating the western Balkans into the European
Union, under the right conditions. We could then offer security,
freedom, a market economy and the type of atmosphere that we would want
to live in, not only to the people living in the western Balkans but to
Europe as a whole. As other noble Lords have said, it is an irony that
although Britain is still foremost in asking for and promoting
enlargement, we have started a feeling within the rest of Europe that
Britain is itself heading for the exit. That is not just a paradox; it
is potentially a contradiction in our policy. It threatens to dilute
our ability to champion the cause of
enlargement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306271000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306271000009">Two

one of the areas that was formerly part of the Soviet Union, and the
authorities were very careful to make sure that it was patrolled. There
is a museum about the local Soviet commissars and everything else under
the Soviet occupation. Yet Estonia is now one of the most vibrant
liberal democracies. The economy is moving upward. The country is a
member of the eurozone, and very successful. The country now wants more

timeliness of the debate is wider than such rather ephemeral

crisis, and a certain air of enlargement fatigue, has caused this issue

Yet, as is shown by this report, the quality of which owes much to the
skilful chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, the further
enlargement of the EU is of significant importance to the future
security and prosperity of the union, and to its prospects of playing a
stabilising role in its immediate neighbourhood and beyond. We would be
deluding ourselves if we thought that the process of definitively
putting behind us the mayhem which engulfed the Balkans in the 1990s
could be achieved without setting all the countries in that region on a
sustainable path towards membership. We should equally be deluding
ourselves if we thought that we could turn our backs on Turkey, the
most vibrant economy in Europe and a rising regional influence, without
serious negative consequences for ourselves. We should also be deluding
ourselves if we believed that cold-shouldering the European aspirations
of countries which emerged from the former Soviet Union to a shaky
independence would not further Russia’s ambitions to create for
itself a sphere of influence around its borders. Quite a lot is
therefore at stake in the way the EU handles its further enlargement,

purposefully at the

addition to these general geopolitical considerations in favour of
further enlargement, I want to focus on three specific issues: first,
the need to avoid importing into the EU existing territorial disputes,
either between future member states or between them and their
neighbours; secondly, the need to guard against backsliding by new
member states on their commitment to the Copenhagen criteria for
membership after they have joined the club; and, thirdly, Turkey, where
recent developments have been troubling for its friends even though
they should not, I would contend, have shaken their fundamental support
for Turkish
accession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T21:36:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306271000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306271000013">With
the benefit of hindsight, most people now recognise that the
EU’s handling of the accession of Cyprus with the division of
the island unresolved was, to use a diplomatic phrase, suboptimal. The
report that we are debating said as much, and it has since been roundly
denounced for it by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots—a symmetry
of denunciation which in my own lengthy and fairly painful experience
of trying to resolve the Cyprus problem normally means that you have
got it about right. It is not hard to identify similar disputes in
relation to the existing candidates and aspirants: Cyprus, again, in
the context of Turkish accession; Serbia and Kosovo; Macedonia and
Greece; Moldova and Transnistria; and a whole rash in the republics
beyond the Caucasus. That does not make them any easier to resolve. In
the case of Cyprus’s accession, one can see that the EU would in
theory have done better to make settlement of the dispute a condition
of accession. However, to have done that at a time when the leader of
the Turkish Cypriots, the late Rauf Denktas, and the then Government of
Turkey were making any attempts at compromise completely nugatory would
have been to hand them a veto which they would not have hesitated to
use. There are parallels with some of the future members. Each case
will need to be treated on its own merits and the EU needs to address
each in a timely and proactive fashion as it is doing, admirably in my
view, in the case 
<?notus-xml column=842?>of Serbia and Kosovo. There is no magic solution, no template, for every
case. What one can say is that some unilateral attempts at exercising
pressure, such as Greece’s continuing blockage on even opening
negotiations with Macedonia, are both counterproductive and deplorable.

is also the problem of backsliding on the Copenhagen criteria and other
values and responsibilities of membership. There is experience of that
in the cases of Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania. It has become painfully
evident that the EU is better placed to handle such problems before a
country has joined the Union than it is afterwards, although some
instruments are available even after accession, if extremely hard to
apply. Again, as in the case of international disputes, there are no
obvious, easy and universally applicable solutions, but it seems
desirable to ensure that, before a country accedes, the basic values
which justify its membership are firmly entrenched in that
country’s laws and constitution, and that the machinery to
uphold those values is in good working order. I rather doubt whether
new dispositions for handling post-accession transgressions will prove
either negotiable or
operable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306271000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306271000015">Recent

the technical aspects of the accession negotiations. If that process

forms took over responsibility. Every new member of the EU has
benefited economically from trade within the EU —even
more recently while the older member states have suffered recession.

we can now dispense with the phrase “enlargement

mistake again. Peace in Kosovo today is one of the cornerstones of EU
foreign policy, stoutly defended by the EEAS through various policy
channels. It is a major EU project. In fact, it is the largest
recipient of EU investment per head anywhere in the world. Quite apart
from security guarantees, there is a huge human and
financial investment in Kosovo’s future as Europe’s

on 19 April. Indeed, an earlier agreement was announced by Commissioner
Füle on the very day that the committee took evidence from him
in Brussels. Just two more border points between Kosovo and Serbia had
been established. I well remember the excitement in the Commission that
yet another small but significant step had been achieved.
Implementation followed in May. The noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, met
Prime Ministers Dacic and Thaçi last Thursday and reported on
Friday that the EEAS had reviewed the implementation plan and that
there had been concrete progress and further agreements on justice,
police and the forthcoming municipal elections. This is important

and corruption can still be found as much within the KLF ex-combatants

confirmed this week, especially for Scotland and Northern Ireland,
where agriculture is important; and the ongoing major issue of banking
union within the EU.</hs_para>

when I was a member of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, we
regularly met the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. One occasion
always stuck in my head. The Prime Minister said: “You should
encourage greater enlargement of the European Union, because the more
countries that 
<?notus-xml column=846?>join, the more likely it is to collapse”. That was the
understanding of what enlargement would mean in practice. There could
be some truth in it. Croatia is now about to become a member and
yesterday it was agreed to commence Serbia’s accession
negotiations and an association agreement with Kosovo as well. Of
course, all this is subject to the approval of the European Council,
but enlargement is
ongoing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000015">One of
the conditions is that new members in the European Union should also
accept the euro as their currency. The Chancellor in his Statement on
the economy today said that the eurozone is in crisis. That phrase has
been used by several contributors to this debate this evening. It is
the case in Portugal, Spain, Greece, Greek Cyprus and the Republic of
Ireland; you have only to look at the <I>Financial Times</I> today to
see the leaked tapes about the banking situation in the Anglo-Irish
Bank to realise that there are ongoing problems in the eurozone. There
are increasing fears about Italy as well over the next six months. As

France is yet to

Turkey has its problems. Democracy in any country is not simply rule by
the majority, it also requires the consent of the minority, and that
does not seem to apply in Turkey today. We have the decision yesterday
to start further accession talks on Turkey, which has aroused
opposition from Germany, France, Austria and Greek Cyprus. It seems
difficult to foresee Turkey being able to join the European Union, and

for me. It is the first time that I have spoken in your
Lordships’ House on Europe, yet I am a child of that project, my
life having followed the momentous moves that we have seen on the
post-war continent. I was born to a member of the occupying forces in
Germany in 1949. I worked in Brussels from 1 January 1973, the day on
which we joined the Common Market. I have been involved in the EU as it
went from six to nine to 12 to 15, and shortly it will be
28. Particularly on that other 9/11, 9 November 1989, I watched as the
wall began to fall. Then I worked in the European Parliament as the
enlarged Germany took its place in the then European
Community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000025">The
EU, for many of us, embedded post-war security and democracy, then went
on to help Greece, Spain and Portugal shake off their pasts and enter
the democratic family. As we have just been reminded, just days away we
will similarly welcome Croatia. As the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton of
Upholland, the EU’s High Representative, has said,
Croatia’s membership is good for it, but also for the rest of
the EU.</hs_para>

It enables us to pay tribute to those who helped bring this about and
to note how this accession of Croatia reminds us of the journey that
Europe has made and how far a country like Croatia has come towards a
more peaceful and prosperous future. That is not to say that there are
no lessons to be learnt. We also pay tribute to the excellent report
that is typical of the analysis that your Lordships’ committee
brings to its work under the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord
Boswell, to which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has already paid
tribute.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000027">That
analysis is much needed when attitudes to Europe are driven by emotion
rather than rational calculation of our national interest and when the
governing party engages in some meaningless posturing with the European
Union (Referendum) Bill, as it will do in the debate in another place
next week. Today we are talking not about pulling out, about a smaller
Europe, but about EU enlargement, a proud achievement of the previous
Government. When Labour came into office in 1997, Europe had dithered
for eight years about enlargement after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
There was talk of long delays, of eastern countries moving slowly
towards membership, with perhaps two or three joining in five years and
others perhaps never to
join.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000028">Labour
took a bolder approach, helped by Lionel Jospin in France, Gerhard
Schroeder in Germany and the enthusiastic Commission president, Romano
Prodi. Even more, the 1999 Kosovo conflict was a wake-up call,
demonstrating the risks that Europe was running post-Cold War. The
division of Europe into two opposing blocs had disappeared, but we
risked a return of ugly nationalism, ethnic cleansing and mass murder;
a risk that the European Union was not prepared to tolerate. Just as,
in earlier years, the EU had helped cement democracy in Spain, Portugal
and Greece, so now it knew that enlargement could help the new emerging
democracies gain independence and self-respect in a framework that
guaranteed stability and the rule of law, while the single market and
structural funds promoted economic development. Ten new democracies
joined in a big bang in 2004, with Bulgaria and Romania set for
membership in
2007.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000029">To those
who say that the EU can never change, this was the biggest
transformation in its history. Did Europe get it absolutely right? The
report offers some legitimate points of criticism, albeit in very
diplomatic language. Some member states were not as ready as they might
have been. There have been concerns about criminal gangs and the
functioning of the Bulgarian state. There are allegations of systemic
corruption in Romania. In several countries, the legislation for
equality of treatment for the Roma has been honoured only in the
breach. Some new members even show signs of regression to a darker
past. There are concerns about the Government in Hungary.
Constitutional changes have packed the courts and the central bank with
government cronies, limited the ability of opposition parties to
function and even curtailed freedom of the press and of religion.
Tragically, anti-Semitism is again literally on the march within the
boundaries of the Union.</hs_para>

have solved these problems by keeping those countries out of the EU.
Indeed, increasing their isolation and inhibiting economic development
would have aggravated those very problems. But once countries are in,
they must live up to the obligations of membership. There must be no
backsliding, to use the words of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. There is
a suspicion around that the Government have pulled their punches in
criticising the Hungarian Government because they see Hungary as an
ally in their search for some sort of looser relationship with Europe.
Shame on them if that is the case. There should be no loosening of the
EU’s commitment to democracy and human rights. If breaches of
these principles increase, action must be
taken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000031">The EU
can be a positive force for change in applicant states, both before and
after entry, as has been made clear during the debate. The EU helped
Slovakia on to a democratic path and secured fairer treatment of its
Hungarian minorities. Croatia will join on 1 July, having accepted that
the price of membership was to surrender suspected war criminals to
international justice. It has made great steps in order to satisfy the
criteria, to the benefit of its people. Serbia has shown flexibility on
the Kosovo question, the incentive being the opening of membership
negotiations, as described by the noble Lord, Lord Boswell. That is why
enlargement should
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000032">What
about the argument that enlargement has led to more migrants than we
can accommodate? Well, we underestimated the numbers who would come
here after 2004, and there were adverse consequences for the wages of
the low-skilled, and pressures on housing, but the answer is not to
blame the Poles or other migrants or the policy of enlargement. It is
to build more housing and to ensure that the minimum wage is enforced.
It is exactly in order to prevent wage undercutting that Labour will
try to get the posted workers directive revised because, I am sad to
report, the Government are failing to tackle the exploitation of
foreign workers, which leads to the undercutting of local workers. The
Government are failing to enforce the national minimum wage. They have
taken no action on agencies recruiting only from abroad and no action
to extend the gangmasters licensing legislation. Furthermore, they have
failed to champion the enormous contribution EU migrants make to our
hospitality and healthcare sectors. Indeed, I sometimes think that our
social care system would be near collapse without them, while had we
implemented UKIP’s policy of EU withdrawal and sent eastern
Europeans home, we would have to handle the return of elderly Britons
who had retired to France, Portugal or Spain but who would no longer be
entitled to live
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000033">We stand

<?notus-xml column=850?>the important issue of EU enlargement under the spotlight in this
inquiry. The report and this debate are timely. As many noble Lords

cross-party support shown by this House towards EU enlargement. The
Government believe that this support is justified. As the
report under debate recognises, enlargement offers benefits
to the UK, the EU and the candidate countries themselves. First, there
are political benefits, as the power of enlargement drives reform.
Secondly, there are economic benefits, as the benefits of political
reform help create a larger and more prosperous single market. Thirdly,
there is the benefit of security, as better-functioning states,
integrated and at peace with their neighbours, reduce the space for
organised crime and corruption, and help to spread peace and
stability across the region. However, to ensure a credible enlargement
policy, progress must be based on candidates meeting the proper
standards—as set out in the Copenhagen criteria and the
EU’s acquis—through firm, but fair, conditionality. The
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, highlighted some of these challenges. I
can assure her of the Government’s commitment to these
standards, and to the values of the

accession demonstrates this clearly. Croatia will be the first western
Balkan country that was involved in the conflicts of the 1990s to join

negotiations yet will be marked on 1 July; Croatia is joining the EU

process of transformation will not stop when Croatia joins the EU.
Membership provides the foundations for Croatia to continue to tackle
domestic challenges; offers opportunities to harness the potential of
the single market and to co-operate with member states in tackling
cross-boundary challenges such as climate change and organised crime
more effectively; and provides the tools to help Croatia return to
sustainable, competitive growth through access to the world’s
biggest single marketplace and to the EU’s structural and
cohesion funds. Croatia’s success is important as a
catalyst in the region, too. It provides the clearest

rule of law reforms in accession countries is fundamental to the
success of enlargement. Rule of law reform has been central
to Croatia’s progress,

not just the political conditionality that is evolving. In the context
of Europe’s economic challenges, the Council’s
conclusions on the European Commission’s 2012 enlargement
strategy flagged that enlargement must also deliver economic success,
not least given the current requirement for new member states to join
the euro area. This is also crucial to ensuring that EU membership
remains a strong incentive for aspirant countries. The Government are
committed to the principle that eventual membership is open to all
European countries, so long as they meet the criteria as set out in the
EU treaties. We share the view set out by the committee in its report

agree with him that the prospect of membership is often the only thing
strong enough to overcome the powerful vested interests that too often
stand against political and economic reforms. It is therefore vital
that the EU both maintains momentum on the enlargement process and
ensures that it delivers on its side of the bargain. We should not
forget the opportunity costs of turning countries away from
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000042">The
risk that candidates may tire of the struggle if rewards are not
forthcoming is real, as the committee’s assessment notes. That
is one reason why the UK has supported innovations in the enlargement
approach, such as the new approach to rule of law issues. Ensuring that
candidates can start to feel the benefits of their reforms early on can
help reinforce the necessary political commitment. It is the
responsibility of every member state to ensure that this momentum is
sustained. Artificial pauses, which some call for to resist what they
fear is an inexorable expansion, are misleading and damaging. They can
damage the confidence of aspirants in the EU’s credibility and
impact on the long-term benefits of EU enlargement. Such calls are also
predicated on the misunderstanding that enlargement is inevitable:
progress towards accession is based on candidates’ own merits,
and is far from guaranteed.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T22:14:54"></hs_TimeCode> is also
important for the integrity and continued momentum of the enlargement
process that bilateral issues are managed constructively and do not
affect EU enlargement policy or any candidate’s accession
negotiations. Ensuring the continued centrality of the spirit of good
neighbourly relations is therefore vital. As long as the accession
process remains adaptable to the conditions of each country, able to
respond flexibly to new pressures and to learn from past mistakes, the
process of negotiations should not be a barrier to individual
countries’
progress.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_26_PT_1/381555626267674C615D05723416FC935022C9D4" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 June 2013">Wednesday,

Foulkes, and my noble friend Lord Teverson referred specifically to the
Prime Minister’s view. The Prime Minister’s vision for a
better Europe is central to our conditions-based approach to 
<?notus-xml column=852?>enlargement. We take strength from the EU’s expanding membership,
which is essential in bringing creativity and expertise to the EU. In
fact, further enlargement increases this diversity and creativity, but
further enlargement does not simply mean more

noble Lords, Lord Foulkes, Lord Hannay, and Lord Kilclooney, and my
noble friend Lord Teverson raised the issue of Turkey. The Government
continue to support strongly Turkey’s accession. In December,
the UK worked hard with other pro-Turkey member states to secure
enlargement conclusions endorsed by the European Council, which
reaffirmed the EU’s commitment to an active and credible
accession process. The Turkish Government welcomed these. The
enlargement conclusions we secured in December 2012 were
forward-looking and gave the Irish presidency and EU institutions a
strong mandate to make real progress in 2013. We welcomed recent
improvements in relations between France and Turkey and France’s
decision to lift its block on Chapter 22 on regional policy. We are
pleased that, despite last-minute German concerns, a deal was reached
on Chapter 22 allowing a technical
opening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T22:16:59"></hs_TimeCode>. I note
the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, but, like him, I believe,
and the Government believe, that progress on the accession process is
the best way to support Turkish reform. Now more than ever the EU needs
to engage with Turkey. The recent protests serve to highlight the
strategic imperative of EU support to Turkey’s accession process
as a driver of domestic
reform<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T22:17:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000045">The
noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, also raised the issue of Serbia’s
recognition of Kosovo. I agree with the conclusions of the report that
bilateral disputes should not play a role in the accession process. The
pull of the EU has already delivered considerable progress in the
normalisation of Serbia’s relationship with Kosovo. Part of the
April dialogue agreement was a clear commitment from Serbia not to
block or encourage others to block progress on Kosovo’s EU
path<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T22:18:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306273000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-0003.htm#1306273000046">My
noble friend Lord Boswell also raised the issue of the IPA. The
Government share fully the committee’s view of the importance of
a strategically targeted instrument for pre-accession assistance. We
have pressed strongly for a more results focused instrument closely
linked to the objectives of the enlargement strategy for the period
2014 to 2020.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Boswell and the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, also
questioned whether enlargement was losing its momentum. The strategic
benefits of enlargement for both current and future members will be
realised only if the process is an economic and political success. To
achieve this is likely to need time, with each country only moving
forward as and when it is ready, once it has addressed its specific
challenges. Clear results over time will enable us to communicate and
demonstrate the ongoing benefits to EU citizens. The EU needs to
facilitate enlargement, but the rate of progress needs to be determined
by the aspirant countries

Sandwich, asked about Kosovo and specifically about the EU’s
rule of law mission in Kosovo. The Government believe that this has a
vital role to play in enabling Kosovo to meet EU standards in the rule
of law. The mission has had several successes, 
<?notus-xml column=853?>including customs standards, integrated border management and the return
of the remains of nearly 300 individuals missing since the war. The UK

Hannay, spoke of the impact of bilateral disputes. He mentioned Cyprus
as a clear reminder of the need to seek ways to avoid the importation
of bilateral disputes into the enlargement process. On this, the
Government share the committee’s views fully. We will continue
to work with the Commission and other member states to encourage an
open and transparent approach to resolving disputes and to explore
mechanisms to protect the momentum of the enlargement

as relevant today as it ever has been, notwithstanding the changing
economic and political landscape in Europe. It is a vital tool for
Europe in promoting democracy, encouraging freedoms and increasing the
potential of the single market to the benefit of aspirant countries and
existing members. The Government’s vision of a reformed EU is
therefore not just compatible with but mutually supportive of a robust
and successful enlargement policy that delivers increased diversity and
a larger single market, ensuring that countries are fully prepared to
contribute positively to a more effective EU upon their

process of reuniting Europe lies in tackling the remaining challenges
of the western Balkans and reinvigorating Turkey’s accession

once again, I welcome the committee’s report. It is a reminder
that, although there are challenges to be addressed, we remain

communicate the benefits of enlargement to people across the EU and to

should take just a moment further than that to reflect on the fact
that, while there are always differences of emphasis and occasionally
of substance, generally there has been what I would describe—I
include in this both Front Benches and the other

inappropriate to comment on each speech, but perhaps I may break from
that and refer just for a moment to the noble Lord, Lord Teverson. He
has made a distinguished contribution tonight but I should like, in
particular, to reflect on the fact that he has recently left the chair
of our External Affairs Sub-Committee, which he served with great

that, in this House at least, matters connected with the European Union
are treated seriously, sensibly and constructively. I think that we
have generally met those obligations. Equally, there is a sense of
diffidence or restraint because we know that this is not an area in
which the United Kingdom would expect to take unilateral
action or where we should expect magic solutions immediately. We need
to continue to work patiently with other member states and with our
friends who see this agenda as important. I should perhaps have
recorded that we need to continue what has been a very constructive
dialogue with Commissioner Füle and his Cabinet and other
members of the Commission who are also committed to these objectives.
We need to keep the process very much at the forefront of our
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T22:24:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I

modestly—is at least to set the climate for doing that and to

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 18,
which amends paragraph 4(9) of Schedule 9, I shall also
speak to Amendment 19, which makes an identical amendment to
paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 11. These are minor and technical
amendments that ensure the provisions in the Bill which limit fines for
unauthorised disclosure of information incorporate the changes being
made to limits on fines by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders Act 2012, known lovingly to many noble Lords as the LASPO
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062667000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062667000003">The Bill
currently provides for what happens if the provisions in the 2012 Act
come into force before the day on which the Bill is passed. It omits to
provide for what happens if the 2012 Act comes into force on the same
day as this Bill is passed. The amendments correct that omission. If
commencement of this Bill precedes commencement of the relevant part of
LASPO, that legislation provides for such changes to be applied to
earlier legislation. This means that, once the provisions of the 2012
Act are in effect, which, among other things not relevant here, removes
the upper limit—previously set at £5,000—on level
5 fines, any offences committed after that time which would be subject
to such a fine would no longer be limited to a maximum fine of
£5,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062667000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062667000004">The
effect of this part of the LASPO Act 2012 on the Bill is that it will
ensure that offences relating to the unauthorised disclosure of audit
information provided for data-matching exercises or the wrongful
disclosure of information by an auditor or inspector or a person acting
on their behalf will continue to be treated as seriously as other
offences previously subject to level 5 fines, and will ensure that for
more serious offences the punishment can better fit the crime. I
therefore beg to move Amendment 18 and that Amendment 19 be moved at
the appropriate time during discussion of Schedule
11.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13062667000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062667000088">Amendment

data-matching powers currently exercised by the Audit Commission
through the national fraud initiative have been a considerable success,
having identified nearly £1 billion of fraud, errors and
overpayments since 1996. It is important that the NFI is found an
appropriate home in the new regime and we understand and accept that
discussions are under way to make this happen. Probing this is not the
purpose of the amendment although if the Minister has an update for us
it would be good to hear.</hs_para>

prompted by the Audit Commission, which has expressed concern that some
of the data-matching exercises that it undertakes at present under its
audit powers would not be available to any new body as they would not
fall within the additional purposes provided for in Clause 8(2).
However, it has instanced a data-matching exercise to assist with
identifying maladministration which it undertook concerning GP lists.
This was done as part of the national duplicate registration initiative
and sought to identify such matters as deceased persons registrations
or duplicate registrations. The two most recent exercises led to more
than a quarter of a million patient registrations being
removed—saving some £16 million—and some 30,000
patient records ending up with current rather than previous
GPs.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062667000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062667000009">This
work targets error rather than fraud so would not be covered by the
Bill as it stands. There is quite properly a sensitivity about data
matching and we support the safeguards which are included in Schedule 9
restricting the use of such exercises and protecting certain data.
There is also the code of data-matching practice which has been drawn
up by the Audit Commission, the maintenance of which will become the
responsibility of a relevant Minister under the Bill. Clearly, data
matching has, as a matter of fact, been undertaken under powers which
will seemingly not be available in the future under the Bill. Where
does this 
<?notus-xml column=221?>leave exercises such as the national duplicate registration initiative
in the future? Will the initiative be conducted, at least in part, by
data matching, by whom and under what powers?
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T15:51:38"></hs_TimeCode> NDRI is just
one example. Perhaps I may ask the Minister whether there have been
discussions with the Audit Commission about the demise of its audit
powers in this regard and how matters will be handled in the
future.</hs_para>

is a further matter concerning the extent to which those fall within
the mandatory provisions of data requirements. The Bill retains this
requirement for those currently required to do so and now includes
foundation trusts. The Bill also enables the adding-in of other public
bodies subject to consultation and regulation. Has any consideration
been given to adding in any further public bodies? What assessment has
been undertaken of this possibility? One possibility raised with us has
been adding in housing associations which currently participate only on
a voluntary basis. Data matching has proved to be a powerful tool in
helping bodies to detect potential tenancy fraud and we are advised
that just one RSL which participated in 2010-11 recovered 12 properties
from illegal occupation which were able to be reallocated to general
tenants. There is a continuing imperative for local authorities and
RSLs to manage their stock in the most effective way given the housing
crisis which faces the country and punitive measures such as the
bedroom tax.</hs_para>

interest in targeting fraud but also—I hope—in the
prevention and detection of maladministration and error. This is all
the more important given the huge cuts in local authority budgets and
of course the further dreadful announcements from the Chancellor just a
few hours ago. Data matching has a role to play provided there are
robust safeguards. At the very least the Government should justify any

is the possibility of spreading the data protection rules and
investigations even further than they are now. They are pretty strong
already in the Bill and detection of maladministration and error is
done by many local authorities—I am not sure about health
authorities—in their internal and external audits. One of the
main raisons d’être for that is to look for
maladministration and error. As my noble friend will know, such audits
are independent of the other departments of the local authority or

it will not have those

from the local to the national level, issues about function creep,

talking about, are there for others to object to. I stress again that
we have to be careful about how easily we allow this to extend further.

acknowledged the point that once the Audit Commission goes, some of the
powers that it has used to do data matching will fall with it. Those
will not automatically be picked up in the Bill or elsewhere, but that
is the subject of ongoing discussion. I should just say in defence of
the Audit Commission, if it needs it, that these data-matching
exercises were not done in any sort of clandestine way. It published
the results, particularly on this one initiative to show its benefits.

take the point entirely that there is already provision in the Bill for
those who have to participate on a mandatory basis. I guess that part
of my question was: is it intended in relation to housing associations
to perhaps kick-start a consultation? Some do participate but I
understand that it is quite a small percentage, and it looks as if some
of the benefits could be quite significant for them to participate.
That has nothing to do with extending the powers of data matching, but
just extending the basis of those who are required to participate.

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am a vice-president of the LGA but I
am not sure that I will retain that position after what I have to say.
I am afraid that I do not entirely concur with the sentiments and
positions taken by the two noble Lords who have spoken thus far. I said
in a previous Committee sitting that I had a concern that, although the
Audit Commission was, in fairness, asked by the previous Government to
over-regulate, overprescribe and over-report, it nevertheless performed
a valuable role in looking particularly at the interface between
services and the comparisons between different types of authority.
Actually that information, contrary to what the noble Earl, Lord
Lytton, said, should inform local debate. It does not supplant it. It
should help to facilitate the citizens to hold their local authority to
account, because they must have some comparative data to see how well
or badly they are doing in relation to other authorities. That will be
one of the things that we will miss. I express a hope—or, put
another way, a fear—that with only six value-for-money studies
to be carried out by the NAO, which I understand is the position, we
would lose that independent assessment of what local authorities are

of peer review and of the work that the LGA has done in promoting
improvements across the sector, and it has done very well in that
regard, but when it comes to an objective assessment, the perception
will be that that is an in-house job. It is better in my view that
there should be a role for a body like the Audit Commission
was—and currently still is, temporarily—or the National
Audit Office will be. That is something that this amendment would very
much restrict. Yet the formulation here depends on a division of
resources, and whence comes the money? Of course, increasingly we will
see national organisations, be it in the health service or other

Beecham:</Member></B> Yes, whole place. It is playing with words, and
of course Labour words such as “total” are not
acceptable. Within these areas there will of course be collaboration,
and the proportion of funding will vary considerably. For example, in
public health, less than 50% of government money will be coming in, so 
<?notus-xml column=228?>the Audit Commission would presumably be prohibited from taking a look
at the effectiveness of that. It is not an audit job in that sense, but
it is particularly desirable that it should address the issues of
effectiveness and outcome, not purely in financial terms but across the
piece as well, and that in itself should facilitate the work that the
LGA and individual local authorities are doing, particularly in their
scrutiny functions, to see how they are faring relative to others, and
for that information to be communicated to the people who elect them.
So I certainly could not support these amendments. I understand what
the noble Lords are saying, but I think that a mission creep has
overtaken their amendments as well. They were going too far in the
interests of local democracy and the effectiveness of local
government.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_26_PT_1/75081B2EEEC49089617A10E8A95A917172EE2D9E" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 June 2013">Wednesday,

can see that, for certain bodies, it is a test that is currently
relatively straightforward to determine. However, if you seek to apply
it to a local authority you can imagine the sort of criteria that you
would have to unpick and examine. Presumably it is not part of
government funds to take account of its income which comes from council
tax. What happens when you come to the business rate? Is it part of its
income? Do you look at the gross amount or the 50% under business
retention that goes to central government and then comes back? Is that
still government funding? Does it originate with the local authorities?
All the issues around how tariffs, top-ups and safety nets work just
from that regime itself could make that particular test in the context
of local authorities extremely difficult to apply. It would be easy in
some cases where either they would be clearly in or clearly out but I
would be surprised if there were not a whole range where it would be
extremely
problematic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:22:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

as I understand it, is that the Auditor-General can carry out
examinations of bodies when more than half of their income comes from
public funds and where they are appointed by or on behalf of the Crown.
I am not quite sure how you translate that into the local authority
context but it seems to me that the basic proposition which the noble
Lords are seeking to achieve in terms of avoiding mission creep and
certainly league tables is already in the Bill.</hs_para>

broadens the Comptroller and Auditor-General’s powers to enable
the National Audit Office to undertake examinations on groups of
relevant authorities, enabling a more end-to-end view on the use of
public money. The powers in Clause 34 have been designed deliberately
to support the National Audit Office in undertaking its core roles. It
enables examinations that support the National Audit Office either in
holding the Government to account to Parliament or in providing
analysis and advice that is useful to the sector. By definition, this
does not mean that the NAO will be examining or reporting on individual
authorities. It means that the comptroller can look at what is going on
in a local authority but only in relevance to a wider group or area in

Auditor-General to undertake examinations only on groups of relevant
authorities that received more than half their funds from government. I
think that that is where the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has stepped in
and given a pretty clear explanation of why this is not going to work.
The amendment is overly restrictive and would not support the National
Audit Office in fulfilling its core roles. The Audit Commission
currently has powers to undertake examinations in relation to all
relevant authorities. Removing relevant authorities that receive less
that half their resources from the Government would mean that the
National Audit Office could not look across the whole spectrum and thus
do its job. The amendment would also reduce the level of scrutiny of
public  
<?notus-xml column=230?>spending that the NAO could carry out, including all the other elements
mentioned by the noble Lord regarding the way that grants are paid and
the money that goes into local
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062683000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062683000009">Amendment 18ZB
would prevent the Comptroller and Auditor-General from undertaking
examinations for the purpose of assessing the performance of individual
authorities or the production of league tables. Clause 34(2)
already provides for the first part of this. It states that a
value-for-money examination must relate either to all authorities or to
a particular description of relevant authority, and it is extremely
unlikely that an individual authority would meet those criteria. An
individual authority could be looked at but only in relation to a group
and could not be identified as one authority. The Explanatory Notes set
out that these powers are not designed for the National Audit Office to
produce an assessment of the performance of individual authorities or
comparative analyses in the form of published league tables. The
Government do not wish to see a return to the comprehensive
area assessment of local authorities. The NAO’s evidence to the
pre-legislative scrutiny committee on the draft Bill confirmed that it
is seeking neither to audit individual local authorities nor to
interfere with the primary accountability of local authorities to the
local electorate.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062683000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062683000010">However, the
clause does not prohibit comparisons of individual authorities during
the course of the examination. This is because such group or overall
analysis is necessary in order for the National Audit Office to make
conclusions about the economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which
authorities in a particular group are using resources, or to provide
evaluation, commentary and advice to relevant authorities. We believe
that the Clause 34 will give the National Audit Office a
strengthened role in the assessment of value for money,
which the Government said we wanted to achieve when we announced the
intention to close the Audit Commission. I know that that intention has
received a great deal of parliamentary support, including from the
Communities and Local Government Select Committee, the committee which
undertook scrutiny of the draft local audit Bill last autumn, and from
many noble Lords during our discussions.</hs_para>

understand—and I know that the National Audit Office does
too—the concerns that have been expressed about the risks of
scope drift or expansion of the programme beyond what is intended. I
believe that there are safeguards in the Bill that mitigate against
these risks. I emphasise that it is not the Government’s
intention to replicate the Audit Commission’s programme of
studies. The powers are narrower than the Audit Commission’s and
there will be fewer studies. Although the examinations programme is
ultimately a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor-General, Parliament
undertakes a full and thorough scrutiny of the National Audit
Office’s strategy and budget. The House of Commons Public
Accounts Committee scrutinises the strategy and budget annually,
including the balance of work between different roles, before approving
the National Audit Office’s budget for the year ahead.</hs_para>

requirement to publish statutory notices in the local newspaper was
introduced in 1972. We lived in a completely different world 40 years
ago where we would not have envisaged the enormous changes in
communication and media opportunities that have taken place over that
time. In 1972 a statutory notice in a well-read local newspaper quite
probably was the most effective way of communicating with residents. In
2013, I would suggest that a frankly rather boring, hard-to-read notice
published somewhere in the middle and back pages of, perhaps sadly, a
much less well-read local newspaper, is the least effective way of all
the opportunities now available to communicate any information to
anybody, whether they be local residents or people with professional or
organisational
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:39:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062683000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062683000026">It
is high time for us to remove that statutory requirement, something
which has long been championed by local government. Indeed, a survey by
the Local Government Association indicated that 84% of councils believe
that there are less expensive and/or more effective ways to disseminate
information contained in public notices. The only surprise to me is
that 16% of authorities apparently do not share that view, although I
suspect that they might be in the “did not respond “or
“do not know”
categories<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:40:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

members of the public who regularly look for and read statutory notices
in the local newspaper. I will leave for another day the question 
<?notus-xml column=234?>of how widely read and circulated local newspapers now are, certainly in
London, and how wide their reach is. Again, the Local Government
Association’s survey suggests that in 54% of council
areas—not London in particular, but council areas
generally—local newspapers reach less than 40% of the
population. Of that 40%, very few will be reading statutory
notices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:41:01"></hs_TimeCode>. If this
amendment were enacted, it would still of course be possible for a
local authority to place a public notice in a local newspaper if it
wished to. It may on occasion think that that is a desirable thing to
do, but it would no longer be a statutory
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

considerable financial pressure facing local authorities, which is no
doubt increased with today’s announcements. However, local
authorities have spent a little over £26 million in the past
year paying local newspapers for the cost not of general advertising
but of statutory notices. They pay another £17 million,
voluntarily and entirely properly, for general advertising. That is
something that they can do of their own volition, but the £26
million is something that they are required to do by the 163 statutory
enactments listed in Amendment
19E<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:42:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I can think
of little greater waste of money. I have said earlier that statutory
notices are possibly the least effective means of communication. They

the understandable concern over the demise of many local papers. The
demise of the regional press is an important issue which we have
debated previously; it is not really a debate for this context.
However, I do not think, and I do not think that anyone else thinks,
that requiring the publication of statutory notices—in effect
requiring local authorities to provide a £26 million-a-year
subsidy to local newspapers—is in any sense the answer to the
demise of and difficulties facing local media due to the changing world
of communications. That is a much bigger force than that with which we
are here to deal. Continuing this requirement seems rather Canute-like,
facing the incoming tide of the change in how people receive their
communications, which is no longer through statutory

to me—and something of which I was less well aware—is the
fact that the LGA survey to which I referred found that 42% of local
councils are charged by their local newspapers a higher rate for public
notices, which they have no choice but to publish in the local
newspaper, than exists for general advertising. That is perhaps a
matter between the local authority and the local media, but nearly half
of local authorities in the country have found that to be the
situation. There is, again, something seriously wrong

this is a waste of money and they do not want to do it, but whether
that is contentious or agreed by 84%—but not, perhaps, by

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I have a certain sympathy with the
amendment moved by the noble Lord. It is a long time since I recall
seeing a notice about the provision of a cattle grid, a busker’s
licence or even acupuncture, which feature among the interesting series
of regulations which apparently apply, and it seems that an overhaul of
the requirement is long overdue. However, I do not completely follow
the line he has taken. We must not forget that a significant proportion
of the population are still not involved with modern communications and
are therefore not able to log on to a council website, for example.
Moreover, if you log on to a council website, generally speaking you
are looking for something, whereas if you are perusing a newspaper you
are more likely to come across things. The question is: what things
ought to be included in this provision? That is a perfectly legitimate
point which the Government need to address to reduce substantially the
scope of the present
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:48:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062683000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062683000034">However,
I do not have too much sympathy with local authorities which complain
that they are being charged a differential rate as the answer is in
their own hands. They should threaten to withdraw the relevant
advertising from the local paper if they do not get better terms. I
should think that that would be a pretty powerful sanction. I think
that my authority spends £88,000 a year on statutory notice
advertising. There is ample scope to reduce that with a more sensible
list but I would not like to see the requirement go altogether. Certain
other things also have to be published by way  
<?notus-xml column=236?>of statutory notice—for example, in the realm of probate,
licensing matters and things of that kind. Certain things in this
enormously long list ought to be retained. I am with the noble Lord in
hoping that the Government review this issue and come forward with a
much reduced list which would make more sense and perhaps reduce the
cost. However, I would not go all the way with him and support the

whether a local authority chooses its moment to stick in an important
announcement when the local football team has been moved up to the next
division or whatever it happens to be, and nobody is going to read the
small print in the public notices part of the paper. Maybe it is
because they are being charged so much that the print is so small so
they need to cram it into a smaller number of column inches in order to
get value for money—but that is speculation on my

robin e-mail and I happen to be on the circulation list and that is how
I get to know about it. I think that must be the experience
of many noble Lords and many members of the public. So I support the
general purpose here. Certainly, I would not necessarily support the
removal of public advertising in the press for every single thing that

purpose of statutory notices is to inform the public about decisions
that will affect their lives, their property and their amenity. There
are 162 aspects they will need to be informed about but they are all
relevant to local people, either individually or in groups. The
amendment does not consider the effect on the public or on business and
other groups, and would potentially put local people in the dark. We
must acknowledge that there are still people who do not access
information other than through newspapers. The local paper, where it
exists, still fulfils a very public duty in that regard.</hs_para>

notices from the requirement to publish for local authorities would
also stifle local transparency and the rights of local people to
challenge decisions that impact upon their lives, because they would
not know about them. This is a complex and contentious issue, as my
letter to the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=237?>Lord Tope, acknowledged. I do not believe there is any

of statutory advertising is one that we acknowledge, and the
Communities and Local Government Select Committee’s
recommendation a couple of years ago for a review of publication
requirements for statutory notices cannot be ignored in the long term.
Against this background, local newspapers remain an important part of
local democracy, ensuring that local people are informed about the
decisions that affect their daily lives. It is essential that local
people have free and open access to information that can affect them or
impinge upon them rather than having to rely on other means. I
acknowledge that the requirement to publish some notices in newspapers
comes from an age which has long since gone—1972 was a very
different time from now—and they could perhaps be removed.
However, other requirements remain as valid today as they always have
been.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062683000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062683000042">Looking
at planning applications, there is a limited amount of time for local
residents to make representations, yet applications can and do affect
their and their neighbours’ quality of life and property. The
previous Administration consulted in 2009 on removing the statutory

received. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, may remember

concluded that it was clear from responses that some members of the
public and community groups relied on the statutory notices in
newspapers to learn about planning applications in their area. There
was no conviction that good alternative arrangements could readily be
rolled out. The effect of this amendment would therefore be to reduce
public scrutiny regarding, for example, planning decisions, the
provision of sex shops, bus-lane fines, casinos, betting shops and
councillor allowances, among myriad others. I acknowledge that all 162
are laid out in Amendment 19E, but I have understandably mentioned a
few which are important. Although some may be willing to see all these
go, we would ask whether the blanket removal of a huge swathe of
statutory notices is really in the public interest or ideal. That does
not stop us looking at the statutory notices under initiatives such as
the Red Tape Challenge, but they are currently as

is vital that we understand how local people receive and use
information in the 21st century. Some make use of innovative
technology, and everyone here sits with their little iPads making sure
they know exactly what is going on at home when they are sitting here

is also true that the money that pays for these statutory notices helps
to keep local newspapers in existence. That is important to ensure that
those who are not going to be tied up to the internet have ready access
to information not only about statutory notices but about what is going
on their local area. The 
<?notus-xml column=238?>newspaper industry is clear that competition with local authority
newspapers for advertising revenue is damaging their primary source of

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, I am searching for the words in the
coalition agreement which certainly comply with the amendment. I am, of
course, grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in the debate.
Perhaps it was the way in which I introduced it; there seems to be some
misunderstanding. There is nothing in what I am seeking, nothing in
this amendment, which removes the requirement to publish statutory
notices. What I am seeking to remove is the requirement to publish them
in local newspapers; that is an important difference. I entirely agree,
and wholly sympathise, with the view expressed by several speakers that
by no means everybody accesses the web or electronic means of
communications. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, may well receive his
parish notices by e-mail, but I suspect that not all in the parish
study the parish e-mails. Maybe one day that will be the case, but it
is not yet and I do not suggest that it should be.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T16:55:05"></hs_TimeCode>amendment would
still require local authorities to publish their statutory notices, but
it would require them to do so in a way that they thought likely to
bring them to the attention of persons who live in the area. That could
be in the local newspaper—perhaps in a better form than most
statutory notices—by e-mail or on their website. Possibly the
most effective way is still on a piece of paper put through the letter
box, which is still, I suspect, where many people get their information
on planning applications and other matters of direct interest to their
immediate vicinity. It is for the local authority to decide, depending
on the circumstances of its own area, which is the most effective and
cost-effective way of meeting a statutory requirement to publish public
notices. Among the least effective ways is this statutory
notice—with which we are all familiar but which is seldom
read—published in the back pages of a

purpose of this amendment. Quite clearly, particularly in Grand
Committee, there was never an intention to press it to a vote, nor
indeed do I wish to press it to a vote in your Lordships’ House.
However, I want to encourage the Government as strongly as I can to
address the issue and to reach its conclusions—with which I may
or may not agree—in time to enact them in this Bill before it
completes its passage through Parliament. It seems to me that this is a
long outstanding 
<?notus-xml column=239?>issue. We all agree that the legislative requirement relating to local
newspapers which was applicable 40 years ago is no longer applicable
today. What we are not yet getting is any agreement on what the right
solution is. We have a legislative opportunity which is not likely to
occur again before the general election to update this legislative
requirement. What I am seeking to achieve is that before this Bill is
enacted there is something in it which reflects current government
thinking—once it reaches that conclusion—and which is fit
for the 21st century, not the middle parts of the 20th century. Having
said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

In the course of discussions, some doubts were expressed about whether,
under the present code of practice, it is possible for authorities to
publish statements of fact correcting statements of that kind. I put it
no higher than that there is a doubt about that. There is a legal
opinion that it is perfectly legitimate to do so but certain
reservations are held in the world of community relations and local

Clause 38 standing part of the Bill, and I did so to enable us to have
a debate on what for many in local government is arguably the most
contentious part of the Bill, or certainly one of the most contentious.
I did not wish to try to amend the clause; I simply wanted to
facilitate a debate to enable the Minister to give us the evidence that
the abuse of the voluntary publicity code is sufficiently serious and
widespread, and indeed is a prime cause of the threat to local
newspapers, as to justify giving very considerable powers to the

I said, I am asking the Minister for the evidence on which the
Government are basing what I consider to be fairly draconian measures.
I ought to say that I entirely agree with that section of the coalition
agreement and, indeed, with that part of my own party’s
manifesto. I believe that I am sitting next to the author of that, so I
have little choice but to agree. However, I do agree. I offer no
personal or political support for that tiny number of local
authorities—I believe that it is a tiny number—which have
gone too far in a party-political sense when publishing newspapers,
magazines or other material. That criticism applies whichever party is
involved or even, in one case, no party. I think that we all hold that
view. However, is that abuse so widespread and general as to justify
legislating to give the Secretary of State this power? I am not sure

the publicity output of local authorities”, but that is where
this is leading.</hs_para>

Secretary of State power to intervene even if a local authority has
complied with the currently voluntary publicity code. I find that
worrying. I have never believed that a small number of abuses, however
wrong or undesirable or however much we all oppose them, is ever
sufficient justification to legislate for everybody. However, that is
what I think we are doing. I believe that the vast majority of
publications, of whatever nature—magazines, newspapers,
newssheets, letters from the leader—comply with the voluntary
code. Of course, people may or may not agree with some of the comments
but they give no cause for general concern and certainly no requirement

take a different view so, by enabling this debate today, I am asking
the Minister to give us more widespread evidence—rather than two

continuing budget cuts are actually proving a far more effective

2,700. The <I>Daily Mail</I> has shed a quarter of its 3,000-strong

firms to lobby on their behalf. Again, if there were any suggestion

exactly the same way as any political material in a newspaper. But why
should a council not seek to use lobbyists—preferably registered
ones, which I hope will come, even if we have not got round to it

nothing wrong with that provided it is not a political exercise.

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, with the leave of the Committee, I will
speak to both this amendment and the following one, Amendment 19BC,
since they both relate to council tax referendums, which is a highly
contentious issue—to use the noble Baroness’s
phrase—about which no doubt several authorities would be only
too pleased to be able to lobby. I do not think a telephone call would
suffice to deal with this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000044">Amendment
19BB deals with a particularly objectionable part of the
Government’s proposals. I remind your Lordships that the ad hoc
committee on the Bill had no opportunity of considering these
amendments, or indeed the code of practice that we have just discussed,
because these matters came very late in the day and were added to the
Bill as a convenient vehicle for the Secretary of State’s
obsessions, to which I have already referred. In terms of the council
tax referendum, what is particularly objectionable is that there is a
potentially retrospective effect here, because decisions already taken
in the past can be used as the basis for requiring a referendum in the
future. That is particularly objectionable where the decisions might
have been taken by a body that is not actually the individual local
authority. If it is a precepting authority or, as this Bill is seeking
to require, a levying authority, that is even more objectionable. There
is no justification whatever for this element of retrospectivity and I
hope that on reflection the Government will see that it is a departure
from normal practice and one that cannot be justified except in the
most exceptional circumstances. In my submission these simply do not
arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000045">Amendment
19BC acknowledges—as do both amendments—the fact that we
are living with a provision about council tax referendums. Many of us
opposed them when they were inserted into what is now the Local
Government Act but they are there and we have to live with that. What
this amendment deals with is the position that might arise as a result
of not simply a decision in the past but a decision in the past with a
continuing effect on expenditure. So, for example there are
authorities—I understand that Leeds has raised this—with
city deals that have entered arrangements which would require
expenditure over a period which, if the current referendum provision is
applied, might severely impact on the schemes to which the Government
are party.</hs_para>

one welcomes, is an opportunity for the Government, local government
and private sector partners to work together. It involves a commitment
of expenditure on all parts. If such decisions are not to be thwarted,
given the ever tightening situation affecting local authorities, at the
very least the Government should be making transitional provision to
ensure that decisions fairly recently arrived at, but which
will have a continuing impact, will not merely be on the finances but
on the economic state of the area with which these arrangements are
very largely concerned. 
<?notus-xml column=248?>The Government’s proposed changes could cause very severe
problems, whether they are over transport—which I think was the
case in Leeds—or about city deals such as that in which my own
authority has been involved. No doubt we shall hear from my noble

are both costly and unpredictable in their outcome. You cannot have
that situation when you are dealing with third parties and have entered
into arrangements that could be disrupted as a result of the change
which is now being proposed. I think that the Government should take
both of these matters back. The first point is really a matter of
principle about retrospective legislation and requirements. The second
is to deal with what appears potentially to be a significant issue for
a number of authorities which are endeavouring to do their best in many
respects to work with government on agreed programmes that could be
rendered difficult—no doubt unintended—as a result of the
provisions. I beg to move.</hs_para>

Secretary of State was somewhat upset by the level of council tax rises
which were entirely consistent with the law as it stood. Before I begin

2012 on council tax
referendums.</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062685000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000090">“The
definition of ‘relevant basic amount of council tax’ . .

calculation of the authority’s basic amount of council tax. This
amount is modified by omitting local precepts issued to or anticipated

authority, from the calculation. This is to ensure that increases in
levies, over which authorities have minimal or no control, are not a
factor in triggering a council tax referendum”.</hs_quote>

were the words of the department in issuing guidance on council tax. As
my noble friend indicated, levies come in to local authorities in a
number of different guises. In Greater Manchester last year, two
particular things impacted on the levy situation. First, not quite like
Leeds, we had an agreement between authorities on transport
expenditure, which will put a 3% increase above the day-to-day spending
needs of the transport authority to invest in transport infrastructure.
That programme began in 2009 with the commitment of the 10 authorities
in Greater Manchester—which took some getting, I assure you, but
we got there—to put that money in for six years. When we went to
the Government and negotiated our city deal—we were the first
conurbation to get a city deal—this transport expenditure was
seized upon by the Government as an innovative way forward for local
authority spending. It has taken some time, but we have devised an
earn-back model and have now agreed that the Treasury will reallocate
some of the increased taxation back to Greater Manchester. We will be
able to spend that money on future investment. It is a good deal, and I
understand that it will be part of the announcement on the public
spending review.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=249?><hs_para UID="13062685000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000050">Last year, the increase
for the Greater Manchester transport levy was 3.6%. In other words, it
was 0.6% for day-to-day transport needs—the cost of fuel and
other things; this meant that there were big impacts on costs. The
other 3% was that commitment made back in 2009, which continues to roll
forward in future years—a contribution to investment and
transport. We can prove that the transport investment is taking place.
If noble Lords go to Manchester, they will see that the new Metrolink
system is up and running, and new bus ways beginning in my area. There
are all sorts of things going on which meet our commitment, and
government commitments, to reduce greenhouse gases and all sorts of
things. We thought that we would agree that with the Government but,
obviously, they pushed up the levy.</hs_para>

back slightly from the second impact because Wigan is not part of the
Greater Manchester waste disposal authority. The waste disposal
authority signed a new PFI deal a couple of years ago because it did
not have the facilities to deal with modern waste and needed
expenditure on a new facility. So often with PFI deals, the early years
have a really high cost which inevitably falls over future years. The
effect on the waste disposal levy was 4.5%; obviously a very big
increase for those authorities. A number of authorities in Greater
Manchester therefore raised their council tax by more than the 2%,
which the Secretary of State said would trigger a referendum. This was
entirely legitimate within the rules of council tax referendums as they
then were. In fact, the ironic thing was that a number of authorities,
including those which seemed to have the biggest increase, actually
reduced the proportion of the council tax take for their own services
to meet the needs of external levies. That means that if this clause
goes through, then the threat of the Secretary of State—the
revenge of Eric Pickles—will be that any authority which raised
its council tax by, say, 3.5% while the guideline figure remained at 2%
can only increase its council tax next year by 0.5%. The rules have
changed.</hs_para>

what would have happened if the council had known that that was the
situation last year? Different decisions might have been made. How can
we predict the mind of the Secretary of State and the mind of the
department when it wants to change the rules in this manner? It is
grossly unfair that some authorities, in addition to the awful amount
of cuts that they are taking on board, will have to make savage
cutbacks in services to cope with this part of Clause 39. This is bad
and retrospective legislation and the Committee should think very
carefully before it commits to Clause
39.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_26_PT_1/7E19C413C4A62895A3465727D5338905066ECCAF" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 June 2013">Wednesday,

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, have some concerns about this
clause although I am a little unsure about whether to raise these
concerns on these amendments or perhaps in a few minutes in the debate
on whether the clause should stand part of the Bill. However, I will
deal specifically with Amendment 19BB, which deals with the issue of
retrospection. The case has been well made with particular instances. I
have concerns  
<?notus-xml column=250?>about the retrospective nature of subsection (15) on rather practical
grounds. By the time this Bill is enacted, all attention will be
focused on the next financial year and not the current one. For the
Secretary of State, whoever that may be at that time, to be penalising
authorities at that stage for acting lawfully at the time when they
took the action in respect of this current financial year seems to be
both wrong and impractical. Should the Secretary of State take that
view, what will be the practical implications by the time we are very
nearly through the current financial year? I hope that when the
Minister responds in a moment she will at least be able to give us some
reassurance on the particular issue of retrospection, which is causing
quite proper practical concern as well as political and philosophical
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000054"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="13062685000113" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000113">Baroness
Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, as I understand it, the noble Lord has
grouped together Amendments 19BB and 19BC. Amendment 19BB
challenges the Secretary of State’s power to determine
categories of authority and to set excessiveness principles which apply
to them accordingly. Subsection (15) makes it explicit that, in doing
so, he may differentiate between authorities on the basis of past
council tax decisions. The amendment would remove subsection (15)
because of concerns, as raised in our discussion, about retrospection
and about it providing much wider powers to the Secretary of State when
setting excessiveness
principles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000055">I
am happy to confirm that subsection (15) does not apply referendum
principles retrospectively. It does not make any changes to the setting
of council tax in previous years or change the referendum limits that
applied. The Government were clear before council tax and levies were
set for 2013-14 that they would take into account the decisions taken
by local authorities on council tax in setting future principles. As
already stated, no changes will be made to those principles that
applied in 2013-14 or, indeed, to any other year. Both authorities and
levying bodies can continue to plan
accordingly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000056">In
light of the fact that local authorities have had a pretty clear
indication that their decisions for 2013-14 would be taken into
account—what they did, where and why—in setting future
principles, there is no argument that authorities were not aware of the
Government’s intentions or justification for accusations of
unfairness, given the Written Ministerial Statement of 30 January 2013,
followed by an information note sent to all to local authorities on 8
February. Decisions taken on council tax increases for 2013-14 were
taken in full knowledge of those warnings. Subsection (15) does not
radically extend the Secretary of State’s existing powers. It
clarifies those powers and removes any doubt as to whether they allow
him to continue to take into account past council tax decisions when
making decisions on the following year.</hs_para>

19BC would provide that during a transitional period specified
expenditure could be exempt from inclusion within the calculation on
whether a council tax increase was excessive. The noble Lord will be
aware that the excessiveness principles, which are set annually,
already allow for different principles to be set for different
categories of authority. For this 
<?notus-xml column=251?>reason, I assume this amendment is intended to press the case for the
additional flexibility that we have been talking about.</hs_para>

detailed excessiveness principles for 2014-15 will be made later in the
year. However, the principle will remain that local taxpayers should be
protected from unwanted excessive council tax increases. It is local
residents who should have the final say on whether to accept an
excessive increase. We recognise that there may be specific reasons as
to why a particular local authority may wish to set an increase above
that level; the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, referred to the city deal in
Leeds, and the noble Lord, Lord Smith, referred to Manchester. The city
deal with Leeds on private sector investment has been predicated on
increases in levies from the West Yorkshire Integrated Transport
Authority. It is right that the levy set by the 22 elected councillors
from the five district councils that manage the authority should be
treated in exactly the same way as the costs of every other local
authority investing in local transport projects. The Government accept
that neither this nor any other city deal is dependent on setting an
excessive council tax increase, nor that excessive increases in levies
were agreed as part of the deal. The chair of the West Yorkshire
Integrated Transport Authority put it well himself. He said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13062685000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000059">“transport

and local accountability to council taxpayers are what the current
clause would provide by extending the transparency of decisions taken
by bodies funded from council tax receipts and ensuring that local
residents have their say when those decisions would require larger
increases. In summary, the Secretary Of State already has flexibility
to set referendum principles that address particular situations and the
right to take into account the 2013-14 council tax level. With those
explanations, I hope that the noble Lord will be willing to withdraw
his amendments.</hs_para>

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, of course I am not going to seek to
test the opinion of the Committee today, but this is a matter to which
I and other noble Lords from different parts of the House will want to
return. I confess that I used the word “sophistry” to my
noble friend to describe some of the assertions made by the noble
Baroness—assertions no doubt made at the behest of those in
somewhat higher positions within the department. This is not a
satisfactory position. We will clearly need to look in detail at what
she said but the reality is that decisions were taken in good faith,
along with the Government, to establish a range of agreed policies
without the expectation that these would somehow be affected by
decisions of the kind to which the noble Baroness referred. If those
agreements reached with government and other partners are to be
sustained, it will, on the basis of the Government’s announced
policy, be at the expense of core services. That was not envisaged at
the time these deals were entered into, and it will make councils
extremely reluctant to enter into any further arrangements with
government when that could have the impact that it appears is now
facing a number of significant authorities that are 
<?notus-xml column=252?>doing their best to work with government. It is an unsatisfactory
position to which we will no doubt return on Report, but I beg leave to

by the LGA. The unitary and district authorities obviously have a
different range of election frequencies and proportions of those
standing for election, so the only slightly tongue-in-cheek question is
this: how many council tax referendums equate to an election? As I say,
that is slightly tongue in
cheek.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000065">I
accept that a council tax referendum may be advanced on a narrower
basis than a local election but it seems to be obvious that if a
council is elected and starts to implement its programme, but is then
subject to a further check on progress via a referendum on the logical
outcomes of its policies, it begins to look like a recipe for potential
gridlock. Giving the electorate the right to chop and change midway
through an electoral cycle is curious. I suggest that the open-ended
nature of that needs to be looked at. I do not necessarily say that the
principle of intervening in council tax referenda is wrong or anything
like that, but they do not necessarily coincide with the normal
electoral cycle, and there is therefore the possibility of such
referenda being quite
disruptive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000066">As
I said earlier, in order to galvanise the local electorate, which is
sorely needed in some cases, it is necessary to have matters of
substance and of relevance to the electors on which their votes can
make a difference. That is a very important point. The LGA certainly
feels—I noted the comments of the noble Baroness in another
context—that the referendum provision risks 
<?notus-xml column=253?>compromising the thrust of local democracy in certain circumstances and
that the main decision should be via the normal electoral ballot box.
That is certainly the view of the LGA. As I say, we cannot guarantee
that a referendum and a local election will coincide. A
further explanation is needed from the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062685000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062685000067">In
terms of forward investments, I noted what the noble Baroness said a
few minutes ago about the way in which the previous amendments might be
brought to bear on this whole matter. I did not quite understand the
thread that a longer-term investment process would necessarily be proof
against the effects of a referendum. That was my intention at this
stage. I noted that no other noble Lord had added their name to the
amendment and therefore anticipated that I might be in a minority of
one standing before the Committee. On the broader principle, however, I
should be interested to hear the Minister’s comments and those
of other noble

that he may be in a minority of two. I share his
concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T17:59:53"></hs_TimeCode> and
would ask the Minister aquestion for clarification. Is it the case
that, if a referendum on what is deemed to be an excessive levy is
lost, that so-called excessive levy will still apply but the local
council will have to cut its own budget in order to levy an appropriate
council tax to meet the levy demand? Noble Lords opposite are saying
yes; that is clearly the answer I am going to get and I want it to be
clear and specific on the record. If so, we need to understand the
implications of what we are doing. I can pick many examples, but flood
defences might be appropriate. One can well understand where a drainage
board wishes to put in a so-called excessive levy for particular work
in a particular area and the public at large, who pay the council tax,
may well feel that they do not want to contribute to that. As others
have said, it can lead to unforeseen and undesirable
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000002">In

most significant implication for Bradford relates to current plans
across the Leeds City Region to create a West Yorkshire Transport Fund.
This fund is planned to grow to a total of £1bn by 2025/26 to
pay for investment in the transport infrastructure. It will comprise,
roughly, £150m from Dept for Transport, £100m from Local
Transport Plan, £750m from the participating Councils, each of
whom will contribute a <I>increasing</I> amount each year, by way of a
levy. The current plan means that Bradford Council would put in
£1.2m in Year 1, £2.4m in Year 2, £3.6m in Year 3

worth pointing out that the Transport Fund is a central plan in the
Leeds City Deal, a key part of the Government's regional policy. While

proposal to treat the levy by the same referendum rules as Council Tax,
this plan held good. For citizens, the plan did of course mean that,
while the Council Tax element of their bill would be restrained at
below 2%, they would pay an increasing amount for transport investment.

sustain the Fund ranks among the most significant decisions in the next

Bill’s proposal means that the Transport Fund can only be
afforded in its current form if offsetting reductions are made across
other services in the Council. So, by Year 3, for example, savings in

otherwise, for Bradford to afford its currently planned contribution of

financial perspective, the proposal means … If investment in
transport remains a priority, and the planned regional-level investment
makes sense, there is now much sharper trade-off between transport and
other choices. … If investment in transport has to be
significantly reined in to satisfy the ‘below 2% rise’
rule, the investment returns will be significantly curtailed, with the
reduced economic impact (which in turn would expect to feed through to
a weaker taxation base of citizens in work and firms in business paying

Smith of Leigh:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with the noble Earl
about the problems of the electoral cycle. It was a bit disappointing
that this is the fallow year for metropolitan authorities so we did not
have elections. Noble Lords may recall that Wigan won the FA Cup and
the feel-good factor was particularly good; obviously there have been
fantastic comments on social media, but unfortunately we did not have
any local elections to take advantage of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000005">It
was really interesting that the noble Lord, Lord Tope, read out the
views of the director of finance from Bradford. The answer that the
Minister gave to the earlier amendment was that, under Clause 39, the
current provisions of the Localism Act, which define the relevant basic
amount of council tax increase, will change from being what the council
itself sets to include levies and other charges. Therefore, decisions
that were entirely within the law as it stood earlier this year in
March will be affected.</hs_para>

debate earlier on the council tax referendum principle. The Government
say they are not capping but actually they are. In my long experience
of local government, I cannot believe that once the Secretary of State
sets out the guidelines to which a referendum will apply, any local
authority would want to set an amount of council tax increase above
that guideline. If it does, it is on to an absolute loser. There is no
way it will win a referendum on that. Which council tax payer is going
to vote for higher council tax? They are not asking, “What
services are being cut?”. It is a simple referendum on the
increase in council tax and nobody wants it. The Secretary of State may
want and need that part of it but effectively it is capping local
authorities.</hs_para>

have the longer-term political impact that Governments may think. When
capping was first introduced, my authority was one of 
<?notus-xml column=255?>the 22 Labour authorities that were all capped at once; no
Conservative authorities were. We set a budget, but the Government said
we could not and that we had to reset it and make significant cuts.
When we came to the elections that May, we had a really big increase in
our majority, so it did not have any negative political impact. I have
great sympathy with the noble Earl’s position. Do we need this
clause? I do not think
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:08:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Beecham" PimsId="5821" UID="13062696000130" xid="2085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000130">Lord
Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be brief. The position is a
curious one in relation to what the Government regard as an area of
excessive increases and what they regard as something else. An increase
of more than 2% in council tax is excessive but an increase of 5.8% in
social housing rents is acceptable. Indeed, the Chancellor has said
today that that social rents will increase by CPI plus 1% a year for
virtually a decade. That actually will be rather less than the
increases imposed in this past year but whichever way you look at it,
it means that what is an unacceptable increase for council tax payers
is well below what social housing tenants will be expected to pay. It
is an interesting
anomaly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000009">However,
on the referendum point, it should be noted that three sets of
organisations are involved in local government finance at the local
level—the council, the levying bodies and the precepting bodies
such as police commissioners. Several police commissioners increased
their levies by significantly more than the 2% figure. That was
acceptable because it did not raise the overall increase significantly.
On the other hand, technically, their regime is rather different and
rather more generous in terms of potential increases. However, if they
breach the limit for precepting authorities, I understand that they
would have to have a referendum. Therefore, there are two referendum
systems here, as it were. It is odd that there are in effect two
external bodies—some bodies, admittedly, comprise a combination
of local authorities, but many do not—which can, by means of a
levy, potentially force the council to have a referendum on its overall
council tax levy, whereas precepting authorities are in a different
category. That anomaly certainly raises questions to which we may want
to return on

anticipate that the noble Earl will not seek to test the opinion of the
Committee tonight. Given the fact that referendums are now,
unfortunately, part of the system, despite the opposition of many of us
when the Local Government Bill went through, I am not sure that we will
get very far in that regard on Report. However, in this curious area of
anomalous situations and differential rates of what is acceptable and
what is not, we might at least provoke the Government into thinking
about the system they are creating and the degree to which it is being

calculation that authorities must make each year to determine whether
their council tax increase is excessive and therefore requires the
approval of local people in a referendum. It changes the definition of
excessiveness from an amount that excludes levies to one including
levies. It will ensure that people get the final say over an excessive
increase in the total council tax charged by an authority. The noble
Lord, Lord Beecham, properly drew attention to the fact that precepts
are already part of the local government charge.
Currently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:13:11"></hs_TimeCode>, the
excessiveness calculation is based on the relevant basic amount of
council tax, defined so as to exclude changes in levies raised on an
authority by levying bodies. The level of levies varies in different
areas, but can make up more than 50% of an authority’s council
tax requirement. This year, many council tax payers have seen their
total bill increase by a higher percentage than they might have
expected due to the impact of levies, with the overall increase
appearing to be above the referendum threshold set by the Secretary of
State and approved by the other
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000013">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:13:50"></hs_TimeCode>
short, a levy is a demand for payment by a levying body on a local
authority. A large number of organisations and bodies have historically
been granted the power to issue levies. Some of these are relatively

excessiveness principles which compare council tax figures in 2013-14

arrangements, where the Secretary of State takes into account all
relevant factors, including previous council tax levels. Noble Lords
will be aware that the effect of the clause is to reinstate the model
for council tax referendums contained in the Localism Bill when it was
introduced to Parliament in 2010. Not one objection was raised to the
inclusion of levies during the consultation or the parliamentary debate
on council tax referendums.

effort to keep certain types of expenditure from the excessiveness

First, the rate of levy increases has outstripped the national increase
in council tax. In total, the levy increased by 4.1% in 2011-12 at the
time of an overall council tax freeze. The coalition Government have
been clear from the outset about their wish to protect people from
excessive council tax increases, and the inclusion of levies in the
referendum legislation supports that. Secondly, authorities have shown
themselves to be consistently capable of working with levying bodies in
setting them and considering the cumulative pressure on council tax.
Local authorities are well represented on the majority of boards of
levying authorities, and there are hundreds of examples of councils and
levying bodies already meeting the terms of the schemes which require a

Government do not accept that local councils will simply have an
excessive increase forced on them by levying bodies. We have had
representations that this clause could constrain authorities that have

clear about this, too. In many areas, transport and waste disposal are
run by local authorities—the noble Lord, Lord Smith, drew
attention to that—and are funded through the council tax, which
is subject to referendum principles. In larger metropolitan areas,
these functions are carried out by joint waste and transport
authorities, funded by levies that are not currently subject to the
referendum principles. It is right that the spending by

order to get it underneath the clerical radar in the Public Bill
Office, I had to specify that the amendment related to such polls only
on matters of parish finance, but the Minister will know very well
where I am coming from on this. I recognise that the wider issues may
well fall outside the scope of this Bill, but nonetheless the principle
is very important and applies to financial matters also that will
clearly fall within the scope of this

place the Minister’s right honourable friend Andrew Stunell
confirmed the situation in debate on Clause 53, saying that this was
clearly a problem that needed to be addressed. He said that he wished
to modernise the existing regime to make it fit for purpose in the
modern world and he intended to work with key partners such as the
National Association of Local Councils and the Society of Local Council
Clerks. That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>

situation there remains that Schedule 12 of the Local Government Act
1972 governs the circumstances in which a parish poll may be demanded.
That, in short, means that at a parish meeting either the chairman 
<?notus-xml column=259?>or 10 members or one-third of the electors present can force a parish
poll. It is whichever is the less, so it may be a very small number
indeed. Once triggered, of course, the process kicks in and the
principal authority then holds the poll and the cost is rechargeable by
that principal authority to the parish. The potential for making
payments to parishes which was lost as part of the Clause 53 issues in
the original draft of the Localism Act was an important
omission<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

poll must be about a “parish matter”, but “parish
matter” unfortunately is not defined in law. There are therefore
no mechanisms to prevent vexatious use of this particular provision.
Moreover if a poll is demanded and it cannot at that particular stage
be shown to be a non-parish matter—sometimes these things are
bounced on parish councils—but subsequently may so be shown, the
auditor may disallow the expenditure and that probably occurs many
months after the event. Furthermore, the poll result is not
even legally binding. There are enormous financial
consequences and is an enormous potential, as will be apparent, for
vexatious pursuit of various
hobby-horses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:24:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000027">Action

have further information that reveals the same sort of thing: sadly, a
very similar pattern of voter disenchantment or a complete lack of
results. Parish polls were triggered in several town
councils—Hythe, Sandgate and Folkestone—in 2010 on a
district council parking strategy. For Hythe Town Council, with an
electorate of 8,000, a population of 14,000 and a precept of
£300,000, the cost was around £9,000. For Folkestone Town
Council it was £20,000—it has an electorate of 15,000, a
population of 50,000 and a precept of around £500,000.</hs_para>

are not insignificant sums of money.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:29:23"></hs_TimeCode> they happened
only sporadically and on rare occasions, that might not matter.
However, it begins to look as if this is the route of preference for
certain people to try to get their particular view across. Never mind
the fact that there may have been a poll in a normal election 
<?notus-xml column=260?>process and that a council, having been given a mandate, should be given
a fair crack of the whip to try to get on with and deliver some of its
policies. The list goes on and I will provide it to the Minister
because it is important that some of this is known. The point I am
making here is that clearly the problem has not gone
away.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000030">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:29:23"></hs_TimeCode>
questions I need to ask are as follows.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:29:23"></hs_TimeCode>, is the
Minister able to suggest anything in the context of this Bill? As I
said earlier, clearly the principle applies to parish finance matters
and is a legitimate subject for consideration even though the concept
of parish polls applies to a much wider category of
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000031">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-26T18:29:23"></hs_TimeCode>,
and probably most importantly, do the Government remain committed to
the comments raised by Andrew Stunnell in Committee in another place?
If so, the National Association of Local Councils and the Society of
Local Council Clerks would appreciate further
dialogue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000032">Thirdly,
on the wider issues to which parish polls can be applied, I appreciate
that I am taking this outside the scope of the Bill but it is important
to ask whether we can look forward to the measures of which the
Minister spoke so warmly in Committee in another place being
introduced. If they can be, could it please be fairly

say on these things. As we know from the announcement today, we all now
have to do as much, if not more, with a great deal less. The question
of parish polls is a drain on community endeavour. It is a drain on
financial resources. It is a drain on human volunteer resources. It

real issue here, of which I was certainly unaware. The ridiculous
numbers involved to call a poll, the non-binding nature of the result

which ought to be addressed. I hope that the Minister will give the
noble Earl an indication that the Government will look at this and
seek, either on the basis of his amendment or in some other way, to
deal with what looks like a highly anomalous situation in which a tiny

poll dimension. I say from the outset that, although we are very much
on the outer edges of the scope of the Bill, the noble Earl’s
points are clearly of importance for the modernisation of parish polls,
which has rather fallen through the net. The questions of the threshold
for triggering the poll and what a legitimate subject for a poll should
be are issues to which we would be happy to give further consideration.
We would happy to meet the noble Earl to discuss this further. I am
rapidly turning over in my mind the question of how one deals with
that. Even though this 
<?notus-xml column=261?>is a relatively limited area, it might be the sort of thing that is
appropriate for a Private Member’s Bill in a future Session,

are aware of the issue of whether one could institute postal or proxy

provisions of the regulations limit the content of polls to matters
which have been considered by the parish meeting, which means that the
person chairing a parish meeting could rule out of order any attempt to
discuss matters which are not parish affairs and so prevent parish
polls on, for example, EU referendums, or whatever it may be. However,
we are all conscious that different parishes and local communities are
often dominated by different small groups. This is one of the problems
we have with getting back to community self-government. I am often
conscious that I am extremely lucky to live in the community of
Saltaire, which has far too many people who are highly educated. We are
overstuffed with activists, and there are other areas around Bradford
which are not so blessed with local activists willing to turn up to
lengthy committee meetings in the evenings and take part in local

the start the undertaking given by the Government on a
post-implementation review but its objectives appear to be somewhat
narrowly based and do not address some of the fundamental issues. The
Bill provides for arrangements that are significantly different from
the current regime whereby the Audit Commission effectively acts as
regulator, commissioner and provider of audit. As the pre-legislative
scrutiny committee report sets out, the new regime is more complex and
certainly more fragmented. The regulation of local audit will transfer
to the Financial Reporting Council, professional accounting bodies and
the National Audit Office. Commissioning of local audit will transfer
to local public bodies, and the provision of local audit will go to
private sector firms. Research and value for money will be picked up by
the NAO to a limited extent and by the sector’s own
self-improvement. The National Fraud Initiative’s ultimate
destination has yet to be determined, as we have discussed, and the
co-ordination of grant certification remains a little vague.</hs_para>

bases have been covered, potential gaps remain. Some of the bodies that
are subject to the new regime are accountable to government departments
other than CLG. How is this to be co-ordinated across government?
Audited bodies themselves will have to liaise with government
departments, the NAO and auditors because the commission will not be on
hand to act as an intermediary. The role of accounting officers within
departments is fundamental to the management and control of resources.
They are currently able to draw on information on the outcome of
audits, implementation of major initiatives and value for money
outcomes analysed by the Audit Commission. How is this all to happen in
the future? Unless the Minister can tell us otherwise, there appears to
be no organisation that will be publishing the outputs of more than
£200 billion of public expenditure.</hs_para>

audits is paramount. The role of the FRC as overall regulator and its
specific role in providing quality assurance to just a few
“major audits” has been the cause of some concern. We
hear the government assurances on this but consider that Parliament is
entitled to a more formal report on how this is working in practice.
Can the Minister confirm that the reports of the recognised supervisory
bodies monitoring auditor performance outside major audits will be in
the public domain?</hs_para>

for oversight on how this is working for all “relevant
authorities”, including health bodies and smaller authorities.
Many of the provisions in the Bill are not applicable to health service
bodies because equivalent provision is made in other legislation. We
have not thus far sought to compare or contrast 
<?notus-xml column=263?>these provisions with those applicable to other relevant authorities.
Contemplating consolidation may give the Ministers a nightmare at the
moment but the Bill does not give us a sense of how joined up this is
all going to be in practice. A report to Parliament would cover this. I

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government support the
intention behind this amendment. Post-implementation review is
acknowledged good practice. It will provide the assurances that
Parliament and the general public will want that the new audit
arrangements are achieving the outcomes that we expect, and it will
identify how policies might be improved if they prove to be less
effective than we anticipate. For these reasons, the Government have
already committed to undertake such a review. This is set out in the
impact assessment, at Section
K.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000045">However, I
am not persuaded that the timeframe envisaged in the amendment is the
right one. The commitment in the impact assessment is to a review
within three to five years of Royal Assent. This is in line with the
Government’s general commitment to post-legislative review. The
reason for preferring a slightly longer period in the case of this
legislation relates to the implementation of local auditor
appointment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000046">Assuming
that this Act is passed in early 2014, the amendment would require a
report in early 2017. As noble Lords are aware, the earliest date at
which local auditor appointment would begin is 2017. It would seem to
make sense to include some assessment of the move to local appointment
in the proposed review. This would enable a robust assessment of audit
quality and auditor independence in the new regime, and of the impact
of local appointment on the audit supply
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062696000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130626-gc0001.htm#13062696000047">Nevertheless,
government departments, through the accounting officer, are accountable
to Parliament annually for the money voted to them. Where this money is
distributed to others, accounting officers need to be able to
demonstrate that appropriate accountability arrangements are in place,
usually through an accountability systems statement. The external audit
of local bodies is one of the evidence sources that will help to
demonstrate whether the system is working effectively. We will ensure
that the necessary assurance can be provided to accounting officers and
to Parliament.</hs_para>

audit regime of health bodies have been designed to provide at least
the same level of assurance to the Department of Health accounting
officer and Parliament on the use of resources by the health sector as
current arrangements. All the health bodies covered by this Bill are

department reviews the outcome of the audits and annual governance

to say a few words of reassurance about the scope of the proposed
post-implementation review. The impact assessment explains that the
review will look at how well the core objectives of the
local audit reforms are being met. I remind noble Lords that these
objectives are: 
<?notus-xml column=264?>to deliver greater localism, decentralisation and

to be anything in the list of specific requirements in the amendment

do not know whether the noble Lord can help me on a further point, or
write to me on it. In considering the Bill, I do not think that we have
done enough work on how the regime for health bodies and other relevant

authorities. However, a whole raft of provisions appear to apply to
relevant authorities other than health bodies. We may not have an
overall view of how that fits together but one would hope that any
review of how the measure will work in practice would pick up what the
inconsistencies and consistencies of the regimes are and what lessons
can be learnt from one stream which could benefit the other. That
aspect appears to have received less attention than many other aspects
of the Bill. However, I accept the undertaking that there will be a
post-implementation review based on consultation with relevant bodies.

smaller English NHS charities, with income of between £25,000
and £500,000 in the year in question, to opt for an examination
of their accounts as an alternative to audit which is intended to
minimise costs of producing accounts to the charities. This is

criteria for who may undertake such examinations are set out in the
amendment. An examiner of an English NHS charity’s accounts must
be independent and the charity’s trustees must reasonably
believe that the person has the requisite ability and experience to
carry out a competent examination of the accounts. The examiner of an
English NHS charity’s accounts must also be a member of a
professional body as set out in Section 145(3) of the Charities Act

academic research for the UK by Professor James Foreman-Peck (Cardiff)
has sought to quantify the extent of the impact on UK exports, and
suggests that the effect is likely to be large, and substantially
greater than is perceived by many UK businesses themselves, as they
appear to rely too much on being able to use English. UKTI is currently
commissioning some new work to up-date this analysis and quantify the
effect of these skill deficiencies. In response to Recommendation 14 of
the recent House of Lords Committee on SME Exports; Roads to Success:
SME Exports, UKTI stated that they “.. agree with the

the two Houses. It is subject to  periodic review and will be
reviewed again prior to  the commencement of new contractual

the parliamentary estate are subject to frequent fluctuating demands
