Government on the progress made in banning referral fees, which has led
to a 5% reduction in motor insurance costs with a planned reduction of
as much as 15%—an achievement in no way to be sniffed at. Is the
Minister aware of the extent of the current challenge to this new plan
of the Government, which may undermine all the good work so far? For
example, is he aware that Tesco, through its insurance company Fortis,
has set up a new joint venture with a company called New Law, a
personal injury claims specialist based in Cardiff? Will my noble
friend accept that it is not doing this for its health? Will he have a
word with the Legal Services Board and the Solicitors Regulation

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, referral fees are viewed with a certain
suspicion, particularly when, as in the case of motor insurance, they
were rising to about £800 a pop. That obviously fed into the
cost of the insurance. After the first look, it was decided that the
greatest abuse took place in motor insurance, and so we concentrated on
that area. However, we will consult the regulators and consumer groups

have sensibly been raised in the House today, some of them hearsay and
some from direct experience, which suggest that what we intended to do
in LASPO may not exactly be hitting the target, or that, as a result of
organisational devices used by companies, the target has been moved. I
can tell the House that we will talk to the regulators and look at some
of these examples. If necessary, we will look at the powers that we
were given under LASPO to make sure that we do what the House intended,

Unfortunately there are many vulnerable children without parents, or
who have uninterested parents, so no amount of awareness education will
do anything for these kids. Many are already re-enacting pornographic
behaviour on other children, as highlighted by the NSPCC. So
will the Minister tell the House, as the service providers are working
on filtering for new customers, why the Government do not insist that
they offer filtering for their existing customers, and block porn and
adult material by default as part of the solution to protect all
children before they end up in a moral

shocking, and the fact that it is so easy for our children to access
these dreadful images is shocking. Certainly, a step change in
attacking images of child abuse on the internet was secured yesterday
at a meeting with the Culture Secretary, Maria Miller; companies agreed
to increase funding substantially to the Internet Watch Foundation so
that it can now actively search, block and remove child abuse images.
It will no longer have to wait for illegal material to be reported.
Anyone trying to access a page blocked by the Internet Watch Foundation
will see a warning message, known as a splash page, saying that they
are trying to access illegal material. The industry will commit to

initiatives in this field are clearly welcome. The question is whether
they go far enough. Why is so little effort being put into working with
the industries to ensure that there is a robust system of age and
identity verification available for those who try to access services of
all sorts on the internet? Not only could those who use child
pornography be identified, it would also protect children from seeing
things that they should not see, and it would no doubt solve all sorts
of other problems that we might have in respect of material which is

the industry to develop robust age verification systems to prevent
children and young people being able to access these images. ISPs are
bringing in closed loop e-mails so that when the filters are changed in

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, schools are also central to
safeguarding children in this area. Yesterday the Minister said that
teachers should be able to teach internet safety effectively in
computing classes. With respect, I doubt that anyone knowledgeable in
this area agrees with that view, because it requires teachers trained
in addressing these difficult personal and social issues with young
people—and that will not happen in a computing class. One of the
most compelling arguments for statutory personal, social and health
education within the national curriculum is the provision of specially
trained teachers. Will the Government now consider making these
important child safety issues part of the national

minor injuries unit was introduced in Wycombe to deal with cuts,
bruises, sprains and other minor injuries and illnesses. A modest

neighbouring hospitals led to a fivefold increase in the number of
people having to wait more than four hours—the national
target—in Wexham Park A&amp;E and a dramatic increase in the
number of cancelled operations. Indeed, I am told that that number
doubled. What is the point of making this national policy of closing

that, although I understand his concerns in relation to Wexham Park and
other hospitals, there is no government policy about the closure of
A&amp;E departments. The whole thrust of government policy since we
were elected to office has been that there should be no top-down
direction of this type of decision. Rather, we are clear that any
changes to healthcare services should be locally led, clinically driven
and involve the local population in a consultation. All patients have
the right to high-quality urgent care at whatever time they use the
health service. The key for local commissioners and decision-makers is
to ensure that that happens. I am aware that the situation at Wexham

There is no doubt from Sir Bruce Keogh’s urgent and emergency
care review, published this month, that attendance at an A&amp;E
department often reflects the lack of availability or the lack of
awareness of alternative sources of help. Some patients may default to
A&amp;E departments when they are unsure about which service is most
appropriate to their needs. That has to be addressed and is being

increasing fascination the number of Ministers who are now attacking
the way that A&amp;E operates, although they are to blame. I heard a
Minister the other day attacking GPs for failing to act in the way they
should. At the end of the day, I wonder who is responsible for putting

for the provision of the health service so I do not duck that
responsibility for a second. Nevertheless, Ministers do not manage the
health service day-to-day and have never done so. We are involved
day-to-day in the plans to ensure that we have a health service that is
properly configured to meet the needs of patients. My right honourable
friend the Secretary of State could not be more assiduous in the work
that he is doing to make sure that that happens. Responsibilities are
not being ducked; nobody is being blamed. The fact is that demand is
going up considerably, and has been for a number of years. We need to
address that and we need to do it cleverly. It is not always a question
of piling more money in; it is looking at how the services are

started with the issue that matters most to our people—jobs,
growth, mending our economies. First, we agreed that each country needs
to press on with sorting out its public finances. Dealing with our
debts and securing growth are not alternatives. The former is an
essential step in achieving the latter. In fact the communiqué
that we agreed unanimously reflects all three parts of the plan that we
have for growth in Britain: not just fiscal sustainability, but active
monetary policy to unlock the finance that businesses and families
need, and structural reforms to increase our competitiveness so that
our young people can get into work and succeed in the global

UK’s G8 also launched a bold new pro-business agenda to drive a
dramatic increase in trade and to get to grips with the problems of tax
evasion, aggressive tax avoidance and corporate secrecy. This was a
distinctive British agenda, to shape the way the world economy works
for the benefit of everyone. We believe in free trade, private
enterprise and low taxes as the best route to growth, but that is only
sustainable if ambitious trade deals are agreed, the taxes owed are
paid and companies play by the rules. This agenda has now, I believe,
been written into the DNA of G8 and G20 summits, I hope for many years
to come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000063">On
trade, we started the summit with the launch of negotiations on an
EU-US trade deal. This could add, as has recently been said, as much as
£100 billion to 
<?notus-xml column=249?>the EU economy, £80 billion to the US and as much as £85

tax, the Lough Erne declaration that leaders signed yesterday sets out
simple, clear commitments. Tax authorities across the world should
automatically share information so that those who want to evade taxes
will have nowhere to hide. Companies should know who really owns them
and tax collectors and law enforcers should be able to obtain this
information easily—for example, through central
registries—so that people cannot escape taxes by using
complicated and fake structures. In a world where business has moved
from the offline and the national to the online and the international
but the tax system has not caught up, we are commissioning the OECD to
develop a new international tax tool that will expose discrepancies
between where multinationals earn their profits and where they pay
their
taxes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000065">The
declaration also makes clear that all this action has to help
developing countries too, by sharing tax information and building their
capability to collect taxes. Crucially for developing countries, we
agreed that oil, gas and mining companies should report what they pay
to Governments, and that Governments should publish what they receive,
so that natural resources are a blessing, not a curse. Charities and
other NGOs have rightly campaigned for years for action on these issues
and for the first time they have been raised to the top of the agenda
and brought together in one
document.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000066">The
agreements on tax made at the summit are significant but it is also
worth noting what has happened on this front since I put this issue to
the top of the agenda. On 1 January there was no single international
standard for automatic exchange of information. Now there is such a
standard and more than 30 jurisdictions have already signed up, with
more to follow. After years of delay, the European Union has agreed to
progress the sharing of tax information between member states. The
overseas territories and Crown dependencies have signed up to the
multilateral convention on information exchange. They have agreed
automatic exchange of information with the UK and action plans for
beneficial ownership. Taken together, all the actions agreed with the
overseas territories and Crown dependencies will provide more than
£1 billion of revenue to the Exchequer, helping to keep taxes
down for hard-working families here in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000067">People
around the world also wanted to know if the G8 would take action to
tackle malnutrition and ensure that there is enough food for everyone.
The pledges at our nutrition and hunger summit earlier this month will
save 20 million children from stunting by 2020. But crucially at our G8
we also took action on some of the causes of these problems. This is

to the fourth T—terrorism—we agreed a tough, patient and
intelligent approach: confronting the terrorists, defeating the
poisonous ideology that sustains them and tackling the weak and failing
states 
<?notus-xml column=250?>in which they thrive. The G8 leaders reached a ground-breaking agreement
on ransom payments for kidnap by terrorists. In the past three years
alone, these ransom payments have given al-Qaeda and its allies tens of

will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000069">We also
discussed plans to begin direct talks with the Taliban. Britain has

discussed support to Libya. I believe that we should be proud of the
role we played to rid Libya of Colonel Gaddafi, but we need to help
that country secure its future. So we held a separate meeting with the
Libyan Prime Minister, which included President Obama, and European
nations have already offered to train 7,000 troops to help Prime
Minister Zeidan disarm and integrate the militias and bring security to
the whole country. More contributions will follow from others. Let me

let me turn to Syria. It is no secret that there are very
different views around the G8 table. I was determined that we should
use the opportunity of this summit to overcome some of these
differences and agree a way forward to help the Syrian people achieve
the change that they want. This did not happen during just one night in
Lough Erne. The talks between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister
Lavrov have been vital. In the weeks before the summit I flew to Sochi
and Washington, and I met again with President Putin and President
Obama in the hours before the summit began. These conversations were
open, honest and frank, but we were all agreed on what must be the core
principle of the international approach to this crisis. There is no

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> On my noble friend’s first points
about the importance of trade, tax and transparency for the developing
world, he is of course entirely right. We are aiming for more trade and
to break down the barriers. Coming out of the G8 we are very keen to
make progress at the WTO conference this December. For instance, we
will try to break down trade barriers in Africa, where they have a
terribly detrimental effect on the ability of people to do business and
also affect the tax revenues that flow from that. We aim to make that
easier and more straightforward so that tax is paid. We also want to
make the system more transparent so that money from industries such as
the extractive industries will go into legitimate purposes to help
those economies and societies, rather than into a small number of very
deep pockets. I agree with him on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000103">On

folly of military intervention in Syria and I have no need to repeat

the allegation in the <I>Times</I> today that the West is trying to

honourable friend the Foreign Secretary, distinguished historian as he
is, needs no reminding of the disastrous results of some previous
attempts by outsiders to change regimes in the Middle East. Not only
would such attempts, if successful, almost certainly produce a
Government in Damascus of much greater threat to British interests than
the present regime, it would directly contradict the
Government’s repeated view that any future regime is for the
Syrian people to decide. Can the Leader of the House assure us that HMG
is playing, and will play, no part in any such attempt at regime
change—what the Statement describes as helping Syrians to

not heard those latest figures on Northern Ireland, and I am delighted
to hear them. They are further evidence of the benefits of holding the
G8 there and the wisdom of doing so. I am very grateful for the remarks
made by the noble Lord. On his more general point about tax avoidance
and so on, this whole approach will clearly only work if it is applied
on a level basis across all countries. The aim of much greater
transparency is at the heart of this approach. An example is publishing
information on where countries pay tax in order to work out where the
profits are. Trying to make that approach across a broad front lies at
the heart of what was agreed at the

constructive conference. The proposals being made on taxation regarding
transparency and so on should certainly have a pretty rapid and
significant effect on tax evasion, but they will have only a relatively
limited effect on aggressive tax avoidance. Consulting internationally
is certainly welcome, as the Statement says in relation to the OECD.
However, at the end of the day, it is a matter for taxation in this
country. Multinationals which use these aggressive techniques in this
country have said that doing so is within the law. This is true, but it
means that our law needs to be changed, which is a very technical
subject. The law needs to relate to profits made in this country, and
in some way enact a tax on the profits of online transactions which
originate in this country. I hope that we will not overlook that side

not fulfil the promises made at that meeting, what further steps will

necessary. We will do so because it is obviously right to help

expectations on the quick arrival of a Geneva conference. Listening to
Mr Putin’s comments in Russia and at the summit, he has made it
very clear that he intends not only to continue to arm the present
regime but also to, in his words, draw up new contracts for arms with
it. That, to me, conveys very clearly Russia’s intention to
argue at a Geneva conference for a regime which is in control of as
much territory as possible. I am afraid that means continued fighting
and refugee problems for the Middle East, and little hope of a
successful outcome. We need to face up to the fact that Mr Putin has

clearly wise to say that one should not set unrealistic timescales and
all the rest of it in terms of Geneva II, which was one of the
conclusions that the G8 reached. Notwithstanding his points, it is fair
to say that progress was made at the summit in terms of Russia making
commitments that it had not previously made. We all have to hope that,

Despite all that was said on Monday in respect of the Equality Act, and
I listened very carefully to all the contributions, there is a
significant risk that religious organisations and individuals could be
treated less favourably by a public authority in the exercise of its
functions, for example, as regards funding, as a result of the public

Section 149 of the Equality Act, public authorities such as local
authorities are under a duty to have due regard to the need to advance
equality of opportunity between persons who share a relevant protected
characteristic and persons who do not share it. In particular, public
authorities must have due regard to the need to remove or minimise
disadvantages suffered by persons who share a relevant protected
characteristic that are connected to that characteristic. Since the
enactment of the first public sector duty in 2001, there has been
extensive litigation and an expansion of the discretion of public
authorities in this context. The courts have consistently interpreted
the duty of due regard as a duty to further equality of opportunity and
not just a duty to avoid

relation to the first scenario—unfavourable treatment of a
person following a decision not to opt in—the amendment is
needed for three reasons. First, the Bill does not expressly state that
a public authority will act 
<?notus-xml column=261?>ultra vires if it penalises a person following any of those decisions.
Clause 2 protects from compulsion; it does not appear to protect
religious organisations from being treated less favourably by public
authorities under Section 149. The Government appear to think that less
favourable treatment should be ultra vires. In the Secretary of
State’s response to the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of
England and Wales, she
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13061970000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000185">“In

is not clear in the Bill because an ordinary dictionary definition of
“compelled” does not include treating someone less
favourably. Nor is it at all clear, for example, that it would be
unlawful direct religious discrimination for a local authority to
withdraw meeting facilities from a church on the ground that it does
not offer same-sex marriage. At most, it is likely to amount to prima
facie unlawful indirect discrimination and that would then be subject
to the justification defence. We know that the results which flow from
judicial scrutiny of such defences are
uncertain.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13061970000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000132">Secondly,
Clause 2(5) and Clause 2(6) of the Bill provide explicit protection
from Sections 29 and 110 of the Equality Act, despite the
comprehensive protection from compulsion which Clause 2 is supposed to
provide. The presence of these extra exemptions in Clause 2(5) and 2(6)
casts serious doubt on the scope of the protection from compulsion. If
it is necessary to have exemptions for these sections, it is also
necessary to have a separate exemption for Section 149, to give the
protection provided for in this new
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000133">Thirdly,
even if it were established that the actions of the public authority
were ultra vires in the scenario described, such a clarification would
come only as a result of a judicial review being taken by religious
organisations, which would be time-consuming and expensive. What is
more, domestic courts have been reluctant to second-guess the
discretion of public authorities, where allegations have been made
that more weight should be given to a particular ground of
equality. The Secretary of State has been careful not to state that a
judicial review of a public authority that engaged in this less
favourable treatment would be successful. The Secretary of State has
said only that the decision would be vulnerable to challenge. This
amendment will provide the necessary clarification, and thus protect
persons from unfavourable treatment, by making it explicitly clear in
the Bill that public authorities cannot have regard to decisions by
persons not to opt-in, conduct, be present at, carry out, participate
in or consent to the taking place of same-sex marriages.</hs_para>

second scenario, in which persons may be treated unfavourably under
Section 149 following an expression of the opinion that marriage is the
union of one man and one woman, the amendment is necessary for two
reasons. First, the Government have repeatedly stated that teachers
will not be required to promote or endorse views which go against their
beliefs. The Minister stated at the Public Bill
Committee:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13061970000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000186">“It

it is not clear from the Bill that a teacher would be able to teach
that marriage should be only between a man and a woman, because some
parents, pupils or other teachers could find such teaching deeply
offensive. The public sector equality duty could force a school to
review, for example, its anti-bullying strategy to ensure that such
expressions of opinion are not given. A teacher could thus be
disciplined for expressing such an opinion to his or her
pupils<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:29:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

school’s curriculum positively presents only opposite-sex
marriage, there is a danger that the school could fall foul of the
Section 149 positive duty on schools to advance equality of opportunity
and to foster good relations between people with different protected
characteristics. The public sector equality duty could
consequently compel schools to endorse same-sex marriages, not just to
teach the fact that they

Government agree that less favourable treatment should be ultra vires,
then the appropriate approach is to make clear this fact in the Bill,
thus avoiding unnecessary litigation. It is unclear why the Secretary
of State does not think that it would be “helpful to make
legislative changes to the public sector equality duty” when a
narrowly tailored amendment is possible, which would resolve the
problem without adverse consequences for the public sector equality
duty more generally. It is better to eliminate this uncertainty now by
making this amendment than to leave uncertainty that is likely to be

Equality Act, the Equality Act more broadly, the Human Rights Act and

relation to Section 29 of the Equality Act 2010 and the Equality Act

Clause 2(5) makes it clear that discrimination claims cannot
be brought against religious organisations for refusing to marry
same-sex couples, for example. However, the protection is incomplete.
Clause 2(5) makes an exception for individuals only if they decide not
to conduct a 
<?notus-xml column=263?>relevant marriage, not be present at, carry out or participate in a
relevant marriage, or not to consent to a relevant marriage being
conducted. This list of activities echoes exactly the activities listed
under Clause 2(2). There is no reference to the activities listed under

religious organisations are at risk of being held to perform a public
function when exercising their discretion under Clause 2(1) is as
follows. First, while it seems to be highly unlikely that in general a
religious organisation would be regarded as a public authority, bodies
that are not generally public authorities may nevertheless be regarded
as hybrid authorities if they exercise some public functions. While
giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Secretary
of State recognised that in the Church of England, the minister
performs the function of a registrar, and thus performs a public
function. It is possible she is under the misconception, however, that
only the Church of England are in that position, and that in every
other religious organisation, the minister performs the religious part
of the ceremony, and a separate registrar performs the civil part. That
is not true. In the Catholic Church, for example, a religious
organisation which is going to have the option of opting in, the priest
or another designated person acts as the authorised person performing
the civil function. The priest conducts the marriage
ceremony—the religious ceremony—and it is usually the
priest who is the authorised person who also performs the
administrative or civil aspect of the marriage. Therefore, despite the
Secretary of State’s assertion, other religious organisations 
<?notus-xml column=264?>such as the Catholic Church also perform a public
function when they conduct marriages. I apologise—I should have
probably declared an interest as a
Catholic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000142">Does
the fact that religious organisations such as the Catholic Church, many
minority churches, and many other churches, conduct marriages that are
both religious and civil, make the religious organisation a hybrid
public authority? The answer to this question may well be
“yes”, because religious organisations perform a public
function when conducting civil marriages. Jack Straw, when he was Home

be fairly brief. Despite assurances and the amendments made by the
Minister in Committee and on Report in the other place, I
believe that there is still uncertainty about the
meaning of compulsion and the word “compelled”. The
amendment is designed to remove that uncertainty. It aims to make
things clear, and thus protect religious 
<?notus-xml column=266?>organisations and their members from all legal penalties. It would
prevent public authorities treating such organisations less favourably
if they decide not to opt in. For example, in some sphere completely
unconnected and separate from marriage—such as the provision of
a youth club or a night shelter—public authorities would be
acting ultra vires if they penalised religious bodies for not opting
in, and thus co-operating with the Bill when it becomes law.</hs_para>

experience, where we were totally unable to secure a totally common
position. Unlike previous committees, we decided not to take a vote,
but to produce a compromise document. I did so in the spirit of
conciliation and compromise, but I have to say that I do not agree with

will deal first with Amendment 17. The Government have widely
publicised the quadruple locks that supposedly protect religious
individuals and organisations. One of those so-called locks is the
protection from compulsion, which is supposed to ensure that religious
individuals and organisations will not be required, under any
circumstances, to conduct same-sex marriages if they object to them.
This protection from compulsion is given for two different situations.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:51:20"></hs_TimeCode>, in Clause
2(1), there is a prohibition against compelling any organisation to
take the necessary procedural step of opting in, which would enable
them to go on to conduct the actual ceremonies. Secondly, in
Clause 2(2), there is a prohibition against compelling any person to
“conduct” or “participate in” the same-sex
marriage ceremony. At first sight, the lock appears comprehensive and
wide-ranging, and the Government would have us believe that this is so.
However, in reality, the lock is very narrow in scope because there is
absolutely no definition in the Bill of “compelled”. That
omission creates uncertainty and possibly limits the scope of
protection offered by the
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061970000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061970000163">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:51:34"></hs_TimeCode>

is necessary because, without it, religious organisations will be at

guidance to authorised persons given in December 2012 outline the
contracting and declaratory words that must be exchanged in the
ceremony? It is because this is not just liturgy; it has to contain
certain promises to be a marriage, and the authorised person performs
the role for the state when he or she oversees and witnesses that these
words are in fact included in the ceremony. Finally, if a spouse were
to die after the ceremony but before the signing of the register, they
are married under UK law. It is not merely the registering of the

has arisen for the Government in the name “registrar” in

they record merely the fact that an event has occurred, but their role
in the marriage context is different. They witness and oversee the
formation of the marriage, then later record the fact that the marriage
has happened in the register. It is rather like the school classroom:
the register is taken and that is recording merely the reality that you
are physically present in the classroom. The religious and civil

Berridge:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for that helpful
intervention. That has been the Government’s position looking at
the established church but there is a different situation for those who
are authorised people. Generally in our law, you can get married at the
registry office, or at the hotel with the registrar there, or you can
marry without any intervention of the state when the banns are read in
the Anglican Church. In addition, there is a whole group of people and
religious organisations—for example, the Catholic Church and
Pentecostal churches—which do those marriages as authorised
people. They can decide whether to opt in to do this. First, that
places them in a different legal context for conducting marriages.
Secondly, the Anglican Church can make no decision at all to opt in; in
the Bill it is not allowed to. These groups in the middle, many of
which are in the ethnic minority community, are in a very different
legal position from the Anglican
Church.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061977000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061977000015">The
risk that religious organisations face when they move from conducting
only heterosexual marriages to also conducting same-sex marriages as a
public function is exacerbated by the fact that the decision to opt in
is not like a decision by a private members’ club where you can
look at the rule book and say that the decision was made based on the
rules. The discretion to make a decision is in this statute which lends
to the argument that it is a public discretion that these organisations
would be acting on. The Joint Committee on Human Rights did not come to
a firm conclusion on this matter because of a divergence of opinion.
However, I believe that helps the case for this amendment. The
divergence of opinion makes this amendment necessary because the basis
of litigation is a divergence of legal opinion. The Government need to
give some reassurance to these religious organisations because without

person is the registrar. No one comes from the local authority’s

office is not involved. It is the obligation of the priest to fill out
the register and to return it quarterly to the local authority’s

the Catholic Church expressed concern

exactly what has been said. I have great sympathy with what my noble
friend Lord Lester has said about how this might be approached by the
Government. Let me say two things to the Minister. First, there is a
history here of promises made and broken, as my noble friend made
clear. So even if this is absolutely okay, there is a feeling that it
might not be okay and we have to recognise that
fear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061977000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061977000021">Secondly,
there is also a history of campaigning people who seek all the time to
push their point further than is reasonable. For example, campaigners
have recently argued that we should withdraw aid from youth clubs run
by organisations that take a strong view about homosexual

you take that view you should not get any help from the state for your
youth club. I say to my noble friend that I understand the fears that
people have on this issue.</hs_para>

Catholic Church is particularly difficult because we have a very odd
and rather noble system in Britain that has come out of our history: to
ensure that it was no longer true that only Anglicans could marry, we
extended it to other people via the mechanism of enabling approved
persons to act as registrars. There may be an issue here and it may be
that the fears that people have are correct. However, I also recognise
what my noble friend Lord Lester has said: sometimes, when we try to
correct this, those of us who are not lawyers—and I am proud not
to be a lawyer—add things that make it worse. That is the danger
here. If we are not careful we will have a sort of argument of the
deaf, with one side saying, “We want

“toleration” has become a very curious word. People talk
about toleration as if it means tolerating views that you happen to
agree with. One of the things that we have to do is produce legislation
that enables a tolerant society to accept that some people have very
different views. That is not helped, if I may say so, by some of the
language used by people opposed to the Bill. Some disgraceful
statements have been made by people who have really not come to terms
with the fact that we live in a society that should be inclusive and
accepting. The churches have sometimes spoken intolerably and
intolerantly. However, the truth is that there is intolerableness and

have been expressed by the noble Baronesses, Lady Berridge and Lady
O’Loan, and others. My view 
<?notus-xml column=275?>is that those concerns are unwarranted. As I understand it, three issues
have been raised. The first is the public sector equality duty, under
Section 149 of the Equality Act, which
requires:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13061977000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061977000091">“A

equality considerations. “Due regard” must require
primary consideration to be given to other legislation—in
particular, the legislation before us. I regard it as unlikely in the
extreme that this public sector equality duty could impose a duty or
even confer a power on a public authority to penalise a person or a
body for declining to be involved in same-sex marriage, when the whole
point of this legislation, and a fundamental feature of it, is that a
person should not be compelled to do so for religious reasons. It would
be extraordinary for a court to rely on a public sector equality
duty.</hs_parafo>

second concern was about Clause 2(6) and the exclusion of public
functions, and that this does not cover the decision whether to opt in.
There is a good reason for that. In very simple terms, marrying a
person may well be a public function, as Clause 2(6) recognises.
However, a decision to opt in or not is not the exercise of a public
function. It is not, of itself, a service to the public but a decision
whether to rely upon and maintain a statutory immunity given by this
legislation. Any argument to the contrary would conflict with the
content and purposes of this legislation, and so is extremely unlikely
to be

third concern that we are dealing with in this group of amendments is
the suggestion that the legislation should clarify the meaning of
“compulsion” in Clause 2(1). For a public
authority to impose a detriment on a person for refusing to undertake
an opt-in activity or to refrain from undertaking an opt-out activity
would plainly amount to compulsion in this context. The reason for that
is very simple: it would impose legal pressure on that person when one
of the central purposes of this legislation is to protect religious

carefully about the role of judges and the role of the legislature? It
is the legislature’s role to make the law and the judges’
role to interpret it. Having heard, for example, the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, with whom I entirely agree, I cannot imagine—I do not
know what these breaches of faith in the past amount to; no one has
explained what they are talking about—that the independent
judiciary would not interpret the legislation as it is now drafted in
accordance with its object and purpose. Were there to be any breach of
assurances by Ministers, under the Pepper v Hart regime that could, if
necessary, be brought to the attention of the courts and they would
take that into account. Should we not, when we are making laws, try to
make them clear, but at the same time recognise that in the end they
are to be interpreted by a wise, independent, enlightened

there are very few locks that my noble friend Lord Lester and the noble

discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation equally with
discrimination on the grounds of religious belief. It would not permit
a public body, even with the intention of eliminating discrimination on
grounds of sexual orientation, lawfully to treat a religious
organisation

belief—that marriage should be between a man and a

sides of your Lordships’ House—that religious
organisations and individuals should be free to express their beliefs

Bill about whether to conduct or participate in same-sex marriages,
without fear of repercussion or penalty of any kind. I hope I can
clarify for your Lordships that, as the law stands, a public authority

policy of penalising people or organisations which have religious or
philosophical beliefs with which a public authority disagrees would in
itself be discriminatory. One element of the duty is to have due regard
to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination. It is not meant to be
itself an instrument to discriminate unlawfully. For a local authority,
for example, to withdraw meeting facilities from a church because it
decided not to offer same-sex marriage would be likely to be unlawful
direct discrimination because of religion or belief. We believe that it

commented that there is nothing in the Bill which states that it would
be unlawful for a public authority to punish a religious organisation
which had not opted in. The courts have considered the question of
whether a local authority can use equality legislation to punish an
organisation with views of which it disapproves. In the case of Wheeler
v Leicester City Council, the council banned a rugby club from using
its ground after some of its members attended a tour of South Africa.
It used the then Race Relations Act to justify its decision. The case
went to the House of Lords, which held that the decision was irrational
and that it was an improper purpose, because the members of the rugby
club were legally entitled to go on a tour, just as an organisation is
entitled not to opt in. I believe that the reasoning in that case to
have a clear read-over in this particular case. Similarly, a local

registrars at some length on Monday evening. The explanation given then

Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, judges, who also exercise a public
function, are not allowed to pick and choose which cases come before
them. Similarly, a local authority could not have a policy of refusing
to promote staff who have expressed a belief that marriage should only
be between<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:37:21"></hs_TimeCode> a man

pointed out—and as my noble friend Lord Lester quoted on
Monday—some authorities do idiotic things. No legislation can
provide for every eventuality. However, we believe that the Bill
minimises this possibility as far as possible by making it absolutely
explicit that those relying on Clause 2 are permitted to refuse to be
involved in solemnising same-sex marriages. There would indeed be no
cause of action. We believe that an application for strike-out could be
made early in any proceedings, as there would be no reasonable prospect
of success in such claims. The noble

Clause 2, so that the law is clear and consistent. This aspect of the

achieved. As the noble Lord said, “having regard” also
means that we have to have regard to primary legislation, such as what
would be in this Act if the Bill is enacted. I hear what my noble
friend Lady Knight says about concerns that sometimes guarantees do not
always seem to follow through many years later. However, what we are
dealing with here—I think that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick,
made this point—is a fundamental part of the architecture of
this legislation: namely, that there should be religious freedom not to
opt in. Therefore, it would be unthinkable for a court not to have

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> Indeed, my
noble friend is right. Article 9 of the European Convention
on Human Rights gives that right to freedom of religious belief and
expression. The noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, said that sometimes
the courts are reluctant to second-guess public authorities. It is
highly unlikely that the court would do something which is in direct
contradiction 
<?notus-xml column=281?>of what Parliament has clearly expressed and
intended not just in the Bill but in all the statements that have been
made by Ministers and, indeed, by almost everyone who has participated
in these
debates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:41:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061986000002">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:42:42"></hs_TimeCode>
is also important to note—again, this point was made by my noble
friend Lord Lester and picked up by my noble friend Lord
Deben—that amendments can sometimes have unintended and adverse
consequences. I know that is certainly not the intention of the noble
Baroness who moved this amendment, but the equality duty applies to and
protects equally various protected characteristics, including religion
or belief so a public authority has to bear in mind the impact of its
policies on people holding different religious or philosophical
beliefs, such as the belief that marriage should be only between a man
and a woman. If, as the amendment proposes, a public authority is
prevented from having any regard to individuals’ or
organisations’ beliefs about same-sex marriage, it
would be unable to consider how its own decisions could potentially
discriminate against, or otherwise disadvantage, people who believe
that marriage should be only between a man and a woman. That would
remove an important protection for people who hold such a belief. I
know that this is not what the noble Baroness intends but it
illustrates the fact that when you try to solve one problem
you can create
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:42:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061986000003">As
I say, I recognise the concerns that some public bodies might be
overzealous or mistaken in their exercise of the equality duty or
misuse it to the detriment of those who do not agree with same-sex
marriage. As I have indicated, no Government can give a copper-bottomed
guarantee that some public authorities will not act irrationally. It is
important that we ensure that public authorities understand their
responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 correctly, and how these
relate to beliefs about marriage. With that in mind, the Equality and
Human Rights Commission has undertaken to review its guidance for
public authorities to ensure that the position is as clear as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:43:28"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
have said, while I appreciate the intention behind this amendment, it
is unnecessary and could have adverse consequences quite at odds with
its
intention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061986000004">I
turn to Amendment 17. The concept of compulsion is readily understood
in its natural meaning, and to subject anyone to any type of detriment
or unfavourable treatment because they refuse to participate in any way
in religious solemnization of same-sex marriages would clearly be
understood as a violation of their legal right under this Bill not to
participate. We are therefore confident that Clause 2 provides strong
and effective protection to ensure that religious organisations and
their representatives cannot be forced to participate in same-sex
marriages against their belief. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill set
out the position, as quoted by my noble friend Lady Berridge: the
concept of compulsion is a broad one, which would include, but not be
limited to, attempts to use criminal or civil law, contractual
provisions or the imposition of any detriment to force a person to
carry out the activities protected in Clause 2. The clause
provides no specific remedy, but makes clear that no attempt
at such compulsion would be
upheld<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:44:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061986000005">Less
favourable treatment by a public authority of a person or organisation
who does something which the Bill makes clear they are
legally entitled to do would, 
<?notus-xml column=282?>in itself, clearly be unlawful and open to

penalties—civil or criminal —on a religious organisation

includes, but is not limited to, disciplinary or other action taken in
the employment context. In all circumstances a person who has suffered

Amendment 18 is again unnecessary as the Bill already makes clear that
the decision to opt in or not is an internal doctrinal decision. It is
a matter for the religious organisation involved and—as the
noble Lord, Lord Pannick, clearly said—is not a public function.
The amendment seems to acknowledge this because, as it says itself, it
is drafted for the avoidance of doubt. The activities mentioned Clause
2 (1) are obviously activities which are private in nature, carried out
by religious organisations which are of course not public authorities.
The Government are confident that no religious organisation or
representative could be susceptible to judicial review or challenge
under the Human Rights Act 1998 or Equality Act 2010 in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0001.htm#13061986000008">I know
that the noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, and my noble friend Lady
Berridge referred to the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We will give
proper consideration to the points raised and respond to the Committee,
but we again believe that this is a case where adding words to the Bill
might simply increase what there is to argue about, and potentially
water down the protection already provided, by casting
doubt generally on what functions of a religious
organisation are or are not considered to be a public
function.</hs_para>

we actually look at the activities which constitute “opt-in
activities”. These include decisions by the relevant governing
authority of a religious organisation to give written consent for
marriages of same-sex couples to take place and an application by such
an organisation to the superintendent registrar for the solemnisation
of marriages of same-sex couples to take place in a place of worship.
These are clearly private functions. If, for example, the Bill were to
explain that a decision by a religious organisation to apply to
register one of its religious buildings for the solemnisation of
same-sex marriages is not a public function, this would raise the
question as to whether such an application in respect of opposite-sex
marriages is currently a public function. I hope that this again
illustrates the law of possible unintended consequences. However, I
accept the suggestions that have been helpfully made. We will seek to

other noble Lords have emphasised the need for clarity in legislation.

clarification. That is why the House exists.</hs_para>

registering a marriage, and the noble Baroness, Lady Berridge,

following through on this intention, however, it is important for the
Government to recognise that marriage ceremonies are not the only
relevant service that a religious body or minister of religion might be
asked to conduct. Increasingly today people who marry outside a
religious context come afterwards to a place of worship asking for a
blessing. If Members of the Committee are not sure what I am getting
at, they may go online and type in “blessings” and see a
very good one on the Church of England site, which I have used in the
past after a civil marriage. I am particularly thinking of the
predicament of nonconformist and minority ethnic
churches.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000024">A
blessing ceremony may sound less weighty than a marriage ceremony but
the Government must understand that officiating at a blessing would be
just as problematic for a faith community whose celebrants could not
officiate at a same-sex marriage ceremony without violating their
conscience as would officiating at a marriage ceremony. Doing so would
involve the religious body or minister of religion authenticating,
celebrating and affirming something that their conscience forbids them
from doing. The provision of a blessing ceremony in such a context
would involve the minister of religion and the religious body in
question acting in direct violation of their religious identity. Such a
religious body or minister of religion would have to decline to provide
such a service in just the same way that they would have to decline to
marry a same-sex
couple.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000025">As

way. I know that he will know the Church of England a lot
better than I do but in order to conduct a religious
blessing, let us say of a civil partnership, in a religious building,
it is up to the House of Bishops and the General Synod to approve a
liturgy. Without that approval there is no approved blessing by the
Church. There is surely, therefore, a mechanism because if I am a
priest I cannot conduct a blessing without a liturgy and, therefore,
the synod would have to have pre-agreed that it was permitting the
blessing, and without such a blessing it could not do

in a house or a church is immaterial. I am referring to a specific area

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, this is entirely misconceived. This Bill
is not about blessings. The church has a right to bless or not as it
likes. In my case I am referring to the Catholic church, and not the
Church of England, and you can bless without any difficulty. The idea
that somehow by refusing a blessing you would be subject to the law
because of this Bill seems totally fallacious. You
might be subject to the law according to other 
<?notus-xml column=287?>Acts, but we have not found that, and if you want to
change those Acts, no doubt that would be sensible. But really, this is
otiose. That is what worries me. It seems perfectly proper that people
who disagree with the vast majority of both Houses on this subject will
seek proper protection in areas where one might be uncertain. However
there is also a degree of courtesy—I am sorry to have raised
that word because it will now dog me for the rest of my
life—about not loading this Bill with all kinds of statements
about how you do not want to be pressed in this or that
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000034">It is
quite clear what a blessing is. It is something which the churches give
as a generous offering to people who ask for it. There is no
compulsion; they do not have to do it. If they refuse it, as they can
in many cases, there is no question of there being any recourse to law.
My father was an Anglican clergyman; he would give blessings in certain
circumstances and not in others. That was because in some circumstances
he thought they were suitable, in others he thought they were not.
Nobody could, would, or should ever have taken him to court. Imagine
the court case: “Well, old father, what did you do this
for?” and the response, “These two people have been
living with other people as well at the same time and so I decided not
to give them a blessing”. On what possible basis does the court
then say, “You should have given them a
blessing”?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000035">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>
say to the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey, that we have to
be very careful. There is a great deal of unhappiness among decent
people about the attitude of some churchmen to this Bill. Therefore,
for goodness’ sake, do not let us load this Bill with all sorts
of bits and pieces which are not necessary. Let us protect people where
the Bill affects them. Do not let us try to protect people where the
Bill does not affect them, otherwise we will be doing something which
is the bane of American legislation: because there is no concept of the
Long Title, you can add anything you like to any Act. You say,
“If you want me to vote for this, I want you to include my bit
about a bridge in my constituency”. I fear that this is
precisely that kind of addition. It seeks to squeeze something into the
Bill which has nothing to do with it at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000036">Lastly, I
will say why this is very serious. If we are to take seriously the
contention of some churchmen that same-sex marriages are uniquely
unacceptable, those same churchmen have to be very careful that they do
not spread that unacceptability to other things. A blessing is
manifestly something which the churches have used to overcome the
reality of pastoral care as against the reality of doctrinal belief. It
ought to stay there. The last place where it ought to be reflected is
in the legislation of this House and of this Parliament. Blessing is a
mechanism whereby the Church of England, for example, has overcome the
fact that doctrinally it believes that marriage is indissoluble, but on
the other hand it has to deal with marriage as it is. That is what
blessing is. Do not, for goodness’ sake, try to muck this up by
adding to this Bill something which is entirely

have said already twice during our debates that I utterly support the
rights of religious organisations to take a very different view of
same-sex marriage than me, as passionately as I believe that public
functions need to be open to all. I regret that none of the Methodist
mafia is here today—they are usually around when I need one of
them—but I want to make a particular point about the
nonconformist churches. We spend an awful lot of time talking about the
Church of England for obvious reasons, but I do not want any of the
nonconformist churches to be left in any doubt that they will be
subject to some kind of compulsion when the Church of England will not
be. That is absolutely not the

Lord Deben, that, as legislators working on the Bill, our duty is to
protect those who will be affected when it is enacted and not others.
Section 28 of the Equality Act 2010 provides for a clear exemption for
services provided in relation to marriage and civil partnership from
the Section 29 duty not to discriminate. This will not change under
this Bill. I therefore expect the Minister to confirm that a refusal to
conduct a blessing of a same-sex marriage would be considered a
“related service”, and thus protected under existing
provisions within the Equality Act 2010. Therefore we believe that
Amendment 15 in the name of the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Carey, is

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey, for flagging
this issue so that all of us can answer it with clarity.
Amendment 15 seeks clarity that the refusal by a religious
organisation or its representative to conduct a service of blessing of
a marriage of a same-sex couple would not be considered 
<?notus-xml column=289?>unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act 2010. The amendment
distinguishes between the legal act of solemnisation of a marriage and
a religious blessing which does not have legal effect. The
amendment is intended to ensure that there is no requirement to conduct
such blessings. As with the last group of amendments, we are in
agreement on the aim of protecting religious organisations, and I am
glad that the noble and right reverend Lord was reassured by much of
the previous debate, on that matter.</hs_para>

reverend Lord recognised, the Government are determined that, in
opening up the institution of marriage to same-sex couples,
they will protect and promote religious freedom, as other noble Lords

same-sex marriage ceremonies. The quadruple lock in this respect amends
the Equality Act 2010 to make clear that it is not unlawful
discrimination for a religious organisation or representative to refuse
to marry a same-sex couple, and I remind the noble and right reverend
Lord that these protections apply beyond the Church of England, as my
noble friend Lady Barker made very clear.</hs_para>

Clause 2(2) provides that a person cannot be compelled to

solemnisation of a marriage of a same-sex couple according to religious

Baroness replied to the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, she may have had in
mind not only what was said in the previous debate but also the fact
that at common law, as was said in that debate, it is quite clear that
for a public authority to misuse its powers punitively is itself a
public law wrong. The case quoted was that of Wheeler, but there have
been others such as, for example, when Rupert Murdoch was penalised by
a public authority so far as advertising was concerned. It was also
when Shell was penalised because of a boycott. They were cases where
public authorities were doing public law wrongs, and in my opinion that
would apply equally at common law so far as this is

debate and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Deben, that courtesy and
respect are very much at the heart of what the House of Lords does and
the way in which we do our business. However, as a House we have to
listen to the concerns of many of the people out there; people who we
know. I can assure noble Lords that I did not concoct this amendment
because I was personally associated with it. I did so because of the
many concerns that people have. I would differ from the noble Lord,
Lord Deben, in his view that this is quite different from the Marriage
Act 1949. It is not, because the people who do the blessings are doing
so over the marriage itself. Nevertheless, what I gained from this
brief debate is a clear assurance that people have nothing to fear.
That is now on the record, particularly the view of the noble Baroness
that it is unnecessary because it is covered by the Bill. With that
assurance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

Carey, has departed because I was reminded during the course of the

marriages, of which it conducts more than 600 a year, are notably even
more special. They express humanist values and beliefs, but are

order to clarify humanism and the kind of marriage we would want, I
will describe what makes it distinctive. The marriage is conducted by a
celebrant who shares the beliefs and values of the couple. The
celebrant spends time with the couple prior to the marriage itself to
know them better and better to shape the subsequent marriage. The
marriage ceremony in general reflects specific humanist convictions;
for example, that there is no supernatural side to this reality and
that human beings in the here and now are the source of value and
meaning. These are specific non-religious belief elements. Beyond the
general reflection of humanist values that underlie the ceremony, the
order of service is created 
<?notus-xml column=293?>in line with the specific beliefs and values of the
couple. This itself reflects a humanist conviction about the creation
of meaning in human lives. The marriage is conducted in a place of
particular meaning or significance to the

only because it shows the pent-up demand for humanist marriages. Since
they were legalised in 2005, humanist ceremonies have soared from a few
hundred a year to approaching 3,000. In 2011, there were 2,846 humanist
marriages, but only 1,729 Roman Catholic ones. Only Church of Scotland
and civil marriages are more popular. In 2011, humanist marriages
amounted to 8.5% of all marriages and 18% of all religion or belief
marriages. Moreover, if one looks at the past few years, since humanist
weddings became well established, the picture is striking. In the
latest three years for which figures are available—2009 to
2011—the total number of marriages in Scotland has been rising
again, by 1,611, with humanist ceremonies contributing 942 marriages,

British Humanist Association, which was set up in 1896 as the Union of
Ethical Societies, has been running well established services offering
humanist marriage for a long time. It trains, accredits, insures and
provides continuing professional education for hundreds of celebrants
throughout the country. These ceremonies attract a very high level of
satisfaction—more than 95% of clients give them a five out of
five rating. On the basis of extensive and impassioned testimony from
couples who have had them, these weddings are profoundly valued as
reflecting the beliefs of those who have been married and allowing them
to have 
<?notus-xml column=294?>ceremonies devised in collaboration with the
celebrant to meet their own wishes. Many are equally as eloquent about
how the need to have a legal registration of their marriages detracted

Massey of Darwen:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak briefly in
support of my noble friend’s amendments and of this Bill. The
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey, asked noble Lords a few
moments ago to listen to the people out there. We live in an
increasingly diverse society and are observing shifts in our lifetime
from one generation to another. When most of us were young, it was
assumed that most people were Christians—or at least claimed to
be. Nowadays, among young people at least, the opposite is true, and
surveys 
<?notus-xml column=295?>and polls show that the majority are not religious. Even in the census,
which was very conservative, 25% of us said we had no religion. Among
the under-50s, more than 40% said
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000073">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:36:31"></hs_TimeCode>
are, of course, those who do not welcome this move away from religion.
One consequence is that among young people with no religion—I
suspect among older people, too—many nevertheless have strong
beliefs and commitments that are not necessarily religious but still
provide answers to questions about the importance of relationships,
respect for others and moral standpoints. I would maintain that most
young people have strong moral commitments at the personal and social
level. What for many previous generations was expressed in
Christianity, many young people today express in beliefs about respect
for each other, the world and future
generations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000074">This
is relevant to the amendments that we are debating. These young people,
when they marry, often wish to do so in a ceremony that expresses their
humanist commitments and beliefs, and their respect for other people.
Just as for many religious people the idea of a wedding in a register
office is a mere legal formality compared to the vows they make to each
other and to God in a church wedding, so for these young humanists it
is second best to settle for a civil wedding conducted by a registrar
who, regardless of his faith or lack of it, is not allowed by law to
give expression to any religious belief, including
humanism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000075">The
Bill is about equal marriage. It is also about equal weddings and
allowing this growing segment of our population—already growing
in size, as my noble friend said—to conduct their own legally
recognised weddings within the framework of their own humanist beliefs
and commitments. The proposal has wide support. In Scotland, as my
noble friend said, humanists conduct more weddings than any religious
body apart from the Church of Scotland. A YouGov poll tells us that
more than half the population support the proposal, with only 6%
strongly opposed and another 6% tending that way. I understand that the
Church of England told the British Humanist Association last week that
they would not oppose
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000076">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>
British Humanist Association was accommodating in drafting the
amendments proposed at earlier stages of the Bill and in responding to
suggestions made at meetings with government Ministers and officials.
The difficulties that were expressed then now seem to have been
resolved. The amendment breaks no new ground in being based on an
organisation rather than a building: the Jews and Quakers are already
in this position. The principal concern expressed by officials at
Church House last week to the British Humanist Association was that the
public nature of marriage should be preserved. That is something that
we can surely all endorse but it does not require a registered
building, only that the place intended for the wedding is known and
open to all who wish to attend. The amendment specifies “with
open doors” and the location for all weddings is already
included in the notice of marriage required under the Marriage Act
1949.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000077">The

concerned, as was my noble friend Lord Deben, that a number of
religious believers in your Lordships’ House may, with the
greatest courtesy, have been attempting to load up the Bill.
I shall concentrate my remarks on the allegation that this amendment
undermines, as it were, the whole basis of the law on marriage. As the
law stands, any religion may conduct legally recognised marriages so
long as they have use of a registered place of worship. Any sect of any
religion that can afford a building can register it as a place of
worship, and then re-register it for marriages without any obstacle
whatever. In effect, provided you are a religion, you get a
bisque.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000082">Putting
aside the 11 main Christian denominations—the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, made reference to this—there are almost 4,500 places
registered for the solemnisation of marriage by minor Christian groups,
and more than 650 by non-Christian groups. Many of these, to put it as
kindly as I can, are a little eccentric. The noble Lord, Lord Harrison,
referred to the Aetherius Society, which believes that gods from outer
space visit the earth in flying saucers—and, yes, the Aetherius
Society is registered to perform
marriages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000083">This
amendment simply proposes approval for organisations that, unlike
religious bodies, which sail through unimpeded, meet a number of
serious criteria. The first one in Amendment 22A—it is printed
on the Marshalled List so I will not tire the Committee by reading it
all out—makes a series of requirements. They must be
registered charities of good repute, they must have been established
for at least 10 years, the ceremonies must be rooted in their belief,
written procedures must exist and so on. In other words, a simple visit
from a flying saucer will simply not suffice for the humanist group. A
serious list of terms and conditions is set out in the proposed new
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000084">On the
registration of buildings, to which the noble Baroness has just
referred, I think this is a bit of a red herring. Any marriage needs to
be preceded by a public notice—either banns in a
parish church or a notice under Section 27 of the Marriage Act 1949.
The amendment ensures not only that the place is known 
<?notus-xml column=297?>but that the marriage is to be celebrated under open
doors. I believe, therefore, that this objection is without substance.
The proposal is organisation-based in the same way that the law already
recognises the organisations of Jews and Quakers. I recognise that what
we, as humanists, are seeking to do is, as it were, to slipstream in
behind the Bill, which I strongly support.</hs_para>

with respect that the two main Christian religions in our country are
in some danger of falling out of step with civil society. For example,
any corporation that made it clear that women were excluded from top
positions in its organisation would find itself in court. Consequently,
the debate about women bishops now going on in the Church of England
raises a few eyebrows in this day and age. Most young married couples
are involved in family planning and yet, as I understand it, the Roman
Catholic Church continues to regard this as a mortal
sin.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061986000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000114">6.45

Church of England atheist is not the ideal person to give advice to
churches about how they should be coping with modern society. However,
in the matter of same-sex marriage and humanist marriage, I believe
that both of the main churches, and indeed the minority ones, are out
of step with civil society. The noble Lord made reference to Scotland,
where humanist marriages have now been legal for more than a decade and
where there are already more humanist marriages each year than there
are Roman Catholic marriages. I understand that it is predicted that by
2015 they will have overtaken the Church of Scotland
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061986000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061986000087">Frankly,

made over the past 100 years in rights for women is widely supported in

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like up to pick up on the right
reverend Prelate’s last point about the curious distinction
between a humanist celebration of marriage and one for those of us of
faith. I refer back to the very important point made by the noble Lord,
Lord Harrison, about those of us of faith who have been very moved by
humanist funerals, where without the liturgy and the solemn elements
that are very important to those of us of faith, it has been possible
to absolutely capture in a particular style and format that is
relevant—in the case of a funeral, for the family and friends of
the bereaved, and, we hope in the future, in the case of a marriage, to
the absolute wishes of the couple—in a form that is almost like
liturgy. I suspect that the humanists would not like that word but it
gives a sense of the importance of the act that the couple are about to
go through.</hs_para>

the British Humanist Association has sent through have drawn the
distinction very clearly between the clinical process that can happen
in a civil registry office versus the extremely moving ceremony that a
humanist celebrant can create with a couple to mark the day in the way
that they want. I would regret it if we picked up the French style of
having to have two ceremonies. In France, of course, they celebrate
both in style; weddings go on for whole weekends there, it is never
just one event. But I have been very moved by the accounts in these
case studies where it is absolutely apparent that the handfasting and
the words that the couple have chosen mean as much to them as the
marriage ceremony means to me as a Christian. If this Bill is about the
coalition’s commitment to equality, and indeed the previous
Government’s commitment to equality, now is the time to address
this and accept that this organisation should be considered an approved

of the reasons I have been a member of the Humanist Society for a long
time now is because there seem to be people in that society who are

the supernatural part of most religions. Also, in my view many
religions, including the main ones, are often rather bad when it comes
to women’s rights. Women have made enormous progress in the past

the major
religions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061994000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061994000015">This

when they marry. The Humanist Society has developed arrangements to
train people to provide that sort of service to members of the society.
My noble friend Lord Harrison has made a very strong case this
afternoon and so have other people. I hope, therefore, that what he is

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I am a lapsed humanist.
When I was at Cambridge I was a member of the most privileged club
which was the Cambridge Humanists and I lapsed because it was too
religious. My most memorable experience was asking EM Forster to give a
lecture. He said he would give a lecture on whether Jesus had a sense
of humour. I said, “That is a splendid subject”. I was
just thinking that now you could not give a lecture like that. You
could give one on whether God had a sense of humour. I am not sure you
could give one on whether the Prophet had a sense of humour. But
certainly the proposition at the time was very interesting in
Cambridge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061994000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061994000017">I
completely agree with the speeches in favour of these amendments for
all the reasons that have been given. One further reason why I am in
favour is because both the Equality Act and Article 9 of the European
Convention on Human Rights recognise the rights not only of those of
religious belief but also of those of no belief, and the Strasbourg
Court has repeatedly explained that in a plural society agnostics,
atheists and non-believers have as much right as believers of all kinds
to equality of treatment. I have no doubt that there is inequality of
treatment at the moment between humanists as a belief system and
others. If you look at those registered as religions, they include, for
example, theosophists. It is very difficult to distinguish between a
theosophist and a humanist except that one believes in God and the
other does not. And Buddhists and Jainists are registered but they are
not theistic religions. I believe that, in terms of equality and common
sense, we must move on this, and not only because my party thinks
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061994000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061994000018">My noble

own marriage solemnisations, according to their beliefs, by someone who
shares their beliefs and in any place of their choosing,

to cover quite a bit of ground in my reply, so I hope that the House
will indulge me if I am not as speedy as noble Lords might like me to

it is important for me to remind noble Lords about the purpose of this
Bill. It is about allowing people to marry who currently cannot marry,
and the only people who cannot marry at this time are gay and lesbian
couples. When we decided as a Government to bring forward legislation
to allow that to happen, we decided to do so by making as little change
as possible to existing marriage law. The noble Baroness, Lady
Thornton, has described quite clearly how different humanists might
celebrate their weddings, so I will not go through all the details.
However, it is important to make the point that humanists can marry in
England and Wales. They might not be able to have at this time the
wedding celebration that they would like but, even if they do not want
to follow the route that the noble Baroness suggested, where some
people go first to a register office and then have a separate
celebration, because humanists are non-religious, they have the option,
within a civil marriage at a register office, of being able to adapt
that service to include vows and readings that reflect their humanist
beliefs and values. Although that might not be ideal, they are not
alone in sometimes having to adapt their
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:26:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061994000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061994000047"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Thornton" PimsId="4281" UID="13061994000088" xid="1466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061994000088">Baroness
Thornton:</Member></B> The noble Baroness needs to acknowledge that
humanism is a system of belief. It is quite wrong to suggest that,
because humanists do not want to have a religious wedding, somehow it
is all right for them to have an adapted civil service. That is not the
point here. The point is that humanists want to have a ceremony that is
a humanist ceremony, based on their beliefs and their value

seeking to achieve. I absolutely understand the point that the noble
Baroness 
<?notus-xml column=307?>is making. I was trying to explain that some people
who follow a religious faith might argue that because humanists,
although belonging to a belief organisation, are not religious, they

Lord is making. As I said when I began, there is quite a lot for me to
cover in responding to this issue. I beg the noble Lord’s
indulgence to allow me to go through my response. I assure him that I
will cover everything, giving this matter the justice and the
seriousness that it deserves. The point I was trying to make, which has
been mentioned in different debates over the past few weeks in the
context of this Bill, is that, for a range of people who want to get
married, not just humanists, not everyone is able to have a religious
ceremony or the ceremony that they desire.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:38:15"></hs_TimeCode> instance, we

Scotland, who was therefore not able to marry in St Mary Undercroft and

the noble Lord that things are not so straightforward. It is not the
case that everything is okay in one scenario and different in another.

point still stands—I will explain why in a moment—that in
order to allow organisations to marry in the way that is covered in
this amendment, although it seems like a small change, it requires a
change in existing marriage law that has wider implications for our
system of regulation of marriage law in England and Wales. The noble
Lord, Lord Harrison, and other noble Lords have referred to the
contribution that my right honourable friend the Attorney-General made
during the debate on Report in the other place when he made it clear
that if the amendment that was being debated at that time was passed,
it would make the Bill incompatible with the European Convention on
Human Rights.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:33:08"></hs_TimeCode> amendment in
the name of the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, is broader in scope and
therefore does not raise the concern that the Attorney-General 
<?notus-xml column=308?>raised during the debate in the other place.
However, at that time and consistently, the Government have been clear
that the proposals put forward by the British Humanist Association have
wider implications for marriage law. The Government are concerned
because of those wider implications. There has been a lot of focus on
the Attorney-General’s response to that specific amendment put
forward on Report, and how that would have made the Bill at that time
incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. However,
that was not the only issue that the Government have raised, and
continue to raise, about this proposal. I will explain all this in the

Thornton:</Member></B> I am very puzzled by what the noble Baroness is
saying. She is now saying that there are other grounds. In the
Commons—and it is on the record in <I>Hansard</I>—the
Minister specifically said that the letter that she would send to the
British Humanist Association would be comprehensive and would cover all
the Government’s concerns. This amendment and the discussions
that the British Humanist Association has had since then, in good
faith, have met all those points. I am very puzzled as to why the noble
Baroness is now leading us into what sounds like the answer,
“The Government have concerns about other matters”. It

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I do not have the copy of
<I>Hansard</I> in front of me for the debates that took place in the
other place. However, I am confident that my right honourable friend
the Secretary of State, Maria Miller, made it clear in those debates
that there were other concerns about this proposal that went beyond
those raised by the Attorney-General on that specific amendment at that
time. In the letter that my right honourable friend sent to Kate Green,
she was also clear that there were issues of
principle which went beyond the narrow point that the Attorney-General
raised in those

which now form the majority of marriages, where we give other
organisations—that is, other religious faiths—this power
to marry, the authorisation is subject to specific safeguards that are
well established and embedded in current law. In the case of religious
ceremonies—though I absolutely understand that the British
Humanist Association is not a religion but a belief
organisation—registration is generally linked to a particular
building or, in the case of Quakers and the Jewish religion,
by a longstanding arrangement that took account of the particular
position of those religious organisations. Historians in
this House will know that the Marriage Act 1753 recognised the Jewish

takes place, including safekeeping of duplicate marriage registers in

will be absolutely clear on the point that the noble Baroness was
pressing me on earlier. Our concerns are not about entry to the system
of marriage, but spring from opening a new route to marriage and a new
system of regulation. In the course of this debate, noble Lords have
expressed views on religious groups who can marry now. However, the key
point is that they must all comply with the existing system in terms of
their being approved. I do not suggest for one moment that there is any
concern about any of the groups we may be discussing. However, the
reason why the system we have is so important, and why we consider that
there would be wider implications if we were to change the way in which
we authorise people to marry, is because that could have an impact on
things such as, for example, the way we are able to police sham
marriages conducted by criminal wedding
arrangers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061995000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061995000007">The

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> The responsibility I have as the
Minister responding to this debate is to make clear that something
which on the face of it seems quite straightforward would significantly
change our marriage law. We have to consider the implications of that
before a decision could be made as to whether to change this law. The
system we have of registering and authorising people to marry based on
religious premises has been in existence since 1898. To introduce a new
system for new organisations to be authorised in a different way is a
significant change. If we are going to make that change we need to make
sure that we have properly considered all the
implications.</hs_para>

Alli:</Member></B> There is huge respect for the Minister in this House
and for the way in which she has conducted the passage of the Bill. We
all want the Bill to go through. However, the noble Baroness
should take the temperature of the House and of the other place. There
is a will in both Houses that this should go through. You see this
sometimes when the Front Bench are making their response: the
explanation of why it should not go through has been crafted by the
Civil Service and does not feel like one any of us
understand. The unintended consequence argument, the argument that it
could delay the Bill and a whole range of financial arguments are the
standard set of arguments put forward generally to stop
amendments going through. We would be very sympathetic if we understood
what was worrying the Government about this amendment but as yet I,

will have observed that the right reverend Prelate, while unable yet to
tell us precisely what the position of the Church of England would be,
spoke with, one could say, sympathy towards the position. I think what
we are all asking is that if the Ministers, both my noble friend and
the Secretary of State in the other place, were
to say to the civil servants that they would like to find a
way of accommodating this, we know that they could it. We would really

that there has been a great deal of support from all sides of the

but I am still obliged as the Minister responsible for the Bill to
explain when an amendment is put forward that it will have a
significant effect—as we think this one could have—so
that noble Lords are aware and properly apprised of the seriousness of
the issues at stake. While the British Humanist Association and a lot

they should and I have not heard any reasons why they should not. That

there should not be a humanist marriage. Can the Minister at least
say—and it is 7.45 pm—that she will take it
away and have a look at it. Then she could come back on Report or
before and say, “No, we are not going to do it”. She is

course, Acts of Parliament are not the only source of legislation.
Parliament has also seen a huge increase in the amount of secondary
legislation presented to it. In 1952, 29 statutory instruments were
laid before Parliament. By 2012, this number had risen to 3,328.
Alarmingly, the trend has seen a very sharp increase under this
Government. I would be grateful if my noble friend could explain why
this has been the case. In 2008, the number of statutory instruments
considered by Parliament was 1,395; in 2010 it was 2,971; in 2011 it
was 3,133; and in 2012 it was

should consider also what happens to laws once they leave this place.
Every year, new legislation results in more than 30,000 legislative
effects, according to the report. One area where this is felt more than
most is in the tax code. In opposition, I made a little bit of a living
chipping away at the then Government and pointing out that, according
to Tolley’s yellow and orange tax handbooks, the volume of the
UK tax code had doubled between 1997 and 2010, and had overtaken the
Indian code as the longest in the world. In a spirit of cross-party
examination of these issues, I was alarmed to find that since 2010, the
length of the Tolley’s guide has increased, and gone on
increasing, by several thousand pages. What was intended on its launch
some 50 years ago to fit into a pocket would now barely fit on to a

Government came in with very good intentions. They announced the Office
of Tax Simplification to cut a swathe through this complexity. We know
that complexity reduces compliance and the tax take. If you simplify
the system, you increase compliance and the take. I was amazed when
researching for this debate to learn that the number of staff employed
by the Office of Tax Simplification is, to quote the Minister,
“slightly under six”. I presume by that he means five, or
perhaps four. Perhaps he will give the figure today. It compares with
25,000 HMRC staff working on enforcement and

measures are under way to reduce the burden of legislation. I pay
tribute to the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission, whose
2013 Act was the largest Statute Law (Repeals) Act ever. It did away
with 817 whole Acts, along with sections of 50 other Acts. That was a
great triumph. Noble Lords will be delighted to know that the Streets

in front of their house every Wednesday and Saturday between 6 am and 9
am on pain of a 10 shilling fine, has itself been swept
away. However, we should not get carried away and think that we are in
a libertarian free-for-all, because between 1983 and 2009, Parliament

persuasions 
<?notus-xml column=314?>find it useful to focus the attention and time of Parliament on
considering future legislation rather than on determining whether past
legislation has done what it said on the tin. However, there are other
issues. The courts have played a part, as a result of the breakdown of
trust in society between government and the governed, service providers
and customers, and employers and employees. We have become much more
litigious. As a result, an increasing volume of legislation is
going before the courts. In return, the courts are showing
some reticence in passing judgment and are referring back to
Parliament for clarification—and so the circle goes
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061995000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061995000030">There are
other drivers. The 24-hour news culture demands that something must be

do and the less we trust them to behave as good citizens, the more we
take away. Parliament is creaking at the seams as it seeks to digest
the fruits of a burgeoning statute book and, almost 800 years after
Magna Carta, the flow is increasing, not reducing. This is bad for the
country, bad for business, bad for people and bad for Parliament. It is

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lord Bates for this debate. I confess that, since I entered this place
in 1998, I have been what some might call obsessed by excessive
law-making and excessively complex law-making. That obsession has its
roots in my earliest days in the law. I started in a country town
solicitor’s practice in 1957. As I went around the local
magistrates’ courts, within months it was blatantly clear to me
that we already had a system of law that was way beyond the
understanding of the normal citizen. Indeed, the lay magistrates had
great trouble as well. That realisation led me to get a headmaster to
allow me to teach bored 15 year-olds in his school in the 1960s. I
found that they were not bored by the law; they were quickly enlivened
and engaged. That in turn lead me to set up the Citizenship Foundation
in the 1980s with the financial support of the Law Society, and so it
goes
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061995000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061995000033">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T20:01:25"></hs_TimeCode>

excessive law-making. It is a massive, profound problem, and it is
rather depressing that there are only 10 of us present in this debate,

a brave report for the parliamentary draftsmen to produce, but it is

tell your Lordships that you would be scandalised if you knew both how
uneven the enforcement of the law is, and how in some very important
respects the law is not implemented at all. It is getting worse. We

to accessibility, it has two aspects, does it not? First, there is the
citizenry’s understanding of the laws by which they are supposed
to lead their lives. Secondly, there is the question of access to legal
advice when people need it. We cannot blather on about equality before
the law if we leave poor people in the lurch when they desperately need
legal advice. I am 
<?notus-xml column=316?>afraid that with the cuts in legal aid this has happened, and it is

Citizenship Foundation and the few other organisations that seek to

society of which they are supposed to be citizens and, most of all, the
processes of the law, in terms of both its creation and its
implementation. I am informed by the foundation’s chief
executive, Andy Thornton, that over the past two years the number of
schools that carry out schematic citizenship education has dropped by
two-thirds. We need to be on our guard, because it is hopelessly
hypocritical of us to go on about equality before the law and all the
rest of it, yet not to give our young citizens any opportunity to come
alongside and feel that it is their law, giving them an understanding
of the law that is, of course, broad rather than detailed. In our time

turn now to the component of necessity in the list of five criteria,
and return to the number of laws we put before this place and the use
of the guillotine. The guillotine has become a scandal. A quarter or a
third of the Bills we see here have never been considered on the Floor
of the Commons. That is a scandal. It is the primary House, for
goodness’ sake. I ask the House to consider figures from the
House of Commons office, showing that the effectiveness of the Commons
in holding the Executive to account is now so enfeebled that over the
past 11 years only six votes of over 3,000 went against the Executive.
What sort of democracy is that? What sort of effectiveness is that?

educating officials about the significance and the processes of
Parliament. The replacement of the National School of Government with
Civil Service Learning has not necessarily enhanced the capacity for
such learning. Given that, it will be helpful if my noble friend the

also commend another recommendation of the Political and Constitutional
Reform Committee, namely that there should be agreement between
Parliament and government as to what constitutes constitutional
legislation. This builds on the report of the Constitution Committee of
your Lordships’ House that there needs to be a distinct process
in government for identifying and dealing with measures of
constitutional significance. The position of government at the moment,
namely that measures of constitutional significance should be treated
in the same way as all other Bills, is unsustainable and, indeed,
dangerous in terms of ensuring adequate consideration of changes to our
constitutional framework. Not surprisingly, I endorse the Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee’s endorsement of the test I
produced when I was chairman of the Constitution Committee, namely the
two P’s test: does a measure affect a principal part of the
constitution and does it raise an important issue of principle? If both
tests are met, it should trigger special
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T20:16:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061997000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061997000012">We
also need to look beyond the process of passing a Bill into law. For
too long, both Ministers and Parliament treated legislative success as
Royal Assent. That was the end of the process. We should be treating
success as when an Act of Parliament achieves its intended purpose. We
now have post-legislative review, which I greatly welcome, but we need
a committee on post-legislative scrutiny. In this House, we have now
established ad hoc committees to undertake post-legislative scrutiny of
particular measures, which again is a great step forward, but a
dedicated post-legislative scrutiny committee would ensure that nothing
fell between the gaps and serve as a body for ensuring best practice in
departments in undertaking post-legislative

respects, encouraging. Mostly, however, it is discouraging. Mostly it
says that people are disengaged for some of the reasons to which my
noble friends have referred. However, in a number of ways there is new
engagement and increased engagement. For example, 42% of the public say
that they would like to be involved in national
decision-making—up 9% compared with the previous year—and
47% agree that Parliament holds government to account, up from 38% last
year. Fifty-five per cent agree that Parliament debates and makes
decisions about issues that matter to them, up from 49% the previous

the work that has already been done, I understand as a result of this
activity by the parliamentary draftsmen. I shall refer to one
particular example of the way in which they have looked at this issue:
gold-plating, which my noble friend Lord Bates spoke about briefly.
Gold-plating has been around for a long time and I congratulate the
Government on seeking to deal with it. When I was responsible for
agriculture for my party in the other place, I recall looking at a
number of directives as they emerged from Brussels, then looking at the
regulations as they appeared in the United
Kingdom.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13061997000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061997000018">I
was not at all surprised to read in this document that in 2003 there
was an average “elaboration ratio” for the UK of 330%. In
an extreme example, directive 2002/42/EC consisted of 1,167 words in
its original English text, but resulted in 27,000 words of implementing
regulation in the UK. I recall talking to a previous Minister of
Agriculture shortly before that, who told me that he got so fed up with
the gold-plating going on in his department that he instituted a format
for reviewing every directive that came from Brussels. Alongside it,
his civil servants had to put what they proposed to add and the
resulting consequences in 
<?notus-xml column=320?>terms of length and complexity. He or one of his Ministers then had to
tick off and approve the sequence as acceptable.</hs_para>

thing he told me was that within three days of losing office, the civil
servants abolished the system that he had instituted, because they were
so pleased with the way in which they could add excessive requirements
to what emerged from Brussels. It is a well-known fact that throughout
the other member states of the European Union, directives, for example
on abattoirs that I was concerned with, were a matter of reducing
responsibilities at a more local level, but in the United Kingdom
everything was centralised and imposed much more
rigorously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061997000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061997000020">As
has already been said, pre-legislative scrutiny is an extremely
important way in which we should take responsibility for removing
unnecessary complexity. It should be absolutely explicit at the outset
that one of the responsibilities of a Joint Committee is to reduce
complexity in draft legislation. I am an enthusiastic supporter of
Joint Committees—I sat on several of them—because MPs and
Peers educate each other when we sit together. As my noble
friend Lord Norton has said, it is also true that both Houses have been
asked to think carefully about improving the quality of
legislation, most recently by the Select Committee in the other place,
but before that the committee chaired with such distinction by Dr Tony
Wright. Our own Leader’s Group, chaired by
the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, looked hard at this and made a
substantial suggestion, which I am afraid has so far not been
implemented in this House. It is about improving the quality of
legislation and recommended a legislative standards committee in
recommendation 16 of its report. Sadly, that has not been pursued,
which is a great
pity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061997000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061997000021">I have
one simple, practical suggestion to make. Again, I am not allowed to
wave my visual aid, so I shall have to ask the Minister to look at it
later and take it seriously. In preparing a recent draft Bill with
assistance from Members of the other two parties in the other place, my
extremely able and far more technically competent assistant Alex
Davies, found it was quite possible to put the Explanatory Notes
alongside the clauses. That one small step, allowing you to read across
from Clause 9 to what Clause 9 actually means, would be hugely more
accessible to the general public—indeed to professionals and
those in business outside this House—than the present
arrangements. With draft Bills, government Bills, Private
Member’s Bills and secondary legislation, the Explanatory Notes
can without great difficulty be side-by-side with the appropriate part
of that
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061997000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061997000022">That
is a very practical suggestion which I give to your Lordships’

like to make sure that the credit is not given to me, but to my
extremely able assistant. This is a timely debate. What is so
interesting about it, referred to by the three previous speakers and
me, is that we in this House could do more to improve the situation. It
is not just a question of passing the buck to the professional
parliamentary draftsmen. It is not even just a government
responsibility, it is the responsibility of the two Houses of

must remember that for consumers, legislation is about making roads,
offices or homes safer, safeguarding children from danger or preventing
consumers being ripped off. So we must stop the idea that legislation
is a burden. It is not a burden to consumers if it means that they do
not die from carbon monoxide poisoning, if children are protected or
provided with decent schools, or if consumers have access to an
ombudsman when a service or product goes wrong. It may be that some
legislation should have stayed, such as cleaning the path outside our
doors. I am not certain that that was the right one to get away.
However, let us drop the idea that legislating is bad: it needs to be
done, done well, and for a specific purpose.</hs_para>

however, perhaps I may say that my one difference with the report,
which echoes what has already been said, is the idea that the public is
a new—and it uses that word—audience for legislation. On
the contrary, in answer to the question, “Who is the user of
legislation?”, I was going to use the word people. The noble
Lord, Lord Phillips, used the word citizenry, and the noble Lord, Lord
Bates, talked about small businesspeople and shopkeepers. Absolutely:
that, surely, is the real user of

rest of us—legislators, judges, lawyers or advisers —are

turn to the report. As we know and has been said in the debate, unclear
law often arises out of either unclear policy or perhaps an overhasty
reaction to events. Even before drafting starts, it is important for
politicians and policymakers to engage with relevant experts to ensure
real clarity in thinking and in writing, including those who know the
subject concerned and those in bodies such as the Law Society who have
a wealth of experience in interpreting Parliament’s words. It
also means not bringing clauses here, as is happening today in this

standards committee would be involved. It would add another layer of

Bills or measures were published in draft, more than ever before. Of
those 17, six were scrutinised by Joint Committees, again
more than ever before. This Government have also continued
the practice of providing post-legislative scrutiny memoranda, usually
five years after an Act has been passed. This is a useful opportunity
to take stock of legislation and consider how it has worked in
practice. In the other place, committees have started to make use of
these memoranda and publish post-legislative scrutiny reports. These
are valuable and I hope that this activity will continue and

of plainer language and are committed to drafting effective legislation
that is easier to navigate and understand. However, complexity can be
added to legislation at all stages of the process, not just in the
drafting. The good law programme is looking at the way in which
policies are taken from inception to the statute book. It is not a

hard to use. The growth of judicial review has also had an impact. As a

this process, we in government and Parliament often forget who makes
use of the statute book. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, and my noble
friend Lord Bates in a lengthy list mentioned this point. It is not
just lawyers and judges; small businesses, charities, volunteers and
consumers, to name only a few, also use the statute book. A new small
business does not have a large legal department to rely on and must
itself deal with the legislation. Overly complex law hampers
enterprise, deters entrepreneurs and adds to the general weight of red
tape. There is, therefore, a strong economic case for good law, to
which my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury referred. There is also
a strong moral case. Citizens should have ready access to the laws of
the land which set out their rights and responsibilities. When the law
is too complex and inaccessible, it can be held in contempt by the
public, again a point highlighted by my noble friend Lord Phillips of

chance. Under the Bill as drafted, it is not clear what
“recognised” actually means. What does it mean for
members of a religious organisation to recognise an authority that is
competent to give consent on this issue? Who are the members of a
religious organisation? It is impossible to catalogue the variety of
ways in which churches and religious bodies identify their membership.

such a way that it is considered best not to have a formal system of
membership. Church structures are very complicated. It is possible for
the situation to become confusing, with claim and counterclaim being

given to the impact of this legislation on the Christian and Jewish
religions. However, no consideration whatever has been given to the
difficulties that may arise for other faiths. Can the Minister
enlighten the Committee as to why members of other faiths, each more
numerous than the Jews, are being treated as if they did not
exist? Was this omission inadvertent or was it thought that newer
faiths in this country were less important? Either way, the less than
favourable treatment of other faiths, including my own, appears to
contravene both the Equality Act and human rights legislation. It seems

many of the arguments which the noble Lord, Lord Singh, has made during
this debate, not least because his is a voice that has not been heard 
<?notus-xml column=329?>for very long in this House. I will take away and
contemplate at greater length his statement in one of our earlier
debates that it is not the job of religious organisations to adapt to
modern
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000002">I
listened very carefully during our deliberations on Monday, and the
noble Lord, Lord Singh, indicated that he spoke for all Sikhs. I asked
some other people what they thought about that. They said that in many
ways, the organisation is as he described in that different gurdwaras
do have some autonomy, although there are common principles around
which members of the Sikh faith
coalesce.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000003">However,
there is one group, called Sarbat, which is a lesbian and gay Sikh
group. It takes a very different view of this legislation from the one
that has been put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Singh. It is not my
job, or the job of this House, to determine who is right and who is
wrong. However, I do think it is for this House to note that there are
different opinions within his religion, which is not surprising as
there is a great variety of opinions within the religions to which many
of us belong. I wanted to put that on record, and this seemed like an
appropriate point to do

of religions to go along with society. Religions are formulated and
their purpose is to give a sense of moral direction to society that,
being human, we sometimes lose. It is to remind us of basic values,
such as concern for others before concern for yourself. That should not
be subject to public opinion, which today is becoming very
much about “me and my rights”. Looking to others is very
much a part of
religion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000005">As
to the other aspect of fringe groups within the Sikh religion, there

something of a distraction. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Singh,

some of which are very strong and which he would be familiar with and

Kirkharle and Lord Singh of Wimbledon, in a moment, but I start by
speaking to government Amendments 21 and 51. Government
Amendment 21 specifies the relevant governing authorities for giving
consent to same-sex

replaces the provisions currently in the Bill with a definition that
reflects the current arrangement for the Jewish
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000009">During
the Committee evidence sessions in the other place, Sarah Anticoni of
the Board of Deputies of British Jews’ Family Law Group referred
to drafting issues which it had brought to the Government’s
attention. This amendment is the result of discussions with the Board
of Deputies of British Jews about those drafting issues, and the
Government are very grateful to the board for its helpful and
constructive contribution to the completion of this amendment, despite
representing a wide range of views on same-sex
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000010">The
Marriage Act 1949 already provides a definition of “secretary of
a synagogue” in respect of the registration of Jewish marriages.
This is because the Jewish religion already has specific provisions for
its marriages in the Marriage Act which date back to 1753. This
amendment ensures that the new provision in respect of the relevant
governing authority reflects the modern structure of the Jewish
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000011">Government
Amendment 51 provides that, where a governing authority has given
consent to marriages of same-sex couples, that consent will not be
affected purely by a change in the person or persons constituting that
governing authority. Where a governing authority provides consent and
thereby opts into conducting marriages for same-sex couples, a change
in the person or persons who make up the authority will not render the
consent void, negate it or remove it. The consent will still stand.
However, this does not prevent the new governing authority from
revoking the consent and deregistering the building, but this amendment
makes clear that that would not happen
automatically.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000012">Amendment

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> I apologise if any disrespect has
been taken; it was certainly not the intention. A general reference to
the governing authorities of religious organisations other than the
Church of England, the Jewish religion and the Quakers is already
included in the Bill—not by specific reference, but it is
covered. The governing authority for the Sikh religion would be covered
by this and would enable the members of the Sikh religion to determine
who would be their relevant governing authority for the purpose of
consenting to same-sex
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0002.htm#13061998000015">The
Government do not think it desirable to specify in legislation the
governing authority for any particular religious organisation. That is
properly a matter for 
<?notus-xml column=331?>the members of the religious organisation themselves. For the Government
to seek to prescribe this would be an inappropriate interference in the
internal governance and autonomy of religious organisations, which
should be free to decide, and indeed change, their decision-making
arrangements for themselves.</hs_para>

reflected in what the noble Lord said that he is trying to replicate
the specific reference that the governing authorities of the Jewish
religion and the Society of Friends—the Quakers—have
within the Bill. However, as has already been indicated, they are both
in a different position, given their particular treatment under the
Marriage Act 1949, which arises from arrangements put in place hundreds
of years ago to reflect their particular circumstances at the time.
They have long had different arrangements under marriage law and
therefore their governing authorities are already specifically referred
to in the Marriage Act. In line with that treatment, specific reference
must be made to their governing authorities in this Bill. This is not
required for other religious organisations, where the relevant
governing authority should be determined by the members of each
organisation. Indeed, my own religious denomination, the Church of
Scotland, which has places of worship in England, is not referred to in
this Bill—for the very good reason that there is no historical
reason why it should
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13061998000017">Amendment
20 is similar to an amendment debated in Committee in the other place.
It inserts provisions regarding the definition of the relevant
governing authority, whose written consent is required to opt into the
registration of a religious organisation’s place of worship for
marriages of same-sex couples. The amendment provides that where there
is a dispute over the recognition of the governing authority, the
Secretary of State is required to consult members of the religious
organisation and if necessary hold a ballot in which at least 66% of
members cast their votes. Members are defined as people who have been
on a formal membership roll for 12 months or who have attended the
majority of services held over a 12-month
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13061998000018">As I
have already indicated, the Government do not believe that it is right
for the state to restrict the independence of religious organisations
and interfere with their internal governance in this way. Quite
properly, that is a matter for each religious body to determine for
itself, and we believe that the Bill as it stands gives adequate
clarity about what is required regarding the consent of the governing
authority of a religious group to marriages of same-sex couples, since
the question of who the governing body is will be a matter of fact in
each case. If there is a dispute over the identity of the relevant
governing authority, that is a matter for the religious organisation to
deal with internally, and we do not wish to create additional burdens
for religious organisations. Nor indeed do we wish the Secretary of
State and the state itself to become involved in internal disputes
within a religious
organisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061998000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13061998000019">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T21:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Singh, gave us a very helpful explanation as to why he
had moved this amendment with reference to the authority in his Sikh
religion. It is helpful to have that information about the structure of
the Sikh religion, because it illustrates exactly why it 
<?notus-xml column=332?>would not be proper for the Government to intervene in a religious
organisation and its internal workings. It would be quite wrong for the
Government to determine which part of the Sikh community should
prevail, and it would be a near impossibility for the Government even
to identify every religious organisation in the country and make the
kind of provision that he would make. Undoubtedly someone would be left
off, and that has its own implications. I can assure the noble Lord,
Lord Singh, that the references to the Jewish faith and to Quakers are
for long-standing historical reasons, and I invite the noble Lord, Lord
Curry, to reflect on the fact that it is not appropriate for the state
and the Secretary of State to intervene in such a way with the internal
workings of a religious organisation. On the basis of that, I invite
the noble Lord not to press his

Singh of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I am grateful for what has been said,
but it does not really explain the concerns at all. If there had been
any sort of research into the Sikh religion, the Government would have
had precise answers as to the state of play in that religion and what
and who is the authority. No research whatever has been done. It has
been considered unimportant and that is what really upsets. The concern
is very similar to that of my noble friend Lord Curry: that any fringe
group can say that it is in charge of this or that. If the Government
do not wish to take note of someone speaking on behalf of the largest
and only relevant authority in India, that is up to them, but this is
aiding a “divide and rule” culture that is unhelpful, and
that will not be welcome in the

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I appreciate the point
that the noble Lord, Lord Singh, is making, but I ask him to reflect on
the fact that the exceptions are exceptions for historical reasons of
the Church of England and the Church in Wales where there is a
common-law duty with regard to priests in relation to people within
their parish. Quakers and the Jewish faith are included for reasons
that go back centuries. Every other religion in England and Wales is
treated in the same way. Even my own denomination, the Church of
Scotland, is treated in the exactly same way as the Sikh faith is
treated by the provisions in this Bill for the religious organisation
itself to determine what its appropriate authority is.</hs_para>

is quite clear from what the noble Lord has said that there is no doubt
within his faith as to where that authority lies, just as in my own
denomination the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland would be
the obvious authority. The fact that he has been able to make very
clear where that authority would lie just shows the importance of it
being determined by the religion itself. I also ask him to reflect on
the fact that if we included his amendment, every other faith 
<?notus-xml column=333?>and denomination would have to be included as well. That would be an
impossible task for a Government and would take them into having to
decide which the proper authority of some religions is, and I do not

divisive. Some churches with no clearly defined governing

find it exceedingly difficult if a minority decides to pursue this. It
has the potential to divide church congregations and communities, and
that is deeply regrettable. I shall withdraw the amendment, but I would

Dear:</Member></B> My Lords, I see that Amendments 23
and 24 are grouped together. I had discussions earlier with the Front
Bench that in my opinion it would have been better to have split these
and discussed them separately. As will become clear very quickly, the
only common ground in these two amendments is the classroom. One
amendment deals with the position of teachers and the other with
parents, but in the interests of time I have had a further discussion
with the Front Bench and am more than happy to run these two together
and speak to them both one after the other, if that would help. I am
looking at the Front Bench and they are nodding so, with the approval
of the House, I will do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000002">Amendment
23, which seeks to protect schoolteachers, would preserve the position
of a teacher so that no teacher was required to endorse same-sex
marriage if there was a conscientious objection to so doing, and the
same teacher would not be deprived or disqualified by the same action.
Under the amendment, teachers with a conscientious objection
to same-sex marriage would be protected from being forced to actively
endorse it. The amendment would also seek to protect them from being
disadvantaged as a result. It offers a conscientious protection similar
to that enjoyed by, for example, atheist teachers, who have a legal
right not to have to teach religious education. I contend that, unless
explicit protection like this is included, the same-sex marriage
legislation would jeopardise the civil liberty of teachers holding the
traditional mainstream view of
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000003">Discussion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T21:29:40"></hs_TimeCode>

teachers undoubtedly will feel unable, in all good conscience, to

year among teachers, found that 10%—which equates to more than
40,000 teachers in this country—would probably refuse to teach
children about the importance of same-sex marriage if required to do
so. In the same poll, 17% would teach about its importance but would
not be happy in doing so, and 56% expressed concerns that colleagues
who take a stance supporting traditional marriage could find their

likes it or not, that that may be offensive to
some teachers. It is no good the noble Lord shaking his head. I should
have thought that after all our debates he knows how divisive this

Christians affected by equality laws. In the case then pending before
the ECHR the commission was going to call on the European Court of
Human Rights to back the principle that employers should do more to
reasonably accommodate employees’ religious beliefs like they
accommodate staff with disabilities. I am quoting from the commission.
Later, for quite unexplained reasons, the commission beat a hasty
retreat but we can take some comfort in the fact that for a short time
it looked as if we were going to get somewhere. Surely if in the dark
days of the war you could give people who had a conscientious objection
to fighting the right to opt out of military service we could do

say in a spirit of courtesy that I rather resent the

as a mother and as someone, obviously, who went to school.
For 10 years I chaired the education committee in Lancashire, with a
bevy of bishops—perhaps “beneficence” would be a
more appropriate word—because Lancashire had, and I
think still has, the largest number of faith schools. I think that this
is the last week that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of

experience of the education system is that of a parent and an
unqualified teacher. I have to say, on the basis of my experience, that
the current Government’s use of unqualified teachers serves
children ill. I will address this issue and concerns raised by the
noble Lord, Lord Dear. We tangle with the content of the curriculum and
what teachers ought to say and do at our peril. I recollect—this
may surprise some noble Lords opposite—my faith in the late Lord
Joseph, who, in the circumstance of vitriolic debates about whether
teachers were telling young people that they ought to support CND back
in the 1980s, said that the role of a teacher could be to say that they
supported CND or not, but that as a professional they ought also to say
that other teachers, parents and people in the community held different
views<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T21:38:37"></hs_TimeCode>. To my
amazement—I admit prejudice prior to his appointment—I
found that Lord Joseph was interested in genuine educational debate and

a very devout Conservative Party member, if one can be such a thing.
She asked to see me about Section 28. I thought she would come in and

teacher. She<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

lived and ensure the child was never in any way victimised for the

They may grow up with a mother and a father who are married within a

other people in the community such as family friends, will have
different patterns of life, different beliefs and different

fine line indeed. I hope the noble Baroness will answer a further
question at the same time. What about the 40,000
teachers—10%—who said that they would not be able to

Farrington of Ribbleton:</Member></B> My Lords, my experience in my

would need to know 
<?notus-xml column=341?>the detail. I cannot believe—however, the noble Lord tells me it
is a fact—that any head teacher or governing body has insisted
on that wording. However, I do not doubt that the noble Lord has

am slightly more dubious about opinion polls. I think that the opinions
depend on the exact question that is asked. If noble Lords were asked
as they left the Chamber whether they agreed with indoctrinating pupils
into believing that same-sex marriage was right or wrong, we would
probably all say that we do not believe in indoctrination. If we were
asked a slightly different question, we might answer it differently. As
someone who is very committed to political life, I am saddened that out
there a variety of groups of people hold a variety of views, many of
which I totally oppose personally. Nevertheless, I defend their right
to hold them. That is the issue we are dealing with. I do not want my
grandsons to be told that anything is right or wrong in regard to the
law. They will be told by their parents and teachers and occasionally
by their grandmother—although, as they grow up, they may not
listen—about certain things of which we do or do not approve.
However, I think it is very unwise for us to start assuming that
teachers will be told they have to indoctrinate or put forward a
particular point of view. For 10 years I chaired the education
committee on Lancashire County Council. I once said to somebody,
“If I wanted the whole teaching profession in Lancashire, which

it, the teacher’s role is not simply to promote same-sex
marriage or propagate his or her views. Surely the only role of the
teacher in relation to same-sex marriage is to explain to pupils, where

teaching religious education. Perhaps in some schools this is taught as

not formal sex education. “Where did I come from?” is the
question that a child is most likely to ask at the checkout in the
supermarket, rather than at the appropriate moment at home. Therefore,
one cannot subdivide the process of education. Education goes on all
the time. The teacher may be asked such questions in the classroom. It
may be a scout leader who is asked—it could be anyone; it may
occasionally be the grandmother. Then you have the problem of working

Farrington, has said. As I have said previously, it is the duty of
teachers to support the child, whatever type of relationship the
parents with whom they are living 
<?notus-xml column=343?>may have. I have happily granted adoption orders to

I have a concern. It is really what the noble Baroness, Lady
Farrington, said about being a grandparent. I am a grandparent and my
grandchildren ask awkward questions but the concern is about when the
question is asked of a teacher. The teacher is there, trying very hard
to give a neutral account of what the present law of marriage is. Then
a child asks an awkward question and the teacher answers honestly. It
could be a question such as, “What do you think about it,
miss?”, and the teacher says, “I have to say that I am a
member of the Church of England and my view is that I do not believe in
same-sex marriage”. The child goes off and tells the mother, and
the mother comes and complains to the school because a member of that
family is in a same-sex relationship. That is what worries me. It is
the perception; it is the interpretation. It is that which has gone
beyond the ordinary, perfectly proper teaching of the teacher. It is

be that this is not necessary in primary legislation. However, there is
a potential problem of perception and interpretation. There will be
some teachers who will be at risk, perhaps in areas where they do not
read what the Secretary of State said, or what the Minister said in
Parliament, and have their own views and take the view that the teacher
has gone outside what he or she should say, in having answered the
question of the child, or whatever it may be. I raise the question, and
my concern, in moderate terms. We ought not just dismiss this. That is

is what is said, probably to the head teacher, about what the child has
said, what has gone home, and so on. Although I have never been a

what is misunderstood, and the way in which teachers are placed in very
difficult positions, when the head teacher has been given the

five times to get in, because this part of the Bill is enormously
important. The noble Lord, Lord Alli, said quite rightly that if and
when this becomes law, teachers will have to teach the law. How does he
envisage the situation where a teacher is in a room, teaching the whole
question of marriage as it has been known and accepted until now,
alongside same-sex marriage, to children within the same class? That is
asking a huge amount of teachers under pressurised circumstances. That
is my first point; perhaps I may park that for a moment. I hope I can

more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000050">Secondly,

Alli:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be brief because I know that the
Committee wants to make progress and there is still quite a lot to be
done. This will be handled in exactly the same way as teachers
currently deal with the issue of divorce. Teachers in schools up and
down the country who hold deeply religious views and do not agree with
divorce are free to express those views in the classroom. Nothing
prevents them doing so. However, they are required to tell pupils the
truth about the world we live in and that divorce exists. I do not
think that that causes a problem. The principle applies and it can read
across to another set of issues. Teachers have a much better grasp of
this than perhaps we are giving them credit

Elton:</Member></B> My Lords, there are a couple of things which have
not been mentioned that we need to bear in mind before this is
resolved. The first relates to classroom teaching. I must congratulate
the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, on giving a perfect
example of proper and professional conduct, and some perfect examples
of how extremely awkward children can be. However, noble Lords have not
actually grasped the fact that many teachers are required by their
heads to teach to a particular programme which has been produced by a
publisher, by some think tank in a comprehensive, or whatever. It will
take an attitude to this which to some teachers will appear as though
it is promoting a particular interpretation. Teachers need to be able
not to have that forced on
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T22:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of course, a lot of a teacher’s life is spent in the staff room.
No doubt they hold to the view that they are highly professional and
will do exactly what the teacher the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington
told us about did under all circumstances, yet in the staff room may
express views contrary to those that we are now going to be told are
mandatory. If they express an objection to same-sex marriage
which, as the noble Lord, Lord Dear, has said, is interpreted as being
tantamount to homophobia, and that sort of conversation is held in the
staff room, particularly of a large school, there will be those on the
staff who will regard it as making them unfit to teach. Those teachers
will find themselves under undesirable pressure. No doubt the Minister
will take this away and think about it, and indeed all these exchanges

Farrington of Ribbleton:</Member></B> I remind the noble Lord that the
example in Lancashire that I spoke of was in a Church of England
school. My experience of church schools is that they not only hold
their own strong religious views but respect the communities from which
their pupils come and the circumstances from which their families come.
Perhaps it is different in

Eden of Winton:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for that
intervention, which reminds me, if I needed reminding, of her earlier
speech. I said at the beginning that I agreed with a lot of what she
said and found that I had a lot of sympathy with her point of view.
I accept what she says and just hope that when my noble
friend comes to reply there will be some comment about the nature of
the material that is made available to interpret the various different
aspects of relationships in marriage. It comes back to a point made in
a previous debate, on an earlier amendment, about the
importance of guidance. What is in the guidance material is very
significant. If we could have some reassurances about the nature of the
guidance that will be given to the teaching profession, either from
local authorities or from the centre, that would be very

Glenarthur:</Member></B> My Lords, I hesitate to intervene because I
have not spoken since Second Reading. However, I want to follow up a
point which the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, made
about teaching. I have no experience of teaching but it seems to me
that a teacher coping with a classroom of pupils, who has to deal with
one aspect in a particular way, might need a more individual session
with a pupil who displays a lack of understanding about a particular
issue. It might need to be put over to that individual pupil in a
different way from how it might easily be expressed in a more public
way. That would almost certainly draw the poor teacher concerned into
expressing much more personal views than he or she might have done if
it had been in a public classroom. There seems to be a genuine risk
here which could imperil the teacher concerned. It needs very careful
thought<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T22:17:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, I have a question for the Minister
arising from the speech of the noble and learned Baroness, who made
very strong points but did not describe something new. The sorts of
issues to which she referred have been around for a very long time. We
have had guidance for many years about how such sensitive matters
should be addressed in school. I believe that bishops and
representatives of other faiths have, over many years, been called by
successive Governments to contribute to that guidance. The noble Lord,
Lord Elton, talked about promotional materials, but there is guidance
already. When the noble Baroness comes to summing up—which I am
sure she will be delighted to get into fairly soon—can she say
whether anything in the Bill changes the statutory guidance
that we already have about the teaching of sensitive
matters?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000066"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elton" PimsId="3105" UID="1306209000231" xid="1210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000231">Lord

are things relevant to the noble Lord’s second amendment which

24 stands in my name as well and I will try to be fairly brief; I can
certainly be briefer than I was before. Because of their religious or
other convictions, many parents will not want their children to learn
about same-sex marriage before a certain age, fearing that they will
find it confusing. Others may be concerned that teaching on the subject
will not be balanced or might not respect their own convictions on the
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000072">Parents,
as we all know, have the right to withdraw their children from sex
education. However, same-sex marriage could be included in a range of
other subjects, across the curriculum, to which the right of withdrawal
does not apply. For example, there is no right of withdrawal from
history lessons and there has been a growth of schools taking part in
LGBT History Month lessons within the last few
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000073">Stonewall,
the leading gay rights group, promotes an extensive list of materials
on same-sex marriage for use in primary schools. These resources cover
subjects much wider than just sex education. A teacher training guide,
also produced by Stonewall, suggests that primary school children could
perform some of Stonewall’s recommended story books as school
plays. An accompanying teacher training DVD, which was produced with
the support of the Training and Development Agency for Schools,
suggests that pupils must become
“resilient”—and that word is
lifted directly from its 
<?notus-xml column=349?>literature—to the values of their parents and
grandparents. This is quite clearly an indirect reference to some
parents and grandparents who may have objections to issues such as gay
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000074">There
is a danger that without an extension of the right of withdrawal, the
deeply held beliefs of parents will be undermined, as will their
ability to have their children educated in accordance with their own
convictions. Article 2, as some of us know, of the first protocol of
the European Convention on Human Rights will be weakened. I could give
a number of examples where this sort of thing has happened—I am
conscious of the time and of the fact that the House wants to
progress—but suffice it to say that there are already examples
in this country, and abroad, where children have sought to be removed
from school because of this sort of thing, and the council have told
the parents that action would be taken against them unless the children
were returned to school. It has happened in Waltham Forest in east
London and it has happened abroad in
Massachusetts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000075">I
am galloping through very fast, and I would have liked to develop the
argument to greater effect, but Amendment 24 gives a parent the right

week in advance of those lessons, because being informed in that way is
obviously crucial to the effective operation of the right of

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, third time lucky. Amendments 23 and 24

concerning teaching in schools. I recognise that this is a sensitive

these amendments go too
far.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000077">The
obligations of schools, particularly faith schools, in relation to
teaching about same-sex marriage were extensively debated in the other
place. I will repeat what I said at Second Reading: I think that the
Secretary of State, Michael Gove, got it just about right when he gave
his evidence to the committee in the Commons. These are not new issues.
Current requirements on faith schools around the teaching of PSHE and
subjects such as abortion have required schools and DFE guidance to
forge a sensitive path between teaching pupils about the facts of life
and the law of this country, while still informing them of their
faith’s views on these
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000078">Noble
Lords need to understand that teachers have succeeded in navigating
these sensitive issues. We understand the concern of faith schools that
they will be required to advocate to their pupils something that their
faith does not endorse. However, there is a fundamental difference
between teaching and advocacy, which is why the noble Lord’s
Amendment 23 is confusing. By providing for an explicit protection for
teachers who refuse to “endorse” same-sex marriage, the
amendment misconceives the nature of teaching. The noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, explained that extremely well and I will not repeat those
arguments.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306209000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000079">The

Act 1996, which has been quoted by noble Lords in the course of this

23 would have broad application to all teachers in all maintained
schools. I must stress, as has already been said by the noble Baroness,
Lady Thornton, that no teacher is under any obligation to endorse a
particular view of marriage or would be in the future as a result of
the Bill. Teachers are and will continue to be free to express their
personal views or those of their faith about marriage or any other
matter, provided they do so in a balanced and sensitive way. There is a
significant difference between expecting a teacher to explain something
and expecting them to endorse it. Teachers are required to explain the
world around them in a way that is appropriate to the age and level of
understanding of their pupils. This includes explaining some things
which may be controversial and with which they may not necessarily
agree. The examples that have been used tonight in debate include
divorce and contraception. As many noble Lords have said, teachers are
already very experienced in dealing with such issues and do so
admirably and professionally. The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, gave
a<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T22:32:06"></hs_TimeCode> powerful
illustration of how teachers handle these complexities already. They
are required to ensure that their teaching is balanced and they take
care to ensure that there is no stigmatisation of children based on
their home circumstances, their own sexual identity or their own views
and beliefs. Teachers are not prevented from discussing their own
views, provided they do so in an appropriate way. It is worth reminding
ourselves that there are children in classrooms today who are
struggling with their sexual identity. This is not just about the
teacher; it is also about the pupils and how they respond to the
lessons that they
receive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000087">A lot
has been said today about tolerance and courtesy. My noble friend Lord
Waddington raised the need for that in the context of this
debate—we have to continue to respect differences of opinion. I
understand the point that my noble friend makes in this context and it
has been acknowledged on all sides of the House. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Farrington, said, that is precisely what we want children to learn
through professional teaching explaining the differences that exist in
our society. This is not just about the tolerance that we expect of
each other in debating these issues. We want to help our children be
tolerant and to respect one another. That is an important part of this

noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, expressed a concern
about teachers being criticised by the same-sex parents of a pupil for

the context of civil partnerships. I therefore go back to the debate
that we had on Monday about the law protecting people against others
who might not understand their freedoms. Clearly we 
<?notus-xml column=352?>have a responsibility to ensure that people are aware of and understand
the freedom that everyone has to express their views, and it is
perfectly legitimate for a teacher in a classroom to be able to do
that. If it happens that someone decides to pursue a case against
someone else, the law exists to protect them from inappropriate
discrimination.</hs_para>

employer, have responsibilities to their employees under equality and
employment law. Teachers, like other employees, are protected from
being discriminated against or harassed because of their religion or

may have been the noble Lord, Lord Dear, who said that they can express
that opinion to each other as teachers in the common room or express
that belief in the classroom. It is clearly wrong, as I have stated
many times, to say that, because someone believes that marriage should
be only between a man and woman, that means the person is homophobic.
That is not the case, and I will keep saying that because it is
important that we help people to know that it is not the
case.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306209000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000090">In this
context, as I have also said in the context of other debates, the
Equality and Human Rights Commission’s statutory codes and
guidance, particularly where they relate to public bodies, will help us
to ensure that this understanding is widespread. No teacher is obliged
to endorse a particular view and no school should disadvantage a
teacher because he or she does not do so. If a teacher feels that he or
she has been treated unfairly, procedures are in place for them to seek
redress. I would hope that the first step would be to take this up
through the appropriate channels at school level.</hs_para>

they are being treated unfairly, but it is worth pointing out that the
Bill that we are discussing now has not become an Act. This Bill is not

turn to the noble Lord’s Amendment 24, which is about parents
having the ability to withdraw their child from lessons. Parents
already have the right to withdraw their child from any or all aspects
of sex and relationship education, including any teaching about
marriage, with the exception of those specific topics that form part of
the national curriculum for science, covering biology and reproduction.
Parents also retain the right to withdraw their children from any and
all parts of religious education and acts of collective worship. That
is not affected by the Bill.</hs_para>

cover aspects of teaching that are outlined in the Secretary of
State’s guidance on sex and relationship
education—further to that outlined in the national curriculum in
a biology lesson, for example—then parents have the right, and
will continue to do so in future, to withdraw their children from those
aspects. This is where that matter relates to the issue that my noble
friend Lord Eden raised about 
<?notus-xml column=353?>material. It is important to remind the House that
parents should be fully consulted about the school’s approach to
sex and relationship education to ensure that they are comfortable with
what is being taught. This should include both the content of lessons
and the context in which it will be presented.</hs_para>

further reassure the House that such information is already available
for parents. Schools are required to have a written policy on sex and
relationship education and that policy must be available to parents on
request. What is being taught in this context should include parents.
They should be able to understand it, and it should inform their
decision as to whether their children should be involved in sex and
relationship education—although we would urge that all students
be allowed to participate in those lessons because of the benefits we
believe they can derive from them. I note the view expressed by the
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, about ensuring that all
students are

regards teaching that is not part of sex and relationship education or
religious education, there is no right for parents to withdraw their
children from lessons, because the national curriculum is the statutory

noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, said, questions about marriage may
arise in any lesson and at any time, and it is not practically possible
to know in advance when this may happen. The Government have full
confidence in the professionalism of teachers to handle situations in

I said at the start of this debate, this is not the only debate that we
will have on teaching and education in the passage of the Bill.
However, it is important for me to be clear that teachers are not
required to endorse any belief that they do not have. They are required
to explain the law as it stands. They are free to express their
personal view as long as they do so sensitively and take into account
the context of their lesson. Clearly, what we hope to achieve is the
kind of situation that the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, said the
late Lord Joseph talked about in terms of what we hope all our children
will be able to achieve from the kinds of lessons that are available to

will very quickly make four points. First, I ask the Minister to take
on board the very considerable concern that the ComRes poll showed
among teachers. I ask her to reflect on her words, which were said, of
course, in an effort to be helpful when she spoke at Second Reading,
distinguishing the factual and legal position on the one hand and
promoting and endorsing views on the other. I still maintain that is a
very fine balance in the classroom and may be very difficult to
disentangle. In fact, I unashamedly lifted the word
“endorse” from the Minister’s speech and put it
into the amendment. It may be that we can find a different word, but
the issue is still there, balanced, as I said, on something of a knife

24, I do not suppose that it was meant in the way it was put over.
However, it is rather more than wishful thinking, which the Labour
Front Bench seemed to think it was. Sexuality is very much at the root
of much of what we are talking about—it has to be if we are
going to change the meaning of “marriage” as it has
always been known. There is a very fine line, or balance, between sex
education and education about same-sex marriage and it is very hard to
disentangle the two. The Front Bench has just confirmed that parents
have the right to withdraw from sex education. The difference between
that and education about same-sex marriage is almost gossamer-thin. I
make that point and look forward to further debates on the issue of
education later in this procedure. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1306209000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000264">Amendment

under Clause 9 of the Bill. My noble friend proposes an oath or
affirmation to be made before three witnesses. We already have adequate
powers in Clause 9 that would enable the making of provision for a

are still developing detailed proposals for how the conversion process
would work and these are not straightforward issues. For example, the
more elaborate the arrangement, the more costly this is likely to be
for the couple, many of whom may wish to have a very simple,
essentially administrative process, given that they may have incurred
significant costs when registering their civil partnership. Let us not
forget that if marriage had been option when many couples contracted
their civil partnership they might have opted for marriage originally
and will consider that they do not need to jump additional hurdles or
show more commitment; they have already done that. It is important that
we do everything we can not to force such couples down a costly route

inclusive as possible of affected couples’ wishes. We should not
lose sight of the fact that a conversion is not, and never has been,
intended to signify the beginning of a relationship; rather it is a
change of status of an existing legal relationship. Conversion will be
an administrative process, although we believe there should be a

Alli:</Member></B> My Lords, the effect of Amendment 26A is to remove
the schedule that converts same-sex marriages into civil partnerships
in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The Bill makes legal same-sex
marriages in England and Wales. I state from the outset that the
amendment does not alter the laws of Scotland or Northern Ireland in
relation to conducting same-sex marriages. These are prescribed matters
for the Parliament in Scotland and the Assembly in Northern Ireland. I
do not wish to trespass on their jurisdiction any more than the Bill
already does. My intention is not to amend legislation in Northern
Ireland or Scotland by the back
door<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T22:55:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000118">The
effect of the schedule is to state that, even though a couple are
lawfully married in England and Wales, they are deemed not to be
married in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Government’s view
seems to be that a couple lawfully married in England should not be
treated as such elsewhere in the union where such marriages are not
performed. In particular, a couple of the same sex married in England
and Wales should not be recognised as married but rather treated as
civil partners, even if they have not entered into a civil partnership.
If I were to get married in London and move to Belfast—I am sure
the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, would be very pleased about
that—the Bill would convert my civil marriage to a civil
partnership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T22:56:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000119">I

written constitution has the advantage of flexibility, but there is not
always the certainty that would be helpful. There will be times when
one of the regions or nations passes a law that does not sit
comfortably with the laws of the other parts of the union. The question
is how we should resolve that, and whether there are any precedents
that might be helpful. I am not aware of any, and the Government are in

the absence of past guidance, it would be helpful to look at basic
principles. A first principle must be that as our devolved union
develops, it is very important that it should do so on the basis of
what we have talked about this evening: namely, mutual respect. For
example, it would be wrong for England to try to force another part of
the union to pass laws on which it has devolved powers, but it would be
quite appropriate for England to expect other parts of the union to
respect English law. A law passed in one part of the union cannot
simply be ignored in another part because it is unpopular

the point in hand, it would be a constitutional nonsense for a couple
to be deemed to be married in one part of the United Kingdom and not in

exactly what the union was for. I argue that it is up to the
Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the
Scottish and Northern Irish Ministers, to ensure that a couple married
in England and Wales are treated as married in Scotland and Northern
Ireland. It is not for us to presume to convert English and Welsh
marriages to Scottish and Northern Irish civil partnerships. I hope

usual bold capacity for initiative, was going to tangle with the whole
question of devolved legislation and what can be done between the
Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament. In some ways he managed
to work around that, although in fact he must recognise that certainly
there are separate laws between Scotland and England. Various
situations must be responded to according to the law in the country in

made by the noble Lord, Lord Alli: some people might feel that this is
unjust,

other more fundamental issue concerns the doctrine of the separation of
powers. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 passed legislation for the whole
of the UK using the full process of Parliament. Schedule 2
gives the Secretary of State the power to make a ruling by order on
private right and personal status. Determining how personal
relationships are treated under law is properly a function
of the judiciary, which has jurisdiction over matters of personal
status. Here, we have the Executive taking over a function of the law.

28 asks to transfer this function of the Secretary of State to the
Court of Session, which has the power to make declarations under

Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> My Lords, I find this part of the Bill quite
extraordinary. I have the greatest possible sympathy with the amendment
of the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and indeed with that of the noble Duke,
the Duke of Montrose. If one took the analogy of English law, a
marriage which is celebrated in another country according to the law of
that country is generally recognised in English family law. I have
tried endless cases involving a dispute as to whether or not
a marriage is valid in the country where it was carried out. There will
be issues of whether or not the two parties were capable of marrying in
that country, whether they are domiciled or resident in that country
and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000128">However<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
if those particular points are dealt with, then it is a matter for
English law to say whether we will recognise a marriage. Why are we
legislating for what Scotland or Northern Ireland will do if in fact it
is a perfectly lawful marriage in England and Wales? Is it not for
Scotland or Northern Ireland to say, “Yes, we accept it”,
or, “No, we do not”? I find it absolutely astonishing
that we are dealing with this. As for the suggestion that a marriage
lawfully carried out in England is to be called something completely

sympathise with the sentiment behind these amendments. British same-sex
couples who get married in England 
<?notus-xml column=360?>or Wales but choose to live in Scotland or Northern
Ireland will not have their status legally recognised for what it is.

Northern Ireland for same-sex marriage. Therefore, if a same-sex couple
who are married in England and Wales were to move to Scotland or
Northern Ireland, their relationship would not have a legal status of
marriage in Scotland or Northern Ireland because that provision does
not exist. There is no such thing at the moment in Scotland or Northern
Ireland as same-sex marriage. Schedule 20 to the Civil

the 2004 Act, these same-sex marriages contracted, for example in
Portugal, would be treated as a civil partnership. If this Bill becomes
an Act, we do not wish to see a situation where a same-sex couple
married in England would have lesser legal status in Scotland or
Northern Ireland than a same-sex couple who married in Portugal. It is
for that reason that Schedule 2 exists. As the noble Lord indicated,
marriage and civil partnerships are devolved matters. The noble Lord
asked why Secretaries of State for Scotland and Northern Ireland could
not get together with Scottish or Northern Ireland Ministers to make
them marriages. That is not how devolution works. Legislation would
have to be passed by the Scottish Parliament or the Northern Ireland
Assembly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306209000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#1306209000140">As
the Bill anticipates, referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton,
the Scottish Government have indicated that they will bring legislation
before the Scottish Parliament to bring about same-sex marriage as a
legal status in Scotland. That is why, if noble 
<?notus-xml column=362?>Lords look carefully at the provisions for Scotland in Schedule 2, the
order-making power would not have effect if the Scottish Parliament
passes legislation for same-sex marriage. In many respects, what is
there is deliberately framed, recognising the likelihood that same-sex
marriage legislation is to be brought forward in Scotland in the
relatively near future.</hs_para>

to say that same-sex marriage legislation does not appear to be on the
horizon in Northern Ireland. That is why the position regarding
Northern Ireland is that there is not an order-making power, which will
lapse in Scotland when or if Scottish law changes, but rather one that
sets out in primary legislation the same position for same-sex
marriages contracted in England and Wales in Northern Ireland, as is
the case for same-sex marriages contracted in other countries, such as
Portugal. People there would be in the same position in Northern
Ireland as they would at present.</hs_para>

that this is not what the noble Lord, Lord Alli, wishes to see, but
given the devolution settlement, this Parliament should not legislate

think that anyone in this Parliament is arguing for it. However, in the
absence of legislation there, it is important that we give couples who
have contracted a same-sex marriage in England and Wales a legal status
in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Without the schedule they would have
no legal status, so we are putting them on a par with couples who are

to the amendment spoken to by my noble friend the Duke of Montrose, our
concern is that he seems to suggest that in some way the Secretary of
State would be making an order in respect of every couple who had
contracted a same-sex marriage in England or Wales to convert it into a
civil partnership in Scotland. The position is that Schedule 2 provides
a power enabling the Secretary of State, with the consent and support
of Scottish Ministers, to make general provision that England and Wales
same-sex marriages are to be treated as civil partnerships in Scotland,
and to modify that treatment where that approach achieves a result that
would not be desirable by the

would put their legal status into some doubt. I recognise that the

work in Scotland. I hope that I can reassure my noble friend that there
is no intention for there to be a situation in which the Secretary of
State would consider and pass an order on a case-by-case basis. If that
were what was being suggested, I could accept that it would be
appropriate not for an executive act but for a judicial act. Rather,
the general intention is to ensure that same-sex marriages in England

Secretary of State then to exercise that power. It is not an
appropriate matter for the courts because they obviously cannot
exercise such a power on a general basis and would have to consider
these matters case by case. As I have indicated, that could place a
considerable burden on the courts. It would also mean that those who

as he probably recognises, I am not happy with it. If I got married in
England or Wales, I would expect my marriage to be recognised in
Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is the essence of the union. For us
to have found a mechanism in the Bill to convert marriages into civil
partnerships feels as though it was too difficult politically to keep
them as marriages. It is clearly a nonsense for couples to be married
in England and Wales, and then be treated differently in Northern
Ireland and Scotland. For us, in this Parliament, to determine that a
marriage in England and Wales should not be treated as a marriage in
Scotland and Northern Ireland, without putting the question—as
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, just
indicated—to the Secretary of State for Scotland, and those
Scottish Ministers for that order, or indeed to the Northern Ireland
Secretary of State and Ministers, is for us to be complicit in
perpetuating an inequality. Nevertheless, I will read what the Minister
said and reflect, but I have no doubt we will return to this on Report.

the probing is not particularly successful or satisfactory. I must say
that my research into the legal basis for marriages at sea has been
difficult and tortuous, and I am still not entirely clear what the
statutory basis is. No doubt the Minister will be able to tell me in a
moment. Neither the Public Bill Office nor the Library could identify

those authorities still apply, given that there is now statutory

33A in the name of my noble friend Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, which
is a probing amendment. Our interest in this issue is to draw attention

disease, it is not a disorder, it is a perfectly normal—and
quite common—variation within human development. The need to use
the term is made necessary by society’s insistence on
maintaining a rigid classification of all human beings as male or
female. In many ways, those with an intersex condition can be termed
non-gendered. Sometimes a person is not found to have an intersex
anatomy until she or he reaches the age of puberty or she or he finds
himself an infertile adult, or dies of old age and is autopsied. Some
people live and die with intersex anatomy without anyone, including
themselves, ever

we take the classic stereotypes of what constitutes male and female and
consider the biological, social, gender or sexual orientation in the

significantly. Some commentators would now consider sexuality as a

major difficulty with the use of bipolar stereotypes is that there is
no precise way of determining into which of the two boxes someone

karyotype,

these, or even any combination of them, can determine sex with absolute
certainty. It is only by ignoring the vast amount of biological
evidence to the contrary that this fiction of a strict bipolar

people who identify as non-gendered do not always, if they are allowed

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment seeks to ensure that
the Bill would allow individuals who identify themselves as being
non-gendered—neither male nor female—to marry. We
understand the challenges that intersex conditions can pose and

Lord has, with great sensitivity, outlined the case for consideration

acknowledges, the law of England and Wales recognises only two
genders—male and female. Although we understand that some people
do not see themselves as either male or female, none the less everyone
has a legal gender status of either male or female. The Bill does not
change that, and it would not be an appropriate legislative vehicle in
which to seek to do so. However, the Bill, by enabling same-sex couples
to marry, will ensure that in future there will 
<?notus-xml column=369?>be no bar to an intersex person, or a person who
identifies as non-gender, marrying anyone whom they choose. The effect
of the Bill will be that people will be able to get married, and remain
married, regardless of their legal gender. The issue raised by this
amendment goes well beyond marriage. Having a gender in addition to
male and female, or not recognising gender at all, would change a
fundamental aspect of our law. Such a change would need to be
considered carefully, in order to understand the implications for the
many aspects of law which are based on gender differences.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving government Amendment 38 I
will speak to the other government amendments in this group. These
government amendments relate to technical but important provisions of
marriage law which determine when a marriage is void—that is to
say, considered never to have existed in the eyes of the law. Clarity
in these provisions protects both couples and organisations conducting
marriages. They also clarify the provisions for courts to issue a
declaration of the validity of a same-sex marriage in prescribed
circumstances.</hs_para>

start with government Amendment 38. This ensures that paragraph 3 of
Schedule 3 to the Bill is consistent with the rest of Part 1 of
Schedule 3 in that it does not limit subsections (1) or (2) of Clause
11. It is necessary because, as a matter of statutory interpretation,
specific provision may reduce the effect of general provision.
Subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 11 make general provision and
Schedule 3 makes specific provisions related to that clause. The
schedule as drafted may give the impression, by omission of
reference to paragraph 3, that that paragraph should limit
Clause 11. This could cause confusion about the meaning of both clause
and
schedule.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13062021000039">Government
Amendments 42, 43 and 44 clarify the use of the term
“declaration of validity” in the Bill. They ensure that
when the courts have jurisdiction to make a declaration of validity
relating to a same-sex marriage as set out in Schedule A1 to the
Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, inserted by Schedule 4
to this Bill, the 1973 Act works properly for same-sex
marriages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13062021000040">Government
Amendments 49 and 50 make provision for when marriages of same-sex
couples will be void in circumstances where the religious organisation
concerned has not agreed to same-sex marriages, according to its
rights. In relation to the Church of England and Church in Wales,
Amendment 49 provides protection to couples to prevent their marriage
from being considered to be a non-marriage. If it was held to be a
non-marriage, this would mean that the court could not exercise its
powers in respect of financial relief, which they can do if the
marriage is held to be a void marriage. This amendment also provides
clarity for the Church of England and Church in Wales, and I can say
that this issue was in fact raised with us by the Church of
England, which we have consulted on the drafting of this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13062021000041">In
the case of other religious organisations, Amendment 50 provides that
where a couple is unaware that the religious organisation has not opted
in to marrying same-sex couples, the marriage will be valid. However,
if the couple took part in the marriage knowing that the religious
organisation had not opted in, then the marriage will be void. If the
couple marry in good faith, believing that the person who solemnised
their marriage was representing the religious organisation, and that
the organisation had opted in, they may live as a married couple for
many years before the mistake comes to light. It is not right that they
should be penalised for the mistake of the person who solemnised their
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13062021000042">This
amendment mirrors the provisions currently in place to deal with errors

which will also apply to same-sex couples. Government
Amendment 52 provides the same clarity about the status of
same-sex deathbed marriage under the Marriage (Registrar
General’s Licence) Act 1970, which has been conducted by a
member of religious organisation which has not opted in to conducting
marriages of same-sex couples. Such marriages will be void if the

government amendment on Report further to ensure that the protection
for the 
<?notus-xml column=371?>Church of England in this Bill is both full and
clear. The amendment replaced the power previously provided in Clause
11(5)(c) with an overarching reference to “other ecclesiastical
law”, which, on balance, the Government felt would provide the
church with more effective protection from the effect of subsections
(1) and (2) of Clause 11, so that Church of England law should continue
to be interpreted as referring to marriage of a man with a woman.
Government Amendment 58 is consequential to that substantive amendment
and removes from Clause 16 the parliamentary control procedure for the
now deleted power in Clause 11(5)(c). I commend these government

flourishing and development of children, and that there are many
aspects of parenthood and many kinds of parenting in such a complex

have a common-law presumption that a child born to a woman during her
marriage is also the child of her husband. Paragraph 2 of Schedule 4
says that the common-law presumption does not apply in the case of a
woman who is married to another woman—for obvious reasons. This
is a probing amendment and the question is whether simply leaving
matters there is sufficient. I argue that it is not because, in all the
debates on the Bill here and in another place, and during the
consultation process, there has not been enough concentration on
children. Tonight, as briefly as I possibly can, I want to stress a
more child-centred approach to the question of children in

bears a responsibility for that child, not least if something should

equivalent or automatic provision made for children brought up by a
married couple of the same sex. If a woman in a same-sex marriage has a
child, there is of course a biological father somewhere but, regardless
of whether or not the father is in an ongoing relationship with the

it has been suggested in the Explanatory Notes that the other party to
a marriage will be treated as the child’s parent by virtue of
amendments that the Bill is making to the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act. These provide, under certain conditions, for the
same-sex partner of a mother who gives birth to a child as a result of
artificial insemination or the placing of an embryo in her womb to be
treated as the parent of that child. I am sorry for this rather
technical intervention at this point in the

not all children born to mothers in a same-sex marriage will
necessarily be born as a result of treatment to which the HFE Act
applies. Such a child might be conceived in the conventional manner by
a woman who is married to another woman. In such
a case it would be possible for the mother to register the
child’s father when she registers the birth, with the effect
that he would have parental responsibility for the child. The
complications of that are quite interesting. Alternatively, she might
not do so and her same-sex spouse might become the adoptive parent of
the child. If neither of these things were done, the child would have
only one person with parental responsibility for it—this is
the
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13062021000049">There
is thus a contrast with a child born to a mother in an opposite-sex
marriage and there is a real possibility of children born to a mother
in a same-sex marriage being disadvantaged as compared to children of
opposite-sex marriages. This is not to say that children always have to
have two parents—that is often sadly not possible. Moreover,
sometimes a child brought up by a single parent or same-sex parents is
actually better cared for than a child brought up by dysfunctional
heterosexual parents. I give praise to couples who give love and care
to children in same-sex partnerships and eventually in same-sex
marriage. However, given the intention of the Bill to extend marriage
and to provide equality, why should children of a same-sex
marriage— some of them, at least—be at a potential
disadvantage in some cases? This is a probing amendment and I ask the

Northbourne<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T23:50:41"></hs_TimeCode>, has
asked me to speak on his behalf to Amendment 39A, which picks up
exactly the same point as the right reverend Prelate’s. The
noble Lord is not terribly happy with the wording that he has produced.
It is, again, a probing amendment and it raises quite clearly the issue
of parental responsibility. I am not sure that it is necessarily
appropriate to delete paragraph 2 in Part 2 of Schedule 4 but the
Government need to look at the point made by the right reverend Prelate
that there will be children born to one partner in a same-sex marriage
who will be the only person with parental responsibility although in
every other way she and her partner will be married and, were they of
opposite sexes, both would have parental responsibility. It is quite an
important point. You might say, “Get a residence order”,
but in the Children and Families Bill residence orders are going to be
abolished. Consequently, I do not consider arrangements made for when
parties are in dispute to be appropriate for those who are in harmony.
Therefore, I ask the Minister to have a look at this question of how
appropriate parental responsibility can be achieved for the female

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to thank
the right reverend Prelate for the speech that he just gave.
I thought that he addressed some very difficult issues in the most
sensitive way. I also think that it is important that we hold this
debate, however late it is, not least to put on record the fact that
very many gay couples think very seriously about parenthood. It is not
something into which they enter lightly at all. Perhaps some of the
most distressing of the accusations which have flown around this Bill
are that people who are in support of it take the issues of
children’s stability and parental responsibility less seriously
than those who oppose it. That is absolutely not true. I happen to
believe very strongly in marriage and one of the reasons is that
I believe that it provides stability for children. That
is why I want to see it extended to gay people because I
believe that the children of those relationships deserve that
stability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0003.htm#13062021000052">I
want to take the opportunity to flag up one thing. I am a veteran of
the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act and the question of
registration of birth is one which is becoming increasingly complex. It
has been very complex ever since we had planned donor-assisted
conception. There is a small group of people who will never be able to
find out what their identity is because they were born prior to the
legislative changes that require there to be a registration of their
biological parentage, and that has done enormous damage to those
individuals.</hs_para>

up an issue that is not for this Bill or indeed just for gay people. It
goes much more widely than that, and it is something that the
Government will need to return to. There was a report on this a couple
of months ago which I thought might be from the Joseph Rowntree

to the same conclusion as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of

reasons. It is not clear from reading the Bill exactly what is meant,
whether it is satisfactory, whether it covers the point about those
children and whether it is adequate in giving those children the
stability that they deserve and require. The only way to do that was to
put down an amendment to delete this provision, but we have no

of this Bill, be amended to allow a mother’s same-sex spouse to

not be sensible for the law simply to presume that a second female

marriage who breaks the commitment to the other by engaging in a
relationship with someone outside marriage strikes at the root of
marriage and can be a devastating blow to the injured partner. The
suggestion has been made that the injured 
<?notus-xml column=376?>person in a same-sex marriage could petition for unreasonable behaviour
as an alternative ground for divorce, but that is not the answer. In
current marriages, if one spouse commits adultery, that is the ground
upon which the other spouse can pray in the divorce petition. It
therefore demonstrates in family legislation the importance of both
spouses remaining faithful to each other during the continuance of the
marriage.</hs_para>

41, which looks at the inequality in the matrimonial law of voidable

inability and wilful refusal to consummate the marriage. A nullity suit
on either of these grounds is nowadays unusual. However, the question
of inequality and possible injustice arising from the difference in two

this Government are, as they should be, strong enough to provide a
revised definition of consummation and non-consummation, they should
deal with voidable marriages as well as adultery. This is not a
homophobic point. On the contrary; this is an injustice to innocent

should enshrine the same standard of fidelity as marriages of
heterosexual couples. As it stands, the Bill does not quite deliver
this. Indeed, the Bill enshrines a very important inequality in the way
that the virtue of fidelity is manifested in relationships. Marriage
between people of the opposite sex is partially defined by the fact
that sexual infidelity—adultery—is a recognised and
long-standing ground for divorce, as has been expounded very eloquently
by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. This is not found

feel very strongly that, as we go forward in our scrutiny of the Bill,
this House must find some way of including that faithfulness equally

described as equal marriage. On the grounds of equality that is an
omission and in terms of the social significance of faithfulness, which
is central to marriage, this omission diminishes the status that
couples of the same sex stand to receive from being married. As the

Alli:</Member></B> I thank the noble and learned Baroness for bringing
forward this amendment. I have listened to what she said most carefully
and I can see the point she raises. Unfaithfulness is understandably a
cause for which many people seek divorce but I do not think that
anything in this Bill will prevent people divorcing their partners for
unfaithfulness. In my view, marriage is a contract that varies in its
nature, understanding and commitment from couple to couple. The issue
and the importance of fidelity is one that, equally, varies from couple
from couple, but it is fair to say that fidelity is a cornerstone of
most religious marriages. I think the same should be said of civil
marriage, too.</hs_para>

sexual act that defines fidelity for heterosexuals is outdated and, in
my view, very cumbersome. The noble and learned Baroness is very brave
to bring the issue to this House. When one looks at penetration as part
of that definition, or we try to import the definition of penetration
from rape into this, it does not deal with lesbian couples, for
example. So much of our sexual law is defined by the male and not by
women that a complete class of marriage is ignored by what the noble
and learned Baroness is trying to do. If we had had more and broader
discussions on the Civil Partnership Act and over the Bill, we may find
common ground, but simply importing the definition of
penetration—anal, vaginal or oral—into this would leave
lesbians at a complete disadvantage regarding fidelity. While I
completely understand what is behind this, we come back to the
definition of fidelity. I think the Government’s position has
been not to disturb the current arrangements as far as possible, to
avoid tampering with existing legislation. It is a much wider question,
which I certainly welcome. There is no way anyone can accuse the noble

effect of the amendment of the noble and learned Baroness would be that
the question of how adultery and non-consummation would apply to
same-sex marriages would have to be determined over time by case law.
The Government believe that such an approach would leave the law
uncertain in respect of divorce and nullity, and would not give people
adequate protection. The noble and learned Baroness will know better
than I that the definition of adultery has developed in case law over
many years. In order for a definition to be determined for same-sex

Bill provides greater clarity by confirming that only sexual

rightly said that the Government had taken the approach, in designing
all parts of the Bill, of trying to avoid disrupting existing marriage
law as far as possible. This provision confirms that the current
case-law definition of adultery applies to the marriages of same-sex
couples. I make it clear that at the moment, if a married man has an
affair with another man, his wife would not be able to divorce him on
the grounds of adultery. However, she would be able to cite
unreasonable behaviour, so she would not be denied the right to
divorce; only the grounds that she relied on would be
different.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0004.htm#13062021000083">Equally,
for same-sex married couples, sexual activity with a member of the same

someone in a same-sex marriage to cite unreasonable behaviour. This
will not mean that same-sex couples have any reduced right to divorce
or will suffer any delay in applying for it, because the same
procedures apply to divorces on the grounds of adultery and those on
the grounds of unreasonable behaviour. If a woman in a same-sex
marriage has an affair with a man, her wife would still be able to
apply for a divorce on the grounds of adultery. If she has
sex with another woman outside the marriage, her wife could not seek a
divorce on grounds of adultery but would do so on the grounds of
unreasonable behaviour. That is what currently happens. As we know, it
is not that unusual for someone in an opposite-sex marriage to have an
affair outside the marriage with somebody of the same
sex.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062021000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-0004.htm#13062021000084">The noble
and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the right reverend Prelate

The right reverend Prelate used a particular word that I cannot
remember; I think he talked about “standards”. I think it
is worth making the point that we need to avoid assuming that in order
to be faithful people need to know they can divorce someone on the
grounds of adultery. It is not the possibility of divorcing someone on
the grounds of adultery that leads someone to be faithful to the person
they are in a relationship with. What makes people faithful is far more
complicated than that. The issues around fidelity, the reasons why
people stay together, and their trust and commitment to each other are
very complex. Even so, in terms of the law, marriage does not require
the fidelity of couples. It is open to each couple to decide for
themselves on the importance of fidelity within their own relationship.
The law does not lay down requirements about the consensual sexual
activity which should or should not take place for married
couples.</hs_para>

correct approach. There has been a lot of discussion of procreation,
not so much tonight but certainly at earlier stages of our debates.
Historically, consummation was linked to procreation, although now in
law it is not. I want to make it clear that there is no requirement in
law that a couple should consummate their marriage in order for it to
be a valid marriage. We do not consider that there is a need to extend

faithfulness in marriage of whichever sort is important. I do not for a

years adultery has been a ground for setting aside a partnership
because of the way that one partner has behaved. To call it
unreasonable behaviour, or cruelty in the old days, is not the same
thing. I am sad that the Government are not prepared to tackle this
because something akin to adultery could be achieved to put everybody
who is involved in marriage in exactly the same position. Currently,
with the Civil Partnership Act, and now this Marriage Bill going
through the House, they will be in different positions. You cannot get

speak also to Amendment 14ZC. These amendments take us back to the
debate at the start of our proceedings on Monday. When speaking to
Amendment 1, I indicated that we had tabled a further
amendment covering the same essential point: that of retaining the
capability of enabling national or central procurement. These two
amendments adopt an equivalent formulation to that provided for in
Clause 5 relating to smaller
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:45:57"></hs_TimeCode>. It
provides the Secretary of State with the opportunity to specify a
person to appoint auditors for relevant authorities, and potentially
provides relevant authorities with the opportunity to opt into or out
of such arrangements. Absent the activation of such a capacity, the
provisions on a local appointment would
run<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:46:21"></hs_TimeCode>. The

principle behind these two amendments is relatively simple; they seek
to allow for a measure of delegation of the duty to appoint an auditor
so that the actual procurement of auditors and their formal appointment
can be made by another body on behalf of the authority. The issue
arises by virtue of Clause 7(1), which
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13061979000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000095">“A

if taken literally, could be taken to mean the direct appointment of a
named auditor in person on an exclusive and non-transferrable basis. I
am sure that it is not intended to be quite as tight as that. It is
certainly felt by the LGA, and others who have briefed me on this
matter, that this might prevent any appointment as authorised proxy by
an external person or
body.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13061979000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000008">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>
reality, a firm is appointed to the task and nominates one of its
number, often a partner or director, to head up a small team to handle
the matter. The appointment of an auditor, to use that singular term of
art, and as a specific named individual, is in any event customarily
carried out per pro the authority by this means. For instance, most
small charities and similar bodies appoint a firm rather than an
individual<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:49:43"></hs_TimeCode>. In
the realms of a collective appointment via a national or sector-led
service, this becomes more important. A large consultancy firm bidding
for a sector-led contract will ultimately make an appointment itself of
the named auditor as overseer and signatory to the auditor’s
report</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000009">The
gist of Amendment 14ZAA is quite simply to provide for the procurement
of an auditor by way of a duly authorised proxy, including a large
firm, a sector body or other similar large concern dealing with
possibly several authorities. It does not make this mandatory, simply
an
option<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:50:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000010">Amendment
14BZA follows from this. If the procurement is by way of another body
charged with meeting the requirements of the Bill and thus delegated
from the authority, it is unnecessary, or should be unnecessary, to
have an audit panel, because the oversight of the auditor is carried
out in accordance with the relevant rules of engagement via the proxy.
The authority always remains responsible for whatever measures it has
put in place. The appointed procurer of the audit service must observe
all the criteria in the Bill for that
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000011">The
LGA, as I said, provided a useful brief on this and it is worth picking
out a few salient points. The amendments would be consonant with the
authorities’ need to have flexibility to procure their audit
nationally, or in some form of grouped manner. It would make
collaborative audit procurement more attractive and produce, as we
heard on the previous day of this 
<?notus-xml column=101?>Committee, the potential for significant savings. That would be to the
direct benefit of local finance. Some of the reasons why this is so
have already been rehearsed, including the Audit Commission’s
own modelling and its calculated saving of between £205 million
and £250 million over a five-year
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000012">The
Government’s own impact assessment does not refute this. Indeed,
it concedes that local appointment may not procure the level of savings
secured by the Audit Commission during its last procurement round. It
seems obvious to me that each authority procuring its own auditors on a
recurring basis replicates a cost base. There is an opportunity to save
money
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000013">I
will not go into the other details that have been discussed before,
save to say that I agree that local appointment does not necessarily
increase competition or cut costs. I have no proof of this, but my
hunch is probably that not many firms would undertake a municipal audit
in the first place. In reality one is probably looking at one of the
larger firms, a point that we have heard before. I register the point
made by the Minister on Monday. A paraphrase of her words is that there
will be no recreation of the Audit Commission by the back door, but if
the reality of this Bill’s proposals is to create some form of
suboptimal procurement with waste by duplication, I have to say that I
am against that as a principle. I hope the Minister will feel that
subject to any safeguards that might be necessary to eliminate the risk
of a “son of” Audit Commission coming about, the
principle is acceptable, in which case we can work out the detail as we
go forward. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Palmer of Childs Hill" PimsId="5913" UID="13061979000117" xid="2123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000117">Lord

amendments, although sitting next to me is my noble friend
Lord Tope, in whose name Amendment 14ZA stands. I hope the

the collaborative basis and the fact of buying centrally. Even I was a
late adherent to this, but I think we agree that in one form or another
that is the way to go forward, however it can be arranged, although
there were numerous alternatives. As the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, has
said, there are going to be significant savings, which is something

the Bill and the amendment say that that appointment should be made not
later than 31 December in the preceding year. I cannot work this out in
practical terms. Let us say that KPMG is the auditor of a local
authority or group of local authorities; it has not finished its
accounts and the accounts will not be signed off until, at the
earliest, the end of January the following year. That company could be
under notice, according to the amendments, that it may not be, or could
not be, the auditor for the ensuing year. While KMPG is finishing off
its audit—the accounts will not have been finished and signed
off by the relevant person in the local authority, who in my local
authority 
<?notus-xml column=102?>is me, so I am told; I have done it three years in a row—a new
auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, perhaps, will have been
appointed.</hs_parafo>

worry about how that will affect the mindset of the auditor who is
being replaced. Enshrining within the Bill that the auditor has to be
appointed by 31 December within that year will cause moral,
and sometimes practical, difficulties. Perhaps the Minister will take
this issue back and consider whether the wording should be
“could be appointed by 31 December” or “as soon as
possible by that date”. I worry how the changeover, if there be
a changeover, will affect the performance of the outgoing

14BZA would specifically exclude bodies that opted into such an
arrangement from the need to have an auditor panel. We agree with that.
If there is a centralised system it is plainly not sensible for those
who are being helped by it to have their own audit panel. However, it
is essential that if they are appointing their own auditor,
independently or in conjunction perhaps, with another authority, they
have to have an audit panel. We have discussed the make-up of an audit
panel and its independent membership, and they would be required to do

Lord, Lord Palmer, raised the question of the date of appointment of
auditors. The reason behind the auditor needing to be appointed by 31
December is to ensure that if for some reason the local authority fails
to make an appointment, there is time for the Secretary of State in
particular to take action under Clause 12, which allows him either to
direct a body to appoint or make an appointment on behalf of the
authority. We will discuss this later, but it will certainly apply to
health authorities, and I understand that the situation is similar in

and unfortunate position to have arrived at. We are aware, of course,
that the market for the larger authorities is likely to be dominated by
a handful of firms. That was one of the reservations expressed on
Second Reading and during our previous day in Committee, and I think
that most of us, possibly including the Minister herself, are not
entirely comfortable with that. To see such a process as a repeat
appointment, particularly in the context of these large national

raises an issue about the kind of relationship that might develop when
a firm is anxious to retain the contract.</hs_para>

my submission it would be better to require not simply a reappointment
process but a process that excluded the original firm. There might have
to be a backstop position in case nobody else presented. That matter
might require, for example, the agreement of the panel and the
authority or even, potentially, of the Minister or the department. I
suppose one might need that safeguard, but the important principle is
that there should not be indefinite appointments of the kind that, as I

years is certainly desirable; whether it should be mandatory is
something that we can debate. However, in such a tendering process,
would the existing auditor be precluded from taking part in that

best value tender, would the authority then be prevented from

for raising this interesting point, but I am bound to say that I have
the same scepticism about this as the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, and
my noble friend Lord Tope. It is scepticism about whether it is
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:09:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000034">The
Bill currently requires local authorities or local bodies to make a new
appointment every five years, as the noble Lord said. In most cases,
this will require them to go through a full EU tendering process. We
expect that most authorities would have that as a requirement, if not
in their code of procedure then in their code of conduct. They will
also have to go through the process with the independent auditor panel,
which will have to manage the tendering process so that it is both
independent and transparent. The independent auditor panel will also
look regularly at the quality of the audit from the auditors currently
doing the job. If they are not doing the job, it will not recommend
that they are allowed to proceed. The Financial Reporting Council has
ethical standards as well, and will require that key audit staff are
rotated on a regular basis. The Government believe that the
requirements for a maximum five-year term and  the rotation of
key staff provide sufficient assurances, along with the other measures
on auditor appointment and removal, to safeguard auditor independence
and the local bodies’ independence of view in taking on their
auditors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:10:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000035">I
know that there have been wider discussions about, for example, a
recent Competition Commission report on the need for mandatory auditor
rotation. However, we understand that the evidence that mandatory
rotation supports improved auditor independence and auditor quality is
inconclusive. Bearing in mind what my noble friend Lord Tope and the
noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, said, sometimes there is benefit in the
continuation of an auditor, not on a cosy basis but because of the mere
fact that, particularly with bigger authorities, you have somebody who
understands the processes and what has been happening during the past
five years. In any event, I think it would be wrong to exclude them
from being able to tender, to bring down the barricade and say,
“No, you can’t do
that”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061979000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061979000036">There

it mandatory that they cannot go beyond five years; that would be too

other bodies covered by the Bill to support accountability. This might

overly bureaucratic, but if that is the Government’s approach, I
suppose this amendment simply adds to that bureaucracy. Amendment 14ZF

what firms were involved would be an indication of the relevant

open to authorities to combine in placing audit contracts. The Audit
Commission identified substantial savings having been made by central
commissioning, and it anticipated that if extended to the remaining 30%
of contracts, a significant further saving of some £400 million
over five years could be made. I am not necessarily saying that that is
the way to go but, under the provisions of the Bill and this whole
appointment process, would it still be open for such an approach to be
adopted by authorities coming together, for example, in a particular
region or a particular class of authority, obviously with the support
of their independent panels? Would it still be open to them to move in
that direction, getting a sort of bulk purchase by agreement rather
than it being imposed externally? It would be helpful to have some

the intentions behind the amendment—to ensure that there is
transparency over the appointment of the auditor—but they are
not convinced that this is the sort of thing that needs to be in the

the advice of the auditor panel, which is required to advise on the
selection and appointment of the auditor. This might cover issues such
as the length of the appointment and the process for appointment. Under
the Bill, auditor panels must have regard to guidance issued by the
Secretary of State on their functions. We expect that such statutory
guidance, or wider guidance on best practice, might cover the sorts of
issues that should be included in any advice from the

non-statutory guidance that draws on best practice, including that
issued by the FRC. That practice makes clear that audit committees
should consider the effectiveness  of the auditor’s
risk-management arrangements, the control environment, and associated
anti-fraud and anti-corruption arrangements. They should seek
assurances that action is being taken on risk-related issues identified
by auditors and inspectors. They should be satisfied that the
authority’s assurance statements properly reflect the risk
environment and any actions required to improve it. They should approve
internal audit strategy and plan, and monitor performance. They should
review summary internal audit reports and receive the annual report of
the head of internal audit. They should consider the reports of
external audit and inspection agencies. They should ensure that there
are effective relationships between external and internal audit,
inspection agencies and other relevant bodies, and that the value of
the audit process is actively promoted. They should also review the
financial statements, external auditor’s opinion and reports to
members, and monitor management action in response to the issues raised

about the requirement for a majority of independent members. I see
fully the value in the noble Lord’s suggestion of an independent
chairman, but it is extremely difficult in many authorities to find
suitably knowledgeable and qualified people to take these roles. I know
that under the old standards regime, finding suitable people to chair
those bodies was quite difficult. In some cases, they had the desire to
take over the world and gradually grew, like Topsy, the role of that
body. If we could have independent chairmen, that would satisfy what is
perceived as the body’s independence. I certainly do not see the
need for an additional body in the audit panel to decide who should
audit the authority. There are many checks and balances already within
local authorities on probity issues, as I said earlier, so this is an
unnecessarily bureaucratic step. The audit committee could happily

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has raised
a very important and useful issue. We will discuss in relation to a
later amendment the actual composition of a committee or panel and the
number of independent members on it. I would guess that most principal
authorities have an audit committee. I do not know, but it had not
occurred to me that they would not until now. In many cases, as in my
own authority and as in the case of my noble friend Lord Palmer of
Child’s Hill, that committee is chaired by a member of the
opposition. That is very much not the same as an independent chairman.
Nevertheless, it is a good practice that is followed by many
authorities. In my case, it is a Liberal Democrat authority, while in
my noble friend Lord Palmer’s case it is a
Conservative-controlled authority. It is therefore a useful extension
to have a panel or committee chaired by an independent
member<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

further discussion and consideration about whether we really need to
have completely separate and independent auditor panels, as proposed in
the Bill, or whether there is some way of meeting that through the
existing audit committees and amending that practice. Rather than
reinventing something that in most cases is working quite well in
practice, I would rather see us adapting it. It can certainly be
adapted without too much difficulty to meet the Government’s
requirements through the Bill, which I think we all broadly support. We

Tope, has just said about the principle, which my noble friend also
referred to, of combining these two roles. It does not seem at all
necessary to have panels on the one hand and a committee on the other.
As the noble Lord has reminded us, most authorities have established
audit committees. I ought to declare an interest again as a member of
Newcastle City Council and as an elected member serving on the audit
committee, which is independently chaired and has a majority. It works
very well and it seems to make absolute sense that that body should
also have oversight of these

the noble Baroness’s observations. Although technically the
noble Lord, Lord Tope, is right that it is not for this amendment, as
the remarks have just been made I shall endeavour to rebut the thrust
of the argument. This is really a matter of perception. It is important
that the public are convinced that in the matter of the propriety and
regularity of an authority’s financial transactions, the
oversight of the process—not just the appointment process, but
the whole job of audit—is carried out without the conflict that
might arise from, for example, a controlling group in an authority
having a majority of members on a committee.</hs_para>

many cases there will be a mix of members, in some councils the
political position is that there is no opposition, or there is
insufficient opposition to be represented on the committee. It is
desirable that we should go that further step, to which we will no
doubt address our minds shortly. The cardinal point is that the
Government are right that there should be audit committees, but they
should do the whole job, including the appointment process.

which I referred earlier. I think that the principle of an independent
chairman is a given, but it appears to me from my much lesser knowledge
of these procedures than that of other noble Lords that some councils
might have few politically independent members. I do not know how many
would have none at all, but there must be some. Even political
independence, it seems to me, is

that objectivity and competence, rather than independence, would be a

necessary, enforcement, so to some extent I can see it from the

relate to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, about the
independence and objectivity of auditors as professional people
embedded in their culture, training and ability to retain their
professional status. As a member of another profession altogether, I
very much relate to that. Ultimately, it is the auditor who is doing
the scrutiny, not the committee or panel. They are there simply to
select—if selection be needed; we will get to that later. If the

let us just say that he no longer works for that authority. After his

independence is set out in Schedule 4, which says that a person is
independent if they are not a member or officer of the authority and
have not been within the past five years, or a “relative or
close friend” of such a person. Questions of objectivity and
competence, particularly competence, are, apart from qualifications in
accountancy, a little more subjective. Professional competence is
defined by qualifications rather than by other

independent members of the local audit committee, plus one other, to
make the specific appointment for external audit. I assume we all

do not think that there is a wider case for imposing statutory majority
independent audit committees on local government for internal audit,

to ensure that a committee, or a meeting of the whole body, reviews
arrangements for the internal control and effectiveness of internal
audit, approves the

therefore includes the flexibility for bodies to retain their existing
councillor-led audit committees by setting up a separate independent
panel. Where an authority wishes its audit committee to advise on
auditor appointment and independence, it is right that that committee
has a majority of independent members. A general requirement for
majority independent audit committees, without any flexibility, would
be more prescriptive and possibly even bureaucratic. It would require
local authorities to significantly restructure their existing audit
committees, even though they  might be functioning well with
respect to their current, non-appointment-related roles.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:45:53"></hs_TimeCode> the light of

at the same time it might be appropriate if I reply to the noble Earl,
Lord Lytton, on his amendment, which would remove the requirement for a
relevant authority’s auditor panel to consist of a majority of
independent members. The amendment would mean that a panel would need
to have only an independent chair. We understand that the amendment
might be related to concerns that we avoid any undue burdens on local
bodies. There might also be concerns that some authorities would
struggle to find enough skilled and fully independent members to form a
majority. Given the noble Earl’s interests in the smaller bodies
sector, I understand that he might have particular concerns about
ensuring that requirements are proportionate for smaller bodies that
choose not to take part in central procurement arrangements.</hs_para>

we discussed earlier this week, protecting the independence of the
auditor is critical to ensuring the quality and integrity of audit. The
pre-legislative scrutiny committee endorsed the need for a properly
independent panel to oversee auditor appointment. In the companies
sector, guidance from the Financial Reporting Council recommends that
audit committees consist of independent non-executives. It is right
that panels advising on auditor appointment should be majority
independent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000004">The
Bill meets these aims while minimising additional bureaucracy and
burdens for local bodies. There is no requirement for panels to be
large. If, for example, a panel consisted of three members, which is
the recommended minimum size of audit committees in Treasury guidance,
only two independents would be needed to form a majority. The Bill also
allows bodies to share panels to further minimise any
burden.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000005">On the
possible concerns about smaller authorities, I agree with the general
principle that arrangements need to be proportionate. In most cases, I
expect that such bodies will participate in central procurement
arrangements, so they will not need to have a panel. Where a smaller
authority decides not to participate in such arrangements and makes its
own appointment, it 
<?notus-xml column=116?>is right that a majority panel should oversee auditor independence. As I
have said, the Bill therefore provides flexibility to allow authorities
to minimise any burden. A smaller body might, for example, choose to
share an auditor panel with a larger neighbouring authority where they
would otherwise struggle to find independent
members<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>. With

independent members of an audit panel. I do not see, unless I have
missed it, how the process is expected to take place, and I have some
concerns about the clarity of the job description and expectations. In
some local authorities, particularly in the appointment of people such
as coroners, these have not always been as transparent as they should
be. It would be helpful if we knew what process is expected for

Beecham:</Member></B> Perhaps I may add some more questions. I am sorry
that they come so late. While paragraph 2 of Schedule 4 deals with a
number of issues, it helpfully defines what is meant by a
“relative”. Although seven categories of relative are
referred to at page 40 of the Bill, there is no definition of the words
“close friend”, which appear in paragraph 2(2)(c). Is it
possible to define what is meant by “close friend”? If it
is not, I suggest that the words should be taken out of the Bill,
because this could lead to a ridiculous
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000009">What
is the rationale for dealing with health service bodies in a different
way under paragraph 3 of Schedule 4? It seems to be a
parallel process, and I wonder why it is regarded as separate. Why is
the process not the same for the two bodies? In particular—I
should know, but I do not—what are the current audit
arrangements in health service bodies? We know what they are in
councils—they either do or do not have an audit
committee—but I do not know whether, at the moment, health
bodies have audit committees as such. If they have, just as many of
those who argued for the panel concept to be incorporated in the audit
committee would argue for the same in health. At least my noble friend
and I think that these two bodies are one more than is necessary, and
if that is true for local government it is also true for health bodies.

of amendments with which we are dealing is about the relationship
between audit committees and auditor panels. The noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, as the mover of the amendments, will comment on that in a
moment. However, I am quite sure that we will return to this issue, if
only to seek clarification about the distinction and whether the two
bodies should be, or have to be, separate. My noble friend Lord Wallace
seemed almost to be saying that the auditor panel could in effect be a
subcommittee of the audit committee. I do not think that that was quite
what he meant, but maybe it was. We still need to clarify that
role.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000015">My
confusion started when my noble friend went on to reply to Amendment
14BBA, which is not only in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Lytton,
but in mine. That amendment has not been moved yet, so I am not quite
sure whether we are dealing with it. If we are, and for the sake of
preventing us from dealing with it later on—if and when it ever
gets moved—perhaps I might say that the noble Earl is vastly
more expert than me on the case of small bodies, such as parish
councils and the like. However, the amendment comes from the Local
Government Association, which represents primarily the larger
authorities that do have these concerns. Personally, I have no great
problem with majority independent members, but the LGA is concerned
about it on a number of grounds.</hs_para>

rightly makes the point about the professional integrity of auditors,
which the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, has already made, as has the
noble Lord, Lord True, and others, and which I think we all accept.
They are already fully regulated, quite rightly and properly, and
therefore the perception of independence is, in a sense, already

there is the rather more important, practical problem of whether in
some areas it will be possible to find a significant number of truly
independent people. That does not mean somebody elected to the council
as being independent of a political party; it means somebody who is
truly independent of the council in a way that is defined in the
schedule. In some areas, it may not be possible to find sufficient
people of relevant experience. That does not mean that they have a
professional qualification necessarily, but that they have relevant
experience and are also able and willing to put in the necessary time
to serve on this. That may be less of a concern in some London boroughs
that many of us know. However, I can well see that in more rural areas
or smaller district councils, it may well be quite a significant
difficulty. That is part of the concern that the LGA was raising and

word, having come in late on this section. I hope it will. I want to
pick up on what the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, said about close friends.
I feel that whatever legislation these Houses of Parliament pass should
not be capable of ridicule. That must surely be paramount in
people’s minds. Can one imagine the situation in which people
vehemently deny that they are a close friend: “I am not a close

were close friends, given that he put his hands around her

as the Bill is currently drafted, whether somebody is independent for
the purpose of being able to serve is determined broadly by whether
they have been a member, officer or employee of the authority, a
connected entity or, indeed, a close friend, whatever that may mean.
These relationships which preclude someone from serving on the
committee or panel do not appear to encompass a person with a
significant business relationship with the relevant authority. This
might be someone who is a major supplier to the authority—a

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, we are, in a sense,
continuing the previous debate. Before I directly address the amendment
in terms of defining “independent”, I shall speak with
another hat on. As noble Lords will know, I speak for the Cabinet
Office on issues of civil society and I am struck by the fact that the
largest single part of the population that is becoming more active in
all civil society activities is the fit retired. There is a very large
and growing element there and it is precisely the area from which local
bodies are likely to find the independent members that they are looking
for. Looking around this room, I note that many of us would fit into
that category but, unfortunately, we are not retired. Therefore we have
less time than we would otherwise like to have. The noble Lord, Lord
Tope, is particularly fit, although I like to think that I am fitter
than he
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:08:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

into the question of how one defines “close friend” and
of course we will have discussions on a range of these issues between
Committee and Report. However, I reiterate that a third of audit
committees already have independent members and 15% have two
independent members. We see the independent panels which will appoint
external auditors as not having the heavy weight of work that audit
committees have but as fulfilling a rather more distinctive

amendment for mandatory audit committees is addressed more directly in
other amendments but, as I understand it, this specific amendment is
intended to ensure that, as well as being independent of the authority,
members of an auditor panel or audit committee do not have wider
conflicts of interest that might compromise their independence. I agree
that potential conflicts of interest should of course be taken into
account in appointing members of auditor panels. However, the Bill
already includes a duty for relevant authorities to have regard to
guidance issued by the Secretary of State in relation to their
independent auditor panels.</hs_para>

guidance will cover exactly these sorts of issues, such as how auditor
panels will operate and who should sit on them. We intend to work
closely with the sector and interested parties on developing such

I may ask a brief question. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, raised the
question of a “close friend”—it is good to know
that the noble Lord has 
<?notus-xml column=122?>many close friends—and he is right to be concerned about the
definition. Where is the question of political friendship dealt with in
this? While it is good practice in local authorities, including my own,
to have an opposition chairman—we are conscious of the political
issue—is the situation of independents having close political
associations but not close personal ones dealt with, in this or other
legislation, in a way which would enable the work of panels not to be
distorted by political considerations? In some authorities which are
perhaps not as well governed as others, those kinds of considerations
can be just as important as personal
friendships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13061993000171" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000171">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, we are willing to look at
that as well and I will write to the noble Lord. After all, we are
talking about panels that may consist of two independents and one
member of the audit committee. We are not talking about a vast number
of people to be found outside. However, my understanding is that
“independent” will exclude close political friendship. My
experience of close political friendship also tends to mean close
personal friendship, but we could discuss that in the bar or on another
occasion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Palmer of Childs Hill" PimsId="5913" UID="13061993000172" xid="2123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000172">Lord
Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I can come back
on that because I am probably the only person in your Lordships’
House who is a chairman of an audit committee. The present situation in
many audit committees, of which mine is one, where the chairman is a
member of an opposition party, which I am, gives an incredible
independence. You are not part of the ruling party and when we were in
power we did the same the other way
round.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000040">As the
noble Lord mentioned, we already have two independent members, which is
very good. However, the trouble is that if you appoint an independent
chairman or chairwoman of the committee, that person could well have a
political affiliation. Therefore, when the controlling party in that
local authority was looking for an independent chair of that committee
or panel, not unnaturally it would look to people whom they know or
know of. The current situation where the person is of an opposition
party, where that is relevant, seems to get over that point because
that person is not a close political friend. I just wanted to pick up
that point from my personal experience as something to think about that
when we are considering this
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000041"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tope" PimsId="4308" UID="13061993000173" xid="1468" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000173">Lord
Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that we are trying to achieve the
same thing here and therefore further discussion will be helpful. I
pick up on the Minister’s example of an auditor panel that has
two independent members, in the terms defined thus far, and a member
from the audit commission. Whether they are friends by any definition,
they could easily be members of the same political party. In a slightly
different context, we said earlier that all of us are concerned that
that should not happen in terms of elected members, with a majority
party having a majority on the committee or sometimes even all the
places on the committee. If we are talking about a small auditor panel,
with the three members suggested, it is possible—this is not in
the realms of fantasy in some areas of the country—that 
<?notus-xml column=123?>all three could be members of a political party. That does not
necessarily imply a conspiracy or
corruption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:14:51"></hs_TimeCode>; that

for that response and for the undertaking to look at this again. The
points that have been made around the Committee today emphasise that
there is less clarity than there should be on how this is all meant to

understand the point about making a judgment about whether someone was
independent from an authority because of a business relationship. As
the Minister said, you would seek to deal with that through guidance
and it would be an issue as to whether they should be appointed to
serve on the committee or the panel. In a sense, we are differentiating
between someone who is not independent in that category and someone who
is a relative, where they are not precluded from being appointed to the
panel or committee. However, there cannot be too many of them or the
requirement for a majority to be independent would break down. I am not
quite sure of the logic in that. However, rather than stretch the
debate this afternoon, I ask the Minister to look at that as part of
the broader discussion. Maybe we could have a meeting of all noble
Lords who have contributed before we get to Report because it would be
difficult to repeat this discussion at Report without some interim
deliberations. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment touches on
something that my noble friend began to address in an earlier debate.
It addresses paragraph 3 of Schedule 4, and the making of regulations
about a health service bodies auditor panel. These regulations would
enable the Secretary of State to determine whether any of the members
of the health service bodies auditor panel must be independent and, if
so, what proportion must be independent, as well as the definition of
independent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:18:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000048">A
health service body means a clinical commissioning group and special
trustees for a hospital. These powers are subject to the negative
procedure. The amendment would require there to be consultation with
representatives of health service bodies before regulations are
produced. This seems to be a significant paragraph to be dealt with by
the negative procedure, particularly given the prescriptive nature of

service. The composition of the clinical commissioning groups and local

other amendments in this group. The amendment would remove the
requirement on the auditor panel to advise on the maintenance of an
independent relationship with the local auditor. Indeed, it makes it
discretionary. When I prepared for this debate, I could not for the
life of me immediately recall why we tabled it. Obviously, the
circumstances where a relevant authority ends up with an auditor panel
and an audit committee, as we have discussed, would give rise to
overlap and confusion, and possibly conflicting

we tabled it as a probe to establish a definition of “an
independent relationship”. The Bill defines who is independent
in establishing eligibility to serve on an audit panel and/or
committee, but this definition does not appear to help in defining the
parameters of an independent relationship between the relevant
authority and its auditor. Is it proposed that guidance will be
available, or is it expected that 
<?notus-xml column=126?>audit panels or audit committees will work that out for themselves? This

proper public accountability for the actions of NHS bodies. I think
that public accountability is important, and there is material in the

Second Reading, I described to noble Lords what happened. A supervisory
body called in an auditor but the audit report was not ultimately
published. Instead, a commentary was published with various
recommendations—some good and some bad—but it was written
on the basis that, as no one had really lost any money, we could all
proceed and other bodies would make up the money. It was entirely

world in health and local government, and these worlds are now

believe that we now have the very odd situation where there is one
strand of law which is semi-engaged in this legislation and which
derives from the National Health Service Act 2006, as amended in 2012,
and  a whole strand of local authority-related legislation
concerning audit and accountability. As the two empires come together,
so should those two worlds come together. In my judgment, they need not
necessarily be identical, but the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, made a
fair point when he said that the clinical commissioning group is being
treated very differently in this Act from the way in which local
authorities are treated. I do not make a case for identity but I do for
accountability.</hs_para>

a public responsibility to ensure that what is done in their area is
done for the good of their local populations, and that it is done
effectively and openly, as we would expect it to be done ourselves. I
made the point at Second Reading that there were various issues
relating not only to audit but to scrutiny and its important role. I
would like to think that while it may not be possible to achieve it in
the short term, as I understand it from my discussions so far with my
noble friend, in the time that this Bill is before
Parliament—perhaps even when it is in the other place—it
might be possible to think with a little more foresight about how we
are going to adjust to this world and ensure full accountability. It is
simply not acceptable that a body existing in an area and other parts
of the health service, as happened in the case that I reported to noble
Lords at Second Reading, should simply refuse to respond to questions
from a public authority about the use of resources, certainly
considering the scale involved.</hs_para>

method somehow, whether or not it is through guidance—and there
is existing guidance—although I would perhaps prefer it to be
stronger than that. This Bill should provide us with opportunities, as
local accountability is not just about local authorities and neither is
this legislation. I am encouraged by what my noble friend has said so
far. We may be able to find some improved structures, which may be
simplified in some respects, as other noble Lords have said in
Committee. They should be structures which ensure proper behaviour in
the first place, effective independent audit and effective and open
accountability. All those strands need to be addressed. If an internal
audit document is published with a commentary and then scrutiny is
refused, it is not a satisfactory outcome where there is evidence of
large-scale ineptitude. That 
<?notus-xml column=129?>is a kind way of putting it regarding the use of £28
million of public resources. I am sure that there are other
examples.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061993000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000077">I
am not going to repeat all the circumstances of the case but I urge the
Committee to see those great public entities of local government and
the National Health Service as two great elements of the state,
providing vital services to our country and overlapping in many ways.
We should therefore find the opportunity to construct an architecture
that meets those three strands: effective and proper governance;
effective and ultimately independent audit, although internal audit is
vital in all those things and I do not denigrate it; and the strand of
openness and, ultimately, scrutiny. This is really a probing amendment
although my noble friend encouraged me to think that were this to be
laid, she might perhaps be able to give some encouragement to me and to
the Committee that the Government would be prepared to look at these

regards the attendance of particular individuals, identification of the
appropriate member or employee to attend may depend on the type of
scrutiny review being undertaken and its aims. To take a theoretical
case, where the local authority has required attendance of a particular
individual—let us say the accountable officer of a clinical
commissioning group—and it is not practical for that individual
to attend, or if that individual is not the most suitable person to
attend, we would expect the clinical commissioning group to suggest
another relevant individual. In such situations, both the local
authority and the commissioning group or provider, as the case may be,
will be expected to co-operate with each other to agree on a suitable

for the individual case, my noble friend referred to the 2006

of whom no longer worked for the body and therefore could not be
volunteered by the body—need to be accountable. Others declined
to be presented. Effectively, the authority was told that it could have

discussing when we were talking about local authorities. If the
clinical commissioning group has not appointed an auditor by December
and has no reasonable expectation of employing one by the end of March,
the Commissioning Board will have to notify the Secretary of State and
he, NHS England or the commissioning group will have to ensure that an

if the relevant year is to 31 December 2012, as  I understand

should be in the financial year to which the accounts to be audited

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I have misled the Committee, for which I
apologise. As the noble Lord said, it is the preceding year. If the
clinical commissioning group fails to appoint an auditor in the
preceding year at the end of March, the Commissioning Board will have
to notify the Secretary of State. This gives time for an auditor to put
in place the provisions for the following year. The Secretary of State
has to be notified by the commissioning board by 25 March that the
clinical commissioning group has failed to appoint an auditor. The
provisions are intended to ensure that a clinical commissioning group
has a local auditor in place in a way that is consistent with their
respective roles. I agree with the noble Lord that nine months seems a
long time to get someone in

have to read the record on that. The potential discrepancy that I was

December 2014, it would be the 25 March 2013 that would count. However,
the difference is between the 25 March for the clinical commissioning
groups and 31 December for the relevant authority’s appointment

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, in seeking that Clause 14
should not stand part of the Bill, I should say that this is a probing
measure to seek Government assurances about the appropriateness of
facilitating the limitation of local auditor liability arrangements.
The impact assessment and other documentation records that the Audit
Commission currently provides an indemnity to audit firms for certain
aspects of their work. This is, presumably, their statutory audit
function. It also appears that it covers irrecoverable legal costs. We
are told that the indemnity has been used only twice over the past five
years and that auditors have faced legal action four times over a
five-year period. Perhaps the Minister will let us know the amounts
involved in the use of the indemnity and how much was
paid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000097">What
benefits ensue from limited liability arrangements which relieve
auditors of liability in respect of negligence, default or breach of
trust when conducting an audit? What are the benefits of that? The
limitation of auditors’ liability has been permitted under the
Companies Acts since 2008, although reports suggest that there has been
little take-up. I am indebted in this regard to a Mr James Herbert, who
is a corporate partner in a law firm who wrote an interesting article
in <I>Accountancy Age</I> back in 2009. I took the opportunity of
speaking to him to see whether the view he expressed then had changed.
It had
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000098">Part of
the reason for little take-up of those arrangements is attributed to
issues with the SEC prohibiting UK companies registered with them from
entering into those arrangements. Under the Companies Acts, any
limitation must be fair and reasonable. A separate agreement is reached
for each year and each agreement must be approved by shareholders. On
the face of it, there is no reason why auditors should be protected
from the consequences of their negligence or default in the public or
private sectors. However, one of the public policy objectives was to
enhance competition in the UK audit market and to address concerns
about auditor concentration. As we have discussed before, the big four
have deep pockets, are better able to bear the risks and have more
clout with professional indemnity insurers. There are concerns that the
smaller and mid-tier firms have been least able to benefit from the
agreements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000099">Another
reason for allowing such agreements might be its impact on the price of
an audit. If the risk on the audit firm is less, the cost of the audit
should go down. However, it is difficult to gauge whether there will be
any real downward pressure on fees in the public sector, particularly
given the infrequent calls on the commission’s indemnity. We can
see some merit in allowing limitation of liability agreements if
tightly regulated and if they can be demonstrated to help to open up
the markets and put downward pressure on fees. However, we are
sceptical that they will deliver that outcome. Perhaps the Minister can
say when we might see a draft of the proposed regulations referred to
in Clause 14 or what else might be provided in the key elements in the
regulations. How do the Government propose to monitor and assess the
effects of the
clause?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000100">I
emphasise that in my discussions with that particular lawyer, it

might wish to return to the matter on Report, but it seems to me that,
at the very least, there may be an argument for a sunset clause on the

audit fees and an opening up of the market to smaller firms—is

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> We have already mentioned that the
number of accountancy firms capable of carrying out these audits is
quite small—five to seven, probably. The maximum would be 13,
and most of those would probably not achieve those audits. All of those

had the example within the corporate sector of Arthur Andersen, which
messed up on an audit—not a local authority audit but a public

to say that, in terms of local or public health authorities, these
firms should have this protection, or are we saying that these are the
professionals and they must do their audits, work correctly and cover
themselves? We are not talking about anyone being responsible for fraud
or errors within local authorities or the health service; we are
talking about them not having carried out their work properly to an
extent where they can cover themselves. I ask the Minister to
reconsider whether the liability should ultimately rest with the

to ensure that auditors are not held liable for consequences beyond

14 mirrors the Companies Act 2006 by providing that any such
“liability limitation agreement” must comply with certain

do not unreasonably limit the auditor’s liability and are

removing all liability completely. As I said, it is right that auditors

point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, about who should pick up
the liability, the Bill includes provisions that enable auditors to
recover the costs of their time in exercising their functions from the

indemnity scheme, which covers the costs of auditors taking or
defending legal action. We believe that it is
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:04:14"></hs_TimeCode> for
private companies to bear the risks and costs of that. We do not
believe that it would unduly deter auditors from exercising their
functions. The Audit Commission has rarely indemnified its suppliers.
On the noble Lord’s question as to whether the Government should
pick up liability, the answer would be no. With that, I urge that the

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for that response. I think that we understand a bit better that the
regulations will broadly follow the Companies Acts requirements and
what flows from that. I found her response confusing in some respects.
We are talking about something that is not beyond the control of the
auditors. These arrangements are predicated on a breach in respect of
any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust occurring in
the course of the audit of accounts, so it is a failure of an audit
firm which triggers them. 
<?notus-xml column=136?>The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, raised a very important point. If there is
a breach or damages and if that is not to be visited on the auditor, or
what is to be visited on them is restricted, who bears the cost of the
rest? I do not think we understand that from the Minister’s
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:06:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

public policy issue about this was partly to do with making sure that
another big four company did not go under. The ramifications of those
four big beasts going down to three would be significant over a whole
range of areas, as we learnt from the demise of Arthur Andersen because
of Enron. I thought that a key point was to make it easier for smaller
firms to enter the market because their risks were, in a sense, capped.
There is no great evidence to suggest that that has happened in the
private sector. We do not yet know whether it will happen in the public
sector, but if it does not, that raises the question: why have these
agreements in the first place? All they do is to protect audit firms.
Why? These are sophisticated organisations. They have excellent
training programmes, generally recruit very good staff and have been
around the block a few times. If they mess up, should they not bear the
consequences? If not, the question of the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, is
absolutely right: who
should<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:07:21"></hs_TimeCode>? Part of
the rationale may be that it would produce downward pressure on audit
fees, but that is difficult to justify, particularly if the use of the
commission’s indemnity was pretty restricted.</hs_para>

issue, perhaps in terms of a sunset clause, if these things are to
continue. I hope that the same arrangements as in the private sector,
where I think they have to be annual contracts, will persist in the
public sector in so far as they are used at all. I hope that guidance
is given to firms when faced with such a request from their auditors as
to how they should
respond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:08:14"></hs_TimeCode>. We have

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 16 concerns the

purpose is to ensure that the procedure specifically encompasses the
right of a local auditor to make representations to the auditor panel
or supervisory 
<?notus-xml column=137?>body, or the audit committee, if that is what is in place, and that
might encompass a right to make representation to members. The removal
or resignation of an auditor is a serious business. Under the Companies
Act 2006, an extensive process is set down where somebody is removed or
resigns. These include, in the first case, the right to make
representations to members when removed and a statement of
circumstances when resigning. It is these Companies Act processes which
the Government are seeking to import into the Bill, and we support
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000117">Under
the current regime, there is no need for regulation on the removal or
resignation of local public auditors because it is the Audit Commission
that appoints and removes them. However, a change in auditor could be
straightforward—arising, say, from a new potential conflict of
interest—or it might be indicative of a fundamental difference
of view as to the accounts, where an auditor feels that they can no
longer carry out the audit effectively because of concerns over the
governance of the body or a fundamental breakdown in the relationship.
Ensuring that there is a right for auditors to make their case at an
appropriate level is therefore very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061993000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130619-gc0001.htm#13061993000118">The

range of issues. Doubtless, the Minister will say that they are broad
enough to cover the thrust of this amendment. So be it, but perhaps we

and removal to cover circumstances where the appointment has been made

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member> The
youth secure estate comprises Secure Children’s Homes, Secure
Training Centres and under 18 Young Offender Institutions. The youth
secure estate accommodates young offenders aged 10-17 plus some 18 year
olds who are near to the end of their sentence. Therefore there will be
no foreign nationals aged 19-21 held within the youth secure estate.
The Youth Justice Board collects information on the nationality of
offenders accommodated within the youth secure estate for the last 12
months, but the data is not held centrally. In order to provide the
information it would be necessary to manually examine approximately
3,500 records which could only be done at disproportionate

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member> (1)
Young people should be transported to secure establishments as soon as
possible following a court hearing. Escort providers are expected to
take all reasonable steps to expedite the journeys of young people in
order to reduce the likelihood of late arrivals at establishments. Some
under-18 Young Offenders Institutions do have locally agreed latest
reception times but no young people will be refused entry if they
arrive after that specified time. Secure Training Centres and Secure
Children’s Homes do not have latest reception times. (2) The
length of time young people are held in cellular vehicles should be
kept to the absolute minimum possible. There is no maximum period
specified in which young people can be held in cellular
vehicles. (3) There are financial implications for
providers if conditions of contracts are
breached which includes missing latest reception
times.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-06-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_19_PT_1/Index/4C398E100C2B8E18D34A6A501B71E09CD045C445" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="26" cday="Wednesday" cmonth="June" cyear="2013" date="19" day="Wednesday" issue="20" maxparts="1" month="June" part="1" price="" printing="daily" session="201314" volume="746" year="2013"><tocdate col="WS11">Wednesday 19 June 2013</tocdate><title>ALPHABETICAL
