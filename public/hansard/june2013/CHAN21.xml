Connarty:</Member></B> I commend the Government in England for making
it compulsory at key stages 1 and 2 to teach children to
swim. However, that entitlement does not exist in Scotland. There has
been a call from the Amateur Swimming Association not only to train
swimmers for the Commonwealth and Olympic games but for better swimming
safety. It wants a national entitlement to swimming teaching. In 2011,
six children died by accidental drowning in Scotland and 47 in the UK;
the figure for adults in the UK in that year was 407. Surely it is a
human right for people to learn to swim so that they do not drown if
they fall into the water.</hs_Para>

lead them into a lot of different careers, whether in entrepreneurship

Women’s safety is being put at risk by Government reforms.
According to Homeless Link, Ministers still have not sorted payments to
refuges under universal credit, and it is now clear that sanctuary
schemes are being put at risk. A woman who is a victim of domestic
violence who has a specially installed panic room in her home has been
told that she must pay an extra £12 because it counts as a spare
bedroom under the bedroom tax. Another woman who is at serious risk
from her abuser was moved by a multi-agency risk assessment conference
into safe accommodation, but has now been told that she is
under-occupying and will have to pay bedroom tax or move home again,
when she is already feeling unsafe. It is no good the Minister passing
the buck to local councils and chattering on about the discretionary
housing payment, as his hon. Friends and colleagues have been trying to
advise him. The fact is that such cases are happening across the
country. Does he have any idea how many women are being affected in

running his own Bill, and this week the Prime Minister and the Foreign

reflected on the simple fact that where national security interests are

the standards that the NHS is setting out to meet. They are expressed

any case all Members of Parliament would, in the first instance, be
alongside the providers of health care in their constituencies, because
the first responsibility for delivering standards lies with the

clinical commissioning groups and NHS England have a responsibility. I
think that Members of Parliament will find it extremely helpful to have
a continuing dialogue with their clinical commissioning groups, which
have a responsibility for delivering high-quality care to the patients
for whom they commission services. They are supported by NHS England,
where we have mainstreamed the patient safety responsibilities of the
former National Patient Safety

England is terrifically important, but unfortunately the volume of
payments through the NHS Litigation Authority is now roughly £1
billion a year, and there is a massive contingent liability. We cannot
expect that to disappear and it is important to have compensation where
people have

ensure that that is done cost-effectively. I know all

Preston jail as a high-security prison, but this was refused and the
alternative option of holding the trial at the Old Bailey was not taken

Criminal Bar Association. I recalled the occasion; I was sitting on the

questions, listing the stakeholders that they met. I confess that I
mistakenly thought that the Criminal Bar Association was in that long

I said, last week was national carers week. With over 10,000 events up

Westminster, MPs were invited to a variety of events,
including a speed dating event with carers with a wide range
of life experiences. I had the opportunity to meet, among others, a
woman called Karen whose husband has Parkinson’s. She told me
about her experience of being a carer for someone with that particular
condition and about the isolation she felt, having taken on that caring
role. She conveyed a sense of being increasingly excluded from
participating in many aspects of society. I met other carers involved
with Marie Curie, who told me how, because of the nature of
the diagnosis and the rapid progression of the cancers in question,
they experienced additional strains and burdens in trying to get the
right support at the right time for their loved
ones<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:22:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The week

year’s theme was “Prepared to Care?” It
highlighted the fact that people who take on caring roles are often not
prepared for the physical and emotional impact of caring, nor for its
impact on their lives in other ways, not least financially. In that
sense, it is worth stressing that this is not a “them and
us” issue. It is easy to think about this as something that is
going to happen to other people, whereas the figures clearly show that
three out of five of us will be a carer at some point in our lives. It
will touch all of us, either through personal experience or through our
family’s experiences.</hs_Para>

want to pay particular tribute to the carers I have met over the years
in my constituency during my time as a Member of Parliament. I want to
thank the Sutton Carers Centre for being a lifeline for thousands of
carers—young and old alike. The carers centre in Sutton has been
my guide and teacher on carer issues over the past 15 years. Whether
through shadowing carers to learn directly from them or meeting carers
at the centre, I have found that the things they want—the things
they tell me they want—are not impossible or unreasonable. 
<?notus-xml column=1071?>They do not want to feel that everything is a constant battle—a
battle to get a diagnosis, a battle to get an assessment, a battle to
get support, a battle to get a break, or, indeed, a battle to navigate

years, I have met and listened to many carers in my constituency and I
have met carers for whom the lifeline that keeps them sane and keeps
them connected is not the formal social care support, nor even the
carer centre. It may be, for instance, the local bowling club, as I
learned from one of the carers whom I shadowed. The determination of
the club’s members to support a friend was the most important
thing in that person’s life. Not enough is made of such
informal, often fragile networks of support, although they often
represent the vital difference between just surviving and having a
life.</hs_Para>

clear evidence that the caring role takes its toll on people,
physically, emotionally and financially. Six out of 10 carers report
experiencing depression because of their caring role, and, as I have
said, caring can be a lonely business: three out of five carers say
that they have experienced difficulties in maintaining
relationships with friends. Another problem is the desire of many
carers to stay in the workplace so that they can remain connected
through their work. More than 3 million are trying to
balance their caring responsibilities with paid work, often at the
expense of working hours or their career
prospects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0001.htm#13062055000312">Last
June I hosted a carers summit with the forum Employers for Carers, led
by BT. The aim was to explore opportunities to help carers to remain in
the workplace. BT and other members of the forum, such as British Gas,
have a good track record in that regard. They invest in their staff and
want to retain them, so identifying and supporting carers seems logical
to them. The cost to the bottom line of a business of replacing a
member of staff can be huge, and one of the purposes of the summit was
to enable more employers to see the business case for carer-friendly
employment practices. The Government subsequently established a
“task and finish” group to consider ways of creating an
environment in which people could balance their caring responsibilities
with their careers. That work is

million people have given up work at some point to care for an older or
disabled loved one. One in four gave up work or reduced their working
hours because the cost of replacement care was too high, and a similar
number reported that services were not flexible enough to meet their
needs. The impact of being forced to give up work to care for a loved
one on an individual’s finances alone is clear, but the London
School of Economics has estimated that the hidden cost to the
economy—in benefits and lost tax revenues—is a staggering
£1.3 billion a year, every year. When lost earnings are taken
into account, the figure can rise to as much as £5.3 billion.
That is not a cost that the United Kingdom can continue to bear as a
consequence of a failure to act and provide the safeguards, supports
and systems that would enable carers to remain in employment.</hs_Para>

We must begin to view it in the way we view child care support

although the Government have done much in that regard. Given the scale
of demographic change—the over-85s are now the fastest-growing
section of the population, and their number is set to double by
2030—and the growing proportion of “sandwich
workers” who are attempting to juggle paid work with the demands
of caring for both children and older relatives, the provision of
flexibility is becoming an imperative. The Government must also think

it would make a huge difference to their lives. I therefore regret that
the evidence suggests that that has not happened. Monitoring by the
Carers Trust for the year 2011-12 found that action on the ground had
often been slow or non-existent. Despite clear reporting requirements,
in many areas it was impossible to track how money had been spent, and

drinking in the last-chance saloon. If we do not see progress,
legislation may be necessary. There is another way in which the money
could, and should in future, be earmarked for this purpose. There have
been transfers from the NHS to local authorities for the support of
social care more generally, and in some local authority areas that has
happened with the carers break money as well; it has been transferred.
It has not happened everywhere, however, and I think it should now
become mandatory, so this money gets spent for the purpose the
Government said in their spending review it was for. That is a
perfectly reasonable thing to expect, and the Government need to
reflect on three years of this money not getting where it needed to be,
after a number of years of that under the last Government as

survey by Carers UK found that in one in five cases where a person who
was receiving care from family or friends was admitted to hospital as
an emergency, that could have been prevented if the carer had received
more respite care and support. This makes big differences financially
to the NHS. It uses resources better, and that is why it beggars belief
that the NHS has not yet made sufficient progress, with its partners in
local government, to improve access to breaks for

lead, there have been some examples of improvement, such as in
Huntingdon, where there is an interesting carers breaks project led by
GPs. Partnered with Crossroads Care, they identify carers by meeting
them socially, and prescribe breaks. Carers who are met in that way
tell me they have for the first time had the experience of having
raised their needs as carers and seen that translated into tangible
action that made a difference for them. We need to see more of that. It

by private Members’ Bills. Let me place on the record my
appreciation for the work of the late Malcolm Wicks, whose Carers
(Recognition and Services) Act 1995 was a landmark in the rights of
carers and a fitting legacy for such a thoughtful and generous Member
of this House. For the first time, the Care Bill enshrines in
legislation carers’ rights to an assessment of their needs and,
importantly, establishes a duty to meet those needs which are eligible.
It also establishes clearly the need to consult and involve carers in
decisions about the care of those they care
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000332">Although
the Care Bill is hugely welcome, inevitably there are gaps and
unintended consequences that must be addressed if all carers are to get
the support they are entitled to. Following the Government’s
welcome announcement last week of their intention to amend the Children
and Families Bill to ensure that the rights of young carers are as
strong as those proposed for adult carers, we must see the necessary
changes to it and the Care Bill, and ensure that the rights of parent
carers of disabled children, which have so far been neglected in both
Bills, are not allowed to fall through the cracks.</hs_Para>

their experience of engaging with carers in their constituencies. I

Carers UK of data published from the 2011 census has shown that the
number of carers has increased substantially, by 11%, since 2001, and
there are 35% more carers over the age of 65. We know that carers often
combine paid work with raising their own children, as well as caring
for other family members. In fact, one in four women and one in six men
aged 50 to 64 have caring responsibilities for family members who are
older or disabled. If we think about that for a moment, we start to
realise the difficulties. Of course, many of us know people in that
situation, or may be in it ourselves. Some 3 million carers juggle
caring with paid work, so it is not surprising to learn that full-time
carers are more than twice as likely to be in poor health as people
without caring responsibilities.</hs_Para>

these stresses, carers should be getting advice and information to help
them care, but it is becoming ever clearer that they are not. During
the recent carers week, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred,
Members met carers to find out about their issues. Last week I went to
a speed networking event, as I think it is called, here in the House,
at which I met six carers. Two were carers of family members with
cancer, two had cared for a partner or family member at the end of
their life, and two were carers of spouses with Parkinson’s.
Despite the differences in their caring, the one thing they shared was
not having been given the information, advice and support they needed
to be carers. As the right hon. Gentleman touched on to an extent,
Macmillan Cancer Support tells us that carers of people with cancer
come into contact most with health professionals, by whom they need to
be identified and signposted. However, 95% of cancer carers are not
getting a carers assessment.</hs_Para>

revealing to talk to carers of people with cancer about how this had
affected them. Cancer patients, as we know, may have long days of
treatment in hospital, yet no one had told the carers I spoke to that a
discount was available on expensive hospital car parking costs. One of
the carers had to buy a hospital bed for use at home by her daughter,
yet she was given no advice on where to buy one.</hs_Para>

issues crop up for carers of people with a terminal illness, but those
carers are also juggling with the knowledge that they only have a
limited time with the person for whom they are caring. Carol and Lucy
were the two carers I met. One had cared for a partner and the other
for her mother, both through to the end of their lives. Both said how
much financial hardship they had had to accept to undertake that
caring. The carer of her terminally ill mother could only get unpaid
leave from her job and took it for 11 months. She lost her flat because
she could no longer afford to pay the rent. It seems wrong that carers
have to struggle on unpaid leave while caring for someone who is
terminally ill. She never told her mother that the leave was unpaid or
of the difficulties she was having.</hs_Para>

of people with cancer and of people who are terminally ill both cited
the same issue: as carers, they were mainly ignored by the health

associations for help and advice. In the cases of the very few carers
of people with cancer who managed 
<?notus-xml column=1076?>to have a carers’ assessment, that had most often been prompted
by a referral from a GP. As the right hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam

all matters because the Care Bill puts great emphasis on carers’
assessments rather than the identification of carers and the need to
signpost them to sources of advice and support. Last September, I
introduced a private Member’s Bill, the Social Care (Local
Sufficiency) and Identification of Carers Bill. Three sponsors of that
Bill are in the Chamber. The Government, sadly, did not support my Bill
and their Back-Bench Members talked it out. The clauses on the
identification of carers would have ensured that NHS bodies had the
procedures in place to identify carers, promote their health and
well-being and ensure they receive information and advice. Those are
the exact areas from which the carers to whom I have talked would
benefit. As I said during the debate on the Bill, I believe that the
key focus in identifying carers should be those with the heaviest
caring commitments.</hs_Para>

health care teams in my constituency have started to tackle the task of
identifying carers, but there is much more to do. The manager of the

practices to identify carers, local GPs made 300 referrals last year,
but we have 20,000 carers in Salford, 5,000 of whom will be caring at

higher education to identify students who are carers and have in place
policies to support them. Young adult carers at university or college
have to balance giving care with their academic studies and learning.
Some do that by caring at a distance, returning home at weekends or
holidays to provide care, whereas others have to balance care and study
by continuing to live at home and travelling to their local university
so that they can maintain their regular caring roles. Hardly any of the
carers I have talked about in my speech are in contact with local
authorities or are likely to have had a carers assessment from a local
authority. So the duty on carers assessments in the Care Bill would not
help the carers I have met recently—the carers of people with
cancer or of people who are terminally ill. And, as I have said, the
local authorities are reaching only one in 10 of carers of people with
Parkinson’s

should be given the same rights as adult carers, so that the Bill

have the same rights as adult carers in the Care Bill and there is no
mention of them at all in the Children and Families Bill. That is not
acceptable. The care services Minister and the children’s

Gentleman for that point. I am, however, going to push the matter with
the Minister because there was an opportunity in this regard. New
clauses were moved during the remaining stages on the Children and
Families Bill last week that were copies of clauses from my Bill, and
they would have required those bodies that I talked about to have
policies in place. We are not talking about a large financial
commitment; we are talking about bodies having policies in place. Our
schools, our colleges and our higher and further education institutions
should have policies in place to recognise young carers, but up and
down the country they do not have those. The disappointment that
organisations outside here that support young carers will have felt
results from the fact that the debate was managed last week so that
those new clauses were not reached. That does not show good faith, and
if I were a member of the coalition of organisations that support young
carers, I would look at that and say, “I don’t know what
the Government are going to do.” The Minister will have to
accept that they are still disappointing people who have not been
protected sufficiently by the

conclude by touching quickly on the financial context of social care
and how it affects carers. Giving carers rights in the Care Bill is
indeed a positive step, but the Local Government Association reminds us
that the Government’s austerity programme and the need for
further savings do not fit well with the aspirations of the Bill.
Councils have had to reduce their adult social care budgets by 20% over
the past three years. At least a quarter of those cuts are from
reductions in services and increases in
charges<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Almost
90% of councils only meet needs that are at the substantial or critical
threshold.</hs_Para>

at our local carers centre told me that carers are being affected by
the bedroom tax, the increase in the value of non-dependent deductions,
fewer sources of grant funding, and reductions to care packages that 
<?notus-xml column=1079?>appear to be driven by cutting costs, not by changes in need. That is
particularly true where they are caring for somebody with a learning or
physical disability. Worries continue into the future when the change
from disability living allowance to the personal independence payment
starts to affect carers. The Government’s own impact assessment
published in February indicated that almost 10,000 fewer carers will be
entitled to carers allowance by 2015 as a knock-on consequence of the
loss of disability benefits following the introduction of PIP.

reflect this and ensure that the threshold of eligible needs is not set
too high. The risk is that local authorities will use the framework to
restrict “eligible needs” on the basis of limited

we should acknowledge the importance of creating a care industry that
people aspire to work in by appropriately rewarding the work they do.

demographic make-up of our population is obviously changing, which is
already starting to stress our care system. That is happening against
the backdrop of large-scale cuts across the system. According to the
Local Government Association, local authorities have had to cut their
adult social care budgets by 20% over the past three years, which means
that in many places, such as Tameside, the metropolitan borough that my
constituency covers, the amount of respite care available is being
severely squeezed. I have seen some appalling cases in my
surgeries—the kinds of cases that stay on my mind and often

the backdrop of cuts, many carers work day in, day out, delivering
excellent care but for poor pay, whether they work in a residential

life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:08:47"></hs_TimeCode>. If we as a

should happen alongside a concerted effort to improve skills across the
care industry, investing in training and development to make the sector
one in which people aspire to work. It could be a huge source of
employment for the future—it is not possible to outsource care
in the same way as we outsource other industries to another

I want to discuss the impact on non-professional carers of the current
pressures in the care system. In Tameside, approximately 2 million
hours of unpaid care are given every year. If purchased from a paid
carer, that would cost in the region of £22.5
million. That puts a high strain on carers, as has been mentioned. In
Tameside, people are substantially more likely to be in ill health if
they are carers, and that is in an area that already has poor public
health. We should all take the time to recognise the stressful and
important work that carers
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:10:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000390" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000390">Several
of my constituents who are dedicated carers for the people they love
have told me that they receive no recognition for the valuable work
they do. That is why debates such as this are important. Many of them
have had to give up their jobs, and in several cases the person for
whom they are caring feels responsible for that, even though it is no
fault of
theirs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000391" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000391">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>
burden on many of those who care for loved ones has increased since the
Government introduced their welfare reforms in April. In Tameside,
increasing numbers of carers are reporting stress due to financial
worries. The Government’s impact assessment into the changes to
disability living allowance and carer’s allowance and the
introduction of the personal independence payment shows that almost
10,000 fewer carers will be entitled to carer’s allowance. That
is a massive blow for those who care full time. Locally, the number of
people who are seeking support to complete their benefit forms is
increasing. How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:11:01"></hs_TimeCode>
can it be right that we are penalising these people for the work that
they do? Where are the Government to support these people when they so

conclude, I welcome the principle in the Care Bill of capping care
costs. I do not think that it is set at the right level, but it is a
welcome first step in reducing the burden of care. However, I believe
that we need to explore a genuinely integrated health and social care
system. That would not only help people to stay independent in their
own homes for as long as possible, but reduce the burden on family
members who deliver care each and every day. That is the challenge. I
hope that we will see a developing political consensus, with Members on
both sides of the House moving towards such a system, so that we can
enshrine it, secure it and give people the system that they deserve and
need for the years

extensive caring demands. A number of them are going through the

need time off and a break from the constant work of caring. Some

hon. Members have indicated, the current review of welfare has had many
effects. My niece and nephew are carers at weekends and look after
people with learning 
<?notus-xml column=1088?>disabilities. They stay overnight and therefore need a room for
themselves. Under the Government’s legislation, however, and the
tax we all deplore—the bedroom tax—we find that it might
not be possible for them to continue doing that job. It would also be
hard for their clients to find a smaller house that can be adapted in
the way their current houses are, quite apart from the problems and
upset that such a move would mean.</hs_Para>

fundamental failure of some local authorities to provide information
about what is available is not acceptable, even from a statutory point
of view. Carers are being left in the dark, without support and on
their own. Local authority spending is in decline. According to Mencap,
spending by local authorities on children’s short break services
peaked in 2010-11, but 63% of local authorities reduced this

No family carer should be left to reach breaking point and every family
that needs a short break should get one. Each carer should have their
needs identified and should not feel that they are alone and without
support. Money that is intended for short breaks should be spent on
providing short-term breaks. We need services that are person-centred

Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam. Rather than trying to cover

excellent research communicated during the week or, indeed, many of the
points made by colleagues on the Opposition Benches, I would instead

would like to congratulate the organisations that came together to form
carers week, because they achieved something quite remarkable. More
than 26,000 organisations across the UK came together and put on more
than 100,000 events. Why is that important? From the events I attended,
I realised it was vital to raise awareness of the services and
financial help available for carers. Like many other Members, I am
sure, I often find in my casework and when visiting organisations in my
constituency that those who most need help are often the least likely
to access it, and we have to work hard to ensure that the legislation,
the benefits and the rights that we provide for in the House get into
the hands of the people who really need it.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=1090?><hs_Para UID="13062055000427" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000427"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:35:31"></hs_TimeCode>When
attending the events in my constituency, I was struck by a fundamental
problem touched on by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:35:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ceredigion (Mr Williams): many carers do not identify themselves as
such. I spent some time in the lobby of the Royal Cornwall hospital
trust alongside volunteers and care support workers from the Cornwall
Rural Community Council. They would approach people who were clearly
carers—elderly people pushing people in wheelchairs,
coming into hospital, attending appointments or leaving
hospital—and ask them, “Are you a carer?” They
would ask them very nicely and in a friendly manner, with a view to
engaging with them to ensure they were getting the help to which they
were entitled, but the people would hurry on saying, “No,
I’m not a carer.”</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000428" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000428">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:37:40"></hs_TimeCode>,
however, we asked whether they looked after someone—a husband,
wife, child or loved one—they replied yes. If we asked them,
“Do you regularly provide support perhaps through cooking meals
or going shopping?”, they replied yes. We need to think about
that a bit more in our desire to find out who carers are and ensure
they get the support they need, whether from the NHS, councils,
employers or the voluntary sector and wider community. We need to think
about how we frame the conversation to enable people to identify
themselves as carers, because most of the people I spoke to said,
“Well, I’m just doing what any family member would do.
This is what families do.” If somebody is ill or has a
disability or care need, families gather round. I took that from my
meetings last week, and it is particularly important in literature.
Central Government produce a lot of literature, and a lot of benefits
leaflets go out through the Department for Work and Pensions and
throughout the health service, so we should think about the terms we
use and how we can engage with people in that literature.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000429" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000429"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>Another
thing I reflected on after speaking with carers last week—this
came out in the reports—was the evidence on the number of people
who gave up work to care. This can have a detrimental impact on the
carer: they miss the social contact provided at work and can feel quite
isolated and often trapped at home, especially in remote rural areas,
such as those in my constituency, where it is difficult to use public
transport and connect to wider society. It also has a detrimental
impact on household incomes and pension provision. The main question
that Carers UK is asking the whole nation is the right one: are we
prepared to care? It is a question for the whole of society. Are
employers prepared to provide those flexible working opportunities to
enable people both to attend to their caring responsibilities and to
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000430" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000430">We
have to be realistic, however, because many people are worried about
their job at the moment, and so, for fear of losing their job, are
unlikely to talk to their employer about the need to work flexible
hours. The Government need to engage with employers—there are
exemplars, such as BT, with a long track record of recruiting and
retaining older workers and enabling flexible working—about the
research and the issues and to get them thinking about making it easier
for their staff to request flexible working. The huge triumph in
employment in the past century was to enable women to juggle caring
responsibilities for children and work. In this century, as we respond
to significant demographic changes, we need a massive shift to enable
workers of all 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>ages to combine other caring responsibilities. For
older people and people with disabilities, that is a very important
lesson from carers
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:39:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000431" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000431">Carers
told me that even if they wanted to carry on working—if they had
the income and were prepared to pay for care, or have a mixture so that
they would do part of the caring but pay for people to come into the
home to support them, and their loved ones agreed to that—they
were anxious about the quality of the care they would be inviting into
their homes. All of us were horrified by recent revelations about some
of the carers going into people’s homes, whether they were paid
for by individuals or local authorities as part of their domiciliary
care service. Until we crack the nut of ensuring that high quality,
well-trained and well-paid carers are going into people’s homes,
people will have a great fear and reluctance to try and combine caring
responsibilities with employment.</hs_Para>

find a sad position in too many local authorities. We all understand
that councils’ budgets are under a lot of pressure. I was a
councillor and I know that it is difficult to balance all the needs of
one’s community with conflicting demands on what the council
should be spending its money on. No two people agree on what a
council’s priority should be. For me, it is straightforward: a
council’s responsibility, like central Government’s
responsibility, is to prioritise the care of the most vulnerable people
in society. However, in contracting for domiciliary care, local
authorities are cutting their payments so low that it is difficult for
private care providers to provide a good quality of care while
remaining economically sustainable. That reduces the options available
for the vast majority of people who self-fund

Newton:</Member></B> I absolutely agree that local authorities should
be remorselessly focused on the best possible outcomes for the people
they have a duty to provide care for. They should also understand that
while the vast majority of people are not eligible for local authority
care, local authorities have a responsibility as market shapers in
their localities to ensure that private, third and voluntary sector
organisations are able to provide the care services that most people
pay for themselves. By constantly engaging in a race to the bottom,
they are undermining the ability of those organisations to provide
services to the community. Most private or third sector domiciliary
care providers need a certain amount of contracts or business from the
local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:43:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000435" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000435"><B><Member ContinuationText="Paul Burstow" PimsId="2384" UID="13062055001124" xid="84" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055001124">Paul
Burstow:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is making an important point about
the patchy quality of domiciliary care. There are good examples, such
as in Wiltshire, where the service has been remodelled to focus on
outcomes. However, there is an issue about whether the Government 
<?notus-xml column=1092?>have the necessary powers to ensure that where poor
commissioning practice is allowing contracting by the minute, which is
resulting in sub-standard care to an individual, they can ensure good
quality commissioning practice in the future. The Joint Committee on
the draft Care and Support Bill has recommended a change in the law and
the Government are doubtful of its need. Does she agree that the
Government need to keep thinking about that and perhaps come back with
an
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:44:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000436" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000436"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sarah Newton" PimsId="5613" UID="13062055001125" xid="1158" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055001125">Sarah
Newton:</Member></B> I back what my hon. Friend says. The Joint
Committee’s report was excellent and showed Parliament at its
best. People with tremendous experience from the House of Lords and
this place worked together to scrutinise and improve that excellent
Bill. The Government should be commended for introducing it at a time
of economic restraint, especially as it has financial consequences:
spending more money on supporting carers is a bold thing to do at the
moment and it underlines the great value we put on carers. I back my
hon. Friend in his call for an amendment, because if local authorities
are tempted to avoid doing what we would all regard as the right
thing—to look after the most vulnerable people in our
society—we need to tighten up the law to remove that temptation
from
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:45:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000437" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000437">I
would like to share another issue that was raised in carers week. The
strong message from carers was that they do not always feel involved in
the decisions made by professionals about the people they are caring
for. The Government have, rightly, enshrined in their health and social
care reforms the principle that “No decision should be taken
about me without me.” I would like to extend that so that
“No decision is taken about the person I am caring for without
me.” I have heard far too many cases, in my own case work and
during carers week—particularly from parents caring for children
with disabilities—where substantial decisions, on whether their
children should cared for away from their home many hundreds of miles
away, were considered without proper discussion with the parents. That
is absolutely wrong. There is a prevalent attitude among some
professionals that they know best: “Trust me, we know what is
best for your child. Trust me, we know what is best for your wife or
your husband.” While I would like to be able to trust all
professionals—we think that by and large they do have the best
interests of people at heart—there should be openness and
transparency. Carers should be involved in decisions, so that there is
a joint agreement and an understanding about what is in the best
interests of the person being looked after.</hs_Para>

a more positive note, I would like to share some of the good practice I
saw during carers week. I saw great examples of innovation involving
the voluntary sector, in particular. We have talked about statutory
provision and what employers can do, but broader civil society and the
voluntary sector have an enormous role to play too. I would like to

group of people in Falmouth in my constituency responded to the Prime

does it mean to be a dementia-friendly community? It means that the

means that we have dementia cafes and that the people in the youth
centre are aware of people with dementia. Overall, it means that people
who suffer from dementia, or are caring for someone who suffers from
dementia, can go into Falmouth with confidence, knowing that they will
receive a warm welcome in the shops, libraries, public spaces and the
youth centre. The people there will understand more about dementia and
some of the behaviour that comes with it. Some people might find that
behaviour a little bit challenging and scary, which often makes the
people who care for someone with dementia want to stay at home. They
can be fearful of the response they will receive in a public space and
end up becoming isolated. I can honestly say that people with dementia
will receive a very warm welcome in Falmouth, thanks to the huge amount
of work done by a small group of volunteers ably led by the Bridges,

so that another group of people in Falmouth, led by a former nurse,
Lisa Dann, has been working with Dementia UK over the last year to
raise enough money for two admiral nurses. For those who do not know,
admiral nurses, who are similar to Macmillan nurses, are specialist
nurses who work alongside those with dementia and their carers,
providing a lifeline for people coping with what can be a very
difficult condition. Lisa was motivated to set up the charity and raise
funds because of the poor support that her mum and her family received
when her dad was suffering, before sadly dying from dementia.</hs_Para>

partnership with a large social enterprise in Cornwall—Cornwall
Care, which is the largest independent care provider in the
county—to make the scheme sustainable. The group will be raising
more money for more admiral nurses, which will provide a huge amount of

that the Minister remembers that experience—this was the final
point I was coming to—and has agreed to meet Tracey Roose from
Age UK and Ian Jones from Volunteer Cornwall quite soon to take forward
what he experienced first hand in Cornwall with some more ideas.
Changing Lives is a fantastic example of how volunteers can work with
GPs to ensure that people have access to all the care and support that
they need to live happy, fulfilled lives in their communities. The
pilot in Cornwall has had some quite dramatic results, not only in
terms of carers feeling better supported and the vulnerable, frail
older people concerned having a better quality of life, but in huge
savings for the NHS, with 30% fewer unplanned admissions in our
acute trust.</hs_Para>

the things that we instinctively and intuitively know—that if
people get good advice, the help and support they need and
opportunities to play their part in society, they can live independent
lives at home. The Government can be proud of much of what they are

supporting the Government’s efforts to make this a proud country

the hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) and my hon. Friend the

heard, carers play a vital role, not just for their family members and
friends but for the country. In the past decade, the number of carers
has grown from just under 5 million to nearer 7 million. By 2037, it is
estimated that the number will have increased to nearly 9 million. In
my constituency, there are 11,076 unpaid carers, nearly a quarter of
whom provide care for more than 50 hours a week. As has been said, we
know that this is an underestimate of the actual number who provide
care. My hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South talked
about the lack of information and advice, which has certainly been
identified in my constituency. Age UK in Oldham recently opened an
information and advice centre, and I hope that people will avail
themselves of that. Like other Members, I, too, have had the plight of
carers increasingly brought to my attention in my surgeries. Their
situation is a growing problem.</hs_Para>

today’s terms, the role played by carers saves the economy
£119 billion a year. That is more than the total NHS budget and
nearly six times the adult social care budget. The country could not
survive without the work that carers do, and that is even more so
today, with the crisis that social care is facing. We are facing the
double whammy of an ageing society—it is great that we are, on
the whole, living longer, although austerity 
<?notus-xml column=1095?>is certainly having an impact on life expectancy—and a meltdown
in social care in local authorities, with cuts to their budgets having
an impact on social care budgets. Unfortunately, carers are picking up
the tab. A recent Carers UK survey showed that a third of those caring
for more than 35 hours a week have no support at all. Although 3
million carers juggle work with caring responsibilities, one in five
has been forced to give up
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000454" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000454">In
addition to the lack of support for caring, carers across the UK are
starting to see the impact of the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Changes to
financial support with housing and council tax in some areas mean that
many families are experiencing reduced financial support from more than
one of the changes. The discretionary funding set aside by councils to
support people affected by the bedroom tax is enough to help only one
in 10 disabled people. Carers who require an additional room
because they cannot share with partners who sleep in hospital beds, or
parents of disabled children who need the space for care workers to
provide overnight care are being seriously let down. More than 5,000
families with care needs are faced with either moving or finding an
extra £700 a year.</hs_Para>

cumulative effects of the economic downturn, a squeeze on wages and the
increasing costs of essentials such as food and fuel, along with the
cuts in social security support, are making it more difficult for
carers to manage. More than four in 10 carers in the Carers UK survey
said they had been in debt as a result of caring. This year will see
other changes to the benefits system, as the transfer of disability
living allowance to the personal independence payment and the universal
credit are introduced, which is also of considerable concern to many
carers. DLA was the gatekeeper to carer’s allowance. The changes
mean that 10,000 fewer carers will not be entitled to carer’s
allowance. Many of us have already called on the Government to review
these changes and undertake a cumulative impact assessment of the
effects of these welfare reforms. For many, they will be the tipping
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000456" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000456">In
addition to that, and as a consequence of debt and a lack of support,
there are significant effects on the health of carers. Eight out of 10
carers report that their caring role affects their physical health and
nine out of 10 say that their mental health has suffered. This is not
only a human tragedy; we are storing up problems for the future by not
caring for our
carers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000457" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000457">I
know about that from my personal experience of caring for my
mum—I have spoken about her before—who died of
Alzheimer’s last September. She had Alzheimer’s for 10
years, and for the last three years was unable to communicate or to
feed or toilet herself. Although my mum lived in the States, I provided
respite care during leave, so I can personally attest to the physical
and emotional toll that it had on me. In the last few months of her
life she was bedridden. I am little, but I am fairly fit and strong,
yet physically trying to lift her to bathe her or change her
continence pads was something I found really difficult to manage. The
worst thing was the emotional toll, however, as I worried
how everyone was coping.</hs_Para>

want to spend the last few minutes talking about young carers. One of
the last research projects I worked on before I was elected to this
place concerned the effect 
<?notus-xml column=1096?>on young carers’ health of their caring role. Many people will be
surprised to learn that, according to recent census figures,
there are more than 178,000 young carers in England and Wales. Those
are the official figures, but we know that they are an underestimate.
Children as young as five are looking after family members who are
physically or mentally ill or disabled, their roles ranging from doing
household chores to providing nursing or personal care.</hs_Para>

effects on those children and young people are immense and
lifelong. Because of their caring responsibilities, nearly a quarter of
young carers often miss school or have educational difficulties. Young
carers are also more likely to grow up in poverty, to be socially
excluded, to have low aspirations and achievement and to have
relationship issues. Those problems can follow them throughout their
lives. There is also evidence of significant effects on their physical
and mental health, with anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues
being particularly prevalent. It has been shown that, after a year of
caring, morbidities fail to return to pre-caring
levels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:01:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000460">Services
do not always respect young carers and the role that they play. My
research indicated that many young people felt excluded from
discussions about their family member’s care, even though they
were providing much of it. Some of the responses to questions on
whether the young carers should be allowed to see their parents in
hospital, for example, were quite heartbreaking.
Similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:01:31"></hs_TimeCode>, many
young carers felt that there was a lack of understanding and support
from their teachers and schools. I echo what my hon. Friend the Member

however, that one of the schools involved came back to the project and

do not have any. Is my hon. Friend worried about that as

tell us when we can expect to have the amendments included in the
Children and Families
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:02:50"></hs_TimeCode>? The rights
of parent carers of disabled children are also still in limbo, and the
Government must bring forward changes to the Bill to ensure that the
rights of that group of carers are not left behind. I recognise the
Government’s commitment to carers’ rights, but I
reiterate my earlier remarks: no matter how much we legislate for
assessing carers’ needs, it is meaningless without the means to
implement it. Local authority budgets have been pared to the bone, and
that is having an impact on social care budgets. How are we going to
deliver those assessments? A further £800 million of cuts are
planned for this year alone. I would be grateful if the Minister would
address that point as well.</hs_Para>

exploited—effectively paid below the minimum wage and given
little or no training. Care workers are among the most poorly paid
workers in the country; most are on the minimum wage, and there has
been an increase in the number of zero-hours contracts. More than half

opportunity to take part in this important debate, which affects so
many of our constituents around the country. I add my appreciation and
congratulate the Members who requested the Backbench Business Committee
to provide time for this debate, and indeed the Backbench Business
Committee itself on recognising the significance of this issue. This
debate is timely because many Bills and other measures either before
the House or to be debated over the coming weeks and months will have a
huge impact on carers.</hs_Para>

dealing with that, I want to speak about why this issue is so important
to many of my constituents. There are 14,980 carers in Corby
and East Northamptonshire —a rise of 23% over the last 10 years,
which is higher than the 11% rise nationally. There are nearly 3,500
carers in Corby and East Northamptonshire who care for more than 50
hours a week—a rise of 40% over the last 10 years, which is far
higher again than the national average increase of 25%. Of those nearly
15,000 carers in my constituency, more than 8,000 are juggling work and
caring, which presents many issues.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:13:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) in deploring
the fact that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is not
prepared to set a good standard in this place, where Members are not
allowed to grant their staff compassionate leave. I think we should be
an exemplar in this and should work together across the House to urge
IPSA to change its practice.</hs_Para>

not be touched by that. They will find that they are not able to
continue working and caring.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:14:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie) referred to the amount of the
carer’s allowance. It does not compare well with
jobseeker’s allowance, for example. We should have an aspiration
to improve it. In recognising the significant number of people involved
and the huge cost implications of trying to increase the support for
carers out there, we must also recognise that the carer’s
allowance provides a very small amount for our constituents to live on.
The financial challenges, as other Members have said, are getting much
tougher at the

attended various events during national carers week, including the
event here in Parliament. I want to congratulate all the organisations
that came together to 
<?notus-xml column=1100?>organise national carers week. I met people from the Multiple Sclerosis
Society, Marie Curie and other organisations, who told me about their
experiences. I think they were absolutely right to bring carers
themselves to talk to us here in Parliament about their experiences.
They reflected many of the conversations I have had with my own
constituents. I met a carer who cares for his wife who has MS and a
former carer who cared for her husband who had cancer. They both asked
me to champion raising the carer’s allowance. That is what I
want to do today.</hs_Para>

UK’s analysis of the recent census shows that the
fastest-growing group of carers are people over 65 with
caring responsibilities. There has again been a much more significant
rise in those numbers in my constituency than nationally, with a 35%
rise of older carers nationally compared with a 62% rise in Corby and
East Northamptonshire. I am determined to engage with local
organisations—including charitable and voluntary organisations
that work with carers, but also local authority and local health
bodies—to try to understand why the rise is so significant in my
constituency, the extent to which those bodies have been able to
respond to it and whether that trend will continue.</hs_Para>

over 65 who receive the state pension are, as hon. Members have said,
unable to receive carer’s allowance—despite the fact that
they still face additional costs as a result of caring and have often
lost earnings from retiring early to care. What plans do the Government
have to provide more practical and financial support to people who
spend their retirement caring for their partners, adult disabled
children or their own older parents? My own parents are approaching
retirement and they, like many people nowadays, find themselves part of
what is called the sandwich generation. They not only help me to bring
up my children, providing lots of extra help and support for child
care, but increasingly find that they are taking on a care and support
role for their parents. That matter should concern all of us. It is
particularly important in the context of our full knowledge that we
have an ageing population, which will present a growing challenge for
us.</hs_Para>

about her experience. Her particular concern was about the impact of
the bedroom tax, but she also told me how her life of caring for her
husband had come to an end as he sadly passed away. She told me how
unsupported she felt in the months afterwards, as some of the help and
support she had hoped for—previously in place in part because of
her caring responsibility—was taken away from her. She then
found she had to contend with the bedroom tax on her large family

have personal experience, in that my granddad cared for my nan for many
years. He died on the day after Boxing Day, 18 months ago. He undertook
those caring responsibilities without any help or support—which,
of course, saved the taxpayer a huge amount of money—and he
undertook them willingly because he loved my nan hugely and they had
spent their whole lives together, but by the end of his life his own
health had suffered greatly because of the extra responsibility that he
had taken on as a carer. He would have been happy to continue that
responsibility, but an intervention should have been made earlier to
provide him with at least some additional help and support.</hs_Para>

worse was that after granddad died, we tried to arrange care and
support for my nan, but for a long time were unable to do so. Then,
late last year, I walked up her garden path to find that she was not
sitting in her usual chair. I tapped gently on the window, as I always
do, in order not to alarm her, and saw that she was lying on the floor.
Fortunately there was a key in a safe and I was able to get into the
house, where I called 999. My nan was unconscious for four days, and
only after that were we able to obtain the care and support
package that she needed. It should not take a stroke to secure a decent
package of help and support, it should not take such a long time, and
it should not be at the huge cost of the health of a partner, children

Committee that considered the Children and Families Bill. We pressed
the points about young carers, and we were given some assurances.
We received the same assurances on Third Reading, but

amount, but I fear that, unless we see those amendments soon, they will
have no real opportunity to contribute to the shaping of measures to

something about social care funding, but I must be briefer than I
intended to be, so that other Members can speak. I should like the
Government to think about the fact that the Dilnot cap does not cover

possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000497" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000497">As
for the Welfare Reform Act 2012, the carers to whom I have spoken

However, there is serious concern about other aspects of the Act.
Following the introduction of personal independence payments, 600,000
fewer disabled people will be entitled to support—600,000 people
whom I think we should be trying to help. Moreover, 10,000 fewer carers

the debate on the Queen’s Speech, I referred to the experiences
of two carers in my constituency. One was Lynne Hanslow, who cares for
her 96-year-old father, keeping him out of residential care. All that
she asks for is a fortnight’s respite break each year, but this
year, despite having given the council four months’ notice, she
was denied that break and was abused by a local authority employee when
she complained about her treatment. Not surprisingly, Ms Hanslow ended
up having to go to her GP. A carer had been made ill by neglect and
worry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000504" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000504">I
have spoken to the council’s director of adult services, but so
far Ms Hanslow has not received the full apology that she deserves,
along with a promise that that will not happen again. I believe that
the council’s chief executive should make the apology, thus
sending the signal that he means to take the needs of carers seriously
and will not stand for his staff treating them with contempt.
Ms Hanslow’s experience is one of the reasons for my
conclusion that statutory respite care should become a legal,
enforceable right for carers. We have tried the other approaches for
too
long.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000505" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000505">I
also mentioned the case of Margaret McGarry. She cares for her frail
elderly mother, who suffers from dementia. Her direct payments have
been suspended, apparently in retaliation for her having had the
temerity to go to a solicitor because she felt that the local authority
was being unreasonable in terms of the flawed level of support that it
was prepared to provide. There should be a much simpler independent
review process for carers like Margaret McGarry who are treated in such
an appalling way. The current system seems almost to be weighted in
favour of officials and bureaucrats, at the expense of carers. I wonder
whether the time has come for local authorities to create carers
champions to look out for carers’ interests. I have come to the
conclusion that local authority complaints procedures in much of the
NHS these days are not about problem solving at all. They are about
process. They are almost a game to create an illusion of

need to do more to understand and get to grips with. Our care system

<?notus-xml column=1106?>support family members provide for their loved ones; as many Members
have said, their financial contribution is estimated at more than
£100 billion every single year. Despite that, all too often,

last Government made important progress in improving support for
carers. We introduced new rights for carers, including the right, for
the first time, to request flexible working. We improved information
and advice, and had training programmes for carers such as the expert
carers programme, the benefits of which I have seen in my own
constituency through the brilliant work of CLASP, the carers centre in
Leicester. We funded breaks for carers. Many Members have spoken
powerfully about how important breaks are. If carers who are caring for
many hours a week have a bit of a break in sight, it really helps them
to carry on. We also introduced financial incentives for GP surgeries
to identify carers and refer them to local councils for support. That
was part of the quality and outcomes framework, which was introduced as
part of the 2004 GP contract, and was the very first step in providing
a specific financial incentive for GPs to identify carers.</hs_Para>

all Members have said, far, far more needs to be done. Like many
Members, I have seen in my constituency and within my own family the
often desperate daily struggle that is still faced by too many people

dementia—sometimes all three. I pay tribute to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams), who
powerfully explained her own experience of the physical and emotional
demands of caring for a loved one. As she said, there are the physical
demands of helping someone to get up in the mornings. Carers can be
exhausted from getting up two, three or four times in the night to help
someone go to the toilet, and from helping them move around the home.
There are also the emotional demands. When a carer sees the person they
fell in love with become frail and perhaps lose some of their pride and
strength, it is terribly upsetting. If a son or daughter sees the
parent who brought them up and taught them about the world—for
good or for ill—begin to fade as a result of dementia, and they
begin to feel as if they themselves are becoming the parent, it changes
something essential in the nature of that relationship. I have always
believed that relationships are essentially what make us human. If
someone has dementia and begins to forget the relationships they have,
it takes something away from the carer, as well. Caring for a loved one
is physically and emotionally demanding. Many Members have talked about
the role of public services. Health professionals are taught to
understand physical and mental illness, but not necessarily the wider
emotional and social
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000525" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000525">I
want to talk about three critical areas where we need to make progress,
the first of which is identifying carers. If we do not know who they
are, we will not get them the help and support they need. The second is
ensuring they get the right information, advice and support from the
NHS as well as social care. The third is helping carers to stay in
employment, which many Members have talked about. That is particularly
important as we all live longer and need to work for longer. If the
public finances are to remain stable, we must do everything 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>we can to help people in that regard.

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:44:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) said that there is a great deal of
awareness of carers and of the use of that term, but lots of people
still do not realise they are a carer or think of themselves as such;
they are simply trying to be a good daughter, son, husband or wife.
Others do not ask for support because they worry that people will think
they cannot cope; there is a lot of associated guilt. We need to
identify these hidden
carers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000526" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000526">There
are many examples of good practice, but perhaps the best I have seen is
in Torbay, where the issue of identifying carers in GPs’
surgeries and hospitals has been closely examined. If someone who has
had a stroke comes in with a family member, it is recognised
that that family member is likely to be a carer. A great range of
support is provided. The approach taken in Torbay starts with the
person who may need health care; as a result, they immediately talk
about their family
member.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000527">I
want to offer some practical suggestions to the Minister on how to make
further progress. Will he consider amending the quality and outcomes
framework? At the moment, it provides a points incentive and a
financial incentive for GPs to refer carers to social care services;
but why not to other health services, if carers’ health needs
are so important? Secondly, will he give guidance on the best questions
used to indentify carers? When I recently registered with a new GP, the
leaflet provided asked, “Are you a carer?” I knew what
that meant because I am familiar with the policy debate, but most
people would wonder what that meant—paid carer, unpaid
carer?</hs_Para>

improving information and advice for carers. Carers UK says that a
third of those caring full time for an older disabled or seriously ill
friend or relative receive no practical support, and those who do often
find that services do not fit around their particular needs, especially
if they are struggling to hold down a job. As many Members have said,
these services still too often end up offering last-minute help and
support, when families have already reached crisis point. I pay tribute

Before she got any support, a crisis point had already been reached.
That 
<?notus-xml column=1108?>was no good for her, and it is no good for taxpayers. More than one in
five carers who have been admitted to hospital as an emergency case in
the last three years say that it could have been prevented, had they
been helped to look after their own health, or been given a break from
caring or other forms of support. Given that money is so tight across
the NHS and council care services, we have to get those up-front
preventive services and support in place.</hs_Para>

another practical suggestion for the Minister. As he knows, there is a
brilliant national GP patient survey, run by Ipsos MORI, which provides
detailed information about the needs of patients registered at a
surgery. The last time I looked through it, I do not think there were
any questions about whether the respondent was a family carer. It was
about the needs of the individual patients, not carers. Such a question
would provide us with some brilliant data that could be given back to

carers being forced to give up work or reduce their hours because the

strongly urge the Minister to talk to his colleagues in the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills about how the Government can do
more to promote flexible working among family carers. We have made
great progress in arguing that child care is part of our economic

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:55:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Leicester West (Liz Kendall), for her thoughtful speech, much of
which I agreed with. This has been a thoughtful debate in which many
good points have been made and I thank Members for raising this very
important issue. Many Members who have taken part in the debate have
been long-standing advocates for carers and I welcome their interest
and commitment. I completely understand why various Members constantly
pursue issues such as those to do with young carers and will not accept
my determination to help with that problem until it is dealt with. I
accept that that is their role and it 
<?notus-xml column=1110?>is their right to do so.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:56:40"></hs_TimeCode>The debate has

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:56:38"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

that made by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:57:06"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds), focused on
the difficult financial circumstances for local government, the impact
of welfare reforms and so on. We could have a partisan battle about the
issues, condemning the Government and so on. However, the shadow
Minister recognised at the start of her speech the scale of the
challenge we face, not just today but in the future. The numbers of
people growing older with care needs, often with multiple conditions
and a mix of mental and physical health needs, just keep growing. If we
are all honest, both in this Chamber and with the public outside, we
must admit that any Government of any political persuasion would face
this challenge.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000544">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:59:28"></hs_TimeCode>
is no easy solution. We cannot just find a magic pot of money to throw
at the problem. There is an obligation on us all, as the shadow
Minister made clear, to find ways of using the money we have available
much more effectively than we do. We know that there is massive waste
in the system because of the care silos—between health and
social care, between mental and physical health and between general
practice and secondary care. There is an absolute obligation on us all
to engage in a debate about using money more effectively to achieve
better care and support for people and to ensure that the system
remains sustainable.

the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton) was, I think, really
valuable. Ultimately, we need collaboration among statutory services,
which should not abandon their responsibilities, the voluntary sector
and, crucially, people—that is, the community, families,
neighbours and friends. We need to unleash particularly the power of
the many people who have entered retirement fit and healthy and want to
give something back, but often do not know how to do so. An army of
people out there are able and willing to help to meet the enormous
challenges. Some of the schemes that

wish to join everyone else in this debate in paying tribute to the
extraordinary work that carers do, giving of themselves; it is
self-sacrifice, and they get no plaudits from anywhere else. They are
just committing to helping someone they love, often doing so in
challenging and troubling circumstances, particularly where dementia is
concerned, as the loss of recognition can be very distressing for a
loved one. We also know that many carers are themselves frail,
struggling to cope on their own.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:00:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) mentioned the challenges in
rural areas. My constituency of North Norfolk contains many elderly
people who are often living in isolated
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:00:57"></hs_TimeCode> and
are struggling to get access to the services they need. We owe an
enormous debt of gratitude to the work of every carer 
<?notus-xml column=1111?>in our community. As we have identified in this debate, without carers
the cost to the public purse would be
enormous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:01:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000547" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0002.htm#13062055000547">I
therefore very much welcome this debate, coming, as it does,
immediately after carers week. It gives us the opportunity to discuss
how carers of all ages can be properly supported in their role and
helped to have a better quality of life. That is what we should be
focusing on: putting quality of life and well-being at the heart of the
Care Bill. We should not be thinking about what service we deliver to
passive recipients; we should always be thinking, “How do we
make your life better? How do we make you happier in your life? What
might you, as an older person, be able to offer to other
people?” It should be about that, rather than about these people
sensing that they have nothing more to offer and just facing dependency
as they move towards the end of their life in a rather distressing
way.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:02:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

principles to inform that work and discussion over the summer are,
first, that the starting point should be assessing the needs of the
adult or child who needs care and then seeing what remaining needs for
support a young carer in the family has. The presence of a young carer
should trigger either an assessment or the offer of an assessment to
the person needing care. Secondly, a whole-family assessment is key
when assessing an adult needing care where children in the family are
providing care to the adult or undertaking wider family
responsibilities. The adult’s assessment and eligibility for
support should take into account their parenting responsibilities and
the functioning of the family. Thirdly, assessments should establish
why a child is caring and how to prevent—this is the crucial
point—excessive or inappropriate caring responsibilities which
could have an adverse impact on their education, social activities,
emotional development or health. As much as possible we ought to be
enabling a youngster to grow up like any other youngster can, without
having inappropriate burdens on them that impact on their education and

when I said that we need to be much smarter about how we use the money
available. One of the things we need to do—I think there is a
degree of agreement here—is integrate health and care. It is a
crazy silo situation that we face. We are not using the money
effectively. We could achieve much better support if we combined the

last spending round provided local government with a challenging
settlement. That is why we decided to provide extra funding to help
local authorities maintain access to services. However, local
authorities ultimately have discretion over how they use their
resources. Improving care and support is not simply a case of more
money. Local authorities must look at how they can transform care
through innovation and new ways of working. As I said earlier,
collaboration with the voluntary sector is critical to this. Many local
authorities are successfully 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>integrating health and care services to improve quality, and we are

role of carers, but what we see from examples around the country, such

£400 million funding over four years for carers’ breaks.
It is deeply frustrating that that has not been used as intended in all
parts of the country. There are some areas, including Surrey and many
others, which have done good, innovative things as a result of that.
The Department asked the policy research unit in economic evaluation in
health and care intervention to conduct a survey of a number of PCTs to
gain their views on the benefits of NHS support for carers’
breaks. The findings will be published shortly and will help inform our

declare a family interest in the railways. My grandfather was a
railwayman and I am sure he would be delighted to see me here today
speaking up for the railways. Of course, he was a railwayman in the
pre-British Rail days, let alone the post-British Rail days. In
fact—this will probably give away my age—he was working
on the railways in the first world war in what was then a reserved
occupation. He recalled being approached occasionally by people with
white feathers because he was not fighting. He worked in the railways
after the war when it became British Rail, and as a long-term
railwayman he would have been proud to see British Rail and to see that
the railways are still such an important element in our transport
system. At various times in the past 50 or 60 years there have been
suggestions that railways were the past and we would move beyond
railways, but here in the 21st century it is true to say that railways
are back as a hugely important part of our future, not just of our
nostalgic past. It is therefore particularly important that we get it

other interest that I have to declare is as a frequent traveller on the
east coast main line, spending nearly 10 hours a week travelling on
that line when Parliament is sitting. Since I started that regular
commute, I have been extremely impressed with the service provided by
the current operator. That is not to say that it is perfect. I do not
think any provider would have been able to tackle, for instance, the
day that the line was completely flooded north of Newcastle, when I
ended up having to spend the night in Newcastle. I do not believe that
even a private operator could have held back the waves of water that
fell on the Newcastle area that night, and I know that several Members

was perplexed when, following the fiasco of the west coast main line

to be done at the expense of giving extensions to two other
long-distance operators—Virgin on the west coast and First on
Great Western—because the investigation into the franchising
fiasco suggested that not more than one main line franchise should be
dealt with at one time. Even on that basis, though, why the east coast

previous debate,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:27:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Middlesbrough pointed out that whereas private operators
are obliged to pay dividends, public operators can reinvest all their
profits back into the service, which in East Coast’s case has
amounted to more £40 million since 2009. One of the criticisms
that has been made in the past and might still be levelled now at a
public operator is that, because the dead hand of bureaucracy lies on
it, such an operator cannot be as efficient and as fleet of foot as a
private sector operator, but it is true to say that East Coast is
organisationally distinct from the Department for Transport. It is
staffed by railway professionals and is therefore able to take the best
of a private sector company in terms of efficiency, innovation and
entrepreneurialism, but because it is in 
<?notus-xml column=1118?>the public sector, any profits it makes are available to the Treasury
and all of us as citizens of this country and

am concerned that talking down East Coast to justify the proposed
refranchising will damage morale at the company. That is most unfair,
because staff and management have worked extremely hard and achieved
good results, with 1 million extra passengers carried in 2012 compared
with 2009 and record passenger satisfaction. I hope that, when he
responds to the debate, the Minister will correct his remarks on
punctuality and premium payments; acknowledge that East Coast reinvests
all its profits and can emulate private sector efficiency; and
congratulate staff and management on East Coast’s success. I
think that that will be an important message to send back to the work
force.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000594"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:29:17"></hs_TimeCode>Given

East Coast, the current operator of the west coast main line, Virgin,
will be offered a total of four and half years of extensions up to

the west coast main line and the Great Western line are also important

largest conurbations in Britain, and Great Western serves Bristol,
Cardiff and the prosperous Thames valley, so the claim that the
Government have decided to prioritise the east coast main line because

also leaves the Government in a weak bargaining position with the

debate gives us an opportunity to look specifically at the major
infrastructure challenges facing the east coast main line. I will focus
not on a sterile argument about private being bad and public being
good, but on the challenges and opportunities we face in looking at
public policy on that line. In the past 10 years we have seen a 43%
rise in passenger demand. By 2031 there will be a capacity gap of 1,500
seats in the busiest morning hour on suburban services into
King’s Cross. Indeed, journeys from Peterborough and Cambridge
are expected to rise by as much as 20% by 2016. I think it is fair to
say that, irrespective of our party or our views on the
debate about rail privatisation, we all have a common interest, on
behalf of our constituents who commute, whether from Scotland,
Yorkshire or Cambridgeshire, in safer, cleaner and more punctual trains
and in value for
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000611">It
would be unfair and churlish not to concede the progress we have seen
in Peterborough. New work has begun and is due to be completed next
year. We have three new platforms and platform extensions for the new
Thameslink trains and the new inter-city trains. We have a new island
platform and a new freight loop. The station has been remodelled over
the past few years, and we have 150 new, safe and secure cycle racks to
help to develop Peterborough as a local transport infrastructure
hub.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000612" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000612">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:39:52"></hs_TimeCode>
is vital that I make the point that Peterborough is dependent on the
railway. Indeed, it is integral to the financial and economic viability
of my constituency, given that it is 47 minutes away from central
London and King’s
Cross<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I was

2009—£187 million in the last financial year. The staff
on East Coast trains at Peterborough do a superb job and I know many of
them. They are hard-working, decent people with a public sector ethos
and a commitment to doing a very good job. I am very proud that we have
people who do that, even when the things that go wrong are not their

Labour party has to bear some responsibility for the series of events
that culminated in the current situation. As in so many areas, this
Government are having to tackle that legacy. The Labour Government
should have been more flexible with Sea Containers and Great North
Eastern Railway, which was a very popular provider: it had good staff,
good management and was well liked. Obviously, it was
undermined—this was out of its control—by the parlous
financial situation of Sea Containers, but the previous Labour
Government was pretty inflexible and allowed National Express to
overbid hugely and deliver a poor level of service. I think that the
National Express management team is pretty hopeless. In fairness, the
Labour Government did not have much chance or choice to do anything

will finish my remarks by talking a little about competition and open
access. I welcome the consultation paper that was published this month,
“On-rail competition: Consultation on options for change in open
access”. Open access is an important issue that we need to look
at. The east coast main line is a good example of open access. It has
brought significant benefits to parts of the network. Only a small part
of the passenger rail network is open to competitive pressures. On the
east coast main line, two non-subsidised open access operators, Grand
Central Trains and First Hull Trains, compete with the franchiser. They
have shown that competition leads to more journeys, higher revenues for
the train companies, lower fares, and more and happier
passengers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:51:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000636" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000636">The
Centre for Policy Studies publication in March showed that passenger
journeys increased by 42% at stations that enjoy rail competition,
compared with 27% at those without it; that revenue increased by 57% at
those with competition, against 48% at those without it; and that
average fares increased by only 11% at stations with competition,
compared with 17% at stations without it. So the franchise holder faces
competition and still pays an increased premium to the Government, as
East Coast has done. Open access competition has led to more routes and
more high-speed access to new locations, including in
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000637" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000637">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>

conclusion, 20 years on from the Railways Act 1993, I
believe that privatisation has been a success. Labour will not reverse
it in government if it wins the next general election. The review of

more competition, more investment in our railways, more choice, and
greater value for money and efficiency for our constituents. Ministers

Ronnie Campbell</B> (Blyth Valley) (Lab):</Member> I understand there
was a good debate in Westminster Hall—it is a pity I missed it.
I had to be away, but I am here today, and if the Minister cannot
understand Geordie I will try to speak in plain English—he does
not seem to be listening to anybody on the Geordie side
anyway<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:54:33"></hs_TimeCode>. I will
be very slow so that he can understand exactly what I am
saying.</hs_Para>

long time in the
House—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:54:41"></hs_TimeCode>
Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson) made some valid points at the
beginning of his contribution, but he got a bit sluggish. I want to get
to the bones of the issue. I will not go on, because I know other
Members want to speak, but we must get to the bones of this, and we
have to know why.</hs_Para>

we look back, Great North Eastern Railway was a good firm; it tried but
got unstuck with that container thing and there was a bit of a mess,
but in all fairness it walked away, threw the keys on the line and
another private company went off the rails with the north east rail
link. Then we had National Express, which was hopeless. It should have
stuck with what it is good at, although I do not think it is very good
at driving buses either. It came in and made a right mess of
things.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000642">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:55:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:55:50"></hs_TimeCode>
we have to do—I do not know whether the Minister knows this, but
we do—is talk to the workers on the trains. They will say which
the bad company was: National Express. The workers are happy now. Last
week they told me that they are happy with the not-for-profit system. I
will not say nationalisation—I wouldn’t dare!—it
is a not-for-profit company. They are happy. I said,
“Don’t say that. If the Minister hears you’re
happy, that’ll be the excuse he wants to privatise it. You canna
have workers being happy, can we? Even the management is happy, and we
canna have them being happy neither.” So I told the workers not
to say they were happy too regularly, as that will be an excuse for the
Tories to do it in—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> The
Minister may laugh, but let us put the facts down. National Express
lost the taxpayer £55 million. I am not sure of the figure for
GNER, but I am sure it was some—I do not know what it was, but
it was taxpayers’ money.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000643"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:56:51"></hs_TimeCode>Week
after week I hear the Tories come to the Dispatch Box and start talking
about how they are the custodians of the taxpayer. “We believe
in the taxpayer. We are 
<?notus-xml column=1125?>here to save them money.” Well, I have to laugh. We now have a
not-for-profit company that has made the taxpayer £600 million
in four years and invested £40 million in itself.
What is wrong with making a profit and putting it back into the
Treasury coffers for the taxpayer? The Government are the custodians of
the taxpayer and are saving them money by cutting welfare, hospitals,
legal aid and everything else—that is what they tell everybody
in the newspapers and on television. The Government are saving the
taxpayer. There are also the tax alliance people, the hidden people,
who I think are backed by the Tories—the tax alliance party, or
whatever it is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:58:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
[<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “The TaxPayers
Alliance”] The TaxPayers Alliance. I have not heard a squeak out
of it yet. I have never heard it say, “Oh wait a minute. The
taxpayer is getting money back, and the Treasury fund this company.
This must be good for taxpayers.” No, it is keeping very quiet.
I wonder why.</hs_Para>

second point is about why we want to privatise a not-for-profit company
that is doing very well. I have an idea—actually, I have a few
ideas. My mind works in funny ways. I know the Tory party slush bucket
is going around somewhere and I wonder who is contributing to it. I
would like to try to find out, get my sniffer dogs on it and look to
see who is putting into the Tory slush bucket. We will find out later,
when the names come out, who will get the
franchise—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Well, I will put
my money on now, and I bet it is Goody Two-Shoes. I bet he gets the

Campbell:</Member></B> He’s Branson, that’s who.
He’ll be the man who puts the money in the slush bucket, and
he’ll be the man who the Tories get to run north-east rail. That
is a fact, and I hope that people will remember what I have
said.</hs_Para>

I have said before, the company has contributed £600 million to
the taxpayer, to the Treasury. Its subsidy from the taxpayer was 1% for
various items and things it did on the east coast main line, as against
the west coast main line, which gets a subsidy of 37%. Hon. Members can
see the difference, and perhaps they can see why Branson might have an
eye on the east coast main line, because although he made a mess of the
west coast main line, the Tories made a mess of the franchise for him,
so they had to give it to him again. He will have his eye on this
company and he will want to run it to get that money.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000648" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000648"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:00:28"></hs_TimeCode>When
something is privatised, the money has got to go somewhere. The company
makes money. It has shown how to run a rail link, and it has shown
companies how to do it, and I am sure Branson knows that, and he will
be saying, “Ooh, there’s £600,000. My shareholders
are going to be very happy. Instead of that money going to the
Treasury, it could go to the shareholders in business.” I can
see how he is thinking and I can see how the Tories are thinking. They
are saying, “Hey, we’ve got a company here making money
for the taxpayer. It should be the shareholders getting the dividends
and the managers getting massive bonuses.” I can see them coming
in with their massive bonuses and the money just draining away, and
they’ll most probably throw the keys on the line again and say,
“Sorry, we’ve made a mess of this. We took too much money
out. You’ll have to get the taxpayer to bail it out again, with
another not-for-profit 
<?notus-xml column=1126?>company.” I expect that to happen in a few years. I’ll
most probably not be here, but never mind—I’ll be
watching from my granddad

Minister has got to be listening carefully to what the people are
saying. This is important. We hear what they are saying, and they are
saying they want the company to remain as it is. They are satisfied
with the line. I travel on it every week, like most other Members from
the north-east of England and Scotland, and it is a very good line. It
is always on time. Very rarely, there will be a couple of minutes here,
a couple of minutes there, and of course sometimes something happens on
the line, as happens on all rail lines—a tree might fall down or
a line might go down. It happens from time to time. Those things cannot
be helped. But what is more important is that the workers are very
happy, the company is doing well and contributing, and I think it is an
absolute disgrace if we give this back to the private entrepreneurs,
who, let’s face it, made a mess of it in the first
place.</hs_Para>

Jones</B> (Harrogate and Knaresborough) (Con):</Member> A couple of
weeks ago at Transport Question Time I asked about the timetable for
the re-letting of the franchise, and I received a clear, extremely
positive answer. I was told it would not be long before the franchise
was let again.</hs_Para>

want to talk about two areas: public—or not
public—ownership, and the franchise itself. Perhaps unusually
among my colleagues, I was against the privatisation of our railways,
not because I had a fond memory of British Rail. I used to catch the
train to school in Bradford every day, and it was not a pleasant
experience. Parts of British Rail were good, but parts of it were not,
and overall the customer experience was poor. I remember an advertising
campaign at the time saying, “We’re getting
there.” It was launched to general ridicule from the public, who
obviously knew better. It was not because I thought there was an
important principle between public and private ownership. Across the
world, we can see examples of successful railways in both public and
private ownership. I simply thought it would be hard to bring in
effective competition.</hs_Para>

it came to managing our railways, there was a sense that we were
managing decline, and in many ways of course we were: customers were
choosing other modes of travel. I have checked the data on this. I am
sure the Minister will be aware, but I might take the opportunity to
remind him that when our railways were nationalised—I am talking
not about one year’s or one month’s comparison, but about
decades of data—more than 1,200 million annual journeys were
made each year, and by the time of privatisation, that figure had
declined steadily, year on year, to 700 million. There were a series of
huge declines and the data were bad, however we look at them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000653"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>I
changed my mind about rail privatisation for two reasons, the first
being passenger growth. Again, it is slightly geeky, but I will remind
the Minister of the data. Since privatisation, passenger numbers have
gone from 700 million to 1,300 million-plus, which is a fantastic
change. Level of usage on the rail network is now comparable with that
in the 1920s. Privatisation saw a change of decades of usage, which was
a good thing. 
<?notus-xml column=1127?>I want to encourage more use of public transport, with more
freight off the roads. The second reason I changed my mind was personal
experience. While travelling around the country, I could see a steady
change of attitude in the businesses towards being more focused on
their customers—improving customer experience and developing new
services and timetables. The customer became more central to the
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:05:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000654" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000654">I

question is not whether the line should be in private or public

direct London to Harrogate service for 30 years. I remind the House
that this service was removed under nationalisation, alongside the
downgrading of services for Hull, Bradford, Cleethorpes and Teesside.

the operator has responded and I am quite happy to reflect that. I just
think that more can be done and the hon. Gentleman’s comment
does not really address why our railways saw such a dramatic turnaround
after privatisation. Opposition Members have had no comments whatever
to make about how we have had decades and decades of decline in
passenger numbers. Privatisation occurred and the situation changed
utterly. I am sure the Minister has noticed that no Opposition Member
has said a word about the change in passenger numbers from the

would like to see the new franchise introduce more services for

Flexibility will need to be built in so that we can allow the operator,
whoever wins the franchise, to respond to demand. I hope there will be
new rolling stock, as some of the trains on the service are from the
1970s, and line investment. It is worth noting that new rolling stock
and line investment would change the cost base of the franchise, and
start to change some of the numbers that Opposition Members have been
keen to quote this

Bayley</B> (York Central) (Lab):</Member> Let me start by saying
something that I think everybody in the Chamber will agree with. The
east coast main line is an absolutely vital economic artery, pumping
the lifeblood of our economy—jobs, investment and
growth—through all the regions and cities that it serves from
London to Edinburgh. That is why this debate is so important. It is not
a technical or ideological debate about how the service should be run;
it is a debate about how the railways can assist economic recovery in
our regions. That is the question we need to debate today.</hs_Para>

had a similar debate in Westminster Hall two weeks ago, in which many
hon. Members spoke. I have some sympathy for the Minister: he was left
with absolutely no time to respond to the many questions that were
asked. However, we have more time today. To recap briefly, I would like
to pose two questions that I posed a fortnight ago to which the
Minister was unable to respond.</hs_Para>

if the Government go ahead with refranchising, will the headquarters of
the new service be based in York? The headquarters currently provide
over 200 jobs, but they act as a sheet anchor for thousands
of other jobs with railway engineering companies, suppliers and for
Network Rail’s operation of the east coast main line, which
employs more people than the train operating company. The Government
are legally able to make that a condition of the franchise and there is
a precedent. When the train operating company last changed hands, I
asked my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:10:52"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan), the then Minister,

good performance that East Coast has achieved is all the more

to 15-year franchise that the comparator company on the west coast has.
In fact, East Coast has not really known from one month to the next
where it stands or whether it will continue to run the service or not.
Last year, the Department for Transport asked the chief executive of
East Coast, Karen Boswell, to prepare a five-year plan for the future
of her company. She submitted that plan in January this year. In March,
an interview with Karen Boswell by Roger Ford was published in
<I>Modern Railways</I>, in which she set out her plans, and there was
no hint of privatisation at that point. So what has
changed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:15:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000675">Franchising
is not a low-cost option. The National Audit Office report on the east
coast National Express failure estimated that that had cost the
Department for Transport between £330 million and £380
million. The Department had expected to receive that money from the
franchisee up to 2012 but had not done so. The funds then had to be
recovered from other Department for Transport budgets. The aborted west
coast main line franchising exercise cost the taxpayer £55
million. Alan Whitehouse, the former BBC transport correspondent, 
<?notus-xml column=1130?>estimates that each one of those bidding for a major franchise such as
these spends between £10 million and £13 million in
pursuit of its bid. Those costs ultimately come back to the passengers
in the form of higher fares.</hs_Para>

should continue to run the service, not indefinitely but for the period
of a full franchise, so that it could be an effective public sector
comparator. We have seen today in <I>The Northern Echo</I> that Lord
Adonis, who was Secretary of State in 2009 when East Coast was given
the job of rescuing the service, shares that view. It is of course
consistent with what he said in 2009, which was that the service should
be run by a public sector contractor, East Coast, but not indefinitely.
I am not arguing for an indefinite arrangement; I am asking for a
period equivalent to a private franchise so that we can compare like
with like. That is still my view.</hs_Para>

have been thinking about the matter further, however, and I put it to
the Minister that we already have a public sector comparator. By the
end of this financial year, East Coast will have run the service for
four years, returned about £800 million to the Treasury and
provided an improved service. If the Government are hellbent on
refranchising, will they commission an independent body—perhaps
the National Audit Office—to analyse the bids that they receive
and compare them with East Coast’s performance? If none of the
bidders that responds to the Minister’s tendering exercise can
produce a robust case to show that it can deliver a better and safer
service with lower fares and a bigger financial return to the
Government than East Coast is currently providing, he should keep the
service with East Coast.</hs_Para>

fragmentation, payments to rolling stock leasing companies and the
excess interest on Network Rail debt, paid for no other reason than to
keep it off the public balance sheet. The biggest problem of
franchising, which echoes through the McNulty report, the Brown report

DOR’s role to be is of no consequence. The question surely must
be not whether it was intended to run indefinitely, but whether it is
capable of doing so. The tremendous success of East Coast demonstrates
that it is. Total premium plus operating profit amounted to

failure, the Government are determined to press ahead regardless of the
interest of the travelling public. They would pursue the foolish policy
of privatisation, despite history repeatedly telling us that the
privatisation of railway lines and rail infrastructure is detrimental
to cost and service for the customer and to the Government because of
huge financial bail-outs.</hs_Para>

total. Surely even the Chancellor or the Finance Ministers whom I faced
on the Finance Bill Committee earlier this afternoon would want to see
those moneys returned to the Chancellor’s coffers. Even this

unfortunately, when it was first electrified I am afraid to say that it
was done on the cheap; it was not a good model of electrification in
the first instance. This Government, however, do not want to see that

was, to put it bluntly, badly managed, effectively bankrupt and
unwilling to try to fund urgent safety improvements as well as normal
running costs. Subsequently, as we know, the company was put into

fair and transparent, or even competent, tendering process in the
current rail industry? Let us not forget the west coast franchise, for
instance, which has cost the Government at least £50 million.
What a complete shambles—a shambles that has resulted in Virgin,
which lost to First Group in the tendering process, having to have its
contract extended until 2017. The whole model does not produce
competition; it produces a series of service monopolies on individual

can only reiterate the facts and figures that colleagues have given
this afternoon. Directly Operated Railways Ltd has paid back
£602 million to the Government in premium payments, which is
£232 million more than National Express paid back for the same
service and £320 million more than Virgin-Stagecoach has paid
back since 2009. The facts speak for themselves. Only 1.2% of East
Coast’s income is derived from public subsidy, compared with an
average of 32.1% for the private train operating companies. Since 2009,
East Coast has reinvested all of its £40 million profit into the
service, whereas Virgin, in operating the west coast main line since
1996, has paid nearly half a billion pounds in dividends to its
shareholders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062055000774" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000774">Like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:11:40"></hs_TimeCode>

East Coast. It should be praised for being at fault for so few delays.

constituency in the west of Scotland. Although I am sure some of his
constituents use the east coast service from time to time, he will not
have had my experience of regularly meeting constituents on the train
or at the station. If he had, he would know that his defence for
putting the east coast service back into private hands would not find
great favour among users of that line, because the service provided
since East Coast was brought in has been good. It has not always been
perfect, but customers and passengers are generally satisfied and, as
has been said, when there are problems—particularly
delays—they are mostly not down to factors over which East Coast
has, or is expected to have, any control.</hs_Para>

is pretty outrageous of the Minister, who is generally a fair person,
to use poor punctuality over some selected periods to justify putting
the east coast service back into private hands. Some of his colleagues
suggested that the private sector might be able to offer infrastructure
improvements or offers for long-term planning, but for the last few
years, East Coast has been operating the service, not on a day-to-day
basis but certainly not on a long-term basis with any security. Surely
we should now give East Coast the chance to see what it could come up
with if it were given long-term security similar to a franchise
period.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:18:34"></hs_TimeCode>Government
should approach the issue in a non-ideological way. As has been said in
this debate, East Coast provides a good return to the taxpayer, in
contrast to previous operators, and surely success should be rewarded,
not punished as the Government seem intent on doing. I would like the
service to be retained and continue to be operated by Directly Operated
Railways. That would be the simplest way forward. If the Government are
not prepared to do that, could they not allow Directly Operated
Railways to come forward with an 
<?notus-xml column=1145?>alternative bid and a proposal that could be put against whatever comes
in from private tenderers, to see who offers best value for the
Government and for passengers? Then we can judge who has the best offer
on the table. The Government should at least do that, if they are not
driven purely by an ideological bent, as they appear to
be.</hs_Para>

wonder whether the way the Government have timetabled the franchise
process—presumably partly to comply with the Brown review and
obviously in order to have the east coast main line back in private
hands before the 2015 election—will result in a fair bidding
process. I say that because with Virgin operating the west coast route
until April 2017 and providing a service that is popular with many
passengers, and with another branch of the Virgin empire operating
flights to Edinburgh and Aberdeen, competition issues would surely
arise if it was to bid for the east coast main line as well. It would
not leave many alternative bidders, certainly from within the UK. The
2015 date has clearly been driven by the date of the general election,
but I wonder whether the franchise process, instead of giving the
Government a successful policy to sell to the public, might not in fact
give them a huge headache just before May 2015. If that is the case, it
will serve them right.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:20:46"></hs_TimeCode>I say give DOR
on the east coast main line a chance at least to put forward an
alternative bid to show what it can do, to show what its management
team can do and to show what alternative offer can be put into the

want to raise a point that has not been raised so far, but which is
important to the future of the east coast main line and the franchise.
We will be having a separate debate next week on High Speed 2, which I
support—although I think it should be going all the way to
Scotland—but whichever option is adopted for the future of
high-speed rail in the UK, under the present plans the services
operating the high-speed system will reach points near Manchester, York
or Leeds, and will then be run on the existing rail network up to
north-east England and Scotland—along what are endearingly
called in the HS2 prospectus the “classic routes” to
Edinburgh and Glasgow.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:21:56"></hs_TimeCode>It is reasonable
to ask, therefore, how many more trains we can fit into the existing
east coast main line network north of York.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000787" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000787">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:22:08"></hs_TimeCode>
those reasons, we need to plan for the future services, network and
infrastructure on the east coast main line on a long-term, secure
basis. Let us not forget what has happened before with the franchising
process on that line. Twice the operator has been forced to give back
the service to the Department, and most recently DOR was forced to
operate the service at the last minute to ensure that the
public continued getting a good service, as indeed they have.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062055000788" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0003.htm#13062055000788">If DOR cannot
continue operating the east coast service, the
Government—whoever is in power in 2015—might find
themselves in a difficult situation. At the moment, if a privately
operated franchise collapses, DOR has the infrastructure, staffing and
structure to move in quickly and take over the service. If we take away
the DOR service on the east coast main line, we will take away a
valuable alternative operator and comparator for the rail network. That
is another reason why the Government should be rethinking this proposal
and approaching it on a non-ideological basis. They 
<?notus-xml column=1146?>need to consider what is best for the customer and passenger, and that
must surely be to allow the current East Coast service to continue,
rather than yet again to force it into private hands in the way
suggested.</hs_Para>

east coast main line is vital for the connectivity of my constituency.
As regular passengers, many of my constituents have an interest in the
future management of the line. I too am a frequent user of the route,
travelling between my constituency and Westminster, and I have
generally been pleased by the speed, punctuality and comfort of the
line and by the high standard of service and professionalism of its
staff since it took over from National Express in 2009. I am not alone
in thinking this. The most recent survey by the independent consumer
group Passenger Focus found that 92% of passengers were satisfied with
their experience with East Coast. To put that in perspective, that is
the highest level of customer satisfaction recorded on the
line since the surveys began in 1999, and 3% higher than the national
average for long-distance operators. Improved satisfaction tells only
some of the story. East Coast has increased its employee engagement,
meaning that most employees are in favour of continued public ownership
of the line. That should not be dismissed.</hs_Para>

million to the taxpayer and invested £40 million of its profits
back in the service. As the Office of Rail Regulation recently
confirmed, East Coast receives virtually no subsidy and yet made the
second highest premium payments of any operator in 2011-12. To put that

Coast is also performing a vital role as a public sector comparator,
especially as the Government seek to negotiate extensions with

shortly. East Coast delivers good value for money, benefiting taxpayers

instability and cost that resulted from the collapse of Sea Containers
and the decision of National Express to walk away from the franchise.
Against that backdrop, and taking into account ageing rolling stock and

Coast’s improvements to financial and operational performance

privatisation of the east coast main line—a service that has
quietly and successfully improved the quality of journeys; a
not-for-dividend operator that has delivered good value for money and
reinvested profits in the service, unlike the private

of the success of franchising comes from having both a private sector
that is willing and able to invest and manage risks and a
Government who have the ability to step in, in the short term, to
ensure the continued service of the railways in the event of a
franchise failure. While we do everything we can to avoid such failure,
we must be in a position to step in so that there is a continuation of
service if a franchisee were to get into trouble, as happened with
National Express on the east coast main line in 2009. That is the whole
purpose of DOR. It is not a company like other companies providing 
<?notus-xml column=1154?>franchise services within the rail network. It is there as a company of
last resort in an emergency to ensure continuity of service under the
Railways Acts. This should never be considered a long-term solution,
and it is not an alternative model to franchising. Many Members totally
misunderstood or did not get that point. This is fundamental: DOR is
not an alternative model to franchising. We firmly believe that the
private sector is best placed to deliver the best value for the
passenger and taxpayer, and DOR allows us to make that

Directly Operated Railways, as an interim measure and operator of last
resort, means it would not be right or practicable for it to plan
beyond the short term. In order to provide the stability and innovation
that is needed for any business, in particular a rail franchise that
serves the public, it is necessary to be able to plan well into the
future and make investment decisions that have a horizon beyond the
short term. To meet this need, the inter-city east coast franchise must
be transferred back to the private sector.</hs_Para>

Members have suggested that East Coast should be maintained in public
ownership for an extended period to provide a comparator or baseline
for future private sector operators on the franchise, or against
operators on other parts of the network. This approach does not work.
All franchises are different, and with changes to charges and funding
occurring every five years, they even differ from themselves over time.
Any attempt directly to compare one franchise with another, or even one
incumbent with another on the same franchise, ends up simply comparing
apples with pears. East Coast, a large inter-city franchise, is
obviously different from Essex Thameside, a franchise providing
commuter services on a much smaller route. Clearly, it would be folly
to try to make valid comparisons between them. However, even with the
apparently similar inter-city west coast franchise, differences in
fleet size, cost base, network grant, investment plans, disruption and
other factors make drawing a valid comparison with East Coast almost
impossible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062060000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0004.htm#13062060000060">There
is a comparator already in existence. In the past 17 years since
privatisation, the number of passengers using the railways has doubled
from 750 million to 1.5 billion. The number of journeys has doubled,
and the amount of freight moving off our congested roads and on to the
railways has increased by 60%. The comparator is the British Rail model
that satisfied no one, failed to respond to its customers and was
totally unsuccessful.</hs_Para>

things it ever did was to have a scheme of building new homes and
offering them for sale to people locally at discounted
prices—or, at least, prices that did not make so much profit.
There were huge queues of people and the homes were snapped up. There
was a restriction on onward sales, whereby people had to live in the
houses for a certain amount of time, and they met a lot of the unmet

a constituency example. At the Elephant and Castle, just over the
bridge, as people know, there is a controversial development of a
former council estate, the Heygate estate, that is being done by Lend
Lease, an Australian company. The first phase was either first put on
the market in Malaysia or put on the market in Malaysia at the same
time as it was advertised here. My constituents, who are desperate for
the housing that was meant to replace the council estate, were more
than angry to think that not only were they not getting the affordable
housing they were promised at the promised 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>levels but the property that was made available for private sale first
was being block-bought off plan in Malaysia. This morning I went to

passage for people from all over the world for centuries. Nobody I know
in public life, in my party or in my constituency, does not appreciate
the contribution that foreign investment has made into our country in
the past and will continue to make in the future. We have also
historically prided ourselves on being a country based on the free
market, from which UK citizens and residents can acquire interests
abroad, and where non-UK citizens and residents, and companies
registered outside the UK can acquire interest in property in this
country. Most people know that many, if not most, of our
leading companies now have foreign owners. I often raise the issue of
Thames Water and its failure to pay adequate taxes, but it is, in
effect, an Australian company and many of our other
utilities are also run by foreign owners.</hs_Para>

are being built are specifically built with the probability that they
will be sold easily in the foreign market. These are not family houses;
these properties are mainly flats, often studio, one-bedroom or
two-bedroom flats—small flats—which will either be buy to
rent, will be used occasionally by somebody from abroad who might come
here a couple of times a year on business or will be just kept as an
investment. There is evidence that a lot of these places have nobody in
them at all; they are simply bought as an investment in this country

a much more successful investment. Some purchasers buy these homes to

between UK and other EU citizens on the basis of their
citizenship—I understand that entirely. However, it seems to me
that we could have differential stamp duty or council tax, or another
form of acquisition or disposal tax, or an annual asset tax, on
properties held by non-EU citizens or companies based outside the EU.
Secondly, we could have differential council tax or other tax by
category of use, so a second or third home or a company-let flat, for
example, would be in different categories. I am less certain that this
would be the answer to many of the problems, but we could have
differentiation of tax or council tax by price, with the aim of adding
an extra tax on the middle-ranking 
<?notus-xml column=1161?>properties, which are the ones that our constituents want to buy. That
might have adverse knock-on effects, so I am not categorically
proposing that, but I think the idea should be

believe it would be possible to have priority bidding for rent, shared
ownership or purchase for people who have lived in the area for a
certain period. We could not do that by nationality, probably, but we
could do it by length of residence. Councils are now allowed to give
priority on their waiting lists to people who have lived in the area
for a certain period, so surely we could do the same in the sale,
shared ownership and rental sectors. We could require residential
properties to be advertised in this country at the same time as or
before they are advertised anywhere else. We could do what the London
Docklands development corporation did, which is ensure that properties
are initially offered locally. There would be legal questions to deal
with, but we could consider
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:17:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Finally, we
could give tax incentives to people or companies willing to invest in
affordable housing for rent, shared ownership or sale at below-average
prices, rather than give them only to those who want to build expensive
properties. We could incentivise the right sort of

could pilot these proposals, or give powers to the Mayor or local
authorities in London and elsewhere to try differential planning and
council tax arrangements, to see the effects on the market. As the
Mayor of London has suggested, we could ask the Government to make sure

awkward—and take it in exactly that vein, as a set of positive
suggestions. It recognises some of the challenges, some of which I will

right hon. Gentleman has a strong record of speaking eloquently and
frequently about housing stress in London. I will preface my remarks by
looking at the housing market as a whole and then focus on the question
as it relates to London, because I think that is where the heart of the
problem lies. For too long now, regardless of which party has been in
government, our housing markets have been dysfunctional. From my
political background, and my professional background as a surveyor, I
think that this country has probably built only half the homes we need
year on year for perhaps a
generation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062060000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0004.htm#13062060000098">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:24:32"></hs_TimeCode>
the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, that has caused a long-term
housing shortage and, with it, significant social problems, and that is
especially true in Greater 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>London. That is why the coalition Government are determined to take a
different approach. Our housing strategy seeks to be comprehensive and
to address both supply and demand and both freehold and leasehold, and
it seeks to start to reverse the loss of 421,000 affordable homes that,
sadly, we saw under the previous Administration. It is why we are
reforming<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:21:25"></hs_TimeCode> the
planning system to speed up the development process, why we are
unlocking large sites to create lasting settlements, and why we are
building over 170,000 more affordable homes. It is also why we are
seeking to create a bigger and better private rented sector that gives
tenants greater choice and
quality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062060000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0004.htm#13062060000099">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>
the same time, we are supporting demand for new homes through the Help
to Buy equity loan scheme. Boosting demand matters, especially after
the record lows of recent years. I believe that not just because I am a
passionate supporter of home ownership, but because a rise in demand
gives builders the confidence to accelerate building and can boost
overall market supply, including of affordable homes. That is an
important point about how the flow of cash and investment helps the
market as a whole, a point I will return to in the
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062060000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0004.htm#13062060000100">On
the specific question of foreign investment in housing, it is natural
to look principally at London. We have to recognise that London, as the
right hon. Gentleman correctly said, is a truly global city; perhaps it
is the global city. It has not only the fastest growing economy and
population in the UK, but immense international appeal. I think that
Members on both sides of the House recognise that as a highly desirable
position to be
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062060000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0004.htm#13062060000101">London’s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:22:47"></hs_TimeCode>
success is in part the result of our open and free markets. Being a
global city brings many economic benefits, with wealth creation and
inward investment in jobs. Only a week or so ago the Mayor announced
the securing of £1 billion of Chinese investment in the area
that used to be covered by the old London Docklands development
corporation but is now an enterprise zone, which is a very welcome
long-term investment. The preparedness of others to invest here is a
vote of confidence both in this country’s current economic
strategy—that of the coalition—and in London’s
future. I think that that openness is also vital to the character of
London. It is a diverse city with a fantastic range of influences and
cultures, and that is something to be
welcomed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062060000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0004.htm#13062060000102">As
a result of that,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:23:47"></hs_TimeCode> housing
market in London is quite different from the housing market across the
rest of the country. Across the rest of the UK, domestic demand has
suffered, with mortgage constraints and the difficulties builders have
had in securing development finance, but in London the availability of
foreign investment has kept development going. It has generated the
cash flow that developers need to progress
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062060000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/debtext/130620-0004.htm#13062060000103">The
right hon. Gentleman mentioned research. A recent report by the Greater
London authority looked at barriers to housing delivery. It estimated
that in prime London markets—the very highest—up to 75%

Hughes:</Member></B> I will be brief, because I know the Minister has
other things to say. A report that is about to be published will show
that, sadly, the figure given by Tony Pidgley of a third is much lower

theoretical quota, in my borough the figure is much lower and I fear

land tax do not distinguish between UK and foreign nationals. That is
partly because of EU laws, to which the right hon. Gentleman has

difficulties. Although he will understand that tax policy, as I am

Clearly, it is up to local councils how they do it, but I think that
this is a power that is able to address many of the problems, perhaps
in a simpler and more localised way than we thought. It is something

understandable concerns about the potential impact of people from
overseas buying homes in London. We should not, however, pretend that
there are no benefits—I know that the right hon. Gentleman does
not seek to do that. Inward investment has helped more homes to be
built and it encourages confidence. We need a balance to be struck, but
overall London benefits from being an open and diverse city, which both
welcomes and, indeed, attracts investment from around the globe. I look

gives me pleasure, it gives me none to report that the subject of this
debate is the procurement and management process undertaken by the
Ministry of Justice. Serious flaws have been exposed in the
Ministry’s procedures and policies; the process was a shambles.
The contractual system for court interpreting, which came into
operation at the end of last January, proved unsatisfactory from the
outset and was subject to a boycott by many professional interpreters
whose terms and conditions of employment were adversely affected. As we
say in our report, that caused the adjournment or severe delay of
numerous hearings and, in criminal cases, unnecessary remands into
custody, with potential implications for the interests of
justice.</hs_Para>

be an expert on court processes to understand the dangers to justice
that can arise from inadequate interpretation. We acknowledged in our

is good practice, and my Committee’s practice, to look again and

Alan Beith:</Member></B> I will return to how we proceed from here. I
am tempted to comment that people always say that when it is proved
that standards fell after big changes and that some of the predictions
were fully justified. That should be a warning to the Government, as
they engage in a number of other contracts. I will come back to that as
well.</hs_Para>

pointing out that the problems encountered by the Ministry in
contracting for the work, while serious in themselves, also
have implications for wide swathes of its other activities.
The Ministry is putting out to contract 70% of
rehabilitative services under the transforming rehabilitation
proposals, £450 million in custodial services over the next six
years and a large part of criminal legal aid, all of which will be the
subject of contracts. I do not need to spell out that if things go
wrong in those areas as they have in court interpreting, we
face a multiple-train crash. Does the Ministry really have the capacity
to do the kind of contracting on which many of its policy proposals are
based? I am not arguing about whether it is a good or bad idea to
contract out those things, but the Ministry must have the capacity to
do so well and
properly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062054000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062054000017">Before
I turn to the substance of the report, I will mention another point of
considerable concern to my Committee: the Government’s
insistence that they acted reasonably in discouraging court staff from
taking part in the online forum that we set up as part of our inquiry
to seek personal experiences of interpretation standards in court. That
was a retrograde step. We did something similar with prison officers.
Many contributed to our online forum, and as a result, we produced a
much better-informed report than we could otherwise have done. We did
the same thing with court staff, but they were strongly pressed by the
Government not to co-operate. That is deplorable. We shall continue to
use such mechanisms where appropriate in our inquiries, not with any
intention of getting civil servants to question policy, but to get a
proper understanding of how it is working on the ground. If Departments
repeatedly give that kind of non-co-operation injunction to their
staff, they may find themselves in contempt of the House,
and the whole House may seek to do something about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062054000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062054000018">On
the substance of our report, we recommended that the Ministry of
Justice audit the amounts being expended on interpreter pay and travel
and said that it might be necessary for the rate of pay for tier 1
interpreters —the most highly qualified—to be increased.
We also said that the MOJ and Capita should prove that the framework
agreement could attract, retain and deploy an adequate number of
interpreters to meet the requirements of the courts and other agencies.
We called 
<?notus-xml column=297?>on the professional interpreter community to work flexibly with the
Ministry to find an acceptable way to restore their services to the
justice
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062054000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062054000019">In
response, the Ministry introduced, with effect from May, a number of
changes to the system of remuneration for interpreters, which it says
amount to an average 22% increase in rates. Those changes involve
mileage payments, cancellation fees, payment in 15-minute blocks rather
than by the minute, payment in accordance with the qualification tier
of the interpreter and a daily fee for incidental costs. We welcome
those changes, but it is not yet clear that they will be enough to
encourage many more interpreters to undertake work under
Capita’s auspices, given the breakdown in relations between the
Ministry and interpreters and the fact that many interpreters cleave to
the view that the framework agreement is fundamentally flawed and
cannot be salvaged.</hs_Para>

a different slant on the dialogue. It says that it was invited to a
meeting with the Ministry’s interpretation project in March, at
which it was presented with a package of proposed changes. It says that

constructive dialogue requires both sides to participate with good

basis did the Ministry choose to make the changes on which it lighted?
How does the Ministry plan to monitor those changes to ensure that they

book saving in its first year of operation, but it has not, on the
available evidence, achieved any improvement in service to the courts.

perfect and that we needed to consider efficiency savings. We concluded
that we would have to be very cautious about destroying something that,
since Runciman, had given court interpretation a level of quality that

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>I have been at
the rough end of several Select Committee reports in my time, but I
have never known three reports—the National Audit Office
memorandum, the Public Accounts Committee report and now the Justice
Committee’s report—to be so consistent in their
condemnation of a Government policy. A number of conclusions can be
drawn from those reports. First, there were no fundamental problems
with the original procedures. Secondly, the Ministry of Justice changed
those procedures without understanding their complexities, or indeed
the professionalism of the people providing the services. This is a
caricature, but it seems that someone who knows a bit of holiday
Spanish can now come in and do a job in the courts, which has proved to
be disastrous. Thirdly, the MOJ awarded the contract to a company, ALS,

dimension, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:52:35"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

prevent a Committee of this House receiving first-hand testimony on the

the damning series of reports, the Lord Chancellor’s latest
letter to me—I have kept up correspondence on the issue since
the 2010 general election —tells me that there has
been a £15 million saving. Quality standards have diminished,
the courts have made 6,417 complaints about poor standards, and
608 magistrates court trials and 34 Crown court trials were
recorded as ineffective in 2012 because interpreters were not
available, which is a 100% increase. There is a great deal of doubt
about the £15 million figure, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:53:42"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and others have suggested. We hear that
48% of cases are now dealt with outside the contract, and there are
various other factors that make the £15 million figure
questionable. Even if the figure is true, £15 million is the
kind of small change that falls down the back of the sofas in the
offices of Secretaries of State. Even if the measure has saved
£15 million, the resultant chaos in the Courts Service and the
destruction of the quality of what was a very highly regarded system
surely does not justify that
level<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:54:29"></hs_TimeCode> of
savings, and it is doubtful whether such savings have been made
anyway.</hs_Para>

with the Lord Chancellor, we should not be trying to score party
political points. In government, Ministers reach a stage where they see
that the only way to salvage their reputation following a clearly big
mistake is to accept that it is a big mistake and do something about
it. The Government should pull out of the contract, negotiate with
professional linguists and do all the things that should have been done

been abandoned over a 12-month period due to lack of interpreters, and
the Ministry of Justice calls that a dramatic improvement. I would love
to know what it would call a deterioration. Last month,
Capita provided only 48% of required interpreters. Throughout the
period of the contract, it has operated in breach of its contract. It

interpreter incapability, compared with a stable level in the previous

Public Accounts Committee involves meeting twice a week and each time
hearing about very different situations, usually a litany of failure or

was appalling. I am reminded by the large number of people in the
Public Gallery today—no doubt some of them are personally
interested in the matter—that we had a large attendance in the
Public Gallery on that day. It was one of the few hearings I remember

found, not surprisingly given what we have heard, that the outsourcing
of interpreter services was terribly mismanaged. We concluded that the
Ministry lacked management information on the previous use of
interpreters and therefore did not have a clear understanding of the
requirements when contracting out the service. It did not know how much
it was already spending on interpreters, or even how many interpreters
were required or in what languages. As a result, the system it selected
was driven by bidders’ proposals rather than the actual
requirements.</hs_Para>

Language Solutions, the company that was awarded the contract, was
clearly incapable of delivering on such a large contract, yet it was
handed £42 million a year to cover the whole country, despite a
credit rating report to the Ministry recommending that ALS should not
have been awarded a contract of more than £l million.
Departmental officials could not adequately explain to the Committee
why it had ignored that advice. It is one thing to make such
a striking error in the first place, but the Committee also found that
the Ministry failed to penalise ALS effectively under the contract. Its
penalty was only £2,200, and there was no penalty for the first
four months when its performance was at its worst. Risible levels of
penalties and low expectations of performance obviously allow private
companies to get away with over-promising and
under-delivering.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062054000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062054000090">The
Ministry should draft and implement future contracts to minimise
transitional problems by piloting and rolling-out new systems
gradually, and incentivising contractors to meet contractual
requirements from the outset—for example, through the robust use
of penalties. Will the Minister tell us what penalties have been levied
on Capita for failure to deliver since it took over the contract? ALS,
of course, was handsomely rewarded for its failure. It sold the
business on to Capita for £7.5 million only 10 months
after winning the contract. As we often find on our Committee, the
public sector had no say in that reassignment and certainly got no
financial benefit from the on-selling. That is something we see
constantly in the public sector: it is now a business to win a public
sector bid or a PFI contract and then trade it on. That is how
companies really make money, and ALS is a good example of it.</hs_Para>

Ministry estimated that it would need access to 1,200 interpreters to
meet its requirements. However, it allowed the contract to go live when
the supplier had only 280 interpreters ready to work under the terms of
the contract. The Ministry believed that many more interpreters were
available to work, in line with contractual obligations, than was
actually the case, because it received over-optimistic assurances from
ALS and there was confusion over definitions of what important terms
such as “registered” actually meant. The Ministry was
also unable to confirm that all interpreters working under the contract
had the required qualifications, experience and enhanced Criminal
Records Bureau checks.</hs_Para>

company was only able to meet 58% of its bookings, initially, against a
target of 98%, which is entirely unacceptable. As previous speakers
have said, it is not only about the mechanics of the contract; we are
talking about people’s lives and life-changing decisions that
may be made on their behalf. People who needed the services have paid a
heavy price for the Ministry’s incompetence. We have seen a
sharp rise in the number of ineffective trials, as others have said. A
trial was 
<?notus-xml column=308?>recently cancelled in my area because, unbelievably, the chosen
interpreter was on trial in a neighbouring court at the same time.
Extra costs for the Ministry are then incurred by unnecessary trial
postponements and delays. Those costs have not been revealed but they
will almost certainly be far more than the money saved on the contract,
and I urge the Ministry to measure the waste in the courts system
caused by the problem.</hs_Para>

value-for-money considerations drove the original decision will now
bear little relation to what has actually happened. It seems certain

descended into total chaos, and that almost everything that could go
wrong, did go wrong. I hope that the Ministry will follow up the
recommendations of the PAC, the Justice Committee and the National
Audit Office in order to clean up the mess. Given the large potential
contracts that the Ministry is looking to award, it has a lot to do to
convince the public that it has learnt the lessons, and that contracts

Alan Beith:</Member></B> Before my hon. Friend concludes, I wanted to
put this point to him, which is not always recognised or understood by
people. What has happened in this case, as is proposed in the case of
legal aid, is that instead of outsourcing to a very large number of
small, usually one-person businesses and making an assessment as to
whether they are capable of doing it, the whole process of obtaining
interpreters has been outsourced. It has been done on such a large
scale that few organisations in the country would be able to do
it.</hs_Para>

Swales:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend makes a valuable point, which
is of great concern to the Public Accounts Committee. We seem to have a
number of Government Departments that—I suppose it is belt and
braces—are making the outsourcing, or contracting-out process,
so complicated that now only four or five companies can win the bid.
The whole job is how a bid is won and not what the service is, because
frequently the people who win the bids do not do the work. Eddie
Stobart will not be providing legal aid; its expertise is winning a
Government bid. That is the almost farcical situation that we have now
got into. The Ministry needs to learn the lessons from that process,
particularly as it seems to be about to do some very similar things on
a much bigger scale.</hs_Para>

of the other issues that we have—we use the expression on our
Committee “following the public pound” —is that
the more this type of thing happens, the less access the National Audit
Office has to the people who are doing the work. If the services are
run by the Department, the NAO can be all over them, but typically, the
contracts do not provide transparency or access, so our auditors are

summary, the Minister needs to convince us about the lessons learnt,

people should take place before we walk into the same trap again, and I
fear that the Public Accounts Committee may have a lot more work coming

Mann</B> (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</Member> In three minutes, I will summarise
my concerns for the Minister and the Chamber. I used to own a large
interpreting company, and I looked at this form of interpreting and
whether, even on a micro scale, it was possible to break into that
market. It is not, because it is not possible to manage quality
control. With other forms of interpreting, a range of techniques can be
used; anyone can work through what the control mechanisms on quality
should be, if they know what they are about. When it comes to this form
of interpreting, that is not possible. Capita—or any other large
conglomerate—cannot possibly manage quality. By definition, it
does not know what the quality is, because it cannot employ the people
who know what the quality is.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:27:10"></hs_TimeCode> do not have
the time to go through how techniques to do that can be devised for
other forms of interpreting, but that is how I grew my business, and I
grew it to a very large one.</hs_Para>

is nonsense, regardless of Capita, and we know how bad Capita is from
the shambles that it made of the miners’ compensation scheme,
when, again, it did not have the managerial experience. That was
something that could have been managed, in theory, but it was hopeless.
Managing quality cannot be done by a large corporate of that scale; it
is not simply about Capita.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062054000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062054000101">Also, the
real flexibility needed in providing these services involves knowing
the people because, in essence, there is a trade-off—a
negotiation. The employer will say, “I desperately need you
tomorrow, because we suddenly have this case”—or this
prisoner, or whatever else—“and you have to do it,
because I have no other option. X, Y and Z are not
available; you will have to cancel your hospital appointment and do
it.” That trade-off in the real world, with real people, works.
Trying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:28:35"></hs_TimeCode> to put a
conglomerate in charge never works, and that is why, even on a
small-town basis, my company decided that it was not worth approaching
Government to suggest that we attempt to run part of the system and
contract in the interpreters. It is not possible, aside from the other
issues of whether a company is any good or not.</hs_Para>

is the fundamental issue that the Ministry of Justice and the Minister
need to address. They do not know what they are talking about, and they
have created this system. Whoever runs it, it will not work, and it
cannot work. Even if it continued on a mediocre basis, quality cannot
be assured—ever. That is a fundamental problem for British
justice, and it is one that the Minister needs to address.

that there is no repetition of it in the future. It is difficult not to
conclude that the reason for it was that the Ministry did not want the
full facts of the contract to emerge. I am delighted to hear that this

inquiries. Let me tell Members what my latest inquiries have gained me.
I asked the Ministry to provide the information on wasted costs in
courts, and it said that it would not do that, although it could,
because it was too expensive. I am appealing that decision, because it
seems to me that the Ministry could simply contact each court and ask
it to supply that information as raw data, and my office could collate
that. Failing that, I asked whether the Ministry would
provide me with the e-mail addresses of the country’s courts, so
that I could undertake the exercise myself, and it said, wrongly, that
that information was available publicly. It is not available publicly,
so I am appealing that as well. The fact that the response
to one of those inquiries was addressed to Mr Safranov and the other
one was unopenable and caused my computer to crash only confirms that
the Ministry is either unable or unwilling to provide the information

entire Courts Service. I read in the technical press this week that a
£300 million MOJ desktop and laptop support contract has been
postponed, reportedly after the four most serious contenders had
already spent millions bidding. That is the computer contract for the
entire court, prison and probation system, which has been in planning
for some years and which has now simply been pulled. We do not know
why; perhaps the Minister will tell us. The point is that there is no
coherence to the contract letting process in the MOJ and the contract
is perhaps the clearest example of it. It is also one of the smallest

there has been a dramatic improvement when the situation is getting

Committee, they claimed that the slight amelioration of conditions was
something that had been welcomed. Nothing could be further from the
truth, and it is clear in the minutes of the meetings between the
Minister, officials and interpreters that the terms being offered do
nothing to meet the concerns of 
<?notus-xml column=313?>the professional interpreters or to adequately compensate them. Until

provided<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
well known, however, that the old system was not ideal. It was
inefficient, inadequate and did not provide good value for money. Those
issues were noted by the National Audit Office in its
report<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:45:27"></hs_TimeCode>. The new
contract and framework agreement were developed to address, as far as
possible, those inadequacies. The reality is that we could

relation to the levels of work that they carried out. The National

was expensive and unpredictable, notwithstanding the fact that many of
the interpreters we used were outstanding. The system needed to change,
and it has. It needs to be noted, as I have already said, that we do
not have supply problems at the moment. Where there have been problems,
they have tended to involve the more challenging and unusual languages.

independent nuclear missile. That practice was copied by a later Prime

development of nuclear weapons, there has been one major occasion when
there was a serious likelihood of their use. That was the Cuban missile
crisis of 1963, which was resolved when the Soviet Union agreed not to
put nuclear weapons on the island of Cuba. In return the United States
agreed to remove its nuclear missiles that were targeting Soviet
targets from Turkey—although that was done secretly. A year
later, both the leaders who negotiated on that were either dead or
gone. Khrushchev was removed by an internal process, and Kennedy of
course was assassinated. What came out of that period was a realisation
of just how dangerous nuclear weapons are, and how dangerous it would
be if they proliferated further. A great achievement was the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty, which was signed in 1970.</hs_Para>

Corbyn:</Member></B> This debate is not about Scottish independence; it
is about nuclear weapons. Quite clearly, the positioning of
Britain’s nuclear weapons in Scotland makes that issue a factor,
and the very broad opposition throughout Scotland from all parties to
nuclear weapons is significant. Merely moving the weapons to somewhere
else does not make us all safer because they are still in existence and
still a threat. I hope to persuade the Minister —I am
sure that he is ready to be persuaded—of the need for Britain
not to replace its nuclear weapons system and to become part of the
nuclear-free world that we all aspire to. I can see that the Minister
is about to jump in and intervene and say that he agrees with me.

have spoken for nearly 30 minutes, so I will conclude shortly. We are
members of the UN Security Council, and some people argue that, by

Other countries will become permanent members of the Security Council
or the structure will change possibly to include, among others, Brazil,
Mexico and India. Our membership is not dependent on having nuclear

have a slightly schizophrenic approach towards nuclear weapons. Some

Saturday afternoon session of the conference when I was asked to delay
my presentation by half an hour or so because a video message was
coming from the British Government. The former Defence Minister Geoff
Hoon appeared on the screen above us and gave a cogent talk about
Britain’s commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and
about how we were detargeting and reducing our warheads. He said that
we were encouraging a nuclear-free world and co-operating with Norway
on decommissioning, but that Britain was not going to give up its
nuclear weapons all together. It is time that we accepted the message
that we are part of the NPT and have a contribution to make towards
nuclear disarmament and did something about it. We should say that we
will not proceed with the development of the new submarines, which
would affect the ability to deliver those weapons. Instead, we should
move to a nuclear weapons-free defence policy, which would not only
save us a great deal of money but improve our standing in the

We have both been arguing the merits and demerits of nuclear weapons
and nuclear deterrence—I would like to think passionately but
also reasonably—for at least the last 30 years. Perhaps we
should cast ourselves as the nuclear version of “Les
Misérables”, but which one of us would be the fugitive
and which one the pursuer is a matter for others to decide. Certainly,
I would like to think that our relationship is a bit more positive, if
adversarial, than that of Jean Valjean and his nemesis, but the fact is
that we do disagree, and we represent two diametrically opposed schools
of thought. I genuinely congratulate him on securing this debate. I was
away with the Intelligence and Security Committee in the United States
when he applied for it. Had I not been, I would have been happy to
support him in applying for it, just as he supported me very fully
earlier this year when I applied for the debate that we both secured on
Trident, which most people thought was beneficial and extremely
valuable, whichever side of the debate they happened to

Lewis:</Member></B> I am delighted to hear that, and that is what I
hoped he would do. I will try to follow the chain of the hon.
Gentleman’s argument—not too pedantically, I hope. I will
start where he did, in 1945, because as he said, that was the one
occasion on which nuclear weapons were used. However, it all depends on
what we mean by the verb “to use”, because although they
were used, very controversially, to end the war with Japan, I contend
that they have been used frequently, indeed continuously, ever since.
Once we get to the stage of mutual nuclear deterrence, the use of the
nuclear deterrent lies not in firing it, but in possessing it, so that
no one else will ever be tempted to do to a country what America was
able to do to Japan. Whether we regard that as right or wrong in the
circumstances is irrelevant. We want to ensure that no one is tempted
to do that again in the future. The use of the nuclear deterrent is to
deter anyone from attacking a country with mass destruction

the end of the hon. Gentleman’s speech, he said that nuclear
weapons were a fat lot of use as far as 9/11 was concerned. That is an
update of an argument that we used to hear in the 1980s, when it was
said, “Well, your nuclear deterrent didn’t stop Argentina
invading the Falklands, did it?” My answer to the more modern
version of that has to be the same as my answer to the earlier version:
if a weapons system does not 
<?notus-xml column=326?>deter every sort of threat—and it does deter some dangerous
threats—there is no more reason to get rid of it than to get rid
of the antidote to a deadly disease just because it could not cure us
of other, unrelated diseases.</hs_Para>

question of nuclear deterrence was substantially worked out before
nuclear weapons made their existence known. In 1944-45, the British
chiefs of staff commissioned a study by defence scientists under a
famous professor, Sir Henry Tizard, to try to imagine what the future
nature of warfare would be once Germany and Japan were defeated. Tizard
was not allowed to go into the question of nuclear weapons, even though
he knew that they were under development, but he could not resist
putting in his report, in 1945, that he and his fellow senior defence
scientists could see only one answer to the atomic bomb, if indeed it

blind alley as far as nuclear weapons development was
concerned. They were subject to eavesdropping at Farm hall, where
intelligence experts heard them doubting and wondering whether it was
true that the Americans had successfully developed the atomic bomb used
in Japan. However, he is absolutely right that Nazi scientists played a
key role in developing the rocketry that could carry such weapons to
their destination, should they ever be fired. As I like to stress over
and over, that is not what their use consists of, once the stage of
stable nuclear deterrence is

and interestingly, the hon. Gentleman said, again rightly, that the
Cuban missile crisis was probably the most dangerous point in the cold
war—the point when the possibility of a nuclear exchange was at

greater than he suggested, because they had nuclear-armed missiles
based in Turkey. It was not a question of targeting Turkey; the US had
missiles based in Turkey, which Kennedy wisely decided the US should
offer to remove as a way of giving Khrushchev some face-saving ability,
so it would not look too much like a straightforward climb-down for him
to remove the Soviet missiles from
Cuba.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062059000051">Although

standard of morality and how one measures it. I would say that it is a
little like arguing that the neutral countries in 1940—for
instance, Holland, Belgium and Norway—had greater moral standing
than democracies such as Britain and France, which at least tried to
have armaments with which to defend themselves. However, that is not my
standard of morality or my way of measuring it. My way of measuring it
is to ask which country, by adopting a particular policy, will do most
to prevent a nuclear war from breaking out. It was implicit—at
one point, it was virtually explicit—in some of the hon.

about the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons, and that will

currently constitute the British strategic nuclear deterrent are not up

one could argue that not replacing the submarines would effectively
disarm this country of its nuclear deterrent. That is why the hon.
Gentleman and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament would like the
submarines not to be replaced. Equally, it is why I am determined to do
everything that I can to put pressure on the Government to ensure that
they fulfil their promise to replace them. However, I do not think that
it is credibly arguable, by any stretch of the imagination, that
replacing four submarines that are reaching the end of their design
life with three or four new submarines to carry the same
missiles—indeed, the new submarines 
<?notus-xml column=328?>will have a smaller missile compartment, so arguably they will carry
fewer missiles, although I freely acknowledge that the flexibility in
the number of warheads that can be put on missiles probably means that
it is a distinction without a difference—comes anywhere near a

particularly draw attention to the example of what happened with a
treaty that undoubtedly would have had the support of the Campaign for
Nuclear Disarmament in 1972, when it was signed: the biological warfare
convention. I always remember that brilliant columnist, Bernard Levin,
who wrote an article at the time of the biological warfare convention,
talking about the fact that the Russians were apparently disposing at
sea of all sorts of horrible biological weapons, under the terms of the
treaty. He said that whatever things they were consigning to the depths
of the ocean, he was pretty sure that biological weapons were not among
them. He was dead right, because we now know that in 1973, the year
after Russia signed the treaty, the Soviet leadership set up
Biopreparat—a massive organisation—secretly to continue
its deadly biological weapons research into such charming weapons as
smallpox, bubonic plague, anthrax, brucellosis, tularaemia and
Ebola<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:52:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

this because in 1989—I remember when it happened—a
defector from that organisation, Vladimir Pasechnik, revealed
everything that was going on. We were able to get away with that
cheating, because we had the ultimate fall-back of a nuclear deterrent
system, which meant that it would have been just as dangerous for
Russia to have exploited its secret monopoly of biological weapons,
which it kept while everybody else kept to the terms of the treaty and
disarmed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>. We

question that people who advocate a nuclear-free world have to ask

should like to ask the Government for more information about how they
intend to deal with this issue. Many such debates take place in the
context of the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system, about
which we have heard many references. Strong arguments are made by those

find it difficult to justify the cost of more than £100 billion

for New Forest East that it would be wrong to get rid of nuclear
weapons before getting rid of all weapons in this world. The position
of some states on nuclear weapons makes it more likely that other

Of course, there is much debate about Syria. Previously, there was much
debate about Libya and Iraq. We have had debates and there has been
discussion this week about the regime in Iran. The reality is that many
of those regimes, at various points, may have had the capacity to
develop and possess nuclear

is beholden on the United Kingdom Government, as one of the five

Gentleman’s closing remarks. I was with him for quite a bit of

Perhaps taking the opposing view—that we will achieve a world
without nuclear weapons—is idealistic, but I think it is
important that we have that in mind as an end goal. After all, each of
the parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty—he cited
article 6—has 
<?notus-xml column=331?>undertaken to pursue in good faith negotiations on the cessation of the
nuclear arms race at an early date and to achieve nuclear disarmament.
Having signed up to the treaty, we have committed ourselves to
making progress on that front, even if we think that the end
result will be a long way off; it comes down to the speed and passion
with which we pursue those
negotiations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:02:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062059000076">The
official Opposition believe that the UK must continue to press for
multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable

operationally available warheads and the overall weapons stockpile. The
UK now accounts for less than 1% of the global stockpile of nuclear

Trident and the need for an independent nuclear deterrent,
Labour’s continuing objective is to play an active and

warheads, but Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent has been
the cornerstone of our peace and security for more than half a century.

capabilities and the security landscape is characterised by instability
and uncertainty—we have heard about the situation in Pakistan,
North Korea’s missile tests and the unpredictable situation in
Iran, despite the election this week of a new President—it is
right that the UK retains an independent nuclear deterrent. However, we

the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis). It is clear to all of us in
the House, having known them for a long time, that not only do they
know what they are talking about, but they continue to conduct the
debate on a serious issue in exactly the sort of terms that we would
want for an argument of such seriousness. As the years ebb and flow, it
remains uncertain which argument will dominate at any particular stage
in British politics and the like. That the reasons for and against are
put so clearly is of benefit to all of us in the House, so I very much
appreciate the hon. Member for Islington North calling for the debate,
and the way in which he led it, as well as the way in which all other
colleagues who have spoken

always, we need to go a little way down memory lane. The first time
that the hon. Member for Islington North and I debated the subject was
when we were both councillors on Haringey council in 1981; he was
either proposing or part of a movement to declare the borough a
nuclear-free zone. Probably the first time that I came across
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:11:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for New Forest East was when he was campaigning with Tony
Kerpel and others in the anti-CND movement about the same time. Both

world has of course benefited from the case put forward so ably by my
hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East. It is a case with which I
am broadly in agreement: our possession of nuclear weapons has
contributed to the peace of the world, provided it has been allied to a
commitment, demonstrated by successive Governments, to rid the world
steadily of nuclear weapons through measures of mutual confidence. I

moderate way and recognising the responsibilities of the United Kingdom

associated through its various treaty

United Kingdom is a firm supporter of the non-proliferation treaty,
which we believe is the cornerstone of the international
non-proliferation regime. Of course, the NPT faces challenges and
pressures, such as the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran, the
risk of a nuclear terrorist attack and the spread of sensitive nuclear
technology. We must also remember, however, that the consensus outcome
of 2010 NPT review conference, with agreement of the cross-pillar
action plan by 189 state parties of the NPT, was a real achievement and
a boost for multilateralism. We are now halfway through the five-year
review cycle. Looking ahead to the review conference in 2015, we need
to ensure that we deliver against our action plan

response to the question of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:14:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bristol East, we in the Government take our action plan obligations
seriously, on all three pillars of the NPT, which are nuclear
disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses, and our role as
co-convenor for the conference on the establishment of a weapons of
mass destruction-free zone in the middle east. I will say a little more
about each of
those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0001.htm#13062059000098">On
disarmament, under the first pillar of the NPT, the United Kingdom is
committed to the long-term goal of a world without nuclear weapons.
Successive UK Governments—the hon. Lady can take pride in her
party’s achievements—have played an active role in
helping to build an international environment in which no state feels
the need to possess nuclear weapons. I take the opportunity to
highlight the UK’s strong record on disarmament. In our 2010
strategic defence and security review, we announced reductions in the
number of operational warheads and our overall stockpile. I remember
making some of those announcements in New York at the time of the 2010
conference. We announced, for the first time, the total size of our
nuclear warhead stockpile, and gave a new, stronger security assurance
that the UK would not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear weapon states party to the NPT. Those announcements meant
that the UK has been more transparent than ever about our arsenal in a
declaratory policy that we believe will assist in building trust
between nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states, and contribute to
efforts to reduce the number of nuclear weapons worldwide. We continue
to call on other nuclear weapon states to take reciprocal
steps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:16:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

essence, as we all know, the NPT is a grand bargain between
nuclear and non-nuclear weapon states. It is essential, and at the
heart of our disagreements with Iran in particular, but not only Iran,
that both sides keep that bargain, otherwise mutual confidence is not
there. If we do keep the bargain, we can make progress towards the
world we want to see. China’s involvement in the P5
process—in particular, its leadership of the P5
working group on nuclear terminology—is a positive indication of
China’s interest in engaging in efforts to help enhance
understanding on nuclear matters. That and Russia’s involvement
in the P5 plus 1 talks with Iran indicate that, despite difficulties
and disagreements in some areas, the consensus on nuclear issues and
nuclear disarmament is quite strong under the overall NPT
umbrella<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:17:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000100"><B><Member ContinuationText="Katy Clark" PimsId="4759" UID="13062059000152" xid="912" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000152">Katy

in a
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
groundbreaking work with Norway, a non-nuclear state, on the
verification of warhead dismantlement has been the first time that a
nuclear weapon state has engaged in such an open way with a non-nuclear
weapon state on such a sensitive issue. I hope that we have also been
active in building the conditions for further progress on disarmament.
The United Kingdom instigated the P5 dialogue between nuclear weapon
states in 2009 to help build the trust and mutual confidence to take
forward further progress. The hon. Lady is right that as part of the
action plan—though it was not a commitment—there was much
discussion about the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons and,
therefore, the Oslo
conference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000102"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:18:47"></hs_TimeCode>Of
course we recognise that any use of nuclear weapons would have grave
humanitarian consequences—it is unthinkable. The best way to
prevent such an event is to make progress on multilateral disarmament,
on counter-proliferation and on improving the security of non-nuclear
materials and facilities. Our decision not to attend the Oslo
conference on humanitarian consequences does not change any of those
commitments to the goal of a world without nuclear weapons. We believe,
however, that the energy behind the humanitarian campaign could have
been more effectively channelled through existing processes, by helping
to tackle blockages, and by making progress in the practical
step-by-step approach that includes all states that possess nuclear
weapons. Only in that way can we realistically achieve a world without
nuclear weapons. That is the reason why we and the other P5 members
chose not to
attend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000103"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jeremy Corbyn" PimsId="2717" UID="13062059000154" xid="133" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000154">Jeremy

hon. Gentleman is right. Officials from our embassy in Mexico City held

want to speak about some of the states mentioned by colleagues during
the debate. On the second pillar of the NPT, Iran and North Korea pose
the most immediate challenges to the non-proliferation regime. The
actions of both countries must not be allowed to threaten international
peace and security. The UK remains deeply concerned about Iran’s
continuing nuclear activities in violation of multiple UN Security
Council resolutions and in defiance of the resolutions of the board of
governors of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000106">Iran’s
nuclear programme has no credible civilian explanation, and we believe
that it wants a nuclear weapons capability. Those aspirations are
incompatible with Iran’s obligation under the NPT. A
nuclear-armed Iran would bring the risk of a nuclear arms race and
further conflict throughout the region. The NPT could unravel and the
dangers facing us and other countries would multiply. We want a
peaceful, diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue. We urge Iran to
engage constructively on the basis of the confidence-building proposal
presented by the E3 plus 3, and to take the concrete steps that would
pave the way for negotiations on a comprehensive
settlement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000107">As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:21:49"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Foreign Secretary said, clearly the election of
Iran’s new President has the possibility of introducing a new
element into a complex equation. If that were the case, there would be
warm a welcome from the United Kingdom, but the evidence suggests that
it is sensible to wait and see what such an approach might be.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:22:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bristol East was able to give some background on President-elect
Rouhani that indicates that his position may not be the easiest, but it
is still early days, and any opportunity will be warmly welcomed. The
security and peace of many people is dependent on Iran recognising its
obligations under the NPT and satisfying the concerns of the
international community. If those steps can be taken, there may be an
opportunity to de-escalate. No one and no state would welcome that more

Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:22:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jeremy Corbyn" PimsId="2717" UID="13062059000156" xid="133" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000156">Jeremy

again. Could we not use the opportunity of new President

Gentleman’s point. The opportunity for dialogue is genuinely
there. The House knows that relations between Iran and the United
Kingdom have been reduced to the lowest level, but they are not
absolutely nil. Everyone knows about the talks that are proceeding on
the nuclear issue, so the opportunity for dialogue exists. I do not
believe that anyone in Tehran believes that they would not have the
opportunity of putting something new into the mixture if they wanted 
<?notus-xml column=337?>to, in relation to the President’s position, when it becomes
established, so we will wait and see. I want to make it clear that our

evidence. However, the opportunity will be there.</hs_Para>

briefly about North Korea before turning to the weapons of mass

extent the regime plays games with the international community and its
neighbours is almost impossible to tell. The hon. Member for Bristol
East rightly asked about the prospects for new talks. We welcomed the
news last week that North and South Korea were considering talks on the

proved possible to hold talks this week, we continue to hope that both

to the weapons of mass destruction-free zone in the middle east, I want
to put on record again my strong commitment to it. I have met
facilitator Jaakko Laajava on several occasions. I like him, and he
works incredibly hard on one of the most unforgiving briefs in the
middle east, of which there a few. He has worked tirelessly to try to
bring nations together. As a co-convenor of the conference, we support
it and we want it to happen. I would like an indicative date, and I
back Jaakko Laajava’s attempts to try to create that. His method
has been to try to bring the parties together conditionally to discuss
where it might go, but that has not suited Egypt and other Arab states
that have made their concerns very clear because they were disappointed
that the conference did not happen last year. So were we, but patient
building together will be required to get there.</hs_Para>

much appreciate the re-engagement of Egypt and all other Arab states,

of the bargain that achieved the statement in 2010. Those who are
committed to this can be assured that the United Kingdom will make all
efforts, but ultimately it will depend on confidence all round, and
will include the United States, Israel and the Iranians. It is
interesting that they are all in the process, and the facilitator 
<?notus-xml column=338?>continues to talk to all, which is important. That is our position and
we continue to try to drive that process on. The fact that Israel and

Members would be disappointed if I did not touch briefly on the
deterrent and Trident. Our position remains that maintaining the
UK’s nuclear deterrent beyond the life of the current system is
fully consistent with our obligations as a recognised nuclear weapon
state under the NPT. It does not require unilateral disarmament, nor
does it prohibit the maintenance of a nuclear weapons systems currently
held by any nuclear weapon state. The UK has an excellent record in
fulfilling its disarmament obligations under the NPT, maintains only a
minimum nuclear deterrent and, we believe, is the most forward-leaning
of the five nuclear weapon states. In that context, I reaffirm the
United Kingdom’s position on the
deterrent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062059000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/halltext/130620h0002.htm#13062059000115">My

will deal with the alternatives when that comes through, but for
maintenance of the Government’s consistent position at the

overall approach of the guidelines remains the same, making a clear
distinction between communications which amount to credible threats of
violence, a targeted campaign of harassment or breach of court orders
on the one hand, and other communications—for example, grossly
offensive communications—on the other. The first group will be
prosecuted robustly. Whereas cases in the second group, which meet the
evidential stage, are unlikely to require a prosecution in the public
interest if the sender expresses genuine remorse, the communication is
swiftly removed, it is not intended for a wide audience or does not
obviously go beyond what could conceivably be acceptable in a diverse
society which upholds and respects freedom of
expression.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062053000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/wmstext/130620m0001.htm#13062053000025">Copies

can announce today that the housing guarantees are open for business.
We have awarded the licence to provide the affordable housing
guarantees scheme to Affordable Housing Finance plc, a subsidiary of
the Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. Their bid provided very good value
for money, and I am looking forward to working with them to deliver the
scheme. Affordable Housing Finance are now able to receive applications
and we expect the first applications to be approved this summer,
subject to due

I have laid before the house a minute setting out details of the
contingent liability created by the affordable housing guarantees
schemes. Under the affordable housing guarantees scheme, the Department
for Communities and Local Government will guarantee up to £3.5

housing.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062053000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/wmstext/130620m0001.htm#13062053000065">We
are also now able to consider direct applications for the private
rented sector guarantees scheme. The response to our invitation to
tender for delivery of the scheme indicated a demand from larger
investors for individual direct debt guarantees and that Government
should take the first steps in developing this new market. We are in
conversation with the sector and committed to exploring all of the
market-led options, which will lead to guarantees becoming available as
soon as possible. We will look to offer direct guarantees on money
raised in the bond market by housing providers investing in large-scale
and purpose-built private rented sector projects. The
Government’s scheme rules for the guarantees are unchanged. Some
potential borrowers are already discussing applications with my
officials and others are invited to do the same. A formal
application process will open
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_6bDepartment UID="13062053000006" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/wmstext/130620m0001.htm#13062053000006"><DepartmentName xid="11">Defence</DepartmentName></hs_6bDepartment><hs_8Statement UID="13062053000016" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/wmstext/130620m0001.htm#13062053000016">Reserves

Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs Theresa
May):</Member></B> On 16 April 2013, I informed the House that the
Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) had identified an error in the
way in which they had captured and reported the number of outgoing
(part 3) European arrest warrants (EAWs) that have been issued since
2009-10. As I set out in April, I take this matter 
<?notus-xml column=39?>extremely seriously, and undertook to establish whether any adverse
consequential issues may have arisen, as well as ensure that any
inaccurate data that may have been provided to Parliament are
corrected. Accordingly, I asked HM chief inspector of constabulary
(HMCIC), in collaboration with SOCA, to audit SOCA’s systems for
collecting data on EAWs; to validate the EAW figures; to ensure that
the error identified in collecting data had no detrimental impact on
public protection; and to provide assurances that SOCA’s new
case information management system (CIMS) will provide accurate data in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062053000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/wmstext/130620m0001.htm#13062053000068">This
audit is now complete and I would like to thank HMCIC for the work his
inspectorate have done to produce their report so promptly, copies of
which are in the House Library. The report found that; a) the audit
SOCA undertook to verify the data was robust, and the part 1 audit
would result in the identification of more arrests and surrenders than
previously promulgated; b) there was no evidence of systemic weaknesses
that would adversely affect public protection; and c) CIMS would help
SOCA record more accurate data in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062053000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/wmstext/130620m0001.htm#13062053000069">The
report also made a number of recommendations about work going forward,
including: extending the auditing process to compare SOCA’s EAW
data with information held on the police national computer; to give
consideration to a focused campaign to find and arrest fugitives hiding
in the UK; and to review the progress of all other changes to
SOCA’s EAW process (including the implementation of CIMS) before
the end of 2013. SOCA has accepted all these
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062053000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/wmstext/130620m0001.htm#13062053000070">My

Act 2009. Under statute it must review IPSA’s estimate before it
is laid before the House and decide whether it is satisfied that the
estimate is consistent with the efficient and cost-effective discharge
by IPSA of its functions. If it is not satisfied, the Committee must
modify the estimate to achieve that efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

reached this decision following advice from HM Treasury that it might
be desirable to provide separate entries on the face of the estimate
for core operational costs, which are subject to an annual 5% savings
target, and for project costs, which are outside the savings target.
The Committee concluded that the formal separation of the entries would
provide greater assurance that costs have been attributed correctly and
sensibly to the individual budgets, and that the 5% target was being
achieved. It would be in line with IPSA’s statutory duty to have
regard to the principle that it should act in a way which is efficient,
cost effective and transparent in carrying out its

Committee also had regard to a request from HM Treasury that it should
explore IPSA’s capability to make additional savings on its
operational costs, beyond its existing 5% target, in the current
financial year. Having discussed this with IPSA, the Committee
concluded that the Authority did not have the capacity for additional
savings this year. It therefore found IPSA’s request for
resources to be appropriate, and approved it without
amendment.</hs_Para>

total expenditure was just over £7 million. The large majority
of this was in respect of contractual payments to employees, such as
redundancy pay and pay in lieu of notice. Other expenditure included
costs associated with closing down constituency offices, outstanding

Dunne:</Member></B> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) carries out regular
nuclear safety exercises with other agencies to test robustly emergency
plans and to identify areas for improvement. The Defence Nuclear Safety
Regulator's assessment was clear that during Exercise Senator 2011 the
MOD demonstrated its ability to cope in the highly unlikely event of an
emergency. I have accepted this assessment and work is ongoing to
address its
findings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062097000973" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/text/130620w0002.htm#13062097000973">Each
convoy is commanded by a senior MOD Police Officer who would therefore
be on the scene to direct events in the unlikely event of an accident.
In that event he would become the MOD Incident Commander. Appropriately
qualified MOD personnel from DE&amp;S headquarters in Bristol would be
dispatched to the accident location by helicopter. Experts from other
organisations would also provide support, including the Atomic Weapons
Establishment, Institute of Naval Medicine and Defence Science and
Technology
Laboratory.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062097000974" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130620/text/130620w0002.htm#13062097000974">The
aim of appropriately qualified MOD personnel is to arrive on the scene
as soon as possible. Due to the range of possible locations involved,
the target of four hours applies to the time within which they should
be ready to deploy from Bristol. This was achieved in Exercise Senator
2011.</hs_Para>

for purchasing and installing meters. Similarly, under current
arrangements consumers pay for the cost of their metering and meter
maintenance through their energy bills, and this will be the same for
smart metering. Taking into account the range of costs and benefits
arising from the roll-out of smart metering, we expect the average dual
