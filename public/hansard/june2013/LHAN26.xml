Leveson report in front of me. I note how much the fact and general
nature of any discussion of media policy issues at these meetings
raises questions of how far we go in that direction,
including—as is discussed in my briefing—whether the
exchange of text messages ought to be included in that. As the noble
Lord will know, so far we have included the existence of meetings and
the record of meetings between January and the end of March this year,

Fowler:</Member></B> My Lords, is not the position on Leveson that
almost four months ago, in March, Parliament overwhelmingly agreed a
way forward that protected the freedom of the press but also protected 
<?notus-xml column=976?>the public from the abuse of press power? Is the Minister aware that
many people are suspicious of the long delay in implementing those
proposals? We believe that we have had the debate and that, basically,
we should now just get on with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="1307012000257" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000257">Lord

aware of the strength of feeling on all sides. Some elements of the
agreement of 18 March have now been implemented, as the noble Lord will
know, including within the Crime and Courts Bill and the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Bill. The noble Lord will also know that on 13 April
the Press Standards Board of Finance petitioned the Privy Council with
its own draft royal charter, which is now being considered. When it has
been considered, the conclusions will be published, and the question of
the submission of the Government’s own royal charter will come

March, as has just been said, Parliament agreed to send the royal

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, my briefing says that it is
not appropriate for the Privy Council to consider more than one royal
charter at a time on the same issue. The noble Lord may consider that
the Press Standards Board of Finance has therefore been extremely
clever in what it has done and may draw his conclusions from
that—and that accounts for some of the

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a cross-party
agreement on the way forward. However, as those who have lived through
this debate in even more detail than I have will recall, we are
attempting to build a much tougher self-regulatory principle of
regulation for the press with the support of a royal charter. This is a
very delicate process. Pulling the press along with a tougher system of
self-regulation is not proving as easy as it
might<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:40:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury" PimsId="4063" UID="1307012000262" xid="1800" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000262">Baroness

consideration of consultation responses to the royal charter sponsored
by the Press Standards Board of Finance has finished, when will my
right honourable friend the Secretary of State publish her advice about

should point out that no less a person than Sir Tom Stoppard has said

battle between the press and politicians, with deep and entrenched
mistrust on both sides, which is not doing much good either for the
reputation of the British press or that of British politics. I have to
admit that the subtlety of the process whereby the Privy Council
considers royal charters is something that I ought to have dug into
much more deeply in preparing for this Question. I shall have to write
to the noble Baroness on the timing of the consideration of both these
royal

Grocott:</Member></B> May I gently suggest to the Minister that if he
sees this as essentially a problem between the press and politicians,
he misrepresents or misunderstands where the whole genesis of the
Leveson inquiry came from? It came from a profound mistrust between the
press and the public. Surely, the job of democratically elected
politicians is to do their utmost, preferably on an all-party basis, to
reflect the wishes and concerns of the

issues which might be submitted by other people. Is there no way in
which the Privy Council can draw up a list of priorities of what it

international crime? According to the leaked memo to the <I>Daily

the coalition. They cannot make up their minds. Surely the question of
national security and the fight against crime should rise above these

he perhaps reflect on the possibility that the national interest might

McNally:</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, that is a good example of why we
are giving careful thought to this array of measures. The European
arrest warrant has played an important role in speeding up extradition
arrangements between countries and represents the type of practical
co-operation that we should all support. However, despite its success,
the use of the warrant for trivial offences has damaged its reputation
with many, and lengthy pre-trial detentions have also caused problems
in some cases. It is those areas of proportionality and practicality in
using the warrant that we are trying to address, both in discussions
with our European partners and in looking at the process as it affects
our own dealings with this
warrant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:49:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000030"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Corston" PimsId="4904" UID="1307012000280" xid="1493" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000280">Baroness
Corston:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister accept that it does
not require what he calls “careful time” to consider the
European arrest warrant? Criminals are not fools. If we opt out, they
will go and live in Spain, the way they used to years ago, beyond the
reach of British law. Given that there is much greater pressure in view
of international terrorism, why does it take any time at all to
consider this
issue?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000031"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:49:35"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="1307012000281" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000281">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> It takes time because it is part of a range of
issues. Nobody is talking about jettisoning all these measures, but
some of the proposals in the Protocol 36 decision were written when
reference to the European Court of Justice was not in mind. There is a
variety of technical reasons why careful study is warranted. I assure
the House that the Government will continue, as they have done right
through their period of office, to address opt-ins and opt-outs on the
basis of national security and national interest. When we have our
package to bring before the House, we will ask your Lordships to make
decisions on that
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:50:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, opting out of Protocol 36
means, as we have heard, opting out of the European arrest warrant.
Last week, the Government had to make a Statement significantly
revising their figures for the number of criminals who have
successfully been returned to the UK under the European arrest warrant
agreement. The figures have been wrong for the last three years. Does
the Minister believe that we will be more successful or less successful
in bringing criminals to justice if we opt

McNally:</Member></B> Quite frankly, no. As I indicated in my answer to
my noble friend Lord Marks, our assessment is that the European arrest
warrant has many many benefits, which we want to
profit from. However, in practice, in some places it has shown a lack
of proportionality and in other places it has imposed on British
citizens long periods of pre-trial detention. It is those matters that
we are dealing with. This is not just a tick-box issue; it is a matter
of carefully examining a range of proposals. We are greatly indebted to
the Lords committee for its analysis, which will play an important part
in the decisions that we
make<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:51:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness O'Loan" PimsId="5469" UID="1307012000284" xid="2015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000284">Baroness
O'Loan:</Member></B> My Lords, if we do exercise the opt-out from the
European arrest warrant, one consequence will be that we will have no
extradition arrangements with a huge range of states, most of which
have repealed the original extradition legislation. If the Government
are contemplating an opt-out, are they currently in negotiation with
those Governments to see whether their legislative programmes would
enable the passing of legislation either to allow us to go it alone or
to allow the lengthy period of negotiation that would be necessary to
enter into another arrangement on an arrest
warrant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000035"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="1307012000285" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000285">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> The noble Baroness puts forward one of the very
real problems of a total opt-out: that we would be left with a whole
series of bilateral negotiations and no guarantee of success. The more
this question has unfolded, the more we see the wisdom of the
Government’s considered discussion and thought about what to
bring forward to both Houses and that it is fully
justified.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_01_PT_1/F062CC9D2E02305EC93CFE44688CBA512B83D012" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 1 July 2013">Monday,

Kobler. Indeed, in his latest report on Iraq, the United Nations

work of Martin Kobler. We believe that a new representative needs to be

to see this in the context of, sadly, the rising level of violence in

Warsi:</Member></B> I hear the point that my noble friend is making.
Noble Lords may be aware that there is a long history to this matter.
The particular group, Mujaheddin e Khalq, which originally was in Camp
Ashraf and was moved to Camp Liberty, is being assessed by the UNHCR
for relocation. Concerns have been raised about the conditions within
the camp—concerns about water, sanitation and electricity. This
is not to justify the conditions in those camps but they are similar
to, if not sometimes better than, some of the conditions that people

aware that ever since the evacuation of people from Camp Ashraf to Camp
Liberty, which I suppose is the most misnamed camp in the
world— I have often described it as a concentration
camp—we have had reports of these goings-on and the conditions
that have been mentioned. The Minister just said that the Government
are trying to advise the Iraqi Government so that they get credibility.
Would they not get more credibility if they were to allow the media,
lawyers and doctors to go into the camp, which has been denied to
outsiders? There is no confidence in Kobler, whatever the Minister may
say today. People outside who have been watching this situation know
that the United Nations has been pretty poor. Will she please use her

can see what is going on and hear the

to see the increase in the amount of cycling taking place. However, the
difficulty is that we are seeing an increase in the number of

an increase because of the rise in the number of cyclists and the

Syria continues to worsen. As we speak, the people and the city of Homs
are being subjected to a renewed and brutal onslaught. The humanitarian
situation continues to deteriorate by the day, and the gulf between the
regime’s priorities and those of the Syrian people grows ever
wider. It is also clear that the murder, violence and repression with
which demands for democracy and accountability have been met have
serious implications not only for  the country’s future,

of this is having a profound impact on regional stability. The growing
burden on Syria’s neighbours, above all Lebanon and Jordan, both
of which are playing a vital humanitarian role in hosting hundreds of
thousands of refugees, is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The
intervention of increasing numbers of foreign fighters on the side of
the regime has escalated the conflict and increased the risk of
regional overspill. Individuals with links to the UK as well as from
across the Middle East and well-known terrorist organisations have also
been travelling to Syria to fight the regime and push their own agenda.

opportunity to further their own causes.</hs_para>

interest that these challenges to regional peace and stability are

solution to bring an end to the violence. Our efforts are therefore
directed at actively supporting the US-Russian plan to convene an
international conference in Geneva with 
<?notus-xml column=986?>both the opposition and the Syrian regime to seek a peaceful settlement.
As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made clear, we are
determined to overcome diplomatic differences and agree a way forward
to help the Syrian people achieve the change they want. We used our G8
presidency to underline that efforts must be focused on the ultimate
goal of a political resolution. That has not changed. This built on
previous contacts between the Prime Minister and President Putin in
Sochi, and with President Obama in Washington. They agreed that all our
efforts must be focused on the ultimate goal of a political resolution.
Strengthening an inclusive, credible and capable opposition is an
important step towards laying the groundwork for a negotiated

an artificial state that was born after World War 1 inside lines drawn
by imperial powers. The communities of Syria—Sunnis,
Alawite/Shia, Kurds, Druze and Christians—were forced to live
together under rules agreed by others, not by their own consent. As
Assad’s authoritarian rule collapsed, Syria now looks more like
Lebanon in the 1975-90 period: a fragmented, sectarian country, with
continuing violence between communities, and a central state that has
neither the might nor the legitimacy to bring order to the whole
country. This is a conflict whose resolution demands some fundamental
reconceiving of the kind of country that Syria is and the social
contract that underpins
it.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1307012000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000088">The
conflict is marked by three dominant features. First, the civil war is
becoming more entrenched, with no prospect of decisive military victory
for either side. Optimism about the prospects for a victory for the
Syrian rebel forces has subsided in recent months. 
<?notus-xml column=990?>Assad’s forces have better armoured equipment and significant air
power strength. They have gained confidence from recent captures of
rebel strongholds, and have successfully consolidated in recent months
the main population centres and the routes that connect
them—from Homs to the coast, from Damascus to the Jordanian
border. They have stopped the flow of senior defectors, and have
trained a militia of 60,000 to guard positions formerly held by the
Syrian military. Any strategy based on a prospect of military defeat
for the regime at this point looks highly unrealistic, to put it
mildly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000089">Secondly,
the conflict is characterised by the involvement of multiple foreign
powers on all sides, the overwhelming preponderance of which is
escalating violence. The regime is benefiting from weapons, technical
assistance, surveillance drones and help in monitoring internet traffic
from Iran. Hezbollah and Iran have built a 50,000-strong militia to
support Assad’s forces. On top of this, Assad benefits from
significant Russian assistance, with multiple active arms contracts
between Syria and Russia, and an S-300 air defence system about to be
delivered to Syria from Moscow—the announcement of which was
made just after the Foreign Secretary vetoed the EU arms
embargo.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000090">On the
rebels’ side, foreign fighters are coming from a range of Arab
countries through the Jordanian and Turkish borders to fight Assad.
Extensive support continues to be provided by Saudi Arabia and Qatar,
the latter having allegedly spent $3 billion funding the rebel forces
and offered $50,000 to every Syrian army defector and his family. Qatar
has sent 70 military flights to Turkey with arms and equipment.
According to American intelligence sources, and despite the expressed
concerns of the Obama Administration that such weapons may fall into
the hands of militant Islamists, Qatar has shipped Chinese-made
shoulder-fired missiles to be used against Assad’s air
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000091">Foreign

third feature of the conflict that stands out is the fragmented nature
of the rebel movement. One expert described it as a “bewildering
array” of groups: defectors, Kurdish groups, volunteers, local
militias, Islamist groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra, foreign fighters and
the official Free Syrian Army brigades. Many of them are fighting for a
reformed, democratic Syria, but some of the Sunni militias are becoming
increasingly radicalised, aligning with groups such as al-Nusra and
Ahrar al-Sham, who have called for a jihad against the Alawites and
want an Islamic state. At least one al-Qaeda-affiliated group, the
Islamic State of Iraq, has proclaimed  
<?notus-xml column=991?>an affiliation with the Nusra front and in April, al-Qaeda in Iraq

rebels are brave and committed to ending Assad’s cruel rule, but
they are a diverse, fluid and unstable collection of groups whose
agendas and interests compete with one another as well as reflecting
the interests of foreign powers. The character of the rebel movement

wisdom of the UK collaborating in supplying it with lethal military
support. I note that, following the lifting of the EU arms embargo in

understand that, but it is a statement that raises the question: what
exactly is the justification for arming Syrian rebel forces? Is it that
it would help bring a decisive victory? If so I fear that that is
heroic given the facts on the ground. Would it level the playing field?
If so, it does not seem a strategy likely to reduce violence, but
rather to prolong it. As the Foreign Secretary himself
said:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="1307012000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000219">“There

tilting the balance would be more likely to lead to a military
stalemate so that Assad would agree to come to the negotiating table?
If so, how realistic is that, given that Assad seems to be doubling
down in his military strategy, given that he continues to receive
extensive support from other countries, and given that the insistence
that Assad cannot be part of a post-conflict transition—whatever
the wisdom of that position—is unlikely to make him want to put
his weapons down? Or perhaps the case is that arming the rebels makes a
palace coup in Damascus to depose Assad more likely? If so, that is a
highly speculative basis for such a consequential strategic
decision.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1307012000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000094">Given
the state of play of the conflict, I am not convinced that arming the
rebels can plausibly be thought to be part of a strategy that reduces
violence rather than fuels it. There is a second consideration: what
assurances do we have that any weaponry given would stay in the hands
of moderate rebels rather than Islamist rebels? The Foreign Secretary
has said that non-lethal equipment has already been given to the rebels
and that there is no evidence it has got into the wrong hands. With
respect, that is insufficient reassurance, for many reasons. There are
reports of clashes between rebel groups over resources such as oil
already. The market for lethal equipment is significantly different to
that for non-lethal equipment; and the consequences of it falling into
the wrong hands are much more severe. The absence of systems of
monitoring is therefore considerably more concerning in the case of
lethal assistance. The Minister alluded to the possibility of Syria
becoming a failed state. How do we know that the weapons will even stay
inside the borders of
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:28:33"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000095">There
is also concern about the compatibility between a strategy of opening
up the possibility of arming rebels and the credibility of a commitment
to a negotiated solution. Does the Minister agree in retrospect that it
was perhaps short-sighted for the Government to use 
<?notus-xml column=992?>the run-up to the G8 summit spending so much time talking about
the case for arming the rebels, rather than how to
secure a start date for the Geneva II conference? Is there not a danger
that offering more weapons might encourage the rebels to seek a
military victory rather than resolution in a negotiated
settlement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:29:04"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000096">Overall,
concerns about the coherence of the rebel forces, the security of the
destination of weapons, the improbability that making more weapons
available would bring a quick end to the conflict and the tension
between moving towards Geneva II and making more arms available all

turn to a further reason why we should be reticent about increasing the
supply of arms inside Syria. The conflict is fast spilling over into
the wider region; in Iraq, for example, it is having a seriously
destabilising effect. Sectarian tensions are growing as Sunni minority
protests in favour of reform combine with growing Shia angst that a
pan-national Sunni counteroffensive is mobilising across the region. In
Turkey, border incidents such as the bomb that killed 50 people on
11 May reflect the porous frontier across which insurgent
groups pass every day. Turkey’s relations with Iraq, Syria and
Iran have degenerated spectacularly, while domestic political unrest is
increasing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000098">Lebanon

is divided internally on Sunni-Shia lines and has a weak central state

Syria, and Hezbollah operates as a state within a state. In recent

danger that the Syrian conflict will trigger conflicts among neighbours

on in the international community to improve the situation. In the
short term we can prioritise working with Governments in the countries
most at risk of spillover, to shore up the legitimacy of internal

their commitments to supporting humanitarian

Moral and Pastoral Theology at the University of Oxford, who has proved
a most thoughtful sounding board. However, before I set out my own
personal position, it is important to acknowledge two things. First,
the brutality of the civil war and the suffering that endures today are
of concern to those on all sides of the House. We on these Benches have
regular and constant discussions about the way forward. Today, I
suspect that we will be coming from different perspectives on the way
to proceed. Secondly, our different perspectives on how best to bring
an end to the suffering of the Syrian people do not diminish from our
common goal, which is for a negotiated and speedy end to the civil war
and an outcome that brings an end to the armed conflict so that
solutions to the coexistence of the different sides can be explored and
developed. Whether that is though an international conference or
through the UN Security Council finding the unity and the will to stop
the carnage, we are united in believing that our country must do what
it can to end the

own views are coloured by my long engagement with and affection for
Syria. I first went there in 1973 and, 40 years later, I can only be
grateful that I saw again and again the history, culture and dignity of
the people in better times. Were I to adapt John Rawls’s
“veil of ignorance” to this kind of conflict
situation—that is not what he intended it for but nevertheless I
think it applies—I do not believe my views on where we are today
and what we should be doing would be any different had I never set foot
in Syria. With 93,000 dead and many millions displaced
internally and externally, living in the most appalling conditions, it
is only right that here in the United Kingdom the Government have
sought to prepare for a future arming of the Free Syrian Army through
the lifting of the EU arms embargo on Syria. This decision has,
rightly, been debated extensively within government and, indeed, in
both Houses—“rightly” because, if arms are
supplied, it presages an intervention by our country that many will
doubt can lead to any good.</hs_para>

this House who will argue that adding more arms into an armed conflict

from the noble Lord, Lord Wood of Anfield. I can only envy him his

we cannot know with whom we are dealing, who these people are and where
our weapons will end up. Then there are those who might believe that we
have no business taking sides—that it is a sectarian struggle
between 
<?notus-xml column=995?>Shia and Sunni, and we are best out of it. Finally, there are those
who believe that the mere act of arming one side
will suck us into a full-scale intervention, with our own troops in the

shall start with the view that where there is killing, providing more
arms cannot reduce the killing. If this view was a morally held one
which applied to all times and all eventualities, it could not stand
the scrutiny of our own history. Leaving aside for now the First and
Second World Wars, again and again, the United Kingdom has intervened
in other conflicts after killing has commenced in order to stop the
killing. We have done so in recent times in Kosovo, Sierra Leone,
Afghanistan and
Libya.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000111">Specifically
with regard to lifting the arms embargo, we have the example of the
Spanish civil war. In the 1930s, Britain and France maintained an arms
embargo, while the USSR gave support to the republicans, and fascist
Italy and Germany supported the nationalists. Russian support enabled
the communists to dominate the divided republicans and fascist support
enabled the nationalists to defeat the divided republicans and win the

Spain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000112">It is
also true that we can have no cast-iron guarantee that the arms we
deliver to the Free Syrian Army will remain in its control through the
exigencies of running combat day to day. There is no guarantee that
were we to give weapons they would not end up in the hands of
Assad’s forces, or indeed with Jabhat al-Nusra and its al-Qaeda
fighters. However, the test that one should apply here is whether by
arming the forces of the Free Syrian Army to the point that Assad is
brought to the negotiating table, we are likely to succeed. If the
answer—after assessing the risks properly as to what arms we
should supply, to whom and with what level of training—is a
likely yes, we should take the risk that some of our weapons might fall
into the wrong hands. At the moment, we have a situation whereby the
Free Syrian Army is suffering from shortfalls even of rounds of
ammunition. If we can bring more symmetry into the equation, alongside
the assurance from General Idris of the Free Syrian Army that his men
will account for the weapons delivered and will seek to return them to
us when all is said and done, then when we feel more secure in those
assurances, we should move to arm
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000113">It may also
be true that we do not know the different factions well enough or
understand their motives to be able to make judgments as to who we
might befriend. If that is the case, I am all for holding back, but as
this war progresses, we know more and more who we do not trust. It is
clear to me that Assad cannot any longer be part of the solution. I
suspect that there would be consensus in this House that al-Qaeda in
the form of Jabhat al-Nusra will not be a force for good in Syria, her
neighbours or indeed the West. Our engagement must be based on our
assessment of which side best reflects our
interests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000114">Since

their rights and upholding human rights in a future stable, peaceful

to be an assessment that is laden with risks, but there are risks
equally in turning our backs. There is a strong view, and has been for
nearly a century in the Middle East, that the West engages with the
region only in its own interests. What good then will western passivity
have in this situation? What will we have demonstrated other than cold

future. Existing international law may impose that obligation upon us,

conclusion, I reflect that we need to be clear about what the doctrine
of non-intervention holds for us today. We cannot argue for
multilateralism on the one hand, when the forces of globalisation,
climate change or international terrorism call for us to work with
others to solve problems, yet turn away when the most fundamental
crisis arises: that of significant human death and destruction. In
saying this, I am not saying that we must intervene. It is possible
that our intervention, limited as it might be to supplying arms, might
not succeed in our objective to bring Assad to the negotiating table.
If we are clear that intervention at this stage will not achieve that
objective, we should not do it. Whether we intervene or not, there will
be consequences for us. Today affords us an opportunity to reflect on
what those might be, although we do not have sufficient clarity. The

urge the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, to keep a close eye on the travel
advisory for Lebanon. There are few exits from the country. In the 2006
war between Hezbollah and Israel, most British and other foreign
nationals were evacuated along the international highway to Damascus.
Clearly, that option is no longer open. The one airport in Beirut is
close to the Hezbollah suburb of Dahiyeh and is easily closed with one
telephone call from Hezbollah. I am concerned that Lebanon

to the noble Baroness for introducing this important debate. I thank
her for her wide-ranging and helpful speech. The Foreign Secretary was
right when he recently described the situation in Syria as the worst
crisis affecting the world today. It is a truly wicked conflict. This
wickedness is illustrated both by the scale of the human tragedy and by
the complexity that has thwarted efforts to resolve
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000128">I
am also grateful for the noble Baroness’s mention of the Prime
Minister’s G8 announcement of a £178 million
emergency package, which is very welcome. However, we should not
deceive ourselves into thinking that it will suffice. As other speakers
have mentioned, the crisis has so far driven more than 1.5 million
Syrian refugees into neighbouring countries, and thousands more pour
across Syrian borders every day. Sadly, as the noble Lord, Lord Wood,
mentioned, around 50% of these refugees are
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>. This
is a truly desperate situation, and I hope that the Minister will be
able to say something more about the efforts to tackle the growing

traumatised children are sold into prostitution through temporary
marriages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000129">With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>

we can expect that over 3 million Syrians will have left their home
country by the end of the year. This situation threatens to become a
Sword of Damocles hanging over the host countries and host communities,
which lack the capacity to absorb increases of up to 10% of their local

unsettle the delicate confessional and political balance of
neighbouring states, not least Lebanon itself? I am sure the noble
Baroness would agree that, even if obstacles have yet to be overcome in
resolving this conflict, the international community should not shirk
its responsibility in containing it. What steps are the Government
taking to ensure that donors’ pledges are fulfilled without
delay and that additional funds are provided to meet short-term and
longer-term needs? I would like also to mention here the indigenous
Syrian Arab Christians, who are especially vulnerable when outsiders
from elsewhere in the region, who know or care little about the
honoured place that Christians have held in the nation from earliest
times, seem to be influencing events so greatly. All of us who are
Christian leaders are extremely concerned about the two abducted
archbishops from Aleppo, Boulos Yazigi and Mor Yohanna Ibrahim. We are
all in solidarity with the faithful Christian communities of
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:56:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000131">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:56:02"></hs_TimeCode>
wickedness of this humanitarian catastrophe is matched only by the
paucity of our political efforts to resolve the conflict. The absence
of any real political progress on Syria at Lough Erne last month is a
truly regrettable blight on an otherwise successful G8 summit. The
Government have to date wisely resisted the temptation of military
intervention, but it remains a real concern to members of this Bench
that the Government hold to the assumption that only by correcting the
asymmetry of military power can President Assad be cajoled into serious
negotiations with the opposition. Is this right? Will arming the
opposition—or it might be better to say
“oppositions”, in the plural—make the situation
for the Syrian people better, or will it merely lead to more bloodshed
and accelerate spillover to the wider
region?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000132">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>
accept that that there might be a time when it is necessary for the
international community to police any peace settlement, but we are
clearly a very long way from that point and, as it stands, the ongoing
debate about the arming of Syrian rebels serves merely to distract
attention from finding a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Surely now
is the time to intensify our diplomatic efforts. Diplomatically, the
West appears locked into a political mindset that assumes that a
solution needs to be agreed by external powers and then imposed from
outside without any consultation. Is this the right strategy? Even if
the capacity and coherence of the Syrian opposition can be developed
sufficiently ahead of Geneva 2, are the Government being fanciful in
thinking that a group of Syrian exiles can be parachuted in as the
opposition transition government implant, to assume command of the army
and security forces in
Syria?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000133">The
Government need to move beyond the narrative that this is a
liberational struggle against a nasty and brutish regime. This might

other parts of the Middle East and north
Africa<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T15:58:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Will the
Minister accept that the political position taken in the embryonic
stages of this conflict—namely, 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>that Assad must go—has now become an obstacle to resolving the

Howell of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, more than a year ago,
Lakhdar Brahimi said that the choice for Syria was between his plan,
which at that time was for some kind of transitional government, and
hell. His plan was completely rejected and now we have hell. Syria is
descending into total fragmentation, with a hideous death toll and
oceans of human misery, as we have heard in several very eloquent and
penetrating speeches. The costs to date are estimated at anything
between $50 billion and $100 billion, perhaps far more: one can hardly
put a price on these things. Prices in Syria have risen 100% in the
past year and are heading for hyperinflation and the point where money
dies. Unemployment has quadrupled and many feel that the country is
getting ready to split up, possibly with an Alawite statelet, as under
French rule in the
1930s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000136">Meanwhile,
in Jordan, Hashemite rule is under pressure. As we heard in the
eloquent speech of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, the state of Lebanon
is threatened, although I am not quite as gloomy as he  is
about the miraculous way in which that state has somehow survived so
far, given the amazing pressures since its own civil war. Even Turkey
is destabilised, and there is clearly a feedback into a worsening
situation in Iraq, which we sometimes overlook as being one of the
world’s biggest oil
producers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:01:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000137">Meanwhile,
on the ground, the rebels seem to have captured Deraa and have plenty
of anti-tank weapons. Every day, Qatar and Saudi Arabia run arms runs
with massive supplies of weapons, and while these are perhaps not all
the rebels want there are a great deal of them, so there is a stalemate
already. There is no hope of a new force arising—as someone said
the other day, a new Zenobia—to unite Syria. Nothing of that is
in sight. It was a non-sectarian battle to start with and could have
been handled much more wisely, but it was not, and now all sorts of
jihadists have joined in, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Wood.
It is now becoming a civil war between Islamic sects. The pessimists
could say that when we had a similar religious division in Europe, it
lasted 100 years and involved unbelievable
atrocities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:04:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000138">It
is hardly surprising that in all this appalling scene, where
terrorist-inclined organisations are fighting each other on both sides,
we are all very reluctant  to intervene. That is
understandable, but—there is  a
“but”—we cannot do nothing when not merely a whole
house but a whole neighbourhood is on fire, 
<?notus-xml column=1001?>and the fire is spreading. This kingdom is supposed to be a responsible
and powerful contributor to the network of world peace and stability,
and I believe that we are as long as we do not lose confidence in
ourselves. We live in a totally interdependent world. Even those who
sometimes hanker after different versions of independence when we talk
about other issues do not seem to understand that the whole system is
now totally connected. Interdependence obliges us to proceed on certain
courses. In this case, we simply cannot opt out. However, in not opting
out and deciding how to proceed, we must not allow this to turn into an
old-fashioned Cold War, East/West issue, which I am afraid it is
rapidly sliding towards. Indeed, that is my worst fear of all. We hear
more and more talk of line-up and the West must do this and Iran,
Russia and China must do that. That is the stance that many of us
thought we had seen for the last time with the fall of the Berlin Wall
and the old world of the divided Communist Cold War. To bring it back
and to act as though it had never gone is a great

concede that there are enormous hurdles to proceeding in any direction
at all. Diplomacy has become decoupled from the facts on the ground.
There is a weak and divided Syrian national council, now the national
coalition. It is very hard to know who is in charge. The Russians,
although they have talked big about legitimate regimes and remaining
behind Bashar al-Assad, have totally failed to influence him. Their
diplomacy, which they proclaim very loudly, has not been a success. The
mechanism of dialogue is extremely unclear and the past aspiration of
all nations to develop the concept of responsibility for moving in and
protecting against hideous atrocities and killings has been blocked at
the United Nations by Russia and
China<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we have to be completely realistic and recognise that China and Russia
are the key to any change. Without them, any measures taken will
produce counter-reactions and escalate the problem. There should be a
common responsible global approach, without which there will be no
effective approach. The good news in all this gloom is that the UK has
very recently mended its fences with China, and that positive move is
understood and welcomed on both sides. My right honourable friend the
Foreign Secretary, William Hague, has held detailed talks with the
Russian authorities and Mr Lavrov. Of course, my right honourable

can be done to bring the two giant powers, Russia and China, to a more

much more discussion and dialogue. The Chinese talk about intervening
only peacefully, and have used the phrase 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>the “peaceful rise” of China. That is questionable because
the Chinese have not always been peaceful. However, the plain fact
facing them is that the bulk of their country’s oil imports now
come from the Middle East. Most oil resources from there go eastwards,
not westwards. It is estimated that by 2030 95% of all oil and gas will
go east to China and the great rising powers of Asia. Syria and Iran

the street are challenging the traditional tools of government, to see
where the real forces lie. We should therefore engage with these great
powers that think that they can play superpower politics in the age of
the networked world. We have to engage much more closely with
China’s think tanks and continue our discussions with the
Russians to make them realise that in the end we all share the same
responsibility and that the dangers of failing to combine together will
affect us all, whether it be the Chinese, Russians, Europeans or

establish this common approach. I believe that we in Britain are well
placed to make a contribution in seeking that goal, and we should
strongly support my right honourable friend William Hague in his
efforts in that direction. That is where the solution, if there is one,
to this horror lies: in a common global approach. Without a common

over 100 different factions from Islamic extremists to small local
militias? And how do we in the UK fit into the grand scheme in which
Russia and Iran, together with Hezbollah, are busily arming the ruling
party and Saudi Arabia and Qatar are pouring in weaponry for various
Sunni groups? It sounds to me like a situation we would be better off

the problems that those nations face now are clearly nothing at all to
do with Israel or the Palestinians. In most of them, what starts out as
a popular uprising of oppressed people seeking to topple a dictatorial
regime and gain a better life, and perhaps democracy, ends up with a
vacuum rapidly filled by a vicious Sunni-Shia conflict, fuelled by
clerics each denouncing the other as infidels. This is the case in
Syria, in Lebanon and in Iraq, while in Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood

East, leading to the prospect of an arms race with Saudi Arabia and
Turkey. I find it difficult to imagine that any of what is going on in
those countries can be laid at the door of Israel. Israel is a useful

both Israelis and Palestinians, but even if we reach that nirvana it

on elsewhere that is a major barrier. There is of course strong
pressure from the USA in the shape of John Kerry to restart
negotiations, as well as his offers of billions of dollars to Mahmoud
Abbas for West Bank developments. Furthermore, surprisingly, if
somewhat belatedly, Mr Netanyahu has recently reiterated several times
his offer of talks without preconditions. He is even rumoured to have

<?notus-xml column=1004?>one or other of these victors could turn their attentions to attacking
Israel with or without the threat of nuclear force from Iran. It might
seem to him like signing a suicide note if he makes peace with Israel
and at the same time makes enemies out of Hamas and much of the Arab
world. He might feel that just now, procrastination is the best option.
Against this background of instability elsewhere his reluctance to
negotiate could be more
understandable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000152">Of
course, events might turn out differently: a moderate power might take
over in Syria, Hezbollah might go home with its tail between its legs
as it loses Syrian support, Iran might become more conciliatory or more
isolated and weakened, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt might become
less dominant, all of which might give greater courage to Mr. Abbas.
However, despite American pressure and support from Saudi Arabia, he
might think that the buzzing, angry wasp’s nest to his north
makes it preferable to wait than to gamble. He has, of course, the
additional task of dealing with Hamas in Gaza and in the West Bank. Its
hard line of non-collaboration in any peace deal means that he can
speak for only a proportion of Palestinians. Furthermore, his stability
is further compromised by the recent resignation of two Prime Ministers
in quick succession, and that cannot help either. A strong leader is
needed in any negotiations, so it is difficult to remain optimistic for
the immediate future as so much depends on events elsewhere. There are
little glimpses of hope here and there, but that depends to a very
large extent on what happens in the rest of the Middle

Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a privilege
to follow the noble Lord, with many of whose views I profoundly agree.
I also join others in thanking the Minister for giving us the chance
for this debate. Who among us would not wish to seek to stop this
bloody Golgotha of the innocents in Syria? I am not sure whether you
can use the word Golgotha in relation to an Islamic country but I
suppose it is appropriate here. Who among us would not wish for
something to be done, if it can be? But here is the question, the
paradox: what if the thing you want to do does not make things better
but makes them worse? That is the conundrum to which we must now seek
an
answer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:18:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000154">It
is not the case that I am against intervention—far from it. I
suppose I was one of the first to push for intervention in the Balkans,
in Bosnia and again in Kosovo. When I returned I wrote a book, which is
still available no doubt in all the best bookshops at a remarkably
cheap price, about how we might intervene more successfully than we
have in Iraq and Afghanistan. I happen to believe that, in an
increasingly turbulent world, the capacity of the international
community to intervene to preserve the wider peace will be one of the
instruments that determines whether the decades ahead are more or less
turbulent and more or less

it is sensible to intervene only when it is sensible to intervene. When
it is not sensible to intervene, it is very stupid to intervene indeed.
For reasons I shall explain, I am afraid it is not sensible if by
intervention 
<?notus-xml column=1005?>we mean either military force taken by Britain or the West, or the
provision of arms. The case is so difficult, so tragic and so
potentially catastrophic for the wider peace that it behoves us to try
to put forward a suggestion other than intervention which it might be
possible to follow. I shall seek to do that,

are two departure points on which we can agree. First, we desperately
hope that Geneva II succeeds. Frankly, I rather doubt it will. We must
all hold hands, cross our fingers, wish it a fair wind and hope for the
best. Secondly, until President Obama decides to announce what he wants
to do, we ought not to say that what he wants to do is foolish until we
discover what it is. He has been remarkably timid in following up the
statement one felt that he was dragged to some weeks—or was it
months?—ago that he wanted to assist the rebels. He may want to
do something which is largely humanitarian. He may want to create a
humanitarian corridor or a humanitarian safe zone. Those options, too,
would not be without their complications and dangers. As we saw in
Bosnia, safe zones can easily become safe zones for the rebels, for
those who do not want peace and prosecute instead violence and war.
Safe corridors can easily become corridors for more arms, with more
activists, rebels and fighters coming in. However, until President
Obama announces, we all should wait and listen with
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:21:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000157">There
are things we could be doing—I shall touch on them in a
moment—but, in my view, lifting the arms embargo is not one of
them. Let me explain why. The Government have got themselves into a
difficult spot having been so enthusiastic towards that proposal. It
was put forward first by François Hollande and we followed the
French in saying to the European Union, “Let us lift the arms
embargo”. I sense they would now like to withdraw from that
position. I hear it in the weight of opinion in your Lordships’
Chamber
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:21:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000158">There
are four basic reasons why, in this instance, lifting the arms embargo
would not be a wise move. First, the rebels do not need arms. It is an
unchallenged fact that 3,500 tonnes of arms have been shipped in by way
of Croatia with the assistance of—the noble Lord, Lord Wood,
mentioned the Americans—the CIA. That, too, is unchallenged.
This is funded by the Saudis and the Qataris and is going almost
exclusively to the more jihadist groups, the Wahhabists and the
Salafists, who, though they do not love each other, are fighting
together in
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000159">I
know where those weapons are coming from. I have seen them stacked up
in the underground arms factories in Bosnia. Tito created those arms
factories precisely because he did not know who was going to attack
him—would it be the West or the East? They are the weapons left
over from the Bosnian war. They are being shipped out in large measure
through Croatian ports and airports, and they are making vast sums for
the corrupt forces in the Balkans who are used to these
things.</hs_para>

do not need more weapons; they have more than enough. They have been
provided with the assistance of the CIA and, above all,
funded—foolishly in  my view—by the Qataris on
the one hand and rich 
<?notus-xml column=1006?>businessmen in Saudi Arabia on the other. The arms may not be provided
by the Saudi Arabian Government, but they could stop it if they wished.
Noble Lords may wish to reflect on the fact that the rich businessmen
who are funding the supply of weapons are the same rich businessmen
who, by and large, funded Osama bin Laden in the early days for reasons
which, as we discovered later, were not to our
advantage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:23:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not lifting the arms embargo is that the so-called rebels in Saudi
Arabia are not fit and proper people for us to provide arms to.
Some—maybe even a majority—of this fractured, diverse,
uncontrolled group are as casual about killing and disregarding human
rights as those they oppose. There is not much to differentiate between
the revolting acts committed by both sides. I am not happy that we may
well be contributing to that process and that we may provide weapons
which we give to the right people but which end up in the dominant
faction, as weapons always do in times of conflict, who are the wrong
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:24:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000162">Thirdly,
with great respect to my noble friend Lady Falkner, I know of no case
anywhere where the provision of external weapons has created more
peace. I was opposed to it in the Bosnian war for exactly the same
reasons. There are occasions, of course, when the West can intervene,
and Bosnia/Kosovo is an example of that. We were prepared to come in
and suppress the conflict using our weapons and our forces, but handing
over weapons, supplying them to a chaotic situation run by rebels, is
different. Frankly, I know of no occasion when one of the routes to
peace was to provide more weapons. In fact, it almost always seems to
point in the other
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:24:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

powerful reason for not doing this is that Syria is not what we think
it is. Syria is not the conflict; it is the front line in a wider
conflict that is no longer about the great Satan of the West but is now
about the great heretic in Tehran. What we are seeing being built up
now is a determined attempt, funded by the Saudis and the Qataris, to
create a powerful, radicalised, jihadist Sunni element that can capture
the community of the Sunni as a preparation for a wider war against the
Shia. I do not say that that will happen, but there is a risk of it
doing so. That is the intention behind the provision of these weapons.
What we see in Syria is connected to what we see in Lebanon in ways
that have been very well described. It is connected to what we see in
Egypt, it is connected to what we see in Tunisia, it is connected to
what we see in Libya and it is connected to what we see in Mali. As I
say, this is not about the great Satan of the West, this is about the
preparations that some are deliberately making—to have a wider
regional religious conflict, just as my noble friend Lord Howell said
earlier. Do we really want to stimulate
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

that we understand the position of Russia. We believe that Russia is in
favour of Assad because he is Russia’s last man in the Middle
East. However, there is a deeper reason that we should understand. The
Russian Islamic republics of Dagestan, Chechnya and so on are being
infected by exactly the same movement. They know that the jihadisation
of the Sunni umma is affecting their stability. If they are 
<?notus-xml column=1007?>not very careful, it is in danger of dividing the Russian Federation, or
at least causing great instability. So we have this terrifying
situation of the West being instrumentalised on one side in favour of
the Sunnis, and the Russians being instrumentalised on the other side
in favour of the Shia in what runs a grave risk, although not a
certainty, of widening into a much broader religious conflict that will
engulf the Middle
East<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:27:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Mao
Tse-Tung once referred to the Second World War as the
European civil war. Perhaps it was a civil war but it had global
connections, and those global connections in today’s
interconnected world mean that a regional war can have much wider
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:27:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

East has been attended by the law of unintended consequences. We piled
into Afghanistan and provided weapons for Osama bin Laden because our
enemy’s enemy is our friend, is he not? However, he turned out
to be our primary and most potent enemy. We piled into Iraq because we
wanted to get rid of Saddam Hussein. We supported a Shia majority and
now we find that the border of Iran has effectively moved 400 miles to
the west. The law of unintended consequences is likely to apply in
Syria more than in any other recent circumstance and I really do not
believe that this would be a wise step
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

thing we could do. Why do we want to pursue the issue of arms when
there is an issue of diplomacy still open to us? I repeat the question
I asked the Minister the other day. If it is the case that Saudi Arabia
and Qatar are today funding the very jihadism against which we are
fighting—the jihadism, by the way, that has killed French troops
in Mali—why are we not using international pressure in the form
of the United States and the European Union to persuade Saudi Arabia
and Qatar to stop and thus prevent this? The moment we do that, we will
create the circumstances in which the Russians may well have common
cause with us. We will begin to create a diplomatic space that can be
widened and we will be assisting the rebels in another way. I do not
understand why we are rushing to lift an arms embargo when there is a
serious diplomatic route that would take the steam out of this conflict
by persuading our friends in Qatar and Saudi Arabia to stop providing
the money that is spreading the very jihadism that we know is the
greatest threat we now face. We should not stumble towards arms when
there is diplomacy still to be played
out.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_01_PT_1/935A7F7822D87A8F6391FDD304AE58985B8BE04F" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 1 July 2013">Monday,

victory. A complete ceasefire is therefore in the interests of all,
whether they are combatants or neutrals. One hundred thousand lives

from the 2012 conference on Somalia held in London. That has not, I
agree, resolved all problems, but at least the situation there is very
much better than it was. We should note that some British jihadis were
fighting in Somalia, just as they are now in Syria. It is therefore in

minorities everywhere and progress on nuclear issues. Iran should not
be seen as a necessary enemy or as part of any axis of evil. The United
States has understandable memories of the kidnapping of its diplomats.
Saudi Arabia and Israel, for their different reasons, are likely to
wish to prevent detente between the United States and Iran. I trust
that we will be more statesmanlike than that, as was suggested by my

resignation of its own leader in March, and remains generally fractious
and divided. It is also unable to assert proper command over many of
the rebel groups and has been unable to develop or offer any
substantial support in respect of the humanitarian
crisis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307012000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#1307012000181">What I

conflict finally comes to an end, whatever the outcome. One has only to
cast one’s mind back to the Libyan crisis and the subsequent,
exhaustive efforts made by the West in sourcing and retrieving the
plethora of weapons that were lost in the post-war chaos. Supplying
arms would seem to be a slightly contradictory move, in that it poses a
threat to the very long-term stability that some believe we can achieve
by arming the rebels in the first place. We are making these decisions

course, in the development of what I believe is now a convention for

Technically, for a whole host of legal reasons, we have not declared
war since declaring it against Siam in 1942. The most usual
scenarios today are armed conflict or the commitment of troops. In the
past, Governments were able to act under the royal
prerogative—what Churchill deemed “the people’s

approval for the war in Iraq broke new

firmly developing. I find it difficult to visualise a situation short
of an extreme crisis where armed conflict would be
undertaken without parliamentary approval. I would argue that the
supply of arms, with the possibility of mission creep, comes very near
to engaging in armed conflict, and that there is a need there, too, for
parliamentary approval. Indeed, I would like to hear the argument for
why it would not be covered by the growing

Union lifted its arms embargo, which means that the transfer of arms,
subject to certain conditions, could be legal under European law. There
could be at least five legal objections to supplying arms after the
lifting of that embargo. Even the arms trade treaty signed in June of

1991 my predecessors as law officers enunciated the germination of, and
indeed blessed, the doctrine of intervention in the absence of a
Security Council resolution to provide for a no-fly zone to protect the
Kurds and the Marsh Arabs in Iraq. As the Attorney-General, I was faced
with a similar impasse in the case of Kosovo, where I had to hone and
develop that doctrine and provide what I believed in those particular
circumstances was a legal basis for Ministers and the Armed Forces to
act. Representing the United Kingdom, I had to defend our stance for
five long days in the International Court of Justice at The Hague.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T16:55:48"></hs_TimeCode> is possible,

shall set out briefly what I believe are the necessary requirements
following Kosovo. First, there has to  be convincing evidence,
generally accepted by the international community as a whole, of
extreme humanitarian distress on a large scale requiring immediate and
urgent relief. I have no doubt that this is satisfied. Secondly, in all
the circumstances there is no practical alternative to the use of
force, if lives are to be saved. This is much more difficult; it
depends on the action proposed, and judgment has to be exercised.
Thirdly, the proposed use of force—in this case, the supply of
arms—is necessary and proportionate to the aid proposed, which
is the relief of humanitarian need, and is strictly limited in time and
scope to that end; that is, it is the minimum necessary to achieve that
aim. I argue that the supply of arms could be deemed to come under what
might be called the rubric.</hs_para>

doctrine is not without controversy. Some distinguished academics,
perhaps from the comfort of their ivory towers, find the doctrine
unacceptable. I respect them. They did not have to face the
overwhelming humanitarian disaster that I had to face, or to advise my

are the legal grounds that might justify acting, given the history of
intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq, I would nevertheless counsel
against any intervention until we were satisfied that

my noble friend Lady Falkner of Margravine asked the Minister quite
recently about whether, if the Government were minded to provide
weapons to the opposition in Syria, your Lordships’ House would
have an opportunity to express a view. As the noble and learned Lord
has made clear, the Minister was unable to give a full and clear reply.
She seems to have moved things forward a little today in her
introductory speech. I thank her for that, as have other noble Lords,
and for the opportunity for today’s debate. However, it seems
clear even at this stage in the debate that there is very strong
resistance to the idea that the Government should arm the rebels or
should participate in arming the rebels, so I seek specific assurance
from my noble friend that were the Government at any stage minded to
move in that direction, today’s debate would not be regarded as
an appropriate calling in of advice from your Lordships’ House
and that there would be a subsequent debate, as has been undertaken for
the other place, whether or not your Lordships’ House is in
recess.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070113000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#13070113000004">This
is a major issue, and I wish to say why I think it is so. When the
Berlin wall came down and the Cold War drew to a close, we all rejoiced
at the opportunity for a change in the world order we had grown up
with, a world order in which it seemed clear that there were the good
guys and the bad guys and we were the good guys. In a very interesting
and important speech, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Truro
advised us against regarding foreign policy as best conducted on the
basis of good and evil, and when a right reverend Prelate tells us to
be careful about regarding things on the basis of good and evil, we
would be wise to pay attention.</hs_para>

reverend Prelate was right because at that time the possibility arose
of a new world order constructed on a different basis, a multipolar
world where there would be various kinds of arrangements and
engagements, but we failed to achieve that. We paid attention to a
long-term intervention in Afghanistan when perhaps something much
shorter and sharper would have been appropriate, if anything was. We
got ourselves embroiled in Iraq in a completely
inappropriate way. I supported the intervention in Libya, but we must
accept that there have been untoward consequences in other
countries apart from the situation in Libya. The most important thing
is that in failing to create a multipolar and robust new world order we
left a vacuum of power structures, and nature abhors a vacuum, so when
the Arab awakening arose, it arose without any kind of structure that
could 
<?notus-xml column=1015?>enable people to move forward in appropriate ways and we find something
much more destructive, regressive and

situation in Syria, I fear that having had the opportunity of moving to
a new world order that was not based on one side and the
other—good and evil, black and white—we are falling back
into precisely that, perhaps with many of the same actors. It does not
seem to me that it is simply a question of Mr Assad and his colleagues
against the Syrian rebels. I see Russian warships in the eastern
Mediterranean lining up and saying to Mr Obama, “I’m
sorry. We draw a line”. Although it is the case, as noble Lords
have said, that Mr Assad is seen as Russia’s man in the region,
Mr Putin is saying to the United States, “Stop recurrently
operating without Security Council resolutions; stop taking it upon
yourself to decide what you and a coalition of your willing colleagues
will do. That is not international law. That is not an international
order that we will accept, so we are drawing a line, and we are going
to support Mr Assad, whether he is a good guy or a bad guy, because
there is a bigger question here of whether you are going to respect
some kind of order or whether you will be the determinant of
order”. I think Mr Obama realises that and is a little cautious.
It would not be a good thing for this country to be liaising with
Senator Kerry to push President Obama into some kind of
intervention.</hs_para>

President Assad. I remember the first time that I went to Damascus,
some years ago, specifically because I felt that Syria was an important
area and I wanted to meet the Foreign Minister to see whether there was
any possibility of an agreement between Israel and Syria at that time.
There were indications that there was a preparedness to engage. Indeed,
the Syrians said, “Yes, we would like to find a way of engaging
and finding a peace agreement, because we believe that peace in the
region would be worth while. Are the British Government prepared to
engage?”. Well, the British Government did engage, but they did
so with a finger-wagging diplomacy which said, “If you do not do
what we say, it will be worse for
you<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:05:29"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

therefore find ourselves with everything deteriorating and much blood
being spilt. People can say with ease, “These are the good guys
and this is the axis of evil”. In truth, however, some of those
whom we regard as our allies have been contributing to some of the
difficulties in the region. My noble friend Lord Ashdown has pointed
out that weapons are coming, if not from the Saudi Arabian Government,
then at least from Saudi Arabian businesses’ pockets, and from

but not about engaging; on the contrary, we need to be
energetic. When a problem of this kind threatens to blow out all over
the place, we need to help to create some security in the region. We
need to be more energetic in helping to sustain the stability of Jordan
and Lebanon. Certainly, when I was in Lebanon recently, I was much more
disturbed when I came away than before I went. It was clear
that things were deteriorating very quickly indeed. Even Turkey, which
we thought was a relatively stable country, is no longer as
stable as it was on its eastern borders; even within the
country itself, difficulties are arising. Of course, we have not
contributed to an entirely stable Iraq; that much is
clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:07:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not

doing all that we can to encourage others to assist in the stability of
countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey. Their humanitarian
problems are enormous—by the way, not all the refugees arriving

the outcome in Syria may or may not leave Mr Assad in place. We do not
know. I have often heard Governments, including those in London, saying
that they would never negotiate with this, that or the other
rascal—only to find themselves doing exactly that five, 10 or 20
years later. I remember saying that we would have to talk with the
Taliban, and was told I was a naive fool who was on the wrong side.
Well, now we are negotiating with the Taliban when it is far too late,
when it knows perfectly well that it has only to sit tight for a few
more months and watch us depart, tails between our legs. Had we

careful, but we should be energetic, not sitting back or avoiding
getting involved. We should not be providing weapons in a situation
where there are more than enough, but be energetically involved in
trying to persuade our allies, and those with whom we differ, that the
future is to be found in trying to stabilise the region. If not, I fear
that my noble friend Lord Ashdown is right: we may be looking at the
beginning of a bloody Sunni/Shia civil war across the whole of the
region. By the way, it will affect us here. I have already had
colleagues at the other end of the Building telling me about Shia
constituents who are worried about what is going to happen when some of
their Sunni counterparts in London constituencies start to take these

events in the Middle East could not be more timely or more necessary. I

their equivalents

Britain’s capacity to wield influence in the Middle East is on

influence there by acting alone has all but disappeared, we should not
ignore the uncomfortable reality that the Middle East has a continuing
and perhaps growing capacity to influence us, whether in respect of our
energy security, the threat of terrorism, the rising flow of refugees
and asylum seekers or the risk of spreading hostilities on
Europe’s doorstep.

will focus my remarks on three topics: the civil war in Syria, the
prospects for negotiations with Iran following its recent presidential
election, and that well known oxymoron, the Middle East peace process.
During the two and a half years since Syria began its slide into civil
war, no party has emerged with any credit, and none has achieved any of
its objectives in a sustainable way. While the regime of Bashar
al-Assad has hung on by the skin of its teeth, it has lost all
legitimacy and has committed horrendous war crimes, for which one must
hope that it will one day be held to account. The insurgents, while
controlling substantial parts of the country, have not yet rid
themselves of the Assad regime, have not achieved a convincing degree
of unity and have not reassured minorities that they would be secure in
a post-Assad Syria. The insurgents have also undoubtedly committed a
number of human rights abuses
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:12:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070113000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#13070113000018">The
international community has been prevented by a series of Russian and
Chinese vetoes in the UN Security Council from fulfilling its
responsibility to protect Syria’s civilian population from a
regime that has seen fit to bombard them with Scud missiles, cluster
bombs and, in all probability, poison gas. It is frankly a sorry story,
and one that should discourage us from thinking that more of the same
policies will bring about results. Having listened to the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Truro speaking about good and
evil—about which I am sure he is a better judge than I—I
still assert that what the Assad regime, father and son, have done to
Syrian civilians is
evil.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070113000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#13070113000019">The
longer the civil war continues, the worse the outcomes are likely to be
for all concerned. Signs of regional instability spreading beyond
Syria’s borders are there for all to see, in particular in the
Lebanon. It is in that context of abject failure that one needs to
judge the Government’s decision to prevent any extension of the
EU’s arms embargo on Syria. I think that they were entirely
justified in doing so. The analogy is not so much with Bosnia in the
1990s but—as the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, said—with
the Spanish civil war of the 1930s, when the democracies, Britain and
France, imposed an arms embargo while the dictators, Germany and Italy,
poured in arms and soldiers. Now, Russia and Iran play that role, and
Russia is preparing to send to Syria the S300 weapons system, which
will have major regional destabilising results. The Spanish 
<?notus-xml column=1018?>story did not end terribly well, and nor would an extension of the
EU’s arms embargo on Syria have done
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:14:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070113000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#13070113000020">Since
the decision was made to drop the EU arms embargo, a debate has raged
in this country—and in this House this afternoon—over
whether or not to arm the insurgents. The debate has focused on that
issue almost to the exclusion of all other aspects of the Syrian
crisis, when we should surely be taking a wider look at the challenges
we face. Amid all the denunciations of arms supplies, the gold medal
for hyperbole and opportunism must surely go to the Mayor of
London<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Not all
the arguments deployed against supplying arms seem terribly convincing.
Will refusing to supply weapons make us less vulnerable to terrorist
attacks in future? I doubt it. Will the likelihood that some of the
weapons will fall into the wrong hands put us directly at risk? Our
soldiers in Afghanistan are not being killed by arms that the West
supplied in the 1980s but by improvised explosive devices. Is enabling
the insurgents to hold their ground better against Assad really
contrary to our interests? I doubt that, too.</hs_para>

then, are three elements of a wider strategy, which we might consider
pursuing. First, we should put much more effort and emphasis into the
earliest possible convening of a negotiating conference and seek to
underpin that conference with a robust UN Security Council resolution
based on the ideas of Kofi Annan and Lakhdar Brahimi for a transition.
Secondly, instead of haggling with the Russians over whether
Assad’s forces have already used sarin and other poison gases,
we should concentrate on preventing any further use of it by tabling a
UN Security Council resolution requiring Assad to admit UN chemical
weapons inspectors and give them unfettered access to any sites where
past or future allegations of use are made. Thirdly, we should seek to
agree with the Russians and Chinese that none of the five permanent
members of the Security Council would send any weapons or ammunition to
Syria during the period up to and including the negotiating
conference—a self-denying ordinance that could be extended if
all parties were negotiating a transition in good faith. This would
underline the crucial role of the conference in future decisions about
the supply of
weapons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070113000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#13070113000022">On
Iran—I hope that the Minister will fill the lacuna in her
opening statement about that country when she replies to the
debate—it is no doubt wise to be cautious about overstating the
significance of last month’s presidential election. We have yet
to see what sort of negotiating hand the new president will be given by
the supreme leader, but the fact that an election with genuine elements
of democracy occurred and was accepted in place of the travesty of 2009
must surely be welcome, as must be the shift from
the raucous populism of Ahmadinejad’s public
pronouncements. So when negotiations with the 3 plus 3
resume, there could be a genuine opportunity—and it could be
just about the last one on offer as Iran’s nuclear programme

grand master of modern diplomacy, Henry Kissinger, advocated that, in
negotiations with obdurate adversaries—he was, of course,
talking about the North Vietnamese—it worked better to put a

incremental approach of small steps, which is what the 3 plus 3 have
tended to deploy up to now. That would seem sage advice at the present
juncture with Iran. Should we not now be ready to accept that Iran can
continue with a programme of low-level enrichment so long as intensive
international monitoring through the IAEA’s additional protocol,
and probably other special inspection mechanisms, are put in place?
Would it not be wise for us to encourage the US to open up in parallel

conclusion, and very briefly, I shall say a word about the Middle East
peace process. However discouraging the auguries, this is surely no
time to subject the new US Secretary of State, who seems to be rolling
up his sleeves with a will, to a deluge of cynical disparagement, as so
many commentators are doing. Rather, we, too, should be thinking of
ways in which to help the process forward. Should we not be thinking of
imaginative ways in which Israeli settlements on the West Bank could
remain within a Palestinian state and Israeli Arab citizens could find
a more secure place within an Israeli state? It is a long time since
any new element was introduced into that longest running dialogue of
the deaf, and I wonder whether it is not time to think a bit wider than

I slightly take issue is more a moral one than a foreign policy one
about the line between good and evil. Far too often we hear portrayed
in public discourse, particularly in regard to foreign policy, that
there are unblemished good people and despicable bad people. We align
ourselves with the good but, when we intervene, we find out that they
were not quite as good as we thought and the bad were not
quite as bad as we thought. I am reminded of <I>The Gulag

the line between good and evil runs not through religious groups or
nation states but through each and every human heart. That is something

disaster in Syria. Therefore, I went to Lebanon, probably fairly

of the hopeful things which struck me was that I had expected to see

Syria into their homes and the humanitarian aid was being distributed

a couple of days, we went to Zahlé, a Christian town overlooking
the Bekaa Valley, where one evening I went to the home of a very

the quick fix was and what needed to be done. In a fairly heavy Arab
accent, he said, “You need to understand history.” When I
replied, “Tell me about it”, he said, “No, you
need to understand your history in our history.” Again, I did
not quite understand, so he patiently explained to me that the best

not go back to London but to Beirut. Thanks to a backstage pass at the
American University of Beirut, I managed to get access to a
comprehensive reading list and sat in café-bars in Hamra reading
up on what had happened. I was frankly amazed because there was much of
the history that I had not appreciated. It stretched back to 1798 and
the Napoleonic invasion of Syria, which then led the British to
consider that their line of supply to India, the jewel in the crown of
the Empire, was potentially under threat. We immediately decided to
invade Afghanistan and had the first Anglo-Afghan war because that
country was to be a buffer state. We did not like the person in charge
there, so we changed him and put in someone we thought was more
favourable to us. They did not last long and we were back 30 years
later, involved in the second Anglo-Afghan war, this time with a larger
force to back up a despotic leader who mercilessly oppressed his
people. However, in exchange, he allowed his foreign policy literally
to be dictated by the British. That situation continued for a
while.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070113000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0001.htm#13070113000032">The
Russians also had interests in and wanted to make moves towards India,

a carve-up between Russia and Britain—no Afghans were

about British foreign policy, it is that the one area in which we are
deficient is drawing lines on a map. We do not have a particularly good
track record in that regard, whether it was Radcliffe in India,
Pakistan and East Pakistan, Durand, or Syke-Picot in Syria. We made
those and further agreements that culminated in the collapse of the
Ottoman Empire, which the noble Lord, Lord Wood, mentioned in his
excellent speech. The area was also divided up under the Mesopotamia
mandate. I read writers such as Gertrude Bell, TE Lawrence and Aubrey

in that region. Therefore, when we come in with thoughts about arming
one group or another, or intervening in a particular area, it can be
misconstrued. I have noticed that there are three historians in the
Foreign Office, and my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary,
as a historian, is keen to expand our historical access in the Foreign
Office. The current historian there has remarked that some of the

that the past 10 or 20 years have not been too distinguished either. We
need to be very conscious of that. The only legitimate means by which
we can engage in the Middle East is through the United Nations. The
fact that we cannot do more through the United Nations is in many ways
a result of what happened when the Chinese and Russians felt that they
were duped by certain resolutions relating to Iraq and Libya.
Therefore, the first thing we could do would be to repair those
relations with China and Russia so that we get a unified

Lord Bates, in our debates. He brings a real sense of deep humanitarian
commitment, of learning and of analysis informed by human reality.
Those are great assets in our deliberations, for which all sides of the
House should be

I was in Israel and Jordan, where I had a wide range of very
interesting conversations. As I listened to the noble Baroness
introducing the debate, I thought that what she was saying related very
well to the preoccupations in those conversations. However, what was
telling during the few days that I was in that part of the world was
the almost total preoccupation with Egypt. I think that this House must
take what is happening in Egypt extremely seriously. If what is
happening there deteriorates and things spiral still further out of
control, it is not impossible that that will put a different
perspective on our current preoccupations, because we will be
absolutely consumed with the implications of what is
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:33:04"></hs_TimeCode>taking place.
Clearly, the issue is highly complex and it affects the stability of
the whole region.</hs_para>

was challenged by the very interesting contribution of the noble Lord,
Lord Ashdown. I think that in future I shall refer to it as the
“Ashdown analysis”. That, too, has to be taken very
seriously. What is really going on and what really is the strategic
situation in which we are caught up? It is worth looking at some
illustrations of that: the pressure on Turkey and how that interplays
with domestic politics within Turkey; the involvement, to which the
noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, referred, of Iran, and the game that Iran is
probably playing; the destabilisation, again, of Lebanon—just in
the past 10 days there have been serious casualties in northern
Lebanon, with the possibility of another collapse of order in
Lebanon—and tension on the border with Israel.</hs_para>

there were great celebrations in the Foreign Office at the conclusion
of the arms trade treaty. This was seen as a triumph of bipartisan,
consistent work by a lot of officials and Ministers, who had brought
about a satisfactory solution. However, I found it quite extraordinary
that virtually at the same time the conversation was beginning to
develop about the possibility of sending arms to the rebels in Syria. I
just could not reconcile such a proposal with all the satisfaction that
had been taken in concluding the arms trade treaty. Obviously, we all
know that weapons are very dangerous, and central to that treaty is
that weapons in the wrong hands are very dangerous indeed. Therefore,
their use is a consideration that must always be borne in mind in
relation to the export of arms. It is important to ask in whose hands
the arms will finally end up, how they will be applied and what the
objectives are of the people into whose hands they may ultimately
l<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:36:46"></hs_TimeCode>and. Also
central to the arms trade treaty is a preoccupation with human rights.
How could we talk about exporting arms to people who—although
obviously not on the scale of the Syrian Government—are too
involved in the crude abuse of human rights,? I have never heard those
two contrary elements of our situation reconciled to my satisfaction,
and I wonder whether we can hear more about that before the debate
ends<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:37:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

two about humanitarian assistance. The first point to make is that
humanitarian agencies in this country are desperate to get access to
all parts of Syria and are very anxious that the Government should
pursue this with all possible vigour, not least in the Security Council
in trying to bring the Russians on board, at least on this.
Everyone—rebels and government—should be pressurising all
parties to the conflict to make access by humanitarian agencies a
possibility. Of course, there is a role for the UN Security Council in
that context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>.
Great credit should be given to the British Government for what they
have done and the lead they have given, but there is still a tremendous
amount to be done in getting the world to face its responsibility of
fulfilling the pledges that it has given. It is cruelly cynical to be
at conferences at which great amounts of assistance are pledged but do
not materialise. The current UN appeal is to last for only for six
months, and in June only 28% of the $5.2 billion needed had
been
subscribed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:39:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

men, women and children are in desperate need of assistance. Since the
conflict erupted, more than 1.5 million people have fled to
neighbouring countries. One has only to think of Jordan, where I was
last week. There is a huge burden on Jordan. In one camp alone, the
Zaatari refugee camp, there are 150,000 newly arrived Syrians. That is
on top of the 550,000 refugees from Syria in Jordan as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:40:00"></hs_TimeCode> and the
600,000 Syrians who were already living in
Jordan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:40:10"></hs_TimeCode>. If one

like to feel that whatever our profound reservations about human rights
in Jordan, it is a relatively stable country. But for how long will
Jordan remain stable? Some have estimated that within a very short
number of years, 25% of the population of Jordan will be refugees. How
does one sustain stability and security in that context? Perhaps I may
add that it also puts our own preoccupations about the movement of
people, immigration and refugees in a very different light when one
sees what the Jordanian people are absorbing and carrying, the burden
on them and the effect on their economy and

settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian issue more urgent than ever, and
not less. I absolutely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bates, that
lasting, enduring solutions have to belong to the people in whose name
they are being reached. They cannot be imposed on the people because
they would not last. A settlement has to be rooted in a
conviction across a wide cross-section of the population
that it is something that they want and believe
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:41:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Last week, I

do not belong to the ranks of those who despair of any movement in the
situation. Tantalisingly, there is some chance of progress but if there
is to be progress one thing is absolutely clear. We have to increase
the number of Palestinians and Israelis being exposed to each other not
as a problem, as analysis or in a stigmatised sort of way, but as
people who are 
<?notus-xml column=1024?>encountering each other, who are hearing each other’s
perspectives and sharing each other’s agonies and
professionalism. At a very interesting conference in which noble Lords

is an oversimplification to describe this conflict, as I have often, as
a Sunni-Shia or Arab-Iranian war. In fact, it started as an uprising,
mainly by the majority Sunni population, against a brutal regime
dominated by the minority Alawite sect, of which Bashar al-Assad is a
member, and exacerbated—this is not often mentioned—by
widespread deprivation in Syria caused by five years of drought. It has
now become a regional conflict between Sunni and Shia forces, backed on
the one side by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and on the other by Iran,
Russia and Hezbollah. The escalation of this proxy war, increasingly
involving non-Syrian fighters on both sides, is a threat to the whole
region and beyond. It is not a conflict in which Britain has a direct
stake. What we do have is an interest in working
energetically—as the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, has
argued—for peace in an unstable area.</hs_para>

are not alone in having consistently underestimated the extent to which
President Assad and his Government can survive this externally fuelled
onslaught. The military strength that Bashar al-Assad inherited from
his father has also been underestimated. Of perhaps equal importance,
so has the degree of support which the regime still enjoys from Syrian
minorities and, indeed, from a significant proportion of the Sunni
business community. The Prime Minister has claimed that we are trying
to help form a transitional Government in Damascus which will respect
the rights of Christians and other minorities in Syria.
Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:48:08"></hs_TimeCode> I may

late 1990s enjoyed greater freedom of worship and absence of
discrimination than any other Christian community in the Middle East.
We should not underestimate the very real fear of Christians in Syria,
now much diminished in number but which until recently included a large
number of Syrian exiles from Iraq, of any likely successor Government
in Damascus. The same fear must be shared by the Druze and other
minorities, including the very small Jewish and Yazidi communities. I

Risby:</Member></B> It is always a great pleasure to hear from the
noble Lord, given his considerable experience of the Middle East and of
Syria in particular. I join all those who have spoken today in
applauding the Minister for the comprehensive way in which she set out
her speech
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000002">This
debate is indeed timely as we grapple with the horrors of Syria, the
instability in the Middle East and the Maghreb and a feeling that
something must be done. However, in common with the citizens of France,
the United States and others, there is a widespread revulsion in this
country against any kind of involvement. Young British lives have been
lost in Afghanistan and Iraq because of some poor political and
logistical judgments that have dismayed the British people, and we have
seen an echo of these problems on our
streets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:53:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000003">My
first visit to Syria was after leaving university in the 1970s. In
2000, President Hafez al-Assad died and the then Foreign Secretary
asked me to join him to attend the funeral of the President in Damascus
and to meet his son, Bashar, who had become President because of the
death of his brother. It is worth remembering that there was a mood of
optimism at the time that this young man, who had worked as an
ophthalmologist in London, who was secular and married to a
British-born wife, could somehow transform and modernise his country.
Indeed, there were substantial improvements in the economy and rising
prosperity—to a large extent Syria is self-sufficient in
food—and, as the noble Lord has just pointed out, there remained
the extraordinary and unique ability of the different communities to
co-exist happily there, as Gertrude Bell observed 100 years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:54:19"></hs_TimeCode>. It is worth
reminding ourselves of the tragedy of the two archbishops, by contrast,
who have been kidnapped—one of whom is a long-standing friend of
mine—and the Syrian Catholic priest who, in the most grotesque
circumstances, was killed only last
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000004">I
subsequently became a director of the British Syrian Society and so
visited the country often and met President Assad many times. However,
when the protests there started more than two years ago and the Syrian
Government reacted appallingly, I immediately resigned, and I have been
active in trying to assist in humanitarian efforts to that tragic
country ever
since.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000005">Put<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:55:11"></hs_TimeCode>

me deal with some of the external aspects, which have been touched on a
number of times today. The stability of our good friend Jordan is now
clearly at risk; it is fragile at the best of times. There are perhaps
more than 1 million Syrian refugees out of a population of 13.2
million. It is a small country lacking in resources, notably water.
Most refugees are concentrated in the north. Syrians are
competing—this is very difficult—with Jordanians for
low-paid jobs, school places and healthcare. Rents have gone up but
tourism has collapsed. The financial and humanitarian situation is dire
for Jordan and its very existence is under pressure. It would be a
great loss to the stability of the
region<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:56:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000007">As
the noble Lord, Lord Williams, so graphically pointed out, the
situation in Lebanon is, if anything, worse, with perhaps 1 million
refugees comprising a sizeable proportion of the population. There will
be no traditional Arab tourism this summer. The country has suffered in
living memory, as we all recall, from a grotesque civil war, an Israeli
invasion and in effect a Syrian occupation. Having gone through all
this, intercommunal tensions and violence are now tearing at the
country’s delicate social fabric. Turkey, of course, has a huge
problem too with numbers, and that grows every
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:56:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000008">However,
over-reaching this, as the noble Lords, Lord Ashdown and Lord Sheikh,
said, are the daily eruptions of violence and murder between Sunni and
Shi’ite—as spillover in part from what is happening in
Syria—in Pakistan, Iraq, Egypt and Lebanon. The social fabric of
Lebanon and Jordan directly, and the coherence of other countries in
the region, are now at risk because of these splits of a ferocious
religious
variety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:57:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000009">I
simply pose this question: whatever the difficulties, are the risks of
supplying selected weaponry and training to chosen anti-Assad rebel
groups greater than the potential immolation of the entire
region—because that is what we are seeing? One hundred thousand
have already been killed, millions have been displaced, either
internally or externally, and Iran and Russia continue to supply
sophisticated weaponry. My right honourable friend William Hague and my
honourable friend Alistair Burt have worked tirelessly to find a way
forward, as has the Prime Minister. We have been energetic in
humanitarian relief and other support. However, we have the obvious
situation—there is no point in being in denial about
this—that again and again President Assad has simply refused to
consider a political track, whether it has been initiated by the United
Nations or the Arab League. For him it is quite simply regime and
personal survival. That will not change if he thinks his superior
weaponry will
prevail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:58:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000010">We
all hope for a Geneva II—our Government are certainly helping
actively in this pursuit—and that it can provide an opportunity
for the new Iranian President to be road tested. However, what really
needs to emerge is a blueprint—at least in embryonic form at
first—that gives some assurance to the Syrian people that their
rights, and particularly their minority rights, will be
constitutionally protected as part of this process of dialogue, and
that if necessary there will be an international force to oversee this.
I perfectly accept 
<?notus-xml column=1028?>that it is counterproductive to call for President Assad to go now,
ahead of any possible dialogue, whatever the justification—and
there certainly is a great deal of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T17:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

situation, the risks of declining to consider the supply of
sophisticated weaponry and even additional basic equipment such as body
armour will actually make the dialogue less likely, and some sort of
declaration of constitutional intent should be formulated. The
alternative that is now evolving before our eyes risks the collapse of
at least two of the neighbouring countries right next door to Syria and
a religious war of medieval
proportions.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_01_PT_1/882791A4AEEA25CA244ED857BFBB9C47ABAA89D0" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 1 July 2013">Monday,

Desai:</Member></B> My Lords, we are having a very rich debate. My
noble friend Lord Wood started by mentioning the collapse of the
Ottoman empire. We were then treated to very good historical accounts
by the noble Lords, Lord Howell and Lord Ashdown, while the noble Lord,
Lord Bates, gave us a flavour of what he has been reading. I could have
spared him the trouble had he read my book, <I>Rethinking Islamism</I>,
where I do it in 100
pages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:00:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I see the Syrian civil war as just one chapter in a 40 year-old crisis
of Islamic society in the Middle East. It started in 1973 after the
third defeat of the Arab armies by Israel and of course the quadrupling
of the price of oil. The secular socialist alternative in all the
countries of the Middle East lost its prestige and a lot of people in
the region turned to religion as the answer to their problems. If we
follow that trail—we could go back to the Sykes-Picot affair,
but let me stick to past 40 years—in country after country, and
between countries, there has been a revival of religion, a hardening of
Sunni and Shia identities, and among the Sunnis the revival of
Wahhabism and Salafism, which has been encouraged partly because the
Saudis got lots of money from the rise in oil prices.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070127000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000014">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:02:35"></hs_TimeCode>
Iran-Iraq war lasted for eight years. It was one of the biggest wars in
the Middle East, but none of us intervened. We may have supplied arms,
but we did not intervene. Saddam proceeded to destroy as much as he
could all the Shias’ means of livelihood in Iraq. I supported
the Iraq intervention, not because of weapons of mass destruction but
because I considered Saddam to be a danger to his own people. We have
to think further along those lines. We now have a much more explicit
chapter in the Shia-Sunni conflict in the Middle East and it is not
going to stop. Whether we intervene, whether we have a Geneva II or a
Geneva VI, the conflict will break out in another location, because
this is a deep crisis in the Muslim society of the Middle East that has
not yet been resolved as it has to confront modernity and its own weak
position in the Middle East and to reconcile religion and civic life.
We have here something that we ought to take a much broader
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>
of.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070127000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000015">If we do
not intervene now, we will intervene later. I assume that it is going
to go on and I do not think that we have the choice of not intervening.
Sooner or later we shall intervene because this war is not going to
come to an end any time soon. If we consider this to be a long-running
Shia-Sunni conflict, we have to ask 
<?notus-xml column=1029?>what the dangers are. In this case, and for the first time in 40 years,
there is a serious danger of this war becoming much more general across
the Middle East than any previous war has done, such as that between
Iran and Iraq.</hs_para>

Lords have already mentioned that Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have been
affected. Very soon, Israel will be affected. Given the strategic
weapons that the Russians are giving the Syrians, it will not be much
longer before there is a general war in the Middle East. It has nothing
to do with whether we intervene or not; the dynamic of the war is such
that there will end up being a general war across the Middle East.
Whether we do or do not give any weapons, we will end up with Sunni
terrorist groups or Shia terrorist groups. It is true to say that we
are watching <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>a
general conflagration in the Middle East, and unless we understand its
full dimensions we will be too preoccupied with our own particular,

picture.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070127000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070127000017">We
ought to be thinking about this in the following terms. Would an
intervention on our part now bring about all the unintended
consequences that the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, told us about? There
are always unintended consequences following any action, so that is
nothing new. Obviously we will do some things wrong, we will get into a
mess and it will take a long time, but eventually some good may come
out of it. There is one good thing that we would like to come out any
intervention, whether an armed intervention or a diplomatic one: a
lessening of the probability of this crisis continuing for another 40
years. It would have to be a general confluence of all the Middle
Eastern countries, not just Syria. The Israel-Palestine question would
have to be a part of it. Unless we take a view on the very
comprehensive nature of what is going on here, we will not be effective
in our
intervention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:06:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
Obviously if there is an armed intervention, it would be better if we
had friends to come along with us, but it is more important that we get
along with them and take a comprehensive view of where we can intervene

already<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:07:16"></hs_TimeCode>

make a couple of points that are perhaps more controversial. The two
subsequent big questions are going to be Iran and the problem of
Israel-Palestine. I have not actually understood why Iran cannot have
nuclear weapons. If India, Pakistan and Israel can have them, why
cannot the Iranians? Pakistan is a very unstable democracy; or rather,
not even a democracy at all. The more countries that have acquired
nuclear weapons since 1945, the less the probability that anyone will
use them. Indeed, nuclear weapons are among the few weapons that have
not been used since their invention, unlike gunpowder. We ought to take
a much broader view of what we object to in the Iranian plan for
nuclear weapons. Obviously there is the fear that if Iran has nuclear
weapons, the existence of Israel will be threatened. Therefore, any
general and comprehensive dialogue on the Middle East has to include
Iran’s ability to have nuclear weapons while at the same time
guaranteeing that the Israeli nation will survive and is not threatened
by anyone in the Middle
East<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:08:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Israel-Palestine problem, which a number of noble Lords have talked

I am old enough, and I have been a member of the Labour Party for 40

Afshar:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi,
for this very timely debate. We all seem to have heard different things
in the Minister’s statement. I got the impression that the
Government were intent on negotiations and that the idea was that there
should be quiet diplomacy before any kind of action. If I have heard
right, I would applaud that and am very grateful because that was what

most important consideration about intervention in the Middle East is
whether it would help yet another “fundamentalist” group
of religious people. In my experience—both as a teacher of
Islamic law and of courses on the Middle East, and as someone born and
raised in Iran—it is when religion rather than citizenship
becomes the badge of identity that death, destruction and the complete
misuse of faith become
evident.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070113000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070113000077">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:11:44"></hs_TimeCode>
do not recognise the presentation of these borderless countries in the
Middle East where people do not know their identity and they wonder
about modernity. I had the good fortune to be born and raised in Iran
in the century when modernisation and secularism were very much part of
people’s experience. Not only was I raised as a secular person,
with my religion accepted, but so were my mother and grandfather. In
our family there are at least three generations, going back to the very
beginning of the century, of accepting secularism without undermining
faith. I grew up as a Muslim and used to fast with my one non-secular
grandmother, who was very religious, but at the same time I was sent to
a Catholic school run by the sisters of St Vincent de Paul. I was then
sent to a Protestant school in the UK and subsequently went to a
secular university at York. At no time did I ever feel defensive about
my religion or the lack of it. When I was growing up, our life was
patterned by Islamic feast days and fast days but, at the same time, by
the Persian new year, which dates back 6,000 years to the Zoroastrian
era. Muslims, Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians—people of any
religion and none—lived, worked and intermarried. They had no
problems—so much so that I learnt a great deal about
Christianity through my aunt’s sister, who is a nun in the UK
and has headed a convent. It seems to me that celebrating diversity, at
least in Iran, goes a very long way
back<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:13:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070113000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070113000078">I
also fear that I will have to disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Desai,
who I admire greatly. It seems to me that the Iran-Iraq war was not
about religion but was very much about borders and fear of religion.
That fear of religion is exactly what we are seeing right now in Egypt.
Egyptians are beginning to realise what fundamentalism, or any
“ism”, means. I would suggest that Islamism, as
experienced in Saudi Arabia, Iran and elsewhere, and Zionism, as
experienced in Israel 
<?notus-xml column=1031?>and elsewhere, have nothing to do with the teachings of the holy books.
They have everything to do with grasping an identity, misinterpreting
the texts and imposing a climate of fear, including fear of the
other—those who do not have our religion. I had no idea who was
a Shia or a Sunni and I still do not among all the Muslims with whom I
work, and work very effectively, in a country where—thank
heaven—Muslim women can sit in the House of Lords and be
Ministers. I would like to wish very much the same thing for much of
the Middle East.</hs_para>

Shia or whatever—is going to be highly counterproductive and
would actually cause more damage than not intervening at all. It seems
to me that much of the Middle East is waking up to the fear of Islam
and of what it can do. That is why the Turks are in the streets and why
the Egyptians are in the streets. There is a real uprising from among
the people themselves. They do not need to be told and certainly do not
need intervention that would help a particular religious group and give
it any kind of advantage. The situation in the Middle East is
tumultuous enough and things are going from bad to worse. The very last
thing that we need as Middle Easterners is for any Government to help
one group rather than another. Of course negotiations are difficult and
of course it is not easy to be peacemakers but, in my experience, what
the British are fantastically good at is quiet diplomacy. That is where
they are sans pareil. There is no other group I know who can work so

Morris of Bolton:</Member></B> My Lords, it is always a pleasure to
follow the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, and I, too, thank my noble
friend Lady Warsi for giving us this opportunity to debate this
important and timely issue. There have been some exceptional and
powerful speeches, which will merit rereading, I suspect, for some time
to come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000002">It is
now two and a half years since the tragic death of a street vendor in
Tunisia, Mohamed Bouazizi, which triggered the astonishing train of
events across the Arab world. These past 31 months have witnessed
uprisings, the overthrow of regimes, the death of dictators and the
election of new Governments; quickly followed by disillusion with those
Governments as they failed to meet the expectations of their citizens.
These months have also witnessed the deaths of tens of thousands of
men, women and children in Syria. What started in Syria as a political
uprising in March 2011, as many noble Lords have said, is now
increasingly religious. As the conflict enters its third year,
Syria’s tragedy is that sectarian divisions and religious hatred
are fuelling the conflict, pitting Syrian against Syrian.</hs_para>

we say that Bashar al-Assad is a brutal dictator but we must also
acknowledge, and condemn, the barbarous acts of cruelty perpetrated by
some of the rebel groups; the kidnap of Christians, the wanton killing
of Shia and the gruesome and public murder last month of 15 year-old
Mohammad Qataa in Aleppo by Islamic jihadists. These factors should
inform our judgement when we consider arming the rebels, some of whom
are only one or two steps away from al-Qaeda. Syria, like whole swathes
of the Middle East, is awash with weapons, as my noble friends Lord
Ashdown and Lord Alderdice have explained. If we add to these weapons,
we can have no guarantee that they would not be exchanged, stolen or
fall into the hands of extremists. I fear the belief that the weapons
would somehow stay in the hands of secular, pro-western forces, or that
they can be tracked, simply would not hold true in the fog of war, with
the utter unpredictability and fast changing dynamism of events on the
ground.</hs_para>

completely understand and am in no way critical of those who call for
the arming of the rebels, and my noble friend Lord Risby is persuasive
in his argument. The natural reaction of anyone observing such
appalling bloodshed, with the death toll approaching 100,000, is to
want to do something. However, I question that arming the rebels is the
something that we should do.</hs_para>

our hands and do nothing. Our actions should be guided by what we can
do—energetically, as my noble friend Lord Alderdice

neighbours of Syria find themselves in. I am proud that Britain has
already spent £348 million on providing critical assistance to
Syria’s refugees, making this the UK’s largest ever
response to a humanitarian disaster. But there is much more to do. As
the intensity of the crisis increases, 53% of all the Syrian refugees
in Jordan have entered since the beginning of 2013. As of 15 June,
there were 545,694 Syrian refugees in Jordan. That is 9% of
the total population of Jordan. Translated into UK terms, it is as if a
refugee population equivalent to the number of people living in
Scotland had arrived in our country and become our responsibility. That
would be massively destabilising to us—just imagine, as the
noble Lord, Lord Judd, invited us to do, the impact on the Jordanian
economy and public services, not to mention the scarce resource of
water. We must do all that we can to support Jordan and all the other

I finish, I wish to turn to another conflicted area where sanity also
needs to prevail: Palestine. While the world, rightly, concentrates on
the savagery of events in Syria, we must never forget, nor diminish our
efforts to find a solution to the occupation and the oppression of the
Palestinian people. The time is rapidly running out for a viable
two-state solution, and with it Palestinian hope for the normality of
life that we all take for granted and which is a vital
component of the stability of Israel. There is much good work going on

was apparent stability five years ago, with long-existing autocratic

monarchies are relatively untouched: Morocco is certainly untouched;
Jordan is still relatively stable, although I refer to what the noble
Baroness said about the very generous reception of the refugees by the
King and people of Jordan. However, the long-suffering Palestinians in
the camps in Syria will find the door closed in Jordan because of the
fear of destabilising further the

course, in most countries the human rights of
minorities—particularly but not only Christians—are more
threatened than before. Our view of recent events 
<?notus-xml column=1034?>in the Middle East has changed radically. Today it is less fashionable
to refer to the Arab spring. The mood of euphoria in Tahrir Square a
year or two ago has been replaced by the demonstrations of yesterday
against President Morsi, the new pharaoh. His supporters can counter
only that he won the election, as if winning elections is sufficient
for any democracy. The dilemma, as one experienced analyst wrote of
Egypt, is
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070132000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000071">“With

uprising” is now more frequently used—although I
understand that the US State Department is known to refer to
“the Arab thing”—but all these terms suggest some
uniformity in the several countries, when, as we know, one cannot
attach one label to so many different national events. However,
constant themes are the search for dignity, the loss of deference and
the readiness to challenge authority. We refer to the current phase as
transition but are puzzled as to what. This search for dignity, this
loss of deference, refers not only to the Middle East but to adjoining
countries such as Turkey and even, as we have seen, to
Brazil.</hs_para>

should recognise that they cannot see beyond the first curve and that
they failed to see the turbulence rising prior to 2008. Yes, there were
fine analyses of the problems in the Arab world, such as the search for
modernity; for example, successive UNDP reports on human development in
the Arab world in the mid-2000s. However, the forecasters did not see
the speed of events, just as they failed to see the Iranian revolution
prior to 1979. This suggests that our policy planners should proceed in
a spirit of humility and that we should have a certain scepticism about
the likely scene in the Middle East in, say, five years’
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000017">Middle
East borders have become more fluid. I enjoyed the article by the noble
Lord, Lord Williams of Baglan, in a recent <I>World Today</I> about the
fluidity of those borders, which are perhaps even more artificial and
certainly more recent than the borders in Africa after the Berlin
Conference. But are we creating a new Turkish sphere of influence in
the region? We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:27:09"></hs_TimeCode>
think of the position of the Kurds, dealt a bad hand by history and now
with a new dynamic not only from the Kurdistan regional government in
Erbil in northern Iraq but from Turkey’s opening to the PKK.
Perhaps this will ultimately be an attempt to recreate the old Ottoman
Empire. Even in the previously stable Syria there is talk about an
ultimate split with the Alawites perhaps retreating to their former,
short-lived, post-First World War
entity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000018">There
is a danger also that conflagration may spread over national boundaries
and engulf the whole region. The obvious example is Hezbollah’s
incursion into Syria as a potential game-changer there and its impact
on an already unstable Lebanon. There are skirmishes around the Golan
Heights. President Assad may ultimately, in desperation, try to involve
Israel in the conflict, but Israel has, so far, shown a masterly
restraint.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000019">It
was the received wisdom up to, let us say, five years ago that Israel
and Palestine were at the heart of all conflicts in the Middle East,
but that dispute is surely hardly related to the current turmoil. No
Israeli 
<?notus-xml column=1035?>flags were burnt in Tahrir Square. Perhaps this is a good time,
therefore, to attempt to restart negotiations. Secretary Kerry has been
extremely active in his pre-negotiation phase and there are rumours of
an Israeli settlement freeze—again—and the freeing of
some Palestinian prisoners, but Palestinian divisions remain, as do the
giant obstacles of refugees and, above all, Jerusalem. It would be
interesting to have the judgment of the Government on the current
prospects for the peace

have said that forward planning is generally difficult; it is nowhere
more so than in Syria. Commentators refer to a sea change having taken
place over the past year. A year ago, the rebels were largely
nationalists, secular and DIY. They have been replaced by more
professional and more hard-line force, including international
jihadists—hence the problem of arms supply, which so many noble
Lords have touched on. It is rumoured that the US may begin to supply
lethal arms within a month. The Prime Minister and the Foreign
Secretary give the impression of wanting to follow and are edging in
that
direction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000021">The
blunt truth is surely this: the readiness to intervene for humanitarian
purposes is cyclical. It arose after the Chicago speech of Prime
Minister Blair in 1999 and followed through with some successes in
Sierra Leone and Libya, but then we had Afghanistan and Iraq and, as a
result, there is no appetite now in our Parliament or in the country
for such intervention. I concede, however, that the mood could change
if there were a major use of chemical weapons by the regime. If we arm
the rebels, we will do so by proxy and, of course, it is most unlikely
that arms supply would necessarily shorten the conflict, as the
Russians and Iranians would possibly only step up their own supply in
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000022">Amid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>
the swirling uncertainties, what is the appropriate response of the UK
and the West, with paralysis at the UN Security Council and a relative
stalemate on the battlefield? The starting point is surely recognition
that we have a limited influence on events. No longer can we intervene
and redraw boundaries as we did under the Sykes-Picot accord. It is, I
concede, hardly a moral stand to stand on the sidelines with
one’s arms folded, but we must have a more cautious agenda and
search for ways where we can positively help at the
margins.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000023">It is
of course the humanitarian crisis which is of most immediate concern.
Jordan, as has been said, is in danger of being overwhelmed by
refugees. My understanding is that the UK Government have responded
most impressively. It would be helpful to have an update on the extent
to which other countries have failed to live up to the obligations
which they undertook at Kuwait and
afterwards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:34:29"></hs_TimeCode>. In
the short term, the refugee crisis is likely to worsen, as the
government forces appear to have a new momentum after Qusair.</hs_para>

with our values, we must help in democracy-building and in the
protection of minorities—Christians are clearly the major losers
in this conflict. Finally, at the political end, we should seek to
mediate in a region where a spirit of “winner takes all”
prevails; it is an existential threat for President Assad. We must
recognise the interest of, and work with, both Russia 
<?notus-xml column=1036?>and Iran, and reject the French attempt to exclude Iran from Geneva II.
The latest news from Geneva is disappointing in the extreme, as Assad
perhaps seeks to improve his negotiating position on the battlefield. I
accept that extreme dilemmas face us in responding. I have an awful
feeling that the situation will get worse before it gets better; that
the Syria that emerges will, even if it is united, be more unstable;
and, overall, that the Middle East will pose a greater risk to
ourselves and to the interests of the

those countries. Today, however, we face a highly toxic cocktail of
very dangerous proportions. One might almost think, in terms of Syria,
of a poisonous Molotov cocktail—a great cross-fertilisation of
several developments, starting in 2011. The Arab spring-type uprising
started the challenge to the Assad dictatorship and was followed by
repression, civil war and challenge to the secular regime. This
developed into, as we have heard so often in this debate, a sectarian,
religious conflict, principally but not wholly between Sunni and Shia,
exacerbating the Sunni-Shia tensions in the region as a whole. Take

offshoots of al-Qaeda, producing in turn a massive humanitarian crisis,
with more than 7 million people in desperate need, following from that
to the destabilising of the neighbouring regimes, particularly Jordan,
Iraq and Lebanon and
Turkey.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000031">Then,
on top of that, there are the ambitions of the Iranian theocracy, which
is flexing its muscles, trying to establish itself as a big power in
the region and to have more influence—dreaming, perhaps, of
former great Persian empires—and with very deep mistrust of the
United States and the United Kingdom, developing nuclear capability as
a symbol of its virility and seen, quite understandably, by Israel as a
serious threat. That is balanced, however, by the one positive sign,
which has been spoken about today: the election of Rouhani as
president. He is, of course, a solid supporter of the Supreme Leader

we add to that, in the Middle East as a whole, the important Arab
nations such as Egypt, which is struggling to find its way towards some
kind of democracy, with serious tensions between the secular political
leaders and the Muslim Brotherhood and with the army sitting in the
background. Meanwhile, Palestine-Israel simmers and stagnates. There is
no will or leadership on either side to find a solution. It is becoming
more and more potentially explosive, with Palestinians failing to unite

solution more and more
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000033">To
add one more issue in the region, there is a rapidly changing influence
of outside powers. Obama is now understandably reluctant to get
involved in any more Middle Eastern quagmires. The European Union is
divided. The United Kingdom wants to punch above its weight against its
gradual loss of weight. In Russia, there is a Putin who is under
threat, flexing his muscles both metaphorically and actually, wanting
to demonstrate Russia’s power and to protect its interests in
Syria and its energy interests in the Mediterranean. Finally, as the
noble Lord, Lord Howell, put across so strongly, there is China,
becoming more and more dependent on Middle Eastern oil and, therefore,
more and more an important power in the Middle
East.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000034">In those

we can play a role, but that it is more modest and selective than it
has been in the past. Like almost every other speaker, I am not
convinced that sending arms to the official Syrian opposition would do
anything other than help to escalate the conflict and the fighting. I
believe that there is no military solution whatever to this Syrian
problem. Therefore, we should concentrate on one thing which I believe
that the Government are doing extremely well, which is humanitarian
support on a large scale. Secondly, where we can, with our allies, we
should shore up and stabilise the neighbouring countries, especially
Jordan and Lebanon.
Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:44:16"></hs_TimeCode>, like
others, I agree that we should give strong support to a political
negotiation leading to a transition and what we hope

Iran. It has an important role to play in the Middle East; it is better

I agree with my noble friend Lord Hannay: we should do what we can to

first thing to say is that doing nothing in Syria is simply not an
option—not with so many dead and with so much at stake. We have
a humanitarian interest in seeking a solution and we have a very great
self-interest in a solution. We also have a responsibility. We played a
direct role in so many of the emerging problems of the region, where
the frontiers were drawn with a remarkably unbending ruler in London
and Paris. We used to pursue a policy of divide and rule and, in recent
years under Prime Minister Blair, we seem to have pursued a policy of
meddle and muddle. We armed Saddam Hussain; then we deposed him. We
even armed Osama bin Laden, when he was fighting the Soviets. We were
great friends once with the Iranians and then we became great enemies.
So it went
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070132000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070132000040">We have a
pretty awful track record of picking winners, and we have no more
prospect of being able to pick a winner from among the maelstrom of
opposition groups in Syria than monkeys have of writing Shakespeare.
That is why arming rebels on our own or as part of an exclusively
Western coalition is hopeless: blind optimism of an order worthy of Mr
Blair. We need a broader coalition with vision broad enough to
recognise that although many of us distance ourselves from the former
Prime Minister’s fixation with remodelling the Middle East, much
of the rest of the world sees no such distinction and simply sees an
old imperialist country still up to its wicked tricks, as my noble

of the wider Middle East, which inevitably brings us to the issue of
Israel and Palestine. Here, I take a slightly different view from the
noble Lords, Lord Turnberg and Lord Anderson. That conflict is
connected in as much as it helps to ignite extremism throughout the
Middle East and hugely inflames the distrust of the

generations will look in bewilderment at how we allowed that situation
to continue. Let me take just one small example: the Gaza Strip, a
territory so small that my noble friend the Minister and I could walk
around it in a day. It is 25 miles long and, for most of its length,
only three and a half miles wide. We could make every inhabitant rich
beyond their wildest dreams for a fraction of the treasure that we have
wasted in trying to resolve this problem. However, the situation still
grows worse, deliberately made worse by men of evil

the other side of that equation, Israel is our friend—we support
it. However, we watch as Palestinians are beaten and kicked from their

of Palestinian territory. I read that the new American Secretary of
State is optimistic about moving forward on a settlement on that issue,

fading. We shall see—nothing is

have a right to be involved in such issues. After all, we had a role in
causing the problems in the first place. Therefore, while again
supporting the absolute and inherent right of Israel to security and

were to retreat from a two-state to a one-state solution, the British

we are to push for stability and moderation in the Middle East, we must
expect our friends in Israel to listen to us, too. We have a right to

inherent right of Israel, we must also expect common sense and balance
from her. We will need to talk, not only to Israel but to our other
friends in the Middle East and to those who are not our
friends—those we dislike and those we openly distrust. We must
talk not only to our friends in the Gulf states and elsewhere, to Arab
League nations, to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, Russia and
China—there is such a long list of them—but also to the
extremists, and even to some who we regard as terrorists; even, as the

these exceptionally challenging circumstances, the Prime Minister is
doing an exceptional job. He is clearly cautious about sending arms to
Syria, and should remain so. He is increasing our humanitarian aid,
travelling far and wide in search of common ground, and I am sure that

Lord, Lord Howell, suggested in his fascinating remarks, it is time to
bring Russia and China in from the cold. I am sure that the Prime

I trust that the Prime

There is no exclusively western solution to this crisis. There might be

extent of the geography and the differences of analysis were always
going to make this a diffuse debate, in which it is perhaps hard to

Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:54:44"></hs_TimeCode>. I will
start by endorsing in straightforward terms the words of my noble
friend Lord Wood at the beginning of this debate about arms to rebels.
That topic was analysed in some detail and with great insight by the
noble Lord, Lord Ashdown; I will say for simplicity’s sake how
strongly I agree with him, even if that causes him discomfort. As my
noble friend Lord Wood also said, we need to understand the history of
the region. I share the sense of urgency of the noble Lord, Lord
Williams of Baglan, and the view of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that
we are not in a position to do nothing—a view that was repeated
a moment ago by the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs. I also encourage the
Minister to respond to the comments made by my noble and learned friend
Lord Morris of Aberavon on some of the legalities, which should be
addressed
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:55:40"></hs_TimeCode>.

aim for perhaps a wider regional appraisal. I apologise in advance to
my noble friend Lord Turnberg if I do
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T18:55:47"></hs_TimeCode> focus
tonight on Israel and Palestine. This is a similar starting point to

striking that across Syria, through Lebanon, in Iran and still more in
Iraq, through several of the Gulf states on both sides of the Horn of
Africa, across north Africa, deep into the Sahara, and north of and in
Mali we are witnessing a harsh sectarian war within Islam—or
fronts in a war, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, described it a short
while ago. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, has also focused on this, and
the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, quite rightly focused on how these events
have demonstrated some of the United Nations’ failures in
getting a proper grip on it 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>in the Security Council. Of course, the great paradox is that
historically Islam was a religion marked by greater pluralist tolerance
than a great many others were. However, now we see on many fronts a
widespread war between Sunnis and Shia and subsects within each of
those great traditions.</hs_para>

the sectarian divide in some places now takes the form of sectarian
barbarism. In Syria the Shia Alawites target Sunnis, with the
undeniable help of the Iranian Shia, including the Revolutionary Guard
and Lebanese Hezbollah. In Egypt, Sunnis launch lynch mobs against
small Shia communities, encouraged by Salafist clerics, and attack Shia
people as infidels. Extreme Salafists have entered Syria. The Syrian
opposition ranges in a bewildering way from secular groups to al-Qaeda
affiliates. Similar confrontational fronts can be seen right across the
region. However, surely it is not adequate to see this as just a series
of theological clashes—a point that was made earlier.</hs_para>

is also clear that in several states minority clans have exercised or
exercise power to the exclusion of the social, economic and religious
rights of majority clans. Assad, Saddam and the Bahraini al-Khalifas
oppress whoever constitutes the majority. In some cases, such as with
the Egyptian and Saudi majority Sunnis, they oppress smaller Shia
minorities. Almost all now also oppress Christians and members of other
religions, across the Middle East, in north and west Africa and in some
senses as far away as Pakistan. However, lest this is thought simply to
be something happening within Islam, there seem to be similarities with

legitimise brutal struggle. The enemy is far more easily stereotyped as

the exception of a few organisations, I fear that there is little
attempt to encourage civic participation and strength and civic

the World Bank, which states baldly that the ease of doing business in
Egypt is that it is a bad place to start any business, as tax reform,
protectionism and state control shackle all prospects. This is in sharp
contrast in many ways with Tunisia, which has begun to develop those
economic prospects in a serious way. Do the Government plan to host or

would be futile in the course of a debate today to range over Libya,
where there may be rather more promise, or indeed Mali, which for
several days was the absolute focus of attention in this House but has
scarcely been mentioned ever since. We see in every one of these cases
the need for an economic platform to be developed and for the
opportunities for pluralism to go alongside it. Briefly, of course, I
have to return to Syria against the backdrop of the huge caution that
has been expressed in this House about what to do, 
<?notus-xml column=1043?>given the complexities. The prospect is simply of a failed state on the
borders of the United Kingdom’s closest allies in the
region—Turkey, Israel, Jordan and, potentially, Palestine, at
the very heart of the Middle East. Strategically, we need a stable
transition from Assad’s dictatorship, and so do the Syrian
people. I fully acknowledge the long-term reflections on this by the
noble Lord, Lord Risby, and his analysis of Mr
Assad’s present position.</hs_para>

so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:05:07"></hs_TimeCode> far as we
have judged them until now, have outweighed intervention. We have
responded with caution. We recognise that the fragmented opposition is
exclusively a Sunni club, and not one that is capable of a balanced
Syrian settlement. We are witnessing a death spiral into chaos;
uncontrolled fragmentation means unending civil war, and of course that
is unsustainable for everyone. It has already spilt over, as many noble
Lords have said, into its neighbours; it knows no borders. It emboldens
Iran, which may or may not be in a state of change—I share the
hopes of the noble Lords, Lord Hannay and Lord Luce, but who

men, women and children had died, more or less the figure that we see
in Syria today. UN and Arab League forecasts are now that 100,000
deaths are likely to occur just in 2013 if Assad proceeds with
impunity. A more active policy is therefore inevitable, and doing too
little will simply grow the crisis to too great a proportion. President
Putin, plainly unimpressed by what the Canadian Prime Minister called
the G7+1 summit, must surely work urgently with Secretary Kerry to
create a national platform, bringing together all the legitimate ethnic
and religious leaders. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, said that a common
global response was what was needed, and that is plainly what they must
work for. The process needs Russia, China, Turkey and the key Arab and
European states, and consideration, as my noble friend Lord Wood

reintegration of combatants, improved governance, a date for elections,
economic recovery and reconstruction scheduled to start. In this, I
draw on Richard Holbrooke’s experience before and during 
<?notus-xml column=1044?>Dayton: the least worst outcomes, even if they artificially create
within the country smaller but secure and economically viable entities,
may be the only solution with which people can live with some
prospects. The opposition may indeed have indulged in terrible
violence—I believe it has—but that can no longer be any

priority must be given to the negotiations, and no negotiation is an
unthinkable course of action. That means that there can be no one-sided

over the course of our discussions, including those from the opposition
Front Bench, but especially for the contributions of the noble Lord,
Lord Wright of Richmond, and my noble friends Lord Risby and Lord

international impacts from the noble Lord, Lord Desai, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Afshar. My noble friend Lady Morris is right that many
interventions merit a reread, and I will certainly be encouraging those
of us at the Foreign Office dealing with Syria and the wider region to
do that. It is important that this House continues to consider the
deteriorating situation in Syria, its wider regional impact and how the
UK has responded. We are privileged in being able to draw on the

shall take a few moments to recap the Government’s policy
towards the complex situation in Syria and the Middle East, and the
types of assistance that we are already providing to the Syrian people.
Syria remains at the top of the Government’s foreign policy
agenda. We are firm in our belief that the conflict and the suffering
of the Syrian people will come to an end only through a negotiated
settlement. We have therefore continued to escalate our assistance in
order to achieve that
goal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000004">In
response to the dire humanitarian situation faced by Syrians displaced
inside Syria and as refugees in neighbouring countries, we have set out
our largest ever funding commitment for a humanitarian disaster. I can
assure the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Truro that we will
remain committed. Our total contribution now stands at £348
million, which sends a clear signal to the Syrian people that they can
count on the UK’s continuing support. At the same time, we have
used our platform as host of the recent G8 summit to urge
our international partners to commit to humanitarian assistance on a
similar scale and to pay funds that are committed. The noble Lord, Lord
Anderson of Swansea, asked about countries failing to make a
contribution. The UN humanitarian appeal is for £5.2 billion. It
is its largest appeal in history. The UK, US and the EU have been the
largest contributors to that appeal, but we agree that others need to
do more. That is why the Foreign Secretary urged Ministers at the
Friends of Syria meeting on 22 June to increase their contributions to
the UN appeal, including lobbying Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the
UAE.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070136000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000005">We have
also committed large amounts of assistance to Syria’s
neighbours, who are experiencing great economic strains and political
tensions due to the conflict spilling over. Regional peace and security

can tell the noble Lord, Lord Wood, that Jordan and Lebanon are playing
a vital humanitarian role and we are providing assistance to help
alleviate not only the humanitarian crisis but the side effects too. We

what we believe is a credible alternative to the Assad regime. However,
the lifting of the EU arms embargo gives us greater flexibility to act
if action is needed. Noble Lords can rest assured that any decision
will be put to a vote in the other place, and we would not want to
pursue any aspect of this policy against the will of the House. Our

the national coalition only; they should be intended for the protection
of civilians; there should be safeguards to ensure delivery to the
right hands; and existing 
<?notus-xml column=1047?>obligations under the EU common practice for arms exports remain in

We are intensifying our diplomatic efforts with all members of the UN

happening in Syria. Our policy must move forward to prevent loss of
life there. This is not a choice between diplomacy and practical
assistance to the opposition. The two efforts are interlinked, in order

Hannay of Chiswick:</Member></B> My Lords, I beg to move the Motion
standing in my name on the Order Paper in my capacity as chairman of
the European Union Committee’s Sub-Committee on Home, Affairs,
Health and Education, which prepared the report now before your
Lordships for endorsement. As the House will know, when we consider
reports of the EU Committee, this is normally on a Motion that the
House simply take note of the report. In the case of this report, the
Motion invites the House to agree with the committee’s
recommendation that the Government should opt in to the negotiations on
the Commission’s recently proposed Europol regulation. The
reason is that the report deals with a draft measure falling within the
area of justice and home affairs, which will apply to the United
Kingdom only if the Government exercise their right under a protocol to
the EU treaties to participate in its negotiation, adoption and
implementation—in other words, to
opt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:29:59"></hs_TimeCode> into it.
They have to do this within three months of the proposal being
presented to the Council, which in this case means before 30 July. The
committee believes that the Government should opt in, and the Motion
invites the House to endorse that
view.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000028">In 2011,
the Government repeated an undertaking given by the previous Government
that time would be found to debate opt-in reports well before the
expiry of the three-month period. I am most grateful that they have
honoured the undertaking on this occasion by making time available for
the debate early enough for them to be able to take into account the
views of the House
when<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:29:59"></hs_TimeCode> reaching a

your Lordships will know from earlier EU committee reports, most
recently from the joint report of Sub-Committees E and F on the block
opt-out under Protocol 36 to the Lisbon treaty, Europol—the
European Police Office—is a vital weapon for co-ordinating the
European fight against serious organised crime, drug trafficking, money
laundering, cybercrime and terrorism. It was originally established in
1995 as an intergovernmental body, and became an EU agency in 2009,
following the adoption of a Council decision to that effect. Europol
has no executive or coercive powers to conduct investigations or make
arrests in the member states, and the Commission’s proposal 
<?notus-xml column=1051?>before your Lordships does not seek to change this. Europol supports the
work of member states’ law-enforcement authorities by gathering,
analysing and sharing information and by co-ordinating
operations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000030">CEPOL,
the European Police College, aims to encourage cross-border police
co-operation by bringing together senior police officers from across
the EU in training and exchange programmes, among other things. It was
established as an EU agency in 2005, following the adoption of a
separate Council decision. It is currently based at Bramshill in the
United Kingdom, alongside the English and Welsh College of
Policing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000031">The
draft regulation we are debating would supersede both the pre-Lisbon
Council decisions: the one dealing with Europol and the one dealing
with CEPOL. It proposes to merge CEPOL with Europol in the
latter’s existing headquarters in The Hague. The new regulation
would also enhance some of Europol’s existing powers, in
particular regarding the collection of data from member states and its
ability to analyse the data more effectively. The Government have
expressed concerns in their Explanatory Memorandum about the
introduction of a stricter obligation on member states to provide data
to Europol. I understand that in fact—this is a point of some
interest—law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom already
share, voluntarily, a greater volume of information with Europol than
do the agencies of other member
states<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:29:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000032">Doubts
could also arise about Europol’s ability to cope with large
volumes of information if it were to be copied in to all bilateral
exchanges, as the regulation seeks to make mandatory. I would welcome
the Minister’s thoughts on how the Government would
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T14:29:59"></hs_TimeCode> these
concerns during the negotiations if they were to opt in to the
proposal. The committee’s view, which we expressed in our
report, was that the Government would be most effective in pursuing
these concerns by participating in the negotiations. In doing so, I
would hope that they would bear in mind, in dealing with our own
concerns, our clear interest in other member states providing more
information to Europol than they do at present. As always, there are
two sides to the
coin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000033">With
regard to the proposed merger of Europol and CEPOL, your Lordships are
probably aware that it has generated a degree of opposition, not least
from both the agencies concerned. While the committee accepts, in
general terms, the desirability of merging EU agencies if this will
produce cost savings without a loss of effectiveness, it did not
believe that the Commission had yet made a sufficiently convincing case
for the merger in terms of reducing duplication, achieving efficiency
savings and increasing
effectiveness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000034">While
the Government also appear to have concerns about the
proposed merger, they somewhat counterintuitively appear to be
unconcerned about the possible relocation of CEPOL to The Hague,
following their announcement that the agency’s lease at
Bramshill will come to an end in March 2014. I will ask the Minister
for further information about the possible relocation of CEPOL,
including whether any efforts have been made to retain the location of
this agency in the United Kingdom. It now looks more likely that the
two agencies will be kept apart, because there is strong opposition not
only from the agencies but from quite a 
<?notus-xml column=1052?>number of member states, as expressed in the recent Justice and Home
Affairs Council and also in the European Parliament, where the LIBE
Committee, which is a kind of opposite number to my sub-committee, is
strongly opposed to the merger. Therefore, the likelihood is that CEPOL
will be looking for a new
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000035">Concerns
have been raised in the past about the limited parliamentary oversight
of Europol. This has been addressed to a degree by the increased
scrutiny of the non-operational functions of this agency, as well as of
CEPOL, by the European Parliament since the entry into force of the
Lisbon treaty in December 2009. In 2010, the Commission instigated
discussions about how national Parliaments could be involved in the
process of scrutiny and oversight in order at the same time to increase
accountability at member state level, thus recognising the shared
competences in the justice and home affairs field. I will explain that
point. I think that everyone understands that this will be an area of
mixed competence as far as the eye can see. It is not even conceivable
that member states will hand all that over to the European Union. It is
certainly not desirable that they should do so—and it is not
going to happen. That means that in an area like this, where there is
mixed competence and the issue of parliamentary scrutiny and oversight
arises, the only sensible way to proceed is to try to avoid a food
fight between the European Parliament and national Parliaments, and to
see whether we can get some sort of system in which they operate
together on the basis of
equality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000036">My
committee and I have played an active role in those discussions from
the outset, and have pushed for the development of existing structures
to this end, rather than for the establishment of new ones. There are
regular meetings of the European Parliament LIBE Committee and the
national Parliament Home Affairs Committee. If we build on them, we
will avoid the potential costs and duplication that a more freestanding
structure could entail. Other national Parliaments have tended to
follow our lead in taking this view, and I will continue to state the
case in Brussels and elsewhere. In that respect, we find the provisions
in the draft regulation extremely welcome. They would increase
parliamentary scrutiny of Europol, and its accountability both to the
European Parliament and to national Parliaments, and would do so with a
light touch, as we have
recommended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000037">Our
position on a number of other provisions in the regulation is set out
in the report. Some are technical, and I will not weary the House with
them. However, there is one to which I should draw attention. It arises
in the context of the committee’s recent consideration of the
Government’s 2014 block opt-out decision under Protocol 36 to
the Lisbon treaty—about which I fear your Lordships will hear a
lot in the coming months when we come to debate the committee’s
report on this matter, which came out at the end of the previous
Session, and when we receive the Government’s response to that
report, which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, stated was coming
“shortly”. “How short is a piece of
string?” is perhaps the same question as, “How long is a
piece of string?”. We will find out in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000038">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:19:58"></hs_TimeCode>
witnesses for the Protocol 36 inquiry, the Home Secretary included,

<?notus-xml column=1053?>about Europol’s role, including the significant benefits it
provided for the United Kingdom’s law-enforcement agencies in
terms of access to information, analysis, intelligence, co-ordination
and support, as well as the efficient and cost-effective arrangement of
having access to 40 countries in one place rather than co-operating
through a network of bilateral
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000039">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:40:54"></hs_TimeCode>
potential value of Europol has recently been enhanced by the
establishment of a Cybercrime Centre within it, in response to the real
challenges that cybercrime presents to all of us. If the
Government choose to opt in to the regulation that we are debating
today, the two Council decisions establishing Europol and CEPOL will
simply drop off the list of measures that will be caught if the
Government decide to trigger the block opt-out decision. However, four
other measures on that list, which Europol informed the
committee were “directly connected” with the
Council’s Europol decision, will remain on the list. Do not ask
me why this has happened or whether it is sensible that it
has happened—but it has happened. Can the Minister clarify which
of the existing measures are subject to repeal by the new regulation
and how would handling any other relevant decision affect handling the
block opt-out decision? Are the Government mindful of the
need to opt back in to any Europol measures not so repealed, so that no
question of lack of coherence arises? Of course, that will occur only
if the Government agree to opt in to the Europol regulation, but it is
worth going over that ground because there is a potential trap there,
which it would be unwise for us to fall
into<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:41:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000040">My
sub-committee plans to keep the present draft regulation under
scrutiny. At this stage, only one matter is for decision by the
House—whether or not the Government are recommended to exercise
the United Kingdom’s opt-in by the end of July. For the reasons
I have given, the committee is firmly of the opinion that the
Government should do so, in part so that they can play a full and
effective role in addressing the concerns that they have expressed,
some of which we share, during the negotiations. It would be good to
hear from the Minister at the conclusion of the debate whether it is
the Government’s intention to opt in to the new Europol
regulation. I understand that a parallel debate on this issue in
another place has been postponed from the scheduled date of 3 July. Can
the Minister say why that has happened and when the debate will be
reinstated, presumably before the other place rises on 18 July? Can he
assure the House that when a decision is taken on the opt-in, it will
be communicated to this House? I beg to

made. The fact is that this merger seems entirely to be the
Commission’s idea. Neither Europol nor CEPOL supports it, and
19 member states have already voiced their opposition. The
proposal will almost certainly be removed from the text at an early
stage in negotiations.</hs_para>

second government concern is over data, and they are not alone here.
Half a dozen other member states have already expressed concerns about
data-sharing. The worry is over the compulsion to supply data, which
exists in the draft text. I think there are good UK reasons for wanting
to beef up data supply to Europol, where we already lead, but I agree
that it is not desirable for Europol to be able to direct data supply
by UK agencies. However, this is not a problem in negotiation. We can
stop this if we want to; we already have enough allies on this to form
a blocking
minority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000047">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:47:12"></hs_TimeCode>
third area of concern for the Government, as I understand it, is over
what they see as a power to compel investigations—that is, a
power for Europol to compel national forces to undertake criminal
investigations. There is no such explicit power in the draft text.
Europol can ask member states to initiate a 
<?notus-xml column=1055?>criminal investigation but cannot force them to do so. However, as the
Minister may point out, the draft text obliges the member states to
give a reason for refusal to initiate a criminal investigation, and it
is just possible that these reasons would be justiciable by the ECJ,
which would be undesirable. However, it is worth pointing out that, so
far, this has not been raised as a problem by any other member
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:47:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000048">I
do not think that any of those three concerns presents a strong
argument for not opting in to the new Europol regulation. In fact, the
UK would clearly lose out by not opting in. We would lose reputation
and leadership. The UK leads Europol, and the director and many of his
senior staff are British. We exercise disproportionate influence over
the agency. If we choose not to sit at the table while the future of
the agency is determined, we will have forfeited that leadership role.
We would also lose influence more generally. If we start negotiations
by announcing our concerns then withdrawing until the text is finalised
in 2015, it would go down very badly with our partners. We would lose
our seat at the table and have no right to vote on the text. We should
remind ourselves that Europol is critical to our security and our
ability to fight crime, and it is a success, led by
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070136000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070136000049">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T19:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>

that each one has to be looked at in the national interest. I always
get a wee bit worried when the coalition talks about the national

interests of keeping the coalition in power rather than what is in the
national interest. When pressed to explain their thinking, Ministers

second problem is the cost of what the Government hope to retain.
Opting back in is not a straightforward process. The noble Lord, Lord
Williamson, having been secretary of the European

is no guarantee that negotiations to opt back in would be successful.
We might find ourselves locked out permanently of key crime-fighting
tools. Ensuring that this does not happen will require a large and
wholly avoidable expenditure of diplomatic capital. Our experienced
diplomats would have to spend their time persuading the other 27

rewards that the Government hope to win by such a policy are largely
intangible. The measures they hope to scrap are mostly technical points
relating to the definition of certain crimes. What is really driving
this agenda is the streak of destructive Euroscepticism that runs
through some of the Tory Back Benches. In this instance, it is clear
what they mean by the national interest. As I said, the national
interest is the interest of a small, bullying minority. David Cameron
is trying to paint himself as a national champion, but in fact he is
having his arm twisted. It is a clever piece of political spin but it
is a disastrous piece of policy that could leave all of us in the
United Kingdom dangerously exposed to crime and terror. I hope that the

always seems to me that if one set out to design a nation that was
dependent on its relationships with the world in almost every sphere of
our significant life in Britain, it would be difficult to think of a
better example than the United Kingdom. We live in a totally
interdependent world. I believe strongly that the test of political
leadership in our country is to demonstrate that we are determined to
look to the well-being of the people of these islands of the United
Kingdom, but that that can best be done only if we are in a network of
international co-operative relationships, of which the European Union
is one. It is not a romantic debate about whether one is a European or
a Briton; it is hard-headed practical common sense about how we look to
the well-being of the British people. Certainly, as far as I am
concerned, any thought that we should retreat into being a sort of
free-floating raft off the mainland of Europe in the turbulent world in
which we live, and that we will somehow then look better to the

interesting and illuminating debate. Perhaps I may say at the outset
how grateful I am to the committee. I found this report and the
previous report on the opt-out to be extremely useful, and it should
have a much wider audience than only Members of your Lordships’
House. Any debate around European issues is often led by emotion and
those with strong views. It often becomes one of those public debates
whereby those with strong views seek to persuade others why they are
right and it becomes difficult to make a balanced and dispassionate
contribution. I have thought for some time that what many people want
is for politicians to stop telling them what they should think and why
they should agree with them but be given hard facts in a reasoned way
and be allowed to make their own
judgments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:02:43"></hs_TimeCode>. What
are the benefits and problems, as well as the potential benefits and

first report last week on the opt-out, there was some suggestion that
there were other opt-in measures that would address some of the
concerns that the Government have raised around issues such as the
European arrest warrant, but no action has been taken. Because there is
an opt-out decision to be taken, proper consideration is not being

would be on the opt-out list. I feel like a character in a play,
somewhere between <I>Alice Through the Looking Glass </I>and
“Yes Minister”. However, it would be helpful to have some
clarity from the Minister on those
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:05:13"></hs_TimeCode>. These

value of Europol as described by other noble Lords is widely accepted.
The value of the range of EU police and criminal justice measures are
also widely accepted as being of huge benefit in the fight against
organised and serious cross-border crime, which is made more dangerous
and more complex by its cross-border nature. The noble Lord, Lord
Sharkey, illustrated some of that in the cases he mentioned. Dealing
with drug trafficking, people trafficking, abduction, money laundering,

main changes proposed by the draft regulation that the UK is being
asked to opt into. I do not wish to repeat the detail but 
<?notus-xml column=1060?>in summary, first, are the new commitments around data sharing and
enhancing the role of Europol as a hub for information exchange. Second
are the proposals for a more robust data protection regime, alongside
structural changes in data management and processing, to make better
use of the data that are held. Third is improved governance and
increased parliamentary scrutiny by national Parliaments and the
European Parliament, and proposals for greater accountability. Fourth
are the changes to the existing structures by merging
Europol and CEPOL; although my reading of the proposed regulation is
that it is more of a takeover than a
merger.</hs_para>

data sharing is essential. There is little point in co-operation
between states if information is not up to date and relevant. However,
we understand the concerns that have been raised by the new wording. I
should be interested to hear from the Minister the exact reasons for
the Government’s concerns on this. The Government consider that
information should be shared on a voluntary basis, if I understand
their position correctly. That is not unreasonable but is there likely
to be an imbalance in information supplied from different countries?
The Government have responded that they have concerns about the
feasibility. Can the Minister be more specific about what he means by
“feasibility”? Perhaps we can have some more detail on
that. The committee’s recommendation on this issue seems
eminently sensible, given that there are concerns, but I am keen to
understand exactly what they are.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:08:27"></hs_TimeCode>
committee’s recommendation on negotiation is helpful but I
wonder how effective we as a country can be in negotiations, given the
Government’s commitment to a block opt-out. That must be a real
worry for those negotiating on our behalf in addressing any concerns
that the Government have. Obviously, if others around the table think
that we are likely to opt out, it is harder to reach agreement. The
Government will need to convince them that we are serious about real
engagement. That might be a challenge for any negotiators. Paragraph 20
of the report is helpful in seeking to tread through this minefield and
makes a very robust recommendation on the course of action that the
Government should take in respect of Europol if they decide to exercise
the block
opt-out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070142000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070142000009">On
the second matter of
data<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:09:13"></hs_TimeCode> protection
and better analysis of data, both proposals are welcome but I agree
that there is a lack of clarity about the data protection provisions,
and that uncertainty will remain until later this month when the
directive is to be agreed. The Commission’s document refers to
the current legislative set-up preventing Europol being fully effective
and equipping member states with the necessary, complete and up-to-date
tools. From the report, this appears to be in relation to forensic and
operational support and criminal analysis. It also seems that this
regulation is needed to tackle the remaining barriers to full
co-operation. I certainly welcome the proposals to strengthen the
current data protection regime, including those intended strictly to
limit the holding of personal information, as well as proposals on the
individual’s right to access information held and the
availability of compensation for unlawful data processing. It would be
helpful to know the Minister’s views on this and whether the

merger of Europol and CEPOL that is perhaps most contentious. Listening
to comments from noble Lords around the House this evening, there seems
to be little confidence that this will go ahead in the proposed form.
As I have already said, it seems to be more of a takeover than a
merger, and I am not surprised that both directors have opposed it.
That, in itself, would not be the sole basis on which to oppose change
but they have raised strong
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:10:45"></hs_TimeCode> of
concern. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:15:02"></hs_TimeCode> share

have previously made points in debates in your Lordships’ House

the Government face in not providing transitional costs. We often hear
that changes in administration or bureaucracy are going to realise
great savings. Obviously savings can be made, but when the rationale
for structural change is just to save money, too often there then
follows a hunt for cuts to realise the savings that have been promised,

Explanatory Memorandum provides an assessment of the benefits. It
certainly appears that there are good reasons for greater co-operation
between the two bodies, although it is worth noting Appendix 2 of the
committee’s report, in which the director of CEPOL states that
the synergies and co-operation between the two agencies are already
excellent. He takes the strong view, with some evidence, that money is
not being wasted by duplication. The directors of both agencies raise
concerns about the supposed financial savings and the implications of a

the Commission identifies as being made more effective is that of

training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:12:40"></hs_TimeCode> and the
priority given to training. This is a dangerous area in which to risk
losing effectiveness. I know that the Government have some concerns but
I hope that they will not be used as a way to try to derail progress.

aspect on which I should like to understand the Government’s
position is the development of EU centres and the provision of training
to fight specific crimes. Looking through the regulations and the other
material, I wonder whether the Government have considered or explored
with the Commission the possibility of a specialist centre being based
in the UK. I would have hoped that the Government would
enthusiastically embrace the opportunity of having one of these EU
centres in the UK—we already have CEPOL at Bramshill—to
further develop and share high-level expertise. Bramshill is a former
police college 
<?notus-xml column=1062?>and it has had international respect but it is being sold off. I hope
that that does not blind the Government to what could be a real
opportunity to extend our influence and share our expertise in policing

the Minister will have to consider that any negotiations to seek
changes in the details of the memorandum and regulations could be
damaged by the Government’s intention to seek an opt-out in
2014. I appreciate that having to look at this issue in the shadow of
the block opt-out makes such discussions very difficult for the
Government, but I would hope—and other noble Lords have echoed
this in their comments this evening—that the importance of this

this debate, I said that a Government’s first duty is to the
security and well-being of their citizens. Crime does not stop at
Calais. The policing methods of “Dixon of Dock Green” are
no longer enough to tackle the complex and intelligent web of serious
and organised crime, where the benefits of, and skills derived from,
modern technology sit alongside the old-fashioned criminal masterminds.
Police officers today are highly trained and they will have to
co-operate across borders if we are to be effective in bringing to
justice the drug dealers, money launderers, child abusers and all those

interesting aspect of tonight’s debate has been that there is
real support from noble Lords across the House for European and

a single voice has been raised this evening in support of the
Government’s proposed block opt-out. I should have thought that,

which ones and how many or what the priorities are, and we do not know
what the costs will be. As I have made clear, there are very real

that this decision has been overshadowed by any other decision which is
also before the Government at this time. The point made in the

separate issue. The noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord

saying that, I want to be clear that we strongly support Europol as it
currently operates. As noble Lords have pointed out, we work very
closely with it in tackling many serious offences, such as people
smuggling and online child abuse. My noble friend Lord Sharkey gave
some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:19:27"></hs_TimeCode> detailed
examples of where Europol has been important in tackling cross-border
crime affecting this country. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Smith,
also recognised that point of view.
Europol<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:19:52"></hs_TimeCode> provides
real benefits to our law enforcement agencies. It is an effective and
well run organisation with strong leadership. Indeed, as noble Lords
have pointed out, with a Briton as its director, the UK plays an
important
part<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070142000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070142000025">However,
we are worried that some aspects of the new proposals may risk making
our law enforcement agencies accountable to Europol, which would be a
different thing. Policing is a core function of a sovereign country and
must remain a member state responsibility. Perhaps I may illustrate
this with an example. I refer to the proposals on police training. I am
pleased that the European Union Committee shares our concerns about the
proposed merger between the European Police College and Europol. The
noble Lord, Lord Hannay, confirmed that in his opening
speech<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
the Commission’s proposals go beyond the merger. They would give
the Europol academy a much broader role than CEPOL currently has in
police training, significantly expanding the EU’s
responsibilities in an area that really should be left to member
states<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:21:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the stronger obligation to give Europol data, to which I shall
perhaps return later in response to contributions. We accept of course
that Europol needs good-quality intelligence from member states if it
is to do its job properly. This country has a good record in that
respect. But the new regulation goes far beyond specifying exactly what
must be shared 
<?notus-xml column=1064?>and in what circumstances. It does not allow us to withhold information
that would threaten national security or harm an ongoing investigation.
That worries us because it seems to undermine the control of member
states over their law enforcement intelligence. Another factor we
perhaps need to bear in mind is that it also risks overwhelming Europol
with data provided by member states without regard to its quality
simply to avoid being taken to the European Court of
Justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-01T20:22:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070142000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070142000027">Another
concern is the provision that allows Europol to ask member
states’ law enforcement agencies to carry out investigations.
Europol already has some powers in this area but the new regulations
strengthen them, which suggests a presumption that a member state will
comply with Europol’s request. Any reason for not complying
could be subject to challenge before the ECJ. Indeed, my noble friend
Lord Sharkey acknowledged that this was a risk. We would have real
concerns if that led to the European courts judging our policing

committee has argued that we should opt into the text and negotiate out
these provisions. That is an option, especially as opting in before 30

still be out-voted. We would then be bound by the outcome even if we

is right to bear in mind that the decision to stay out at this stage

international crime and terrorism by being in an arrangement which
ensures maximum 
<?notus-xml column=1065?>European operational effectiveness? If they do agree that that is the
case, how will we make sure that the regulation is what it should be if
we sit on the sidelines, wait until others have decided and then make

have expressed an interest in accommodating CEPOL, and there seems
little point in insisting that it should stay in the UK just for the

existing Europol Council decisions, although this does remain subject

earlier. Can I have an assurance that, if the decision is taken between

Hannay of Chiswick:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a relatively
brief debate, and I hasten to assure those faithful few still here that
I do not intend to apply Professor Parkinson’s law and use all
the time available to wind it up. I think that the common point among
all noble Lords who participated was the recognition that serious crime
is an international problem now and that we need a great deal of
co-operation to deal with it. That really was agreed by everyone. The
noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, said that crime 
<?notus-xml column=1068?>does not stop at Calais. I sometimes think that some of the
Government’s supporters believe that crime starts at Calais, but
we can leave that on one side. The fact is that it occurs on both sides
of the Channel and the perpetrators are more and more imaginative about
their use of technology and very rapid and easy travel, and all the
other tricks of the trade, and that is why we need this sort of
co-operation to deal with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070142000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070142000050">I thank
the faithful members of the sub-committee that I chair, the noble
Lords, Lord Sharkey and Lord Judd, for having participated in this

to some of the practical consequences of Europol co-operation.
Sometimes our debates must seem a bit theoretical, but he brought us
firmly back to earth. The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, who is on the EU
Select Committee, was also very
convincing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070142000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070142000051">Even
I find this opt-in and opt-out business pretty confusing sometimes. We
should remember, if we find it infuriatingly confusing, that it is
entirely of our own making. No other member state goes through these
agonies. This is an exercise in sadomasochism. I am not contesting it
because I know how it came about. The various previous Governments who
negotiated these rather complex arrangements were justified in doing
so, in my view, but the complications are of our own making, so we
should not get too irritated by them even though they are difficult to
understand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070142000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070142000052">To
answer a question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Smith—the
noble Lord did not answer it—first, there is the directive on
the proceeds of crime, which your Lordships’ committee
recommended the Government should opt into. The Government did not opt
in, but they have not excluded opting in at the adoption stage. That is
the position which the noble Lord described in relation to Europol.
Rather more seriously, there is the European surveillance order, in
which the Government do not have an opt-in or an opt-out; they have
simply failed to implement a piece of European legislation which they
agreed to. It came into force throughout the European Union in December
last year.</hs_para>

surveillance order is actually rather important for British citizens
because it provides the possibility for someone who is subject to a
European arrest warrant to be bailed in their own country: that is, to
stay in this country and avoid being taken to, say, some insalubrious
jail in Greece where they are kept while awaiting trial. My own view,
and that of everybody who participated last week in the very good
seminar in which the noble Lord’s colleague, James Brokenshire,
participated very positively, is that it is unconscionable that we have
not opted into this. Apparently the reason is that the Government did
not wish to pre-empt the view they were going to take on the European
arrest warrant, but as a result of that decision there are British
citizens who are not able to make use of the European surveillance
order and be bailed in this country. That number will grow as the delay
grows.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070142000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-0002.htm#13070142000054">Turning

myself a little baffled by his remark that the decision is finely
balanced. It certainly has not been finely balanced in this House this
evening; it was not finely balanced in the views of our various
witnesses who talked to us about Europol’s activities. They were
not Europol officials but British officials—people from ACPO and

that we would not opt into the Europol regulation but would seek to

cause a great deal of bad blood if they do that. It will damage their
negotiating position both on Europol and on the block opt-out for the
simple reason that nobody will have the slightest idea what they really
intend to do. Do they really value Europol or do they not? If they do
value it, why can they not negotiate about Europol like everyone else?

like–minded Member States, it is in a much better state than the
original proposals. By agreeing a deal on these regulations we have
provided certainty for farmers and delivery bodies.</hs_para>

regulation, I argued strongly on the importance of flexibility for
Member States to deliver the Commission’s
‘greening’ proposals, if they wish to, through national
certification schemes, allowing all the regions of the UK the
possibility to achieve a better balance between costs and environmental
benefits than if we were to apply the measures set out in the
Commission’s original proposal. On coupled support, the prospect
of return to tobacco subsidies has been successfully resisted. However,
it is disappointing that there is not a common set of rules for Member
States and there will be an opportunity to increase the use of coupled
schemes. This is a backward step as EU Agriculture has made good
progress in phasing out subsidy linked to production. In terms of
simplification there will be a mandatory active farmer test but we
successfully negotiated this should only be based on assessing against
a much shorter list of business types. In addition the small farmer
measure will also be voluntary though the young farmer provisions ended
up as
mandatory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307018000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-wms0001.htm#1307018000047">On
Rural Development, the agreed regulation will enable all regions of the
UK to deliver environmental benefits and rural economic growth through
their Rural Development Programmes. A solution was found which removes
the threat of farmers being paid twice, once under each pillar of the
CAP, for carrying out the same environmental measures. Member
States will also have to spend at least 30% of their rural development
budget on environmental measures. This is important to help support
farmers in their crucial role in enhancing and protecting the natural
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307018000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130701-wms0001.htm#1307018000048">On
the Horizontal (finance and control) Regulation, there was the
inclusion of some UK-inspired simplifications. This includes on areas
such as audit provisions, having a longer transition period for mapping
requirements under the greening measures, and a more proportionate
approach on penalties. The ability to use a monthly average euro to
sterling exchange rate may also help give more certainty to farmers and

abstained in the vote on the Single Common Market Organisation (single
CMO). In an attempt to secure agreement with the European Parliament
changes were introduced which did not continue on the trajectory of
reform. Market intervention is unnecessary, costly, and should only be
used in times of genuine crisis as it has negative effects on
farmers’ abilities to respond to market signals and consumer
demand. While end dates have been set for production quotas for sugar
beet and planting rights for vines, these have been extended beyond
dates previously agreed. Nor were adequate safeguards introduced for
the sugar refinery sector. This is bad for businesses and consumers,
and will keep prices artificially high. In addition, I was unhappy with
the move to allow the European Parliament’s involvement in
decisions on reference prices and intervention prices that was part of
the final agreement. I believe this does not adhere to the Treaty on
the Functioning of the European Union principles on the balance of
responsibilities between the Council and the European Parliament. It
was right that the UK took a principled stand.</hs_para>

devolution arrangements. I also obtained a smoother transition than in
the Commission’s original text from historical to

that Israeli restrictions on movement and access in the West Bank and
Gaza are the single biggest obstacle to trade and economic development,
and hence one of the most important causes of the current financial
difficulties of the Palestinian Authority. This is in line with the
assessment of the World Bank's Economic Monitoring Report to the Ad Hoc

the International Monetary Fund's report to the AHLC noted, the limited
progress in reducing restrictions has led to a rise in unemployment (up

percent during the same period in 2011), a decline in public services
and the halving of growth in the West Bank and Gaza (from 12.2 percent

result is harm to the long term competitiveness of the Palestinian
