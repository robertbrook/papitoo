petition system advisedly—that is, not just the e-petition
system. At the moment the e-petition system is working well and is a
significant improvement on what happened in the past. The paper
petition system in this House is somewhat anachronistic. What we
need—I want to work with colleagues to make this
happen—is a petition system that enables our constituents to
petition their Parliament but also engages with Government to get a
response from Government. The signal improvement, I hope, will be for
this House to be able to use the petition system as a basis for
demonstrating further improvements in the engagement of the House with

me turn to how we will invest in stronger communities. The Government
have made a very strong commitment to education. We have protected the
schools budget, including the pupil premium. We know what parents want:
a good school nearby in a good state of repair, and this is how we will
give it to them. First, some buildings simply are not good enough, so
we are rebuilding 261 of the worst schools as part of the Priority
School Building programme. With the moneys I have committed today, we
will complete this by 2017—two years early. There are many other
schools in need of repair and investment. The previous Government
stopped even checking just how many schools were in need of repair. We
have started again. We will put £10 billion behind this, which
will be enough to clear the urgent backlog. We are investing, too, to
create 1 million new places in a decade across the country, including
in Lancashire, Leeds and London—better buildings and a place for
every child are the best investment in our future generation.</hs_Para>

will continue to invest in the health of the nation, too. The health
budget will rise in 2015, including on capital. That means we can begin
redeveloping the Royal Liverpool hospital next year, and I can also

new approach to housing is truly transformative. Our Help to Buy scheme
is already getting people on to the ladder. But, put simply, this
country does not have enough homes that people can afford. The previous
Government allowed the number of affordable homes to fall by a shocking
420,000. A good home should not be a luxury for the few, but an
achievable aspiration for the many. We are already ensuring that the
affordable housing supply increases every year, not decreases, as it
did in every year but one under the previous Government. But our
housing associations have told me that they can do more. To do that,
they need certainty on rents, alongside public investment. So today I
can provide both those things: I can guarantee that social rents will
be set at the consumer prices index plus 1% out to 2025—the
longest period of certainty ever; and I can provide £3 billion
more capital over three years from 2015 to deliver 165,000 new
affordable homes. On average, that is more each year than in any of the
past 20 years; it is more in three years than the previous Government
managed in seven. And we can do all that because our approach gets
twice as many houses as they did for every pound we put in, getting
more for the taxpayer and more for this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T10:40:54"></hs_TimeCode>. This

many Members of this House, on both sides, have in recent years seen

<?notus-xml column=468?>increase that in real terms every year to 2020. More than 400,000
households will be protected over this decade. Insurance also has a
vital role to play in helping households deal with the consequences
when flooding does occur. I am pleased to tell the House that we have
now reached an initial agreement with the Association of British
Insurers on the future of flood insurance. The industry wants to do the
right thing and so do we. We have always said that we wanted to find a
solution that works for households at risk of flooding, wider bill
payers and the taxpayer. The industry’s proposed scheme, known
as Flood Re, promises to do that by effectively limiting insurance
prices for high-risk households. Up to 500,000 households would be
helped, with support targeted towards those on lower incomes. Support
would be funded by a levy on insurers, something the ABI has promised
us will not increase customer bills in general. Importantly, there will
be no cost to taxpayers.</hs_Para>

well as revolutionising the way in which we get our energy, we are
transforming how we generate and supply it. As we face the challenge of
climate change, we need to bring forward investment in low-carbon
technologies. This country has massive potential in wind, wave and
tidal. We need to harness it. We are putting in place a comprehensive
energy policy through the Energy Bill that is in front of this House.
This is an approach that we know will work for consumers and investors
alike. Last year we made the unprecedented decision to set out funding
plans for low-carbon generation all the way to 2020, providing up to
£7.6 billion in real terms.</hs_Para>

set out what this means for investors. We do this through setting
strike prices. If future prices are below this level, we will guarantee
a price to the generator, giving them the confidence to invest now. But
if they rise above it, we will claw back money for consumers. We were
planning to set strike prices next month, but 
<?notus-xml column=472?>we have been able to make faster progress so, today, I can
announce that we are publishing the prices for renewable generation
ahead of schedule. Prices have been set for key renewable technologies,
including onshore and offshore wind, tidal, wave biomass and solar. The
prices are broadly similar to those we would have to pay under the
renewables obligation. We will set the price at the level we need to
bring forward sufficient investment, but not a penny higher. As these
technologies develop, costs will fall, so we will reduce the price too.
For instance, next year we will guarantee generators
£155 per megawatt hour of offshore wind. By 2018 this will fall
to £135. We expect our reforms to bring forward 8GW to 16 GW of
offshore wind capacity. Industry asked for certainty; we have given it.

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0001.htm#13062761000252">Yes,
this approach has costs now but, in the long term for consumers, they
will be more stable than they would otherwise have been. In fact, when
this investment goes alongside our plans for energy efficiency, overall
our policies could save an average of £166 per household by
2020. We are taking the right decisions now for the good of our
country.</hs_Para>

we need to guarantee that capacity will be available at short notice to
meet spikes in demand, for instance through gas-fired stations. Today
we can provide details on a new regime that will achieve this. The
first auction for this new capacity market will run next year to
provide certainty for the winter of 2018. But there is financial risk
for construction, too. That is why we have set up a Green Investment
Bank to back green energy projects. It has committed over £600
million already; for instance, it has invested in the Walney wind farms
off the north-west coast of England, which are expected to provide
energy to the equivalent to 300,000 households. We have already pledged
to provide £3 billion for the bank and, today, I can
announce that we will provide an additional £800 million so that
it can expand further. Crucially this will include, for the first time,
the power to borrow half a billion pounds in 2015-16 from Government.
This is a real milestone in green investment, delivering a key promise
we made in our election manifesto, unlocking over £100 billion

Alexander:</Member></B> Thank you for that advice, Mr.
Speaker. I was merely attempting to respond to the inaccurate account
of our investment given by the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris
Leslie). In fact, investment as a share of GDP will be higher
during the current decade than it was during the 13 years for
which Labour was in office. We are spending more and underspending less
than Labour did. Ours is a record of delivery and a record of action,
and today I have given the House our promise of more.</hs_Para>

Gentleman asked about the private sector. We have been listening to the
private sector, which is why we are setting out the long-term plans
that it wants. He asked about the planning system. We have reformed the
planning system, and he voted against that reform. He also asked about
flooding. As I said in my statement, my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will be announcing
amendments to the Water Bill. The hon. Gentleman will know from the
spending round document which was published yesterday that the forecast
for local government self-financed expenditure is up, not down. I am
sorry to hear that he opposes investment in shale gas. His Building
Schools for the Future programme was expensive and inefficient, which
is why we have introduced the Priority School Building

Secretary’s statement. Affordable flood insurance for all is
essential. Also, the A303/A30, which runs from Honiton up into Somerset

the west country and for its businesses. One final plea is for new
school buildings for Tiverton high school and a new school building for

recovery for more than 100 years, and businesses and families across

building programme has actually been built; only seven of the 576
infrastructure projects they promised have been completed; and they
have delivered a paltry 2,000 of the 100,000 new homes they promised
under the NewBuy scheme. They said that they would set up a British
investment bank to help businesses grow, but no business has yet had
help. They said that they would set up the Youth Contract to get young
people back to work, but no one has used it. They promised councils
£530 million for superfast broadband, but so far they have
paid out only £3 million. They said that they want more
infrastructure spending, but yesterday revealed a £1
billion cut in capital spending. They said that they would bring down
borrowing, but it is £245 billion higher than they planned. Is
not the truth that they are posturing, not governing? They are

those recommendations and express their views on them before the Bill

were the prime movers in the creation of the commission. Nor can I

of the positive announcements made by the Chancellor yesterday. There
are now many local authorities —Plymouth clearly is

provided to the troubled families programme. Some £448 million
over three years was announced in December 2011 by the Prime Minister,
and the extension now announced for funding in 2015-16 enables a
further expansion. I cannot offer time at the moment, but my hon.
Friend makes an interesting point. Many hon. Members may now feel that
they are starting to understand the benefit of this programme and the
opportunity that the extension might give, and they are probably
starting to think that it is time for them to start sharing that

have been taking exceptional measures to try to deliver
efficiency savings and maintain front-line services. What my hon.

happened under the Government the hon. Gentleman supported.

economy was growing and even before we hit the
Labour-induced recession. This programme should, through traineeships
alongside apprenticeships, help some of the young people who have found
the greatest difficulty getting into work. That will also help us to

in so far as the hon. Lady feels dissatisfied—and she is a

find other opportunities for the matter to be debated. I do not know
whether the Government will decide to come forward with an oral

Bryant</B> (Rhondda) (Lab):</Member> On a point of order, Mr Speaker.
On 18 March you were very wise—[<SmallCaps>Hon.
Members:</SmallCaps> “Always.”] And on many other
occasions—you are always wise and wonderful, never curmudgeonly,
and all the rest of it. But, on 18 March, you very wisely dug the
Government out of a hole and enabled the whole House to come to a view
on the future regulation of the press, by allowing a manuscript
amendment and a change to the order of business, without the normal
rules of the House. That was a wise course of action to take. Since
then, however, the declared will of the Prime 
<?notus-xml column=507?>Minister, the Government, the Opposition and the whole House, which was
for the matter to go to the Privy Council meeting in May, has not been
implemented. You are, as I understand it, a Privy Counsellor, and I
suppose you could go to the Privy Council and insist that the matter be
carried forward as swiftly as possible. You might not want to go down
that route, but I wonder whether you could chase this matter up a
little, because the whole House, the victims and all those who had
their phones hacked would be profoundly disappointed if the matter did
not go to the July meeting of the Privy Council, if legal advice were
not provided, if no reason were provided to the House, and if no action
had been forthcoming when we came back in
September.</hs_Para>

complaint about that; I simply point out that I did not have
such notice—is twofold. First, I am a Privy Counsellor, but as
the hon. Gentleman well knows, I do not call meetings of the Privy
Council, which take place perhaps from time to time. Secondly, I
understand the hon. Gentleman’s point—I would be
exceptionally unwise if I did not—and if he is minded to pursue
the matter, he will have multiple opportunities. I have a sense that

many in the House will know, the background to the debate is that just
after the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012

“Transforming Legal Aid.” That consultation closed on 4
June, and the Government are due to respond after the summer recess.
The proposals were incredibly wide ranging and arguably more
significant in some ways than those in the LASPO Act, but it looked as
if the House would not get an opportunity to debate that consultation
document before the Government responded. As the Government are
currently proposing secondary legislation for the matter, my concern is
that we may not get an opportunity to have a debate before the
legislation is introduced.</hs_Para>

the most invidious and troubling cases, however, are those involving
people in immigration detention. That, too, was specifically included
in LASPO because it involved the state depriving people of their
liberty. They must instigate their own proceedings. We often have
indefinite detention for these people; their case does not
automatically review, yet they will not be eligible for legal aid,
because they are not lawfully here. The chief inspector of prisons has

application process for exceptional funding is exceptionally
complicated; it is extremely difficult to provide the required evidence
to the Legal Aid Agency, which is why very few people have applied, and

exceptional funding exists for cases outside the scope of LASPO, yet

cases. That is not much good for people who may have a pressing problem

is this so important? It is important because the Secretary of State
has caricatured this debate as being solely about producers and

fat-cat lawyers and their fees. He also sought to suggest that this
follows in a long line of reform to legal aid over the last 10 years
and that ultimately it is about saving £220 million
of taxpayers’ money. I think it is hugely important that Members

choice of lawyer is fundamental and essential. In fact every democratic
country we can think of enables that choice. That this Government
should seek now to say that someone facing criminal charges cannot

Lammy:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right. It is totally
unacceptable that the Government have sought to rush this measure
through after a speedy consultation that lasted less than two months.
It is wrong that there should not be a vote in the House and it is
wrong to caricature previous changes to legal aid as having any
relationship with these changes. When I was legal aid Minister, changes
were made to scope in personal injury in an attempt to take out those
who were caught up in speeding or traffic cases in the legal aid
system. We introduced fixed fees to maintain costs. We introduced
online and phone systems for free legal advice to limit costs. Those
were the sorts of changes we introduced; we did not attempt to charge
and make an attack on judicial review.</hs_Para>

review is so important. Most people in this country feel that public

until they have an elderly relative in a care home and abuse goes on in
that care home, or until they live in the path of High Speed 2 or
Crossrail. There are people in this country who would seek to use
judicial review and it is a travesty that this Government would run a

<?notus-xml column=515?>Britain, but £1.22 in America. Let us find the savings through

access to it.

headlines at the moment about Jimmy Mubenga, a young man who lost his
life in a deportation case. His family would not get legal aid. Is that
really the kind of country we want to live in? Is that what we want to
arm our Foreign Secretaries with when they are trying to speak
powerfully to foreign Governments who seek to oppress their citizens?
It cannot be, so I ask the Department to think again about the decision
and to think very hard about the changes it is attempting to railroad
through Parliament.</hs_Para>

It is deeply concerning that it has taken senior Back Benchers going to

talking about high street firms in Bristol, Swindon and
Brixton—places as different as that—is unacceptable. This

barristers going on strike, some 25% of criminal law firms having
closed shop in the previous four years and rates having been frozen for
a decade. The then Labour Government acknowledged that the system was
unsustainable and prepared, but subsequently failed, to introduce
contracts for criminal legal aid tendering. Admitting their inability

Djanogly:</Member></B> The previous Government were considering
contracting, as were Labour Front Benchers during this Parliament. We
need to appreciate that the Legal Services Act 2007, brought in by the
previous Government with Conservative support, has transformed the
potential for legal service provision. To cut a long story short, there
is now no reason why solicitors and barristers should not go into
partnership together, or indeed, with non-legal organisations, via
alternative business structures. There is no reason why barristers
should not take instructions direct from the client nor any reason why
barristers should not themselves bid for contracts and employ

the predominantly civil legal aid cuts that have come into effect have
taken out of scope swathes of provision for benefits, social welfare
and large areas of housing and employment. It has happened at the same
time as local authorities are struggling with a 30%-plus reduction in
their own funding, which has added to the squeeze on advice services.
That impact is being felt up and down the country. Just this week, we
were sorry to hear the news that Birmingham law centre was the first
major urban law centre to go under. I am struggling to see whether we
can sustain Paddington law centre, the second oldest law centre in the

Buck:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is correct. This is something that we
will see in terms of the “Transforming Legal Aid” agenda.
We are seeing advice deserts emerging. We are seeing the concentration
of services in larger providers and, critically, we are seeing the loss
of specialist services, which are so important. As is often the case
with this Government, we are finding that cuts—the £350
million taken off the legal services budget—do not always mean
savings. As we were warned, we are already seeing an increase in the
number of litigants in person appearing in court. The Bar and judges
warned that it would lead to additional
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:24:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000588" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0002.htm#13062761000588">A
number of changes that have impacted on housing need have led to an 86%
rise in homelessness acceptances in my local authority alone.
Homelessness decisions remain within scope of LASPO, but debt and
welfare advice provision does not and those issues are what lead people
to the brink of homelessness in the first place. As a result of the
loss of advice services and the dramatic increase in homelessness, we
are seeing extra costs falling on local authorities and wiping out a
number of the
savings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:25:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000589" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0002.htm#13062761000589">It

hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather) has pointed out, urban
constituencies such as ours with large migrant populations are most
likely to feel the impact of the new residency qualifications. Those
qualifications will have a particularly severe impact on children. I am
indebted to a law company in my constituency called Just for Kids Law,
which has raised with me its fears about the residency qualifications
and the extent to which they will hit trafficked children and the
children and families of victims of domestic violence, some of whom
have come here on their husband’s visa. It will hit children and
families of people who have come here to work in domestic service. This
is something I am familiar with in my constituency and have many
problems with. Finally, it will hit the babies and small children of
British citizens who have been abroad and returned to this country, who
will lose their
qualification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:29:41"></hs_TimeCode>.

the Minister to look carefully at the financial incentives in the
proposed contracts. As we on the Public Accounts Committee know, there
is touching faith in most Departments that their private sector
partners will “do the right thing”. They will—but
it will be the right thing to maximise their profits. It beggars
believe that firms might get the same fee for a quick guilty plea as
they get for a trial lasting days or even weeks. I know that the
Secretary of State is a great believer in payment by results, but is he
really looking for justice through short trials with few witnesses, or
for innocent, vulnerable people to be locked up through a quick guilty
plea? That is what his system will

Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Maidstone and
The Weald (Mrs Grant), showed breathtaking complacency about the
overall effect on and cost to the courts system. She even seemed to be
content with a present failure rate that is five times greater than the
one contracted for. In addition, as has been noted, early results
coming in on the new civil legal aid arrangements show more court
cases, not fewer, and many cases doubling in length owing to inadequate

Ministry has touching faith that many groups of lawyers will come
together to bid; in fact, it will be largely the same magic circle of
outsourcers, who hover like vultures around the award of almost every
public contract—with the rumoured addition this time of a
supermarket and a haulage company. One company likely to win work, of
course, is G4S, with which the Secretary of State will be familiar from
his previous job. G4S’s success in winning work in this sector
raises the spectre that a person could be arrested, then have G4S
legally representing them at the police station; providing the civilian
staff processing them there; transporting them to court; representing
them there; owning the court in which that person is tried; tagging
them if they 
<?notus-xml column=522?>are on bail; and, if they are found guilty, transporting them to a G4S
prison—oh, and it is quite possible that when they are released,
G4S will be in charge of their rehabilitation. The potential perverse
incentives in that chain are mind-boggling. I urge the Ministry of
Justice to ensure that its contract packages meet its stated aims. The
Ministry’s record on contracting is appalling. How will it be

as I know, it is very unusual for a partner in the firm to come out in

solicitor who attends at a police station in the middle of the night is
often dealing with extremely serious allegations—sometimes
allegations of murder. I have been in that position on a number of
occasions, representing clients who are alleged to have committed
murder. The solicitor is there on his or her own, whereas the police
have advice from the CPS and many officers to assist them. The
solicitor is facing all that pressure and is not being paid properly,
even under the current arrangements, for his or her

shall go on to deal with price competitive tendering, but first let me
try and bust a myth. There seems to be a suggestion that the Labour
Government were particularly generous to criminal lawyers. We were not.
Criminal lawyers have sustained cuts to fees from successive
Governments. The current proposals are far reaching and, if they go
through, they will be horrifically damaging to the criminal justice
system. PCT will inevitably lead to the market being dominated by the
big multinationals—the usual suspects—G4S, Serco, Capita,

probably be provided by less qualified people supervised, perhaps, by a
single lawyer. The “stack it high, sell it cheap”

the heart of the Government’s proposals lies the question of

Quality was high among those concerns for completely understandable
reasons, but it must be a little worrying that some of the
organisations representing the profession are refusing to engage with

Justice Committee’s session also threw up evidence from the
profession that there were other areas where it felt that savings could
be made, and should be made, first. Principal among these were the
court system, and persuasive evidence was given that there are huge
costs within the court system driven by other agencies and factors
outwith the control of those providing legal representation. I have
some sympathy with the argument that says that to reform the cost of
representation without dealing with those factors misidentifies at

met Robert Ashworth of Saulet Ashworth LLP in Portsmouth and although
he did not agree with the Government’s changes, the point he
made to me that people should be able to choose their representation
seemed to be a good one for the following reasons. He believes there
are considerable hidden cost savings in certain types of, shall we say
regular, clients in having a trusted solicitor whose
recommendations will be accepted without debate. A case in
point would be a recommendation, after due thought by the solicitor and
the representative, to offer a guilty verdict. If accepted, this can
clearly lead to a large saving across many budgets. He believes, and I
accept the core of his argument, that such savings might be lost to the
system under the new arrangements. I know that he submitted his views
to the Government during the consultation. I hope that the Minister
will acknowledge that there is an issue to be
considered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000642" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0003.htm#13062761000642"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:49:45"></hs_TimeCode>The
second issue that has been raised with me relates to rural sparsity.
One of the concerns that has emerged from the consultation is that
rural areas might be disadvantaged as a result of the proposals. In
Derbyshire, Cumbria, Wales, parts of Norfolk, and indeed many other
parts of the country, it is very likely that the contracts awarded will
cluster in or around a small number of larger towns.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:50:05"></hs_TimeCode> my own

the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner) has pointed out.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:50:13"></hs_TimeCode>That might limit
access to justice, given the geographic scale of some of those areas.
Once again, I hope that the Minister will offer some indication that
that factor has been
recognised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0003.htm#13062761000643"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:50:23"></hs_TimeCode>Reform
of the legal aid budget is tough. Its sheer scope and size means that
it just is not possible that it can escape savings. The industry itself
might come forward with a comprehensive and deliverable package of
change that recognises that reducing budgets is unavoidable and
timeliness is essential. If it does, I hope and expect that the
Minister will give the proposals due consideration. However, although I
recognise that the Government’s proposals will lead to
considerable change 
<?notus-xml column=526?>in the industry, they currently appear, at least to an outsider, to be
the only game in town. I believe that, if handled correctly, they can
be the right way forward, although, crucially, they must protect the
quality of outcomes at the same time as saving
money.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/41152A7A97C20B0762EAD702DAD3CFF95C0F5151" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="27 June 2013">Thursday

There is of course scope to tackle inefficiency within the justice

elements of a sound justice system remain in place. Instead, what we
see is a slash-and-burn approach to legal aid—I, other hon.

it—that will absolutely rewrite the fundamental principles and
values of the modern British justice system. The reforms attack the
principles of fairness, justice and, fundamentally, hope.</hs_Para>

justice has been a foundation stone of this country’s criminal
justice system for years. Many small and medium-sized legal firms are

justice system a strong and comparatively fair one.</hs_Para>

firms will be forced to close as they will be unable to compete with
the large entities that are entirely commercially driven, which will be
the only ones able successfully to bid for contracts. The only
incentive for obtaining a contract will be to spend as little as

The removal of choice in the selection of representation concerns me.
The idea that the state will prosecute, that it will contract those who

review is an important branch of law. Of course, the Executive do not

judicial review. No one can predict the outcome of a case, so having to
make a judgment that there is a 50% chance of winning to receive legal
aid, is absurd. Evidence has to be heard from both sides and a decision
is made based on arguments that are made before an impartial judiciary.
Lawyers are obliged to advise a client whether a case has merits before
they proceed. What about the figures for judicial review? They are not
increasing exponentially. A written answer to me revealed that in 2009
there were 2,145 cases in judicial review, with that figure going up to

According to the

midlands. The Magistrates’ Association, another voice against
these proposals, says that there appears to be little consistency in
the number of contracts allocated to each area. The idea that one would
get paid irrespective of how one’s client pleads is absurd. That
is not justice; that is plea bargaining. The Lord Chancellor should
know the difference. It is not choice either, as it concentrates
representation and funds in a few hands. Lawyers pride themselves on
their reputation—that is how they get their referrals. This will
deny people the chance of choosing who they want to represent them.

Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)—by Government
assurances that the quality of legal aid providers will be guaranteed
by a state body. This debate comes barely a week after the Care Quality
Commission scandal. That demonstrates how difficult it is to guarantee
the quality of complex intellectual services, which, of course, justice
is. We should notice that even where the state has direct
control—namely, the CPS and the Serious Fraud Office—it
cannot guarantee quality there either. A judge in a recent murder case
described the CPS lawyer as “completely inadequate”. The
judge said that the lawyer cited old law, did not understand the
current law, fell out with the prosecution team, and then simply did
not show up on the following Monday. As a result, the trial had to be
held six months later. If we cannot guarantee our own system and our
own service, how are we going to guarantee 400 private operators around
the

the Member for Esher and Walton mentions de Menezes, who was shot,

brings me to my final point, which is about judicial review. I
sympathise with Ministers who find it irksome that we have so many
judicial reviews, but the Government are in danger of getting
themselves a reputation for wanting to act above the law. Irksome as it
is, judicial reviews are what keeps British Governments
honest—it does not matter of which party or of which origin,
they keep the Government honest. I say to the Government that before
they strike down these things at their own convenience, they should
think again, come back more slowly and present this House with some
primary legislation we can then be proud
of.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/70D7495A72E83F594FF8F50432D33191E4D5F5E9" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="27 June 2013">Thursday

to justice must not be determined by the ability to pay. That is one of
the most important safeguards we have in a state that believes in

paying their own legal fees. We support the use of the frozen assets of
criminals to fund their legal costs. We also agree on the need to
address the problems of very high-cost cases, not to mention the need

problem is that the core of the Government’s proposals are
likely to have consequences that go against the grain of so much that
we are proud of in our system. We surely cannot go through a process of
reform that leads us to a system that puts quantity ahead of quality,
and risks leading to an increase in miscarriages of justice. The
Government’s reforms will replace the current model whereby the
Ministry of 
<?notus-xml column=538?>Justice purchases legal aid services from 1,400
local providers with a model involving just 400 larger providers. The
fee structure will be changed so that lawyers’ fees are paid

wish to raise a number of concerns, the first of which is about choice,
which has been mentioned by so many hon. Members. Choice is vital to
ensuring that people have trust in the person representing them. Under
these proposals, defendants who want to change their provider will have
to apply to a court and then it will be the Legal Aid Agency that will
determine which other provider services their need. On quality, the
tendering process will be skewed to the lowest-cost provider; lowest
cost will trump quality. If it is hard for someone to change their
solicitor, what is the incentive to firms to ensure that they provide
the best quality to the vulnerable? There is a great concern that the
state—the prosecutor—will also be picking
someone’s defence. No doubt, that will again lead to concerns
about conflicts of interest and miscarriages of justice.</hs_Para>

to raise the issue of the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>impact the
proposals will have on black and minority ethnic firms, which form a
large proportion of solicitors, particularly in London. Some statistics
show—the Society of Asian Lawyers has done some excellent work
on this issue—that four years ago 4,000 firms of solicitors were
able to offer legal assistance to those in the criminal justice system
in London, and 40% of those firms were owned by Asian and black
lawyers. Changes over the past few years have reduced the
figure to 1,600, with a disproportionate number of the firms that have

Brine</B> (Winchester) (Con):</Member> I wish to make a few short
remarks about the “Transforming Legal Aid” consultation,
which has sparked such lively debate in this House and across the
profession, to put it mildly. I qualify my comments by making the point
that I am a member of the Select Committee on Justice, as is
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:37:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Feltham and Heston (Seema Malhotra), whom I follow. The Committee
is conducting a mini-inquiry into these proposals. Representatives of
the profession have been before us already, and we will see the Lord
Chancellor on Wednesday next week. So I have to say that I do not
recognise some of the knockabout from 
<?notus-xml column=539?>the Opposition about the Lord Chancellor somehow
being absent on this one. Members from across this House will be very

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:38:13"></hs_TimeCode>claims have
certainly been made about these proposals in the past few months, one
of which was made at the Committee’s first hearing on the
subject, on 11 June: that the proposals will spell the end of the
independent judiciary in this country, no less. That is quite a claim,
but I do not think it is true and I do not think it helps the debate.
Concerns certainly exist about the reduction in the number of those at
the Bar if these proposals go ahead—future judges are, of
course, drawn from these people. That point has not been aired enough
in this debate so far, so perhaps the Minister will touch on it and
allay the fears.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>Another point
that has been made is that the effect of the proposals will be a
fundamental change to the criminal justice system, and that is

Members still wish to speak in this debate and I know that they will
discuss many of these fundamental changes and what they might mean, so
I wish to focus on the issue of choice. It has been repeatedly raised
with me by constituents, as it has been raised by other hon. Members
who have spoken this afternoon. During the consultation, a practising
barrister in my constituency sent me what I thought was a useful case
study—and one that I hope will show the human side of this
point. Under the current system, he explained, a young man with
profound mental health problems was again arrested for having a knife
in a public place. My constituent, an experienced solicitor, whom the
young man knew and trusted, was called. He had the defendant’s
previous psychiatric reports on file and even his psychiatrist’s
number in his phone. The defendant was questioned by the police
and advice was tendered. A number of appearances in the magistrates
court led to the case being committed to Crown court, at which point my
constituent was instructed, as he had been before, and updated
psychiatric reports were
obtained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000742" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0003.htm#13062761000742">Following
various pre-trial hearings to sort out reports, a two-day trial was
held, at the end of which the young man was acquitted and further
psychiatric treatment was ordered by the judge. Happily, according to
my constituent, the young man is now on the right medication, and has a
diagnosis of Asperger’s. He even has a job for a couple of hours
a week. My and my constituent’s concern is that under price
competitive tendering, the duty solicitor, who almost certainly would
not know the defendant, might well advise a guilty plea, with an alien
barrister, either in the magistrates court or at first appearance in
the Crown court. My constituent tells me that the fee is the same for a
guilty plea as it is for a short trial, so what is the incentive to
have a trial?</hs_Para>

is a huge potential conflict of interest for the advocate, says my
constituent, with the young man possibly being sent to prison,
resulting in devastating consequences for him and the state. I think he
makes a powerful point. Putting aside the arguments about a
reduction in choice in relation to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and
Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 and the European convention provisions
on the right to a fair trial, which I understand opponents of the
proposals will bring forward, if they are pursued, Ministers must
address PCT and the choice issue, so that we do not throw the baby out

that we have one of the best legal professions in the world—a
lot of it resides in my part of the world—and I want to see it

think, slow down, find initial savings and then reform the system in a

to the scale needed to compete for contracts and unable to offer the
loss leaders of the big companies that want to get into the market,
hundreds of firms will go to the wall, and as was pointed out, this

makes clear, lawyers will receive the same fee for entering a swift
guilty plea as for providing several days’ legal defence.

to choose a lawyer is a fundamental breach of rights. I am disappointed

less essential that taxpayers’ money is used to the best effect.
A cut-off point can be set on a person’s income above which they
will not qualify for legal aid, but there are also cases in which
someone who is eligible for it carries on a vexatious case against a
person who is just above the threshold and has to fund the case
themselves. That is perhaps not a matter for debate today, but it is
essential, if we are to ensure that people can get access to legal aid,
to ensure that those cases that are pursued are legitimate and not

concerned about certain aspects of it, as I live in and represent an
area of Devon that is very rural and the proposed contract will be very
large. I believe that the Secretary of State and the Minister
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:54:15"></hs_TimeCode> listening to
these arguments; the Minister is nodding his head. I do not want us to
be a Government who reduce choice, who drive out of business many small
firms that do an excellent job and, perhaps, who do not save anywhere
near as much money as we believe we will. Before we go ploughing on
with this, let us sit down and have a proper consultation. I am hopeful
that the Government are not just saying this and that they will have
meaningful talks. I look forward to that

stage of the process. The final stage of bids will be determined on

Aldous</B> (Waveney) (Con):</Member> I am grateful to the hon. Member

concentrate mainly on the proposals relating to price competitive
tendering. My concern is that these are not suitable for a county such
as Suffolk, which covers a large geographical area, much of it rural in
nature. Suffolk has three principal urban centres: Ipswich, Bury St
Edmunds and Lowestoft, the latter being the principal town in my
constituency. All are some distance from each other.</hs_Para>

lived in Suffolk my whole life and having worked there as a chartered
surveyor for many years, I do not believe that it is practical for a
firm of solicitors based in one of the three towns to provide a good
service across the whole county. If the proposals are implemented in
their current form, I fear it could result in significant parts of the
county being left without ready access to good legal advice. One would,

towns where the presence of solicitors on the high street, often
long-established family firms or partnerships, could be put at risk.
There is a need for their continued presence. Large multi-discipline
firms have their place, but we do not want a system that encourages all
solicitors to locate on business parks, often inaccessible to public
transport, on the edge of remote urban centres. My worry is that the
proposals could eradicate those small legal firms who best know their
clients, and this would be bad for community justice. These high street
firms are not legal fat cats gorging on legal aid.</hs_Para>

I do not believe that four firms can provide comprehensive coverage
across the whole of Suffolk. Rather than applying the same straitjacket
to each of the 42 criminal justice service areas, would it not be more
appropriate to look more closely at the make-up of each area and come
up with a system that takes account of such features as rural sparsity
and the location of the main police stations, police investigation
centres and local
courts?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000789" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0003.htm#13062761000789">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>,
I am concerned that requiring firms to expand substantially to cover
such large procurement areas could mean that solicitors spend most of
their time sitting in their cars driving to courts and police stations.
In Suffolk, Lowestoft is 45 miles from Ipswich and 54 miles from Bury
St Edmunds. Is it realistic to reduce automatically by 17.5% fees that
have been pegged back in any case for many years, and then expect a
firm in, say, Ipswich to provide a comprehensive and good service in
Lowestoft? Will such firms have a proper and full understanding of the
needs, challenges and concerns of people in the Waveney area? Is it
practical for solicitors to drive an hour through the night to attend
at police stations? Driving up and down the A12 or along the A143 are
not the easiest journeys at the best of times.</hs_Para>

it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:05:41"></hs_TimeCode> has been
suggested that one way in which solicitors can improve their
productivity is to make greater use of paralegals. That would involve
those who are not fully qualified and have lower hourly charge-out fees
carrying out more routine work. Such an approach may well be practical
in other legal fields where there are fewer legal obligations, but not
in criminal legal aid, which is fundamentally different from other
legal work.</hs_Para>

magistrates’ custodial sentencing powers from six months to 12
months, which will enable justice to be delivered more efficiently and

restriction breaches the fundamental principle in our legal system that
those who are charged are presumed innocent until proved guilty.
Article 6 of the European convention on human rights requires that they

importance of the right to choose one’s lawyer has also been

representation, and she was acquitted. That would not happen under the
proposed new system. Again, we should not jeopardise access to the law

judicial review. That would not happen under the new system—and
she is not unique. As we heard from my hon. Friend the Member for
Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green), many prisoners are extremely
vulnerable, and may have mental health problems or learning
difficulties. It should be recognised that punishment is not the only
purpose of prison. Opportunities for rehabilitation should be offered,
and prisoners should have access to the law when that does not happen.

I want to say a few words about the smooth running of the justice

involving, sadly, people stuck in the revolving door of prison and the
justice system, and often involving drugs and so forth. The Government
are seeking to address that in a way I applaud, but these people often
have very complex problems, and the cause of ensuring justice in the
courts is almost certainly served by their being able to have some kind
of continuity of representation, rather than starting again with a new

stopped on the street by two part-time judges—there is obviously
something about Battersea, as part-time judges just stop people in the
street. They said that there are enormous savings to be made through
the system running more efficiently, with fewer delays and mishaps.
They also made the point that a rise in the number of litigants in
person will almost certainly have a knock-on impact on the justice
system, and not in a helpful or money-saving
way.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_27_PT_1/A5CD284EB22D6BCF3DA962A017DF5610EB038A82" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="27 June 2013">Thursday

Hillier</B> (Hackney South and Shoreditch) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I want
to talk about the impact of the proposals, the process and the politics
of the situation. Before I start, however, I should mention that I have
raised the issue with the National Audit Office, particularly after its
very good work on interpreters in the criminal justice system. The
Secretary of State ought to be a little worried, because the NAO will
be watching and monitoring the situation and waiting to assess the
impact. Of course, it always does that retrospectively, but the
Secretary of State could save himself a lot of grief from an NAO audit
if he improved the scheme from the beginning. What the NAO can do well
is consider the system as a whole. I have asked it to do that and it is
considering that request at the moment.</hs_Para>

time is limited, I will not repeat the arguments on the impact of the
scheme that have been made eloquently by so many Members. Let me touch
on a couple of points, however. The system is often painted as dealing
with criminals but, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:20:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams) said,
people are innocent until proven guilty. A local solicitor in my area
has pointed out that more than 50% of the people who rely on legal aid
with whom he deals are innocent and are neither charged nor cautioned.
This is an attack on the innocent, as well as on those who appear in
the picture painted by the Government.</hs_Para>

of the big impacts is through cost-shunting. We have heard a lot about
self-representation, more time and duplication of work. Those are
serious issues. I am a member of the Public Accounts Committee and when
we consider such issues, we see time and again that one Department
makes cuts and pushes the cost on to another. We must consider the
system-wide elements and I am not convinced that the Government have
done that.</hs_Para>

will not repeat the other arguments, save to mention what happened when
I was a Minister dealing with challenging issues, when I took on
dealing with children detained with their families. In that
investigation, I uncovered the immense cost of not getting proper legal
advice at the beginning of a case. It caused huge problems and damage
to those children at a later date. There was also a huge issue with the
geographical spread of cases. I did a round table in Wales and swathes
of that nation in our country did not have immigration lawyers. I fear
that this change will only exacerbate that.</hs_Para>

be proud of, that

priority. That makes it even more important that we as a Parliament and
a Government make sure it has integrity, but it cannot be excluded from

gone under in high-cost inner-city areas where low-income families are

all Members who have spoken, I have received many representations on
this matter. I do not have time to quote from or refer to them all, but
I would like us to remember one important underlying principle. When
the current legal aid system, more or less, was introduced in the
1940s—it was built on the rather ineffective system that existed
before—the then Government, who were much more far-sighted than
this Government, considered legal aid to be as valuable to justice in
our society as health, education, housing or the welfare state system
that prevented people from falling into destitution. What we are
approaching, if we are not already there, is a system in which if
someone is poor, destitute, marginalised and up against it, they will
get no help and no justice and will continue to suffer. Legal aid is
fundamentally important in a democratic, civilized society in which a
person can have their day in court to get a verdict in their favour or
otherwise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000867" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0003.htm#13062761000867">I

so I will rush through the most pressing of them. First, I will make
the position of the Opposition clear. We support efforts to find
savings across the justice system. We support making those who can
afford to pay their legal fees do so and restricting legal aid to those
who are most in need. We support using the frozen assets of criminals
to fund their legal costs. We would support moves to address the
problem of very high-cost cases. We would support a root-and-branch
review of our criminal justice system to cut out the waste and
inefficiency that anyone who works in the sector or has used it knows
is
rampant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000892" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0003.htm#13062761000892">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T15:52:32"></hs_TimeCode>

lead to more miscarriages of justice. We do not support legal aid being
run by the same global corporations that run prisons, probation
services, courts and tagging. I should say that those are the proposals

Parliament’s second attack on access to justice. Social welfare
legal aid has been decimated. We were accused of scaremongering during
the passage of those proposals. However, law centres have

closed—leaving the most vulnerable without recourse when they
suffer wrong decisions by the Government and other organs of the state.
In the recent past, more than 600,000 people have been denied access to

Fundamental to our legal system is a presumption of innocence. A
decision on guilt is taken by a court of law only after the evidence
for and against a prosecution is presented and cross-examined in an
open and transparent manner. Due process needs to happen. After all,
removing an individual’s liberty is one of the most important
powers in the gift of the state. Properly administered legal aid means
that all individuals charged with a criminal offence have legal
representation, not just those who can afford it, and ensures that our
country’s precious rule of law applies to everybody. Legal aid
helps those who are wrongly accused to maintain their innocence, and
ensures that the state proves, beyond reasonable doubt, the case
against a defendant. Please note that I use the word defendant, not
criminal. I do not, unlike others, make sweeping generalisations that
all those who receive legal aid are guilty criminals. The last time I
checked, we still had a presumption of innocence in this
country.</hs_Para>

miscarriages of justice have happened because of an absence of proper
representation for defendants: the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four,
the Maguire Seven and others. Because of legal aid, victims have
confidence that genuine perpetrators of crime are prosecuted and
punished. Victims of crime want certainty that the true perpetrator has
been found guilty. They do not want the wrong person pleading guilty or
being found guilty, and they certainly do not want the guilty walking
the streets. Legal representation for defendants is crucial in
minimising miscarriages of justice. These proposals introduce perverse
incentives that could unbalance the criminal justice system, with
representatives being paid the same whether someone pleads guilty or
stands

media to further his own political aims. That is all a tough veneer
that masks the real impact of his proposals. Local providers, often
high street firms that know their local authorities, courts, police and
probation, will be replaced by big corporations, maybe even the same
ones that run prisons, probation and tagging—conflicts of
interest at every turn. Strangely for a party that claims to be
pro-enterprise and pro the high street, this will sweep away hundreds
of small and medium-sized enterprises. High street firms will go under,

Why else propose to pay the same fee regardless of whether there is a
guilty or not guilty plea? It is as if Ministers do not know the
substantial difference in work load between the two pleas. In an era
when so much in the public sector is about choice, the opposite will
happen in legal aid. People will get what they are given, whether it is
rubbish or good. The state will prosecute people and decide who defends
them. The Justice Secretary would not accept a special
adviser—also paid for by the taxpayer —or the external
legal advice relied on by his Department, to be imposed on him. Nor
would he accept where his children go to school being decided

to ask important questions. They have a right to ask why the taxpayer
should be paying the legal costs of the very wealthiest Crown court
defendants up front; why the taxpayer should be paying for criminal
legal aid for claims made by prisoners that can be better resolved by
other means—I will return in a moment to prisoner law—

the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) made that point
very effectively. We have an extremely good legal system—it is
greatly admired and, as others have said, it contributes significantly
to our society—but that does not mean that it should be immune

the best way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:08:00"></hs_TimeCode> to
ensure long-term sustainability and value for money in the legal aid

Member for Tooting (Sadiq

the criminal defence service is highly fragmented, with a large number

Liberal democracies cannot afford to get themselves into a position in
which they wield power over a citizen without giving them a right to

rights without giving them the means to secure them. I hope that the

am grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for giving the House
the opportunity to debate the important issue of corporation tax and
the avoidance of tax by multinational corporations. I was keen to see
this debate take place, not only because of the gravity of the issue
but because of the efforts that two local retailers, Frances and Keith
Smith of Warwick and Kenilworth Books, have taken to raise the profile
of the matter. They have launched a petition, which has gathered
170,000 signatures, calling on Amazon UK to pay UK corporation tax, and
I would like to pay tribute to their public spiritedness and
determination in pursuit of this cause. Individuals can make a

issue that I would like to put at the heart of the debate is tax
avoidance, rather than tax evasion, which is illegal. I think all
Members would strongly condemn any kind of tax evasion. However, tax
avoidance, sometimes euphemistically called “tax
planning”, is also a matter of serious concern. The case that
Frances and Keith have raised illustrates the problem. Amazon made
£4.3 billion in sales in the UK last year, but its
subsidiary Amazon UK paid only £2.4 million in corporate taxes.
It does this by classifying itself as a service provider to its
Luxembourg business Amazon EU Sarl in order to reduce its tax bill, yet
its UK business employs over 4,200 people, compared with the 380 based
in Luxembourg. Given the size of the UK market, it is laughable to
believe that Amazon UK is somehow serving the Luxembourg portion of the
business, but this is perfectly legal and Amazon UK is not an isolated
case.</hs_Para>

avoidance is not without its victims. It is businesses such as Warwick
Books in my constituency and ordinary people who pick up the bill.
Through this creative tax planning, the burden of taxation is shifted
on to individuals and businesses that do not have the resources to
spend on reducing their tax bill and on hiring expensive accountants to
find loopholes in tax law.</hs_Para>

that there are some who believe that businesses have a moral duty to
pay only the absolute minimum of tax that they are legally obliged to

multinational companies, are still members of society. They benefit
from a strong education system, a functioning 
<?notus-xml column=567?>health care system, decent roads, a transport infrastructure, the police
and our armed forces. The reason we raise taxes is in order to produce
public goods. We can argue whether the Government spend that money

taxation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000936" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761000936">Businesses
have a moral responsibility to play a full part in our society, and
structuring their businesses in order to avoid taxation and to make it
harder for tax authorities to monitor their business is not fulfilling
that responsibility. Voluntarily paying tax is not a long-term solution

invest in our country, but multinational companies still need to play
their part. The endless game of cat and mouse, with tax authorities

of these companies depend on individuals and businesses buying their
services, but as they avoid taxation, the Government have to find this
revenue from other sources, reducing the profits and incomes of others
and leaving them with less to spend on other goods and services. The
regulatory arms race between multinational companies and states seeking
to raise revenue is also distracting. It is distracting the
corporations from focusing on productivity and creativity, and one

sheer mechanics of the situation make it clear that action purely from

hundreds of thousands of multinational companies, and only a handful of

may help, they will not reach the nub of the problem. That is why I
believe that we need to focus on the culture in international business,
on the structure of these businesses and the codes of conduct they
abide by. Fundamentally, businesses are staffed by people, and if we
put in place the right frameworks, I believe that we can appeal to the

vexed question of multinational companies and their failure to pay a

powerful chord with the British public. If we take the Amazon example,

it paid only £2.4 million in corporation tax, and then took
£2.5 million in grants from the UK Government. That is simply

because this is too important a market for it not to do so. I also draw
the Minister’s attention to the fact that feelings are so strong
on this issue that we should not, in an attempt to keep multinational
corporations here, allow them to blackmail us. Such corporations will
stay because of the market: they come here because we are outside the

am concerned about whether utility companies are paying the appropriate
amount of tax. I have done a study of nine water companies, which,
collectively, have 
<?notus-xml column=570?>a turnover of £28 billion and operating profits of
£10 billion a year, yet they paid just £541
million in tax, an effective tax rate of 5%, which goes down to about

have looked at two electricity companies, EDF and RWE npower, which
have a collective total turnover of £25.6 billion and operating
profits of £1.7 billion, yet they paid no tax whatever. It
cannot all be explained by capital allowances. Foreign-owned utilities,
particularly in the water industry, have been engaging in schemes using
debt interest to avoid tax, which, on my calculations, have resulted in
a loss to the Exchequer of about £1 billion over the
last three years.</hs_Para>

a net tax charge of £45.9 million. That is an effective tax rate
of 6%. Yorkshire Water, over the last three years, generated
£2.6 billion in turnover, operating profits of £990
million, and yet received a net tax credit of £46.2 million.
Anglian Water, over the last three available years, generated

am calling on the regulators to examine the position and to say that if
the water companies, in particular, are receiving too high a return in
total, they should either be subject to a windfall tax or reduce
customers’ bills. Tax-avoiding water companies, and other
utility companies, should be made to give a rebate to hard-pressed
customers who have faced increased bills in recent years. I hope that
Ministers will consider the options available to them. In any event,
tax law should be changed so that interest is no longer favoured over
equity. Specifically, interest payments from one group company to
another should not be tax-deductible.</hs_Para>

it is only a little over 12 months since the issue finally gained

that the reasons for that are clear: it has happened because since the
banking crash and the recession Treasury coffers are bare,
because of the sheer cumulative scale of the avoidance, because of the
sheer size of the deposits held by United States multinationals

in <I>The Sunday Times</I> about Facebook entitled “The
Anti-Social Network”. He tracked the way in which the social
website had deliberately organised the avoidance of millions in tax,
routeing revenues through Dublin à la Google. A series of
exposés followed on different companies—“the

pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761000970" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761000970">The

once worked as a journalist. Following his investigation of Starbucks,
Tom Bergin revealed that rather than reducing sales booked in the

apparently made. Two campaigners have also been at the forefront of
these investigations: Richard Brooks, a former tax inspector, and
Richard Murphy, an accountant and founder of the Tax Justice Network. I
urge the people at HMRC to read their recent books closely, as I
entirely agree with the PAC report of last year that criticised the

not apply its own rules, so I urge it to start getting tough and the
OECD to start driving home the simple principle that if a company sells
in a country, it must account for that there and owe taxes there. Until
then everyone will be climbing on the bandwagon—or should I say

bring the company into the city, while a £3 million

that if we could get on top of the issue—not of tax evasion,
when people illegally do not pay their taxes, but of tax
avoidance—many of our other debates in this House about the

decades we have reached a situation in which we do not collect the
taxes we need to pay for the services we want to provide in the

is interesting that in this Back-Bench debate we have heard people from
different political parties speaking with one voice. One of the
problems in the debate is that for a long time the leaderships of the
parties have not had the political courage to take on the
multinationals. If we reflect on the speeches we have heard today and
read <I>Hansard </I>tomorrow, we will see that it is notable that these
companies are household names. They are not the kinds of companies that
would move out of Britain. To suggest that Starbucks, Amazon, Vodafone,
npower, Google or HSBC will pack up their bags, move away and stop
making profits out of our constituents is ludicrous. The reality is not
that progress will be made only by the companies themselves. Yes, we
need to change the culture in companies. Yes, we need to name and
shame. But as politicians we have to change the rules of the debate.

welcomed and has to be acknowledged in the tax

There are those who believe that the problem is just too difficult, too

the UK to push for an internationally agreed system of

this issue has received much greater scrutiny in recent months. The

at the outset, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) was right to say,
that there can be occasions where it is entirely legitimate for a
company not to be paying corporation tax if it is making use of reliefs
or capital allowances in the way that Parliament intended. It is also
the case—there can be confusion about this—that
corporation tax is a tax on profits, not a tax on sales. It is also
worth remembering that we do collect significant sums of corporation
tax from large businesses. But where the public’s concerns are
justified, where there is avoidance, by which I mean contrived and
artificial behaviour contrary to Parliament’s intention, that is
a very serious matter and it is right that we take
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T16:55:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001006">There
is an issue of administration. The point has been raised about
HMRC’s effectiveness in dealing with tax avoidance by large
businesses. I should explain that HMRC works, with regard to large
businesses, by putting in place CRMs—customer relationship
managers. Their role is essentially to man-mark the most complex and
high-risk taxpayers. In recent years that approach has proved to be
effective in getting money in. HMRC secured £8 billion of
additional compliance yield from large businesses in 2012-13, and more
than £23 billion in the past three years. It is an approach that
has been endorsed by the OECD. One of the difficulties that HMRC has is
that it is bound by taxpayer confidentiality. It cannot give a running
commentary to this House on the action that it takes, but the numbers
demonstrate that HMRC is effective in getting money

am often intrigued by the way we honour our armed forces and our
soldiers, who do a fantastic job. The Royal Anglian Regiment is based
as Chicksands. I will always remember a story I was told—I think
the Minister was with me at the time—when the Royal Anglians
came back from Iraq and presented to us on the work they had undertaken
there. Some of the soldiers who were there that day are now living in
Bedfordshire and serving as reservists. They were telling us about the
respect the public show them when they come back from a tour of duty.
They had just come back from Washington DC, where they had been making
a similar presentation. They had stopped at an American diner to eat.
When the soldier—the one who presented to us that
day—went up to pay for the meal, the young girl at the checkout
said, “You don’t need to pay, Sir. Your meal has already
been paid for.” When he asked who had paid for it, she nodded to
the window. Reversing out of a lorry bay was a lorry driver. She
explained to our soldiers that the driver had just wanted to say thank
you for the sacrifice they make on their behalf. I was incredibly
touched by that story, particularly as I was told it by soldiers in our
own regiment in
Bedfordshire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:03:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001023">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:04:35"></hs_TimeCode>

know that the military go a huge way towards providing for reservists
all the assistance and benefits that regular soldiers in the Army

full-time employment, they discovered that they had lost their holiday

wording of the legislation needs to be tightened and secured to provide
reservists with much greater protections than they have now. He will

think that there were no loopholes that employers could use, but I am
afraid that they are doing that, and that is what we need to protect
against.</hs_Para>

that without being inconvenienced in any great way. That provision
enables the reservist to go and fight for his country. Surely the

I congratulate
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:12:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Mid Bedfordshire (Nadine Dorries) on securing this
debate on the terms of employment for reserve service personnel. It is
timely in two respects. First, it relates to the White Paper that we
will publish shortly. Secondly, we are in the run-up to Armed Forces
day 2013 this Saturday, when the country will rightly pay tribute to
our personnel, regular and reserve, the families who support them and
our

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:13:48"></hs_TimeCode> would like to
make some general points about our reserve forces before addressing at
least some of the issues that she raised in relation to her

I go any further, I should declare an interest or, given the
circumstances, confirm one. I served in the Territorial Army as an
infantry officer in the 1980s. I was a Royal Anglian—a regiment
that proudly recruits from Bedfordshire as well as from my county of
Essex. It is therefore quite possible that some of her constituents
serve in its ranks. I served in the cold war, when we planned, in
essence, for world war three. Fortunately, that nightmare never came to
pass, so I was never mobilised for operations, I was never shot at with
live ammunition, other than in training, and I bear no medals. However,
I still proudly carry the Queen’s commission, which hangs on my
wall at home. I have worn the uniform and I understand the
ethos.</hs_Para>

truth, however, the role of the reserves has changed markedly since I
served among them. Since 2003, there have been more than 25,000
reservist mobilisations for operations to fight alongside their regular
counterparts, and 30 have paid the ultimate price for their country. I
take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous contribution our
reserves make to the defence and security of our nation, echoing the
exact sentiments of my hon. Friend. Reserves have always played
an essential role in our armed forces, and their dedication,
professionalism and contribution have been vital to achieving
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:15:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001037">My
hon. Friend will be familiar with the background to our new policy for
reserves. The 2010 strategic defence and security review described the
role of the reserve forces as part of our future, highly capable armed
forces. As an integral part of this future force, we are growing the
reserves to provide additional capacity, as well providing certain
specialists—for example, medical personnel or cyber
experts—whom it would not be practical or cost-effective to
maintain as part of our regular capability. Seeing the very close
relationship between my hon. Friend and her BlackBerry, she is indeed a
cyber
expert<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:15:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001038">The
changes we are making are substantial. They are about delivering
defence differently from in the past. We are taking an approach that
envisages military capability being delivered through a whole force
comprising regulars, reservists, contractors and civil servants. This
is already happening in Afghanistan today. For example, the Army is
reorganising into an integrated force of 112,000 trained regulars and
reservists that is able to meet the security challenges of the future.
This construct, mirrored by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force,
allows us better to harness the talent the country has to offer. This
approach will deliver the Ministry of Defence’s contribution to
national security in a cost-effective way that makes the best use of
the resources available.</hs_Para>

need to develop the reserve component of the force. The 2011
independent commission on the reserve forces found at that time that
the reserves were in decline, particularly in the Army, and needed to
be brought up to date to meet the challenges of the new security
environment. The key recommendations of the independent
commission’s report were to stabilise the reserve numbers and
increase the trained reserve strength; to provide the reserve forces
with better and defined roles; to offer the right mix of interesting
and challenging activities, with appropriate recognition and reward to
attract and retain individuals in the reserve forces; to provide
greater ease of mobilisation, better employee protection and greater
recognition of employers; and to increase investment in the reserve
forces<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:17:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001040">In
responding to the report last July, my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for Defence announced a £1.8 billion investment
programme in the reserves over the next 10 years. That is significant.
There have been reviews of the reserves in the recent past that have
led to comparatively little change. This review is different: it will
deliver. It is supported by additional funding, by the requirement to
deliver that is created by dependence of the Future Force on the
reserves, and by the will, throughout Defence, to ensure that it
succeeds. The commitment to deliver was reinforced by the publication
in November last year of the Green Paper, “Future Reserves 2020:
Delivering the Nation’s Security Together”. 
<?notus-xml column=583?>This set out our proposals to enable Defence to build and sustain over
time the changes recommended in the independent commission’s
report, and to ensure that we are able to deliver a reserve force that
will meet the needs of the future whole force

the publication of the Green Paper, we launched a consultation
exercise, which has proved invaluable. We received more than 2,500
responses from reservists, employers, employer organisations,
regulars and members of the public. In addition, some 50
consultation events were held with employers, reservists and their
families. These responses were generally supportive of our proposals
for the future of the reserves, and recognised that the future
proposition requires the development of new relationships between
Defence and reservists—and their families and
employers—that will be crucial to achieving our goals. As

is<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> also very
important? There is an old saying in the Army, “Recruit the
soldier, retain the family.” We need to ensure that families are
supportive of our reservists, too. In order to retain the support of
families, we need to get greater support from employers and, indeed,
from society as a whole. They also serve who sit at home and
wait.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001042"><B><Member ContinuationText="Nadine Dorries" PimsId="4768" UID="13062761001695" xid="802" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001695">Nadine
Dorries:</Member></B> The Minister makes a fantastic point. It is the
families who suffer when employers take away the holiday entitlement
from reservists when they return. The children suffer as they do not
get to spend time with their father or mother when they return from
this very stressful situation. The stress factor is involved here,
because when someone is returning from a tour of duty, they need that
time off and that down time with their families to re-stabilise
themselves—to step away from where they have been and back into
the real world. So removing their holiday entitlement has another
effect, as it prevents that process from taking
place<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

</B><B>Francois</B><B>:</B></Member> My hon. Friend makes a very
pertinent point. Holiday is important to the families as well as to the
servicemen themselves. Of course, it is important to the
children, where that is applicable. The ability to have leave,
particularly when returning from operations, is very important. We
understand that in the Ministry of Defence, and I hope, at least in
general terms, to address that point as it relates to her constituent
in a moment or
two<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:21:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001044">Given
all the things I have been talking about, we have done considerable
work with employers, and much of the consultation focused on them. We
recognise that reserve service will affect different employers in
different ways, according to their size and sector. We seek to develop
relationships that are tailored to reflect that— relationships
that are open, practicable and based on mutual benefit. I have had
productive discussions with the British Chambers of Commerce, the
Business Services Association, the CBI, the Federation of Small
Businesses and the Institute of Directors to try to ensure that we
achieve that. I hope that the fruits of some of those discussions will
be reflected shortly in the White
Paper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T17:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062761001045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/debtext/130627-0004.htm#13062761001045">Given
all that, I was concerned to hear about the case of my hon.
Friend’s constituent, and I shall explain the MOD’s
policy as I believe it would apply in a case such as this. I understand
that her constituent was mobilised 
<?notus-xml column=584?>into service as part of the deployment for Operation Olympics. I, too,
pay tribute to all those service personnel, both regular and reserve,
who, in many cases at very short notice, were mobilised to ensure the
security of those wonderfully successful games. At the end of that
service, a reservist would be entitled to a period of paid leave. For
each month that they are mobilised they get about two or just over two
days’ paid leave. In this particular case, her constituent might
have been entitled to about eight days’ paid leave from the
Ministry of Defence in view of having been mobilised for several
months—it was both before and after the games. So the normal
procedure would be for the leave to be taken at the end of the
operation—in effect, it would be post-operation tour leave, to
be paid for by the MOD.</hs_Para>

without being familiar with all the detail, it sounds like my hon.
Friend’s constituent took that post-operation tour leave of
about eight days, and the employer then decided in effect to
“net that off” and take it off her constituent’s
leave from the company. It might be that the employer went slightly
beyond that—we would need to know more details—but the
reservist would still have had broadly the same amount of leave. One
could take the view, however, that perhaps the employer should have
been more generous, given the service that had been rendered, and
should not have “netted off” the additional holiday. As I
understand it, nothing in current legislation prevents the employer
from doing that, but one could take the view that the employer should
have been slightly more generous.</hs_Para>

that issue, we need to re-set the relationships between reservists, and
employers and society as a whole, and we aim to do that via the White
Paper. Greater reliance on reserves is more cost-effective for the
nation, but requires a greater willingness by society to support and
encourage reserve service. Our reservists make a contribution to
society over and above most others. We recognise and value this and we
must offer them attractive challenges, fair rewards and incentives, and
we must undertake to provide them and their families with appropriate
support, recognising the contribution they

Committee was re-formed after the last general election, we have
concentrated on trying our best to move towards a rebalancing of the
Northern Ireland economy. We know that Northern Ireland has become
somewhat over-dependent on the public sector, and we are well aware of
the reasons why. There is a large deficit in the amount of Government
spending in Northern Ireland relative to the amount of tax raised
there. The same is true in Scotland and Wales, of course, but it is
more pronounced in Northern Ireland. Wages are also lower in Northern
Ireland, and there is great concern about people who perhaps do not
feel that they have had the full benefits of the peace process. We as a
Committee have considered security issues from time to time, of course,
and we will do so again, but we are doing our best to encourage and
work with the Government and make proposals about how we might
rebalance the economy in Northern Ireland. It is obviously worth doing
for its own sake, so that people in the Province can enjoy greater
prosperity, but we also see it as a way to cement the relative peace
achieved over the past 15 years or
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000011">Our
first inquiry after the last general election was on the level of
corporation tax. We recommended that the issue be devolved to the
Northern Ireland Assembly so that it could set a rate that would be
more competitive 
<?notus-xml column=146?>with the current tax rate in the Republic of Ireland. Corporation tax in
the UK is 23%, but only 12.5% in the Republic. Although the Committee
was certainly not unanimous on that proposal, we felt that it would
help the economy in Northern Ireland move towards where we want it to
be. We are debating aviation policy, not corporation tax, but I will
talk about tax a little
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000012">I
must stress the importance of air travel to Northern Ireland. It is an
island off an island—a beautiful place, but nevertheless
slightly remote. The only way that people there can travel reasonably
quickly and efficiently either to the mainland or to the continent is
by air. The sea crossing is lovely, but it is quite slow.

via the only real way other than flying, and to tell us all how long it
takes, how much it costs and how it could possibly help improve
business connectivity for that to be the only way by which a person can

the Minister gets there, he will see that the rail links in Northern
Ireland are not what we might want either, particularly between City of
Derry airport and Belfast. I will come to that issue in a minute. It is
a long and sometimes difficult journey. Northern Ireland Members
sometimes have to leave Parliament early in the day—not in the
morning, of course, but not too late in the afternoon—if they
want to get back that evening, which may explain why they are sometimes
unable to take part in debates such as
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000016">The
background is that we have three airports in Northern Ireland: Belfast
International, sometimes known as Aldergrove; Belfast City, nowadays
named George Best Belfast City airport after the great footballer; and,
of course, City of Derry airport. Belfast International airport has
about 4 million passengers a year, Belfast City airport 2.4 million and
City of Derry 400,000. When we compare that with Dublin,
which has 90 million passengers a year, we see a big difference between
the two, but Belfast International airport is busy and fulfils a
completely different role from Belfast City airport. Both are
important. City of Derry airport could probably be used more,
especially this year, when Londonderry is the city of
culture.</hs_Para>

connectivity, it is extremely important that we retain capacity in the
south-east of England, because many people fly from Belfast to London
and then on to other cities in the world. There is some concern about
the speed with which we are moving in 
<?notus-xml column=147?>that direction. The Committee expressed frustration about how long it is
taking for the Government to decide whether we are to have, for
example, a further runway at Heathrow, Boris island or something else.
It is of some concern to the Committee that the Government seem to have
ruled out a third runway at Heathrow before commissioning the Davies

Government’s policy, in the manifestos of both the Conservative

Robertson:</Member></B> That is extremely helpful, given that we have
less than two years to go in this Parliament before the third runway is
a possibility. I cannot speak for the Committee on that—we did
not express a view whether there should be a third runway at
Heathrow—but we did say that we are concerned about how long it
is taking. The Government’s response to our report said,
reasonably, that they do not want to rush matters; they want to
consider the issue in depth and detail, and to get it right. I fully
understand that, but we feel that we are losing out to Dublin, Paris
and Schiphol due to  the delay.</hs_Para>

important to Northern Ireland that we secure the routes from Belfast to
London airports. A while ago, British Airways—or the
International Airlines Group, to be more correct—took over BMI,
and there was some concern about whether the route would be
discontinued. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:39:20"></hs_TimeCode>
interviewed Willie Walsh of International Airlines Group, who was
helpful to the Committee and stressed the importance of that route to
British Airways. We are concerned that the long-haul routes appear to
be more profitable for some airline companies. He said that BA was not
in a position, necessarily, to buy an awful lot more planes that could
fly long-haul, so the route from Belfast was valuable to it. That is a
slightly negative way of getting to the position that we wanted to get
to, and we must stress the particular importance to the people in
Northern Ireland, and to its economy, of the routes from Belfast to
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:40:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000021">Recently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>,
we had a bit of a scare when Flybe announced that it was ending flights
from Belfast City airport to Gatwick, although it ended a number of
flights to Gatwick, not just from Belfast. The good news is that
EasyJet has taken over and assures us that that route is important for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:40:40"></hs_TimeCode>. All these

to the issues I have mentioned are the slots, particularly at Heathrow,
which is under such enormous pressure. We want to move the situation on
as quickly as we can. We discussed the possibility of ring-fencing
certain slots, particularly at Heathrow, but as the Government
correctly responded, it is difficult to do that under EU law and tends
to distort competition and the free market. As an avowed
free-marketeer, I have  
<?notus-xml column=148?>some difficulty with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>. The slots
are probably best secured by creating extra capacity in the south-east,

now return to tax: air passenger duty. A while ago it became obvious to
the Committee that Continental Airlines, now operating under United
Airlines—the only company flying from Belfast directly to Newark
in the United States—was seriously considering ending its only
flight, because of the high level of long-haul air passenger duty. We
have since had discussions with that airline in the United States. It
was a close-run thing. It was seriously considering ending that flight,
because it did not feel that it could pass on the air passenger duty to
the customers, owing to the proximity of Dublin. Four people travelling
from Belfast to Newark would pay £260 in tax, whereas from
Dublin I think the charge is €3 each, and there was talk of
abolishing that. Because of the possibility of a short journey
elsewhere, Belfast was in danger of losing
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:42:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000024">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>

passenger duty was reduced to that for short-haul flights, and the
Government have since devolved decisions on air passenger duty to the
Assembly, so it can decide how it wants to play it. That reduction
saved that route. I pay tribute in particular to the Select Committee
members from Northern Ireland, who put pressure on me as Chairman,
allowing me to put pressure on the Government. We saved that route, but
it was a close-run thing that demonstrates how important—how big

Hoey</B> (Vauxhall) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to see you in the
Chair, Mr Amess<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:46:57"></hs_TimeCode>,
and I am pleased to be able to say a few words. My colleague from the
Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:47:02"></hs_TimeCode>, the
hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi Long), wants to make a
contribution,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I thank our
Chairman, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), for putting the case so well
and mentioning why our Committee felt that this is an important issue:
the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,
which are crucial, and particularly air passenger
duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:47:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000034">We
need to thank the Government for listening to the Northern Ireland
Affairs Committee and to the lobbying—all legitimate lobbying, I
will add—that went on for a long time and getting the air
passenger duty changed on the international flight from Belfast to
Newark. That was crucial, because there was no doubt that people were
travelling by car down to Dublin, even though it made the journey
slightly longer, as it worked out cheaper due to the reduction there.
The Irish Government make an issue of making it much cheaper to fly
internationally, particularly to
America<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:48:09"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
important. I hope that we have made that link with United Airlines
permanent and that we see it increase. We now need a direct flight from
Belfast to Canada, where there is a huge diaspora of people from
Northern Ireland. That would be
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:48:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000035">In
addition to what was always an important issue, we raised the other
pressing, day-to-day issue in our recommendation 7 on tax policy. Air
passenger duty throughout the United Kingdom is far too high. It is the
highest in Europe. Some people argue that it is good, from a green
point of view, and others argue that it is needed because the
Government need the money. A cost-benefit analysis has not been
properly done to show how much the United Kingdom would benefit
economically if we reduced and, in some parts of the UK, abolished air
passenger duty
altogether<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000036">Northern
Ireland is a special case, just as the highlands and islands have
become a special case, but whenever we ask why the highlands and
islands get a reduction on their flights but Northern Ireland cannot,
we come up against something about which I have made my views known
clearly over time: the European Union and 
<?notus-xml column=150?>regulations, which make doing something about that
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:49:52"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>
Well, given how the EU works at the moment, that certainly will not be
easy to do, but if we had a Government who committed to arguing for it,
it might
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000037">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>
feel strongly that travelling by plane from Northern Ireland to London,
Manchester, Scotland or anywhere else on the mainland of Great Britain
is not a luxury. People do not wake up and think, “Great, I am
going to be flying from Belfast to London tomorrow. Isn’t that
wonderful? I don’t mind paying APD, because it is such a nice
way to travel.” The reality is that flying is the only way
people can realistically travel, particularly to southern England.
Flying is now very expensive for students who want to come back home
between studying, and the cost to business people is very big. A
growing phenomenon in the current economic situation is that more and
more people—mainly young men but women, too—are flying
over on a Monday morning, working in the building industry near
Stansted and flying back on the Thursday night or Friday, and APD is a
big addition to the
cost.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000038">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:51:15"></hs_TimeCode>
should be arguing that Northern Ireland is a special case because it is
different. We are part of the United Kingdom, but we have water around
us, and we therefore need to be treated differently. There is an idea
that we cannot do something about APD for Northern Ireland. The
Government’s response
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13062763000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000152">“APD

do not want to go further than to say that, in the long run, we would
end up with more money if APD were reduced, but, obviously, if we were
to treat Northern Ireland differently, APD would have to be devolved.
In that case, the Northern Ireland Executive would have to make up the
money to fund the reduction, but the people of Northern Ireland could
debate whether they feel that that is a priority. I think that there
would be support for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000040">The

am sorry, but I am a British citizen. I am part of the United Kingdom,

the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) on the Front
Bench does not necessarily agree, but I do not want the EU to decide
policies that should be for us to decide. That is why I support the
need for a referendum, the need for a debate in the country and the
need for us to decide our future relationship with the EU. I will not

do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000042">It
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:53:23"></hs_TimeCode> just not good
enough for us to say that we cannot allow Northern Ireland to be
treated differently and specially because of the peculiar nature of its
situation, not only because it has a land border with another country,
but because of the water that lies between us. It is not good enough
just to say, “We cannot do this because the EU will not let
us.” I believe we should reconsider, and I support the “A
Fair Tax on Flying” campaign, which in some very good reports
has shown 
<?notus-xml column=151?>how we are losing out across the United Kingdom because of the APD tax.

are now no direct flights to Heathrow from Belfast International, which
is an important airport. They have stopped because of the merger of
British Airways and BMI, and Aer Lingus then going to Belfast City
airport. There is a bit of one airport playing off the other by
lowering the amount of money that it charges for a short time, and
after a year or two, the other airport seems to offer something more
and the airlines go back. We need to ensure that both airports, while
they are there, serve the needs of everyone in Northern

want to speak up for easyJet, which has brought an amazing amount of
opportunity for people in Northern Ireland. I fly easyJet all the time,
more or less. I think easyJet is a great airline. For short flights
from Belfast, easyJet is absolutely brilliant and usually on time. I am
not being paid by easyJet; I really do think that. I get cross when
people dismiss easyJet as one of those cheap airlines, because it has
brought huge opportunities for people to travel not just from Belfast
to the rest of the United Kingdom but all over Europe. The more that
that happens, the more that we will see people going from Belfast to
Amsterdam and then to America. That will not happen unless we grasp the

recognise and welcome the Government’s analysis of the
contribution and benefits of aviation to the UK economy. That is
especially true in Northern Ireland, particularly in my constituency of
Belfast East, where aerospace companies such as Bombardier and Thales

contributes to the rebalancing of the economy, which

tourism industry, both inbound and outbound, relies heavily on
aviation, as would be expected for an island economy. Due to the
relatively small number of direct flights to other international
destinations, our connectivity to other parts of the UK is crucial if
we are to ensure our connectivity with international destinations. Such
connectivity contributes heavily to UK economic activity, and
passengers who pay APD on both parts of their journey are particularly
affected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000053">APD<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:59:28"></hs_TimeCode>
has a detrimental effect on the continued development of a thriving
tourism sector in Northern Ireland by placing a cost burden on
business, not least because of our unique position of having a land
border with another EU state, placing us in direct competition with a
much lower-tax economy. We have to be cognisant of that when we make
decisions, and I will elaborate on that
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:58:49"></hs_TimeCode>later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000054">I
will start by addressing connectivity to and through the UK hub
airports, and I will then reflect on what the Committee says about
connectivity to the airports within Northern Ireland. Airports are
recognised as devolved but there may be things that the UK Government
can do to encourage more work on connectivity within Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T13:59:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000055">The
UK is one of the best-connected countries in the world, and the
Government are right to state that the broader the range of
destinations served and the higher the frequency of flights to and from
those destinations, the better connected we will be. That is
particularly crucial in the context of Northern Ireland. It is vital
for us to get access to the south-east of England and, through the main
hub airports, to the rest of the world. On connectivity to the
south-east, the overall gross value added of Northern Ireland is only
about 80% of the UK average. Successive Governments have nominally
committed to a policy of regional convergence, but London and the
south-east are still regarded—I argue, protected—as the
main drivers of the UK economy.
Only<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:00:01"></hs_TimeCode> three UK
regions are net contributors to the Treasury, and Northern Ireland is
the most dependent of the remaining
nine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000056">Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:09:46"></hs_TimeCode>,
an active regional policy by Government is necessary to promote a more
even distribution of economic activity throughout the UK. In the
interim, it is imperative to ensure that the regions have good access
to London and the south-east to assist with economic competitiveness.
Northern Ireland’s unique position means that aviation is
essential to that connectivity. There are no other appropriate means of
transport to access mainland UK or other onward destinations quickly
and easily for business
purposes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:00:29"></hs_TimeCode>. On
onward connectivity, as we rebalance 
<?notus-xml column=153?>the Northern Ireland economy, it is vital that we encourage and support
indigenous businesses to expand their exports, attract new foreign
direct investment and so on. Ease of travel and the frequency and cost
of flights are always factors in our ability to maximise potential.
Direct access to the main hub airports in the south-east is
vital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000057">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>
concur with the Chair when he said that the Committee was concerned
about delays to do with the Heathrow issue, and I will elaborate on
that. Demand for landing slots for international flights is placing
pressure on national connections, which worries us, as one of the most
affected
regions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:01:13"></hs_TimeCode>. If
Glasgow loses its landing slot, people at least have the option to step
on a train, but if Belfast loses its landing slot, we are talking about
a three-day hike, so the issue of our connectivity is much more
serious<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:01:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Future
proposals need to be evaluated not in isolation, but in terms of the
economic impact in Northern Ireland and other remote regions of the UK,
because equitable access to London is crucial. The lack of a decision
on an additional runway at Heathrow or of a new hub airport—I am
fairly indifferent to which option is pursued—has an impact on
landing slots, which is important for Northern Ireland passengers in
two
ways<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:01:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000058">First,
the focus of the airports on through passengers is intensifying,
because of constrained capacity, and both Heathrow and Gatwick now levy
charges on passengers who arrive in those airports as their final
destination from other UK airports, which adds to the cost of travel.
Such charges might be relatively small at the point of introduction,
but they will have an effect, because, as the pressure increases, the
charges will increase. Furthermore, we often find that charges will
increase as people’s tolerance of them increases. The charge is
applied to transit passengers, but Northern Ireland has few through
carriers, so most people arrive there as a destination, then have to
change flights completely—they are not technically transit
passengers, so they end up having to pay the
charge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000059">Secondly,
as others have mentioned, the flight connections between Belfast and
London, and their frequency, are placed at risk as the pressure for
landing slots—at Heathrow in particular—grows; they are
at risk of being replaced by more lucrative long-haul routes. The Chair
of the Select Committee has already reflected on the evidence given by
Willie Walsh of IAG, but his twin reasons for the continued need for
regional flights were to feed the passenger capacity of onward
internationals and because of a lack of a fleet of international jets
ready to take on the extra slots. That was not an option therefore,
certainly in the short term. The reality is that the frequency with
which the airline would want to fly between Belfast and London would be

important as capacity for flights between London and Belfast, so that

that the need for resolution is of acute importance to Northern Ireland

I have read the Government response to our first recommendation, and I
understand the need for an evidence base and the reference to the
Airports Commission, but the response goes on to mention that any
decision will be “highly contentious” and that the
decisions have been under discussion since the early 1990s. I suspect
that the contentious nature of the decisions has had more impact on the
time frame than the lack of an evidence base. Most people in Northern
Ireland feel that that has been more the guiding factor, rather than
the difficulty of the decisions to do with the
airport.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000062">Connectivity
to airports within Northern Ireland is also important. Those are
largely devolved issues, which was reflected in the Government response
to the report, but that context is important. We are pleased to see
commitment to creating lower-carbon methods of reaching airports in
Great Britain, which we hope will be encouraged in the devolved
Administrations. The Northern Ireland Administration do not have a
climate change action plan, unlike the rest of the UK: Scotland has its
own plans, and England and Wales are covered by what happens in
Westminster. Northern Ireland sits outside those arrangements, and some
impetus to drive something through the Assembly would be
good<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:06:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000063">Northern
Ireland will obviously not benefit directly from high-speed rail. In
case the Minister does not already know, I voted in favour of
high-speed rail, which I hope will make him slightly more sympathetic
to my other points. Investment in public transport is good and wise
investment, and I say that as someone who comes from an engineering
background. High-speed rail will not directly benefit us, but in
Northern Ireland, by contrast, all our airports are within one mile of
an existing rail line, and yet none has a direct connection to that
railway. Someone arriving at Belfast City airport terminal can see the
railway, but cannot reach it directly; people have to leave the airport
site and walk across a dual-carriageway bridge and through some streets
to get there. Relatively modest investment by the Northern Ireland
Executive, therefore, could enable connectivity between the rail
network in Northern Ireland, limited though it is, and air travel. We
want to see the Government and the Department for Regional Development
in Northern Ireland work on developing such access to identify funding
and other
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000064">The
lack of ease of access to Belfast International airport in particular
remains a problem, and one that has received attention as a result of
the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee’s aviation inquiry. The
road network serving the airport fails to meet the needs of Northern
Ireland in pursuing inbound tourism and international investment as key
drivers. We need to have an adequate and well-maintained road
infrastructure to have onward 
<?notus-xml column=155?>connectivity within Northern Ireland and with the rest of the island,
which is our main economic partner in terms of exports and other
things. Improved infrastructure could attract more customers and
international carriers to the International airport, improving our
connectivity with the rest of the world.

Belfast and after leaving the M2 motorway, one must proceed along seven
miles of two-lane single carriageway, passing through a small town to
reach the airport. The road is relatively straight and safe, but high
traffic volumes during peak periods result in delays and an increased
chance of accidents. No proposals or meaningful discussions have been
forthcoming about upgrading the road. In our discussions with the

examined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000065">First

next want to touch on air passenger duty, because we cannot discuss
aviation strategy without looking at APD, which has a disproportionate
effect on Northern Ireland passengers. The Committee spent considerable
time discussing the issue, and some changes have happened, in respect
of the International airport in particular, on the back of one of our
previous reports. People frequently gave us evidence about the impact
of APD. If we are to rebalance Northern Ireland’s economy, it
will primarily be not by cutting the public sector, but by growing the
private sector. In my view and that of a growing number of people, the
APD regime is a significant obstacle to that. It is a commercial
challenge to Northern Ireland businesses and conflicts directly with
the positive measures that are being taken to boost tourism and related
employment to encourage foreign direct investment and so on. It adds to
the cost of indigenous businesses, particularly those seeking to grow
their export
markets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000067">The
Committee received evidence from a large fish processor in Northern
Ireland who exports to the far east, and finds APD a huge burden on his
business. Being able to take his product to international markets and
build relationships with those markets and clients is crucial for him
in growing his export base. But in his evidence, Mr Rooney said that
APD effectively consumes part of the budget he sets aside for travel,
so the number of his mission journeys is limited by APD. If it did not
exist, or were lower, he could travel more frequently to sell his
products. He is very successful at getting them into the market when he
has made those
connections.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000068">At
best, APD adds to the cost base and, at worst, it could jeopardise
connectivity between Northern Ireland and other UK and international
markets, impeding our efforts. The levy was originally relatively
affordable, but it has increased significantly, particularly on
long-haul flights. Since 2007, the increases have been very
steep—up to 260% for short-haul flights—and between 2008
and 2011 the number of passengers carried by Virgin Atlantic, for
example, decreased by between 7% and 8%, but the amount of APD paid by
its passengers increased by more than 45%.</hs_Para>

issue frequently—the Treasury would say relentlessly. I
apologise that much of what I am saying today has been heard before,

to focus on what happens in Northern Ireland because of its uniqueness.
It is an effective demonstration in microcosm of APD’s impact

I have raised the issue with Treasury Ministers, I was scolded for not
acknowledging the Government’s work on direct long-haul flights.
I will not make that mistake again. I acknowledge that that was real
progress, and I am glad the Government moved to devolve that and in the
first instance to reduce it so that we retained the United Continental
flight as our only long-haul direct route. Of the 600,000 passengers it
carried in the last six years or so before the decision, 40% were
inbound tourists and business visitors, so it was crucial to retain
that connection to north
America.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000071">The

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:12:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Vauxhall mentioned direct flights to Canada. We had those
seasonally, but have since lost them. It would be good if they were
restored, given the huge diaspora to Canada. It provides a good
evidence base for other airlines to consider direct flights from
Belfast. APD placed the direct flight in jeopardy simply because the
rates are so much lower in Dublin, which is less than two hours away
and, in contrast, has good road links. That is a challenge that we must
face in developing our
infrastructure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000072">I
give credit to the Government for responding to the work of Northern
Ireland MPs, the Northern Ireland Assembly and its Ministers,
businesses and the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee’s report
on APD by reducing the levy on direct long-haul flights and for
devolving the matter to the Assembly. That change was important and
very welcome, but affects around 2% of Northern Ireland passengers. It
does not help with the unfair burden on Northern Ireland of APD more
generally; for example, on regional flights, or because of the double
duty that is paid because our access to main UK hubs often requires
separate flights due to the limited number of through carriers. We pay
short-haul to get to London and we pay long-haul to go from London. If
we had a through carrier, we would simply pay long-haul, even if we
stopped in London, but because we do not have seamless ticketing, we
end up paying more and that should be looked at from the perspective of
fairness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000073">The
case for reviewing APD is strong throughout the UK. For island nations,
connectivity and aviation are crucial. The situation is more acute in
Northern Ireland because we have a land border with another EU member
state and the price-sensitive advantage in the Republic of Ireland has
directly affected Northern Ireland. It was initially a bigger issue
with international long-haul flights because the extra time needed to
get to the airport made it worth while, but when flying on even a
moderate flight of, for example, four hours it is almost as quick for
many people to go to Dublin as to International airport or elsewhere to
pick up their flight. The savings may make it sensible financially to
make that slightly longer journey, and that will be an increasing
challenge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000074">APD
also affects tourism because it reduces the cost for people flying into
Dublin, and when they do so as inbound tourists it is very difficult to
get them to cross 
<?notus-xml column=157?>the border to spend time and stay overnight in Northern Ireland. We are
trying to grow our tourism, and the tourism offer has improved
dramatically in recent years, but it is still difficult to get people
who have flown into another jurisdiction to come north and spend time
in Northern Ireland, which is what I really want them to do. Getting
people to Belfast in the first place is hugely
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000075">When
APD was first introduced, it was a means of taxing aviation to try to
reflect the environmental impact. I have no objection to aviation
paying its fair share in that regard. It is important that it does and
that tax takes account of issues such as climate change and seeks to
effect behavioural change. However, there is no realistic alternative
in this case so it has become punitive for
travellers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000076">I
recognise the importance of addressing the deficit and do not dismiss
it in the slightest, but international evidence suggests that tax on
aviation is such a constraint on other revenue that it outweighs the
benefits economically.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:16:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Vauxhall referred to that. The Irish Government committed to
abolishing the tax equivalent of APD because it viewed it as a barrier
to growth and tourism, despite it being set at €3. Most
significantly, the tax in band B of APD covers flights of 2,000-4,000
miles at around £60 and £120 for economy and
business-class passengers respectively. Comparing that with the zero
charges that the Irish Republic is introducing shows the difference
that it can make to the cost of a
flight.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000077">A
PricewaterhouseCoopers study earlier this year indicated that
significant economic benefits could be reaped from the abolition of
APD. It estimated that APD would boost GDP by 0.46% in the first year,
and amount to about £16 billion in the first three years and
create almost 60,000 jobs in the UK in the long term. One of the most
interesting facts in the report was that the abolition of APD would pay
for itself because the increased revenue from income tax, VAT and
higher employment and business growth would outweigh its loss. That is
without the peripheral benefits, including more tourists coming to the
UK and airlines expanding their networks within the UK. It suggests
that in the first two years, the Government would gain increased
revenue of about £500 million and about £250 million each
year thereafter until
2020.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000078">That
study builds on previous studies by Oxford Economics, which suggested
that abolishing APD would raise gross value added by between
£1.8 billion and £2.9 billion because of the
boost in the aviation and tourism sectors from increased passenger
numbers,  and would create 40,000 to 60,000 new jobs. The extra
income available for consumers from lower airline ticket prices would
also provide a stimulus to consumer spending, so additional spin-offs
were predicted. To date, the Government have not accepted those studies
so the answer is for the Treasury to commission its own independent
cost-benefit analysis, as

welcome the recognition of the need for a fair balance between the
negative impacts of noise and the economic benefits of flights, but I

to be about engagement between airports and local communities. That is
extremely valuable in building relationships and aiding understanding,

would like to see independent monitoring of noise contours, with an

independent body would increase public confidence and ensure that the
existing noise monitoring undertaken by airports has a degree of
independence, which it is currently not perceived to have. That would
also provide a more robust approach and give additional transparency,
as those who are making the decisions about monitoring and about the
frequency and timing of aircraft movements would be removed from having
commercial interests in the decisions.</hs_Para>

mapping and monitoring of noise exposure at designated airports is very
helpful, but it should be considered for extension to airports with any
significant neighbouring residential population, so that anyone living
with aircraft noise is aware of the impact on their health. In
particular, when there are schools nearby, that needs to be carefully
considered. In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:21:37"></hs_TimeCode>
my constituency, the George Best Belfast City airport is a hugely
important economic driver: it is a good employer, employing more than
1,000 people, both directly and indirectly, and it creates jobs and
opportunities for the city of Belfast. There is no doubt about that,
but those who live close to the airport, under the flight path, find it
difficult to deal with the effects. There are issues relating to how
those effects, and the environmental impact, are monitored at a UK
level, and it would be helpful for us to consider those in light of
evidence that the Committee received.

for Belfast East made significant comments on the Oxford Economics
report, the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and what APD is doing, as
well as whether it should be rebalanced and whether that could provide
a greater incentive for the UK economy to grow. I have no doubt that
colleagues in the shadow Treasury team are keen to look at those
issues.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady made some points reinforcing the report’s
recommendations, and I will try to refer to what she said briefly in my
review of the recommendations. One thing that I will is that from my
time as aviation Minister, between 2007 and 2009, I know that the vast
majority of airports take the issue of noise very seriously. We tried
to reinforce the provisions, and the coalition has tried to reinforce
the protection for communities around airports. My understanding is
that the expansion of the airports in Paris, which we envy, because
they have a greater capacity than we have, was partly dealt with by the
appointment of a noise regulator for aviation in Paris, which provided
the independence that the hon. Lady is asking for. This is about
reassuring the public that somebody—whether the Government, an
economic regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, or whoever—is
looking at the noise footprint and can ensure that it is within the
contours; that all the arrangements, whether compensation,
double-glazing or air-conditioning, that are in place for most airports
are monitored appropriately; and that the matter is being dealt with
efficiently.</hs_Para>

the report, the key question relates to recommendation 1 on
connectivity. The Government, as I am sure the Minister will tell us,
have set up the Davies commission, which is looking at capacity and
connectivity. He knows that we think that it was a great idea and that
we suggested it 12 months before they did it, but the fact that they
got round to it is to their credit. We fully support it, and
Labour’s position is that we will wait to see the outcome of the
commission and its recommendations.</hs_Para>

only potential recommendation that we have firmly set ourselves against
is if the commission comes out in favour of an estuary airport. I
cannot imagine that it will, but that is one recommendation that we
will not take forward. However, we will look at anything else that
Davies comes out with, as the Conservative party has also said. I think
that the Liberal Democrats are in a different place altogether on
aviation. I am not clear exactly how they view aviation, given how
important it is as an economic tool, which everyone who has spoken in
the debate so far has recognised.</hs_Para>

Fitzpatrick:</Member></B> For the avoidance of doubt, we have said that
we will look at whatever the Davies commission proposes, with the
exception of a potential recommendation to build an estuary airport. We
said that if that is a recommendation, we are sorry, but we are not
persuaded at all by the evidence that that is the way to move aviation
forward as an economic tool for UK plc. However, we will look at
point-to-point, additional runways at Gatwick or Stansted, or a new hub
airport—whatever the Davies commission comes up with, we will
look at, but an estuary airport, from our point of view, is off the

a range of events have been organised by a variety of different
organisations, industry bodies, think-tanks and so on. The best story
that I have heard from many such meetings was a question-and-answer
session that included, on the top table, the chief executive of
Schiphol airport. When he was asked what he thinks the answer to the
UK’s aviation policy should be, his response was,
“It’s not for me to say, but the recommendation I would
give is that you should take your time and think about it long and
hard.” The longer we take to make a decision, the more Schiphol
is growing, day by day, week by week, and month by month.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Vauxhall said, Schiphol advertises itself these
days as the UK hub airport. It serves more than 20 British cities,
while Heathrow only serves seven. Therefore, the connectivity from our
regions is dwindling, and as slots from Heathrow become more precious
and more airlines want to get in, that squeezes the ability for our
regions and for Northern Ireland, Scotland and elsewhere to get in.
Capacity is a big issue, and the connectivity points made in
recommendation 1 are therefore significant.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-27T14:38:39"></hs_TimeCode>air links to

to consider with the US authorities and other interested stakeholders
the feasibility of establishing US pre-clearance facilities at Belfast

currently available at Dublin and Shannon airports, we hope that

down and thwart what might be in the national interest. That is why the
decision made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Transport to set up the Davies commission was the right one, and I look
forward to the commission’s recommendations in the summer of
2015, so that we 
<?notus-xml column=167?>can seek to build political consensus and move forward. That is crucial,

talked about competing with the Republic of Ireland or with Dublin. I
should put on the record that as well as chairing the Select Committee,
I co-chair the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, so I meant
competition in a very friendly way. The Irish Government support
reducing corporation tax to 12.5% in Northern Ireland, so I speak about
such competition on the basis of

for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey), about EU interference on air passenger duty

Minister spoke about the reasons for APD, of which there are two: one
is to raise tax and the other relates to green issues. On those green
issues, if we over-tax our airlines, we will not reduce the number of
flights or save the world; people will just fly from somewhere else.
That is the point we have been trying to get

scale, I have some sympathy with the Government, because airport
capacity in the south-east should have been sorted out long ago by the
previous Labour Government, but we need to speed up the process. I am
concerned about how long it will take for the review, for action to be
taken and then for building work to be completed. Northern Ireland
might lose an awful lot of jobs while that is going on, and I am very
concerned about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062763000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/halltext/130627h0001.htm#13062763000147">Let
us say that the recommendation is made next year and that it is for a
third runway. From a political point of view, if the Lib Dems do not
like that, they can go into the election saying that they will not
pursue that option, and we can go into it saying that we will. I do not
see what is wrong with that. We will get to the point, before the next
election, at which we disagree on several issues with the Lib
Dems—and with the Labour party—and we will all go into

would be nervous about going into the election and saying to the
electorate, “I’m sorry, we have no policy.” This
is a political point—you may rule me out of order in a minute,
Mr Amess—but I would have a problem about going into the
election and saying to my constituents, “I’m sorry, I
don’t have a clue what we should do in the south-east.” I
will not be doing that; I will be putting forward a very definite view.

I have known him for many years, and I know that he will go away, take
those points on board and do his absolute utmost to help the people of
Northern Ireland. It has been a privilege to lead this debate. As I
have said, the very important thing to do in Northern Ireland is to
rebalance the economy, and one way to help do so is by securing the

Electricity market reform (EMR) is a central component of the Energy
Bill currently being considered by Parliament, and will address the
need to attract unprecedented levels of investment in the UK
electricity sector over the coming decades as we replace our ageing
energy infrastructure with a diverse mix of low-carbon generation, and
meet the expected increases in electricity demand as sectors such as
transport and heat are
electrified.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062755000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/wmstext/130627m0001.htm#13062755000139">The

form a core component of the Government’s strategy to bring
forward investment in affordable low-carbon electricity
generation—including renewables, carbon capture and storage and
new nuclear. CfDs provide efficient and long-term support for
low-carbon generation, reducing risks faced by generators by increasing
revenue certainty and through the backing of a long-term contract.
Generators are paid the difference between the market price and a
“strike price”, but when the market price is high the
generator must pay back the difference, which reduces costs to
consumers when electricity prices are high. The Government are
announcing today alongside the spending review draft CfD strike prices
for renewables technologies, decisions on key CfD terms, and the

key part of the challenge our market faces is in ensuring secure

create an investment challenge, for some forms of capacity such as gas
generation. The Government are taking clear action to address this by
legislating to introduce the capacity market. The capacity market will
give investors the certainty they need to put adequate reliable
capacity in place and by protecting consumers against the risk of
supply shortages. It does this by providing a predictable revenue
stream to providers of reliable capacity, including both generation and
non-generation measures such as demand-side-response and storage. In
return, they must commit to provide capacity when needed or face
financial
penalties.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062755000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/wmstext/130627m0001.htm#13062755000147">Government

Re promises to effectively limit the most that hundreds of thousands of
UK households should have to pay for flood insurance. We anticipate
that up to 500,000 high-risk households could benefit from Flood Re,
and pay significantly less for their insurance than they might
otherwise. Customers would be free to shop around to get the best
overall deal from an insurer of their choice as well as limiting the
potential for price rises, with some customers seeing prices fall.
Flood Re would also constrain the excesses that could be imposed on
households at high flood
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062755000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/wmstext/130627m0001.htm#13062755000159">The
benefits of Flood Re would be targeted towards those who need it most,
helping those who are particularly hard-pressed with the cost of
living. Furthermore, the ABI has assured Ministers that its proposal
can be introduced without impacting customer bills in general. An
internal industry levy would fund Flood Re, capturing the existing
cross-subsidy in the market. Flood Re would operate as a not-for-profit
reinsurance scheme managed by the insurance industry itself. There will
be no contingent liability for the Government or the taxpayer from the
Flood Re
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062755000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/wmstext/130627m0001.htm#13062755000160">Flood
Re would be a novel approach and there remain many details to work
through with the industry, including the relationship between Flood Re
and Parliament. Our broad intention is that Flood Re, rather than
Ministers, would be directly accountable to Parliament for its ongoing
operations. Ministers would of course 
<?notus-xml column=15?>remain accountable to Parliament for overall policy on flood
insurance. While novel, these arrangements are
intended to strike a balance between the full requirements of
accountability to Parliament and the need for Flood Re to operate as an
integral part of the insurance market. I am writing with further
details on this point to the chairs of the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, Treasury, and Public Accounts Committees. Due to the statutory
nature of the levy, Flood Re is also likely to be classed as state aid
and so would need to be approved by the European
Commission.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062755000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/wmstext/130627m0001.htm#13062755000161">While
it is our preference to work with the industry towards Flood Re there
are therefore still significant issues to be overcome, many outside of
the Government’s control. Households deserve to have confidence
that this issue will be addressed one way or another. Because of the
remaining uncertainties around Flood Re, the Government will also seek
powers in the Water Bill to regulate for affordable flood insurance.
This approach would be pursued if Flood Re would not or does not
deliver what we need, and insurers are otherwise unable to keep prices
at affordable levels. If introduced, the fall-back regulatory approach
would place an obligation on each insurer to take their share of high
flood risk households, or face penalties. This flood insurance
obligation would have the objective of sustaining the existing market
for high-risk households at affordable
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062755000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/wmstext/130627m0001.htm#13062755000162">This
Government do not intervene in markets unnecessarily, and whichever
approach is finally pursued it would only operate for a limited time,

improved. A total of 132,000 jobseekers have escaped long-term

that it does not regard the calculation by commentators that 3.5% of
people got into work in the first year of the scheme as the most
relevant figure on which to assess performance. It says that
performance is better measured by counting how many people referred to
the Work programme get into sustained work in their first year on the
scheme on this measure, while just 8.5% of those who started the Work
programme in June 2011 completed at least six months of work in their

to many employment schemes under previous Governments, the programme
targets the hardest to help into work, such as those claiming
employment and support allowance. Some people have been out of work for
more than 10 or 15 years, so it will take time to help them back. But
the Work programme is offering them more support than previous
employment schemes, and 6,000 of the harder to help have now found
lasting work. We expect providers to deliver improving results as they
share best
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13062755000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/wmstext/130627m0001.htm#13062755000224">Although
many providers are now meeting their contracted levels for helping
jobseeker’s allowance claimants, some are lagging behind. The

providers. We will be implementing market share shift in at least
16 instances. Implementation of these shifts will begin in

Prisk</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 24 June 2013]:</I> The Housing
Act 2004 permits local authorities, subject to carrying out a
consultation, to license all private landlords in a designated area
that is suffering from low housing demand and/or antisocial behaviour.
The purpose of selective licensing is to address the adverse,
cumulative impact that poor management by some landlords and/or
antisocial behaviour by some tenants can have in the community.
Selective licensing is only concerned with the management of privately
rented dwellings, not the condition of the
property.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062777000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/text/130627w0001.htm#13062777000361">Notwithstanding,
the 2004 Act also introduced the Housing Health and Safety Rating
System which is designed to assess the presence and severity of a range
of hazards in the home, such as excess cold, fire and electrical
hazards. This allows action to be taken by councils against individual
properties which are substandard or

recognise that some small employers who pay employees weekly, or more

relaxation means that employers with fewer than 50 employees, who find
it difficult to report every payment to employees at the time of
payment, may send information to HMRC by the date of their regular

and JHWSs are local strategic planning processes, we therefore do not
monitor them centrally in the Department. JSNAs are the means by which
the current and future health and well-being needs of the local

This will then be used to develop locally agreed priorities in JHWSs,
which will underpin local commissioning plans. In this way, health and
wellbeing boards will plan local services on the basis of identified
needs. JSNAs will therefore need to cover the health and care needs of
the whole local population and may well include drug and alcohol
treatment. However, it would not be appropriate for the Department to
highlight any care group or area of need over another as this would
risk undermining the purpose of JSNAs and

their service. Therefore, in order to meet the criteria for the Bevan
Boys Badge individuals are asked to complete an application form and

schools judged as 'inadequate' by Ofsted. Data from 2005 onwards have
been placed in the House Library; no comparable data is available for

information would incur disproportionate cost. There has been no
consistent trend in the number or proportion of schools judged as
'inadequate' between 2005/06 and 2011/12. Many factors can influence
the spread of inspection grades, including modifications to successive

other

used to identify underperforming schools were introduced in 2002 for
key stage 2 and key stage 4. Prior to this, targets were set at local
education authority and national level. Data from 2000 onwards on the
number of schools failing to meet each year's targets have been placed
in the House Library. With rising attainment, the criteria for being
"above the floor" has increased over the period—the number of
schools below the floor has decreased both absolutely and relatively
between 2000 and 2012. In 2012, at key stage 4 the toughest threshold

Average income is defined as the median equivalised net household

a third of the world injury burden. Economically disadvantaged families
are hardest hit by both direct medical costs and indirect costs, such
as lost wages, that result from road traffic injuries. At the national
level, road traffic injuries result in considerable
financial costs, particularly to developing

Asian states on transition in Afghanistan to help secure long-term
stability and security for the region. The Senior Minister of State, my

her recent visits to Kazakhstan in April 2013, and to Turkmenistan,
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in June 2013. She also represented the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon.
Friend the Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague) at the Ministerial
Conference of the Istanbul Process in Almaty, Kazakhstan in April 2013.
This conference discussed regional stability and security, with a focus
on 
<?notus-xml column=379?>Afghanistan. My noble and right hon. Friend met with her Central Asian
counterparts in the margins of this conference to discuss Afghanistan.
Our Central Asian embassies actively engage their hosts on transition
in Afghanistan, reaffirming the UK's long-term commitment beyond 2014.
In addition, we are working with Central Asian governments on a number
of initiatives funded by the tri-departmental Conflict Pool to help
them deal with security challenges and we continue to monitor
progress.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13062787000450" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/text/130627w0002.htm#13062787000450"><B><Member PimsId="2626" UID="13062787000564" xid="117" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130627/text/130627w0002.htm#13062787000564">Mr

Arms Trade Treaty that was adopted by an overwhelming majority at the
UN General Assembly on 2 April. I signed the treaty for the UK on 3
June, and will shortly table the text in both Houses to initiate our
ratification process. The Treaty will save lives, reduce human
suffering, and bring consistency to the global trade in conventional
arms. It will not stigmatise the legitimate trade in arms. Instead it
will protect it, establishing global commitments on national arms
export controls and a baseline for robust controls that ensure
countries can defend their citizens without undermining human

using its energy revenues to fund its nuclear programme. This includes
a ban on the import of Iranian oil and gas, and designation of Iran's
key energy companies and their subsidiaries, as well as energy
ministries. As a result of EU and other international sanctions,
Iranian oil revenues have been cut by more than half from 2011 levels,
