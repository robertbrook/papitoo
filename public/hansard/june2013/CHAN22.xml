encourage all students to consider apprenticeships as a high quality
alternative to the academic path. I commend the activity that
Sunderland city council and Sunderland football club are taking to
ensure that more young people in that great city consider
apprenticeships as a viable role for the future. I should add that the
recent diminution in the number of 16 to 19-year-olds taking
apprenticeships was due significantly to the fact that we were reducing
the number of low quality apprenticeships where the duration was
shorter than a proper apprenticeship needs to be and the quality of
tuition was less effective than a good apprenticeship needs to be, but
there is still more to be done.</hs_Para>

importance of construction and other sectors in helping to encourage
more young people to consider apprenticeships. The Under-Secretary of
State for Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for West Suffolk (Matthew
Hancock)—who sadly cannot be with us, Mr Speaker, because he is

Gove:</Member></B> I absolutely agree that those working with
apprentices need to have either the best qualifications or the best
experience in the relevant sector, which is why we implemented the
recommendations of Alison Wolf’s report. We have allowed
lecturers in further education, who are qualified in that sector but
were not previously able to work in schools, to work in schools. We
will also implement the Richard review, which once more puts employers
in control of assuring the quality of vocational qualifications, so
that anyone who secures an apprenticeship can be confident that it will
lead to a satisfying job.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs Theresa

statement about the latest allegations concerning the use of undercover
officers to smear the reputations of Doreen and Neville Lawrence and

the activities of police officers engaged in undercover operations, and
I would like to update the House on the several investigations and

officers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000258">Before
I do so, I know that the whole House will want to convey its support
for the Lawrence family. They experienced an unspeakable tragedy, their
pain was compounded by the many years in which justice was not done,
and these latest allegations, still coming 20 years after
Stephen’s murder, only add to their suffering. I also know that
the House will agree with me about the seriousness of allegations
concerning police corruption and wrongdoing. We must be ruthless in
purging such behaviour from their
ranks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000259">As
Members of the House will remember, in February I announced that the
commissioner of the Metropolitan police had agreed that Mick Creedon,
chief constable of Derbyshire constabulary, would investigate
allegations of improper practice and misconduct by the Metropolitan
police’s special demonstration squad, which for around 40 years
specialised in undercover operations. Mick Creedon took over a
Metropolitan police investigation called Operation
Herne.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000260">In
addition to these latest allegations about the Lawrence family,
Operation Herne is also looking into claims about the use by police
officers of dead children’s identities, the conduct of officers
who had infiltrated environmentalist groups, and other serious matters.
Given the nature of those allegations and the many years the special
demonstration squad was in existence, we should not be surprised if
further allegations are made. I want to be clear that all such
allegations will be investigated. Operation Herne is led by Chief
Constable Creedon and elements are supervised by the Independent Police
Complaints
Commission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000261">Today
the Metropolitan police are also referring details of the new set of
allegations to the IPCC, meaning that this aspect of the investigation
will also be supervised. I know that some Members have suggested that
the IPCC should take over Operation Herne completely, and that is an
understandable reaction. I spoke with Dame Anne Owers, the chair of the
IPCC, earlier today. She does not believe that a greater degree of IPCC
control would enhance the investigation, but I can confirm that where
the Creedon investigation finds evidence of criminal behaviour or
misconduct by police officers, the IPCC will investigate and the
officers will be brought to
justice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000262">I
have also spoken today with Chief Constable Mick Creedon. He
told me that the first strand of his work, which relates to
allegations about the identities of dead children, will report
before the House rises for the summer recess. At present
there are 23 police officers working on the case, with a
further 10 police staff working in support. In the course of
their investigation they have already examined in the

want to emphasise that undercover operations are a vital part of
protecting the public, but they need detailed supervision and constant
reassessment to ensure that what is being done is justified. For

February last year, Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary
reported on how forces go about undercover policing. That work was
undertaken partly in response to allegations about the conduct of a

a series of recommendations designed to improve the procedures that
police forces have in place for managing and scrutinising the
deployment of undercover officers. Among other recommendations, HMIC
said that the authorisation arrangements for high-risk
undercover deployments should be improved and that additional controls
should be put in place where a deployment is intended to gather

the work that they have done to pursue justice and reform over very
many years. The whole country has been appalled by the allegations that

Lawrence was the victim of a terrible racist murder, yet it took 19

listen to the Lawrence family at the time, as chronicled in the

these latest allegations must be taken very seriously because they

disturbingly of all, the latest allegations suggest that police
officers were working undercover to undermine victims of crime when the

oversight and control of the important work that police officers do but
that nevertheless needs strong control. I also welcome the commitment
of the Home Secretary to ensure an independent look at the allegations
about undermining the Lawrence family. I am glad that she has gone
further than the Prime Minister’s call this morning for the
Metropolitan police to investigate; clearly, the investigation needs to
be independent. However, it remains unclear whether she expects the
lead on getting to the truth of the allegations to be taken by Mark

QC is indeed a well-respected independent person to review these
allegations and report back to the Lawrence family, but he does not, of
course, have the powers to instigate criminal or disciplinary
proceedings. At the same time, Operation Herne is a wide-ranging report
with a far wider remit looking into undercover policing, especially in
the environmental movement, over very many years. The Home Secretary
set out the huge scope of that investigation in her statement. May I
suggest that we need a specific independent investigation into these
allegations, given their seriousness and the significance of the
Lawrence investigation and the Macpherson review for policing and
confidence in policing? We need a clear timetable for getting to the
truth. The investigation will also need to look at whether the
Macpherson review was misled. Would it not be better to set out a clear

Home Secretary said that any conclusions that the Ellison review comes
to would still have to be handed to the IPCC or to another police force
to pursue a further investigation. Given that these allegations already
refer to events of 20 years ago, surely this would risk creating
significant further delays. Has she considered giving the Ellison
review additional powers or combining it with independent police or
IPCC investigations in order to allow it to pursue the truth and
trigger further investigations where
necessary?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000277">The
vital work that police officers do every day to investigate crimes,
bring offenders to justice and support victims relies on public
confidence. As we saw with the Hillsborough review, we can
never ignore any case where there is evidence that police officers may
be involved in undermining victims or investigations rather than
supporting them. For the sake of victims of crime and the excellent
work that police officers do each day, there must be a proper, swift

concerns like these arise.</hs_Para>

the review and that she will make sure that it is clear and

Herne, by Mark Ellison, or by the Met under the auspices of the IPCC.
Operation Herne was originally set up by the Metropolitan police, but
it is now being led by Chief Constable Creedon. Although Met officers
are still involved in that investigation, 
<?notus-xml column=29?>Chief Constable Creedon has also brought into it officers from his own
force and elsewhere. The investigation by Chief Constable Creedon will

suggested that he and others were told not to give evidence to the
Macpherson inquiry is a matter of particular concern, but that will be

family, who may be forgiven for believing that they have been punished
twice over for the fact that they inconveniently allowed their son to
be murdered while he stood innocently at a bus stop in south London in
1993. Does the Home Secretary accept that I, as Home Secretary, and the
Metropolitan Police Authority knew absolutely nothing about the
allegations, notwithstanding that it was well known that I established
the Macpherson inquiry and wanted to know everything there was to know
about the 
<?notus-xml column=31?>Metropolitan police’s conduct of that investigation? That conduct
alone is reprehensible, as is the fact that we now understand that such
information was kept from Lord Condon, the then commissioner of the

he says, he established the Macpherson inquiry and was in office when
it published its report. At the time, there were some very concerning
issues regarding the way the murder was investigated, both originally
and later on, and on the attitude, which the Macpherson inquiry looked
into, of the Metropolitan police. He is right that we should be very
concerned if information was deliberately withheld from those who
should have been informed of it, which is why I asked Mark Ellison to
look specifically at the issue of the information that was given to the

Constable Creedon, includes looking at reporting mechanisms within the

the Crown Prosecution Service, to decide whether those investigations

revelations that were made in relation to the Lawrence family. The
Select Committee on Home Affairs published its report into undercover
police officers on 1 March. It expressed deep concern that Operation
Herne had taken 20 months, cost £1.2 million and
involved 23 officers, and yet nobody had been arrested. Chief
Constable Creedon is a full-time serving chief constable. Frankly, with
50,000 documents to look through it will take years to resolve this
matter. We need a timetable. What words of comfort does she have for
the families whose dead children’s identities have been used by

Gentleman and the Home Affairs Committee have raised about the
timetable for Operation Herne, but I would make two comments in
response. First, Chief Constable Mick Creedon expects to be able to
respond on the issue of the use of dead children’s identities
before the House rises for the summer recess. That is one part of the
inquiry. Where possible, his intention is to report on issues as they
arise, rather than waiting until the end of all the investigations, but
obviously that will be done where appropriate and depending on what has
been found and what he is able to report on. Secondly, it is also fair
to say—the right hon. Gentleman is right about this—that
the Metropolitan police had been conducting Operation Herne for some
time before Chief Constable Creedon was brought in, but sometimes it is
easier for somebody coming into an investigation from outside the home
force being investigated to interview people and get the evidence
required.</hs_Para>

Doreen Lawrence had every right to expect that the police would do
nothing less than hunt down those who murdered their son Stephen.
Sadly, as we have seen, it was many years before anyone was brought to
justice and there were issues with how the investigation was conducted
and with the Metropolitan police, as was shown in the Macpherson
report. He is right that if the police are to do their job, they need
the confidence and support of the community, which is why it is
imperative that where there is wrongdoing, it is identified, and that
those who have committed wrongdoing, be it misconduct or criminal
activity, are brought to the appropriate
justice.</hs_Para>

These allegations are very shocking, but for those of us involved in
campaigning around those issues at the time, they are not entirely
surprising. It was era when, for instance, there was a death in police
custody and negative information very quickly found its way into the
public domain. I was the first Member of Parliament to raise this case
on the Floor of the House and I was close to the Lawrence family at the
time. I remember that the reason why Doreen was so angry, so upset and
so determined was that she felt that the police were not even trying.
Now, it seems clear that they not only were not trying, but were
actively trying to denigrate and smear the family. Does the Home
Secretary appreciate that this was a totemic case for a generation and
that she owes it the Lawrence family, but also to the wider community,
to get to the bottom of what happened, who knew and who authorised this
operation?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000321" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000321"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs May" PimsId="1758" UID="13062415000826" xid="420" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0001.htm#13062415000826">Mrs

the seriousness of this case and the allegations made around it. The

beyond disgusting that, when many of us thought that Macpherson was a
moving-on stage in the whole area of public policy in relation to the
black community and to policing, we find out that whole elements of the
Metropolitan police had not moved on at all, and indeed were busy
smearing and obstructing justice in exactly the way they had
beforehand. <I>The Guardian </I>reported at great length on Saturday
the behaviour of two undercover police officers, Bob Lambert and John
Dines. Bob Lambert is known to some of us in this House and is a very
clever operator—there is no question about that. It is also
clear that during the undercover operations used against the Lawrence
family and in the McLibel case and a number of other cases, senior
officers in Scotland Yard must have known who was doing what and known
of the disreputable personal behaviour of such people, and must still
know. I hope the inquiry is not restricted within the police force but,
in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford), is
open and public, and that heads roll at a high level in Scotland Yard
for those who have covered up the truth and allowed smearing and
injustice to go on for a very long time. Unless that inquiry gets to

of what was being done. It is clear that a number of cases are already
under the supervision of the IPCC because they relate to the conduct of

several strands to the work that is taking place; it is being done in
that way for very good reasons. The investigation of Operation Herne,
now led by Chief Constable Creedon, with some aspects supervised by the
IPCC, is looking at a wide remit in the operation of the special
demonstration squad, but also at whether any criminal activities took
place, and whether any appropriate action must be taken in relation to
such criminal activities or misconduct by police officers. The Mark
Ellison review was set up to look at the information available, to see
whether specific corruption was taking place around the investigation
into Stephen Lawrence’s murder and whether all the information
that should have been given to the Macpherson inquiry was given to it.
In due course, there may be a need for investigations to come out of
that review, but I suggest we wait until the review has completed
before making that
decision.</hs_Para>

every other Northern Ireland Bill of recent years, the legislation
before the House this afternoon is not being rushed through to resolve
a crisis, to deal with security matters or to revive collapsed
institutions. Today, we are considering a new kind of Bill for Northern
Ireland: a Bill for more normal times—times in which Northern
Ireland’s position as part of the United Kingdom is settled on
the basis of consent; we have a stable and inclusive devolved
Government at Stormont; and the focus is now very much on the politics
of
delivery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000492" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000492">Many
of the measures in the Bill—in contrast to previous
legislation—have been prepared in the light of public
consultation, followed by pre-legislative scrutiny by the Select
Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. I am very grateful to my
hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson) and his Committee
for the seriousness and diligence with which they approached their task
of scrutinising this legislation. Several aspects of the Bill have been
improved in response to their
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000493">So
the context for this Bill is much more stable than that for previous
Northern Ireland-related legislation. Devolved government is well
established and the Northern Ireland institutions have been running
continuously since 2007. In May, the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister published an ambitious programme to address sectarian
divisions, including dismantling all peace walls within 10 years. Just
10 days ago, they, I and the Prime Minister signed a substantial
economic pact to help Northern Ireland compete in the global race for
jobs and investment. The agreement reflects the maturing relationship
between the Government and the Executive, and it will see the two
Administrations working more closely together than ever before on
crucial issues such as business access to finance, improving
infrastructure, and supporting research and
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000494" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000494">Of
course, last week Northern Ireland also played host to the highly
successful G8 summit—something that would have been unthinkable
only a few years ago. The Prime Minister’s decision to bring the
G8 to County Fermanagh could not have been more fully vindicated. Lough
Erne provided a spectacular backdrop for the meeting of eight of the
most powerful people in the world. The summit was a great opportunity
to showcase the best of the new Northern Ireland, which is a great
place to invest and a great place to visit. A highly effective policing
operation delivered the most peaceful G8 that anyone can remember. Let
me take this opportunity to thank the Police Service of Northern
Ireland and its partner agencies, including the Garda Siochana, for all
their work in making that possible and for their continuing vigilance
against the terrorist threat that remains so severe in Northern
Ireland.</hs_Para>

a number of institutional changes. The measures do not reopen the
political settlement enshrined in the Belfast agreement or its
successors, but I believe they will improve the way that politics
works in Northern Ireland in a number of significant
ways. For example, the Bill will open the way for more
transparency about political donations, it will modernise the way that
elections are run and it will see an end to dual mandates in the
Assembly and the House of
Commons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000496" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000496">Let
me take the points about transparency first. As the House may well be
aware, Northern Ireland is subject to different transparency rules on
political donation from the rest of the UK. The concern has always been
that the publication of donor names could deter people from making
political donations because of fear of violent reprisal. Let me be
clear that the Government’s ultimate goal is full transparency,
with the rules in Northern Ireland being brought into line with the
rest of the UK but, having considered the matter carefully, we have
concluded that the security situation has not improved sufficiently to
enable us to do that and that it is not yet right to start publishing
donor
names.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000497" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000497"><Member ContinuationText="Lady Hermon" PimsId="943" UID="13062415000842" xid="272" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000842"><B>Lady

summit, which has been a huge success, and I thank her for expressing
appreciation of the PSNI and the Garda Siochana. Will she take into

Northern Ireland, but, as I have said, I feel that the time is not

Chamber, where people are involved in alternative jobs and careers;
there is not the same degree of public concern about dual mandates with

them from Members of the House of Commons. We will listen to the

deals with issues such as performance standards for electoral
registration officers; residence requirements for voting; the canvass
form; and declarations by overseas voters. Clause 7 introduces
five-year fixed terms for the Assembly from now on, and moves
the date of the next Assembly election to 2016. When the Fixed-term
Parliaments Bill was debated in 2010, concern was expressed that a
general election in May 2015 would overshadow polls for the UK’s
devolved Assemblies scheduled for the same day and cause voter
confusion. The decision was taken to extend the terms of the 
<?notus-xml column=53?>Scottish Parliament and of the Welsh Assembly. Lord Wallace, speaking on
behalf of the Government, indicated in the debate in the other House
that the Government would consider a similar extension for the Northern
Ireland Executive after consideration of the triple poll of May 2011.
The Bill now brings the Northern Ireland institutions into line with
the approach adopted for Scotland and Wales, avoiding the clash with
the 2015 general election and making future clashes much less
likely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000523" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000523">Clauses

well as consideration of these and other measures in the Bill, I am
sure our debates will give us the opportunity to reflect on what the
next steps for institutional change in Northern Ireland should be. The
Government do not rule out more far-reaching changes to the

consistent with the principles of power sharing and inclusivity at the
heart of the Belfast agreement, and they could go ahead only if
they had cross-party and cross-communal

perennial question for all institutions of government is how to improve
delivery. A growing number of people think this could come about by
facilitating the emergence of a formal Opposition within the Northern
Ireland Assembly. Although MLAs of course provide regular and careful
scrutiny of the Executive, the Government have been clear that they
would like to see a more normal system emerge, which accommodates a
Government and a formal Opposition. As yet the consensus that we would
need in order to legislate has not been achieved, but I believe that
the consultation that my predecessor ran last year on this has pushed
the issue
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000527">I

now looking at steps that the Assembly itself might take in this field.
I certainly encourage the larger parties to be generous towards parties
that might consider that they could best serve the electorate by
choosing to be in opposition, or that do not have sufficient strength
in the Assembly for a seat at the Executive table. As parliamentarians
we recognise the democratic value of challenge to our views,

will play its part in helping to address the challenges faced by
today’s Northern Ireland and its

Coaker</B> (Gedling) (Lab):</Member> This is a remarkable time for
Northern Ireland and a good time for the House to discuss the Bill. The
coverage of President Obama’s visit to Belfast last week and the
sight of world leaders attending the G8 summit in Fermanagh were
powerful, moving and hugely uplifting. Some 2,000 young
people from schools across Northern Ireland were reminded that the
future belongs to them and that it is their attitude and
decisions that will take us forward. The President’s words will
serve to inspire those in the Waterfront hall and far beyond to make
rhetoric a reality and to deliver progress for the next
generation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000532">From
a Northern Ireland perspective, the G8 summit was everything we had all
hoped it would be. I again congratulate the Secretary of State and the
Prime Minister on their work and their foresight in deciding to hold
such a prestigious international event in County Fermanagh. Indeed, the
Prime Minister told us last week that each of the world leaders
commented on how incredible it was that such a summit could take place
in Northern Ireland, and in the most tranquil and beautiful
surroundings of Lough
Erne.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000533" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000533">Thanks
to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, their colleagues from other
police forces in the UK, and An Garda Siochana, the G8 met safely and
securely and the accompanying protests took place peacefully
and respectfully. The people of Northern Ireland and their
representatives in this House and in Stormont can rightly be proud of
what that showed the world last week. I know that everyone in this
House and right across the United Kingdom and Ireland share that pride
and that sense of success and achievement. It is in that context that
we are discussing the Bill today and not, as was so often the case

the Secretary of State suggested, and as Members know, there is more to
come. We are halfway through Derry/Londonderry’s year as UK city

<?notus-xml column=55?>visiting the newly developed Tower museum, which charts the
city’s incredible history, the London street art gallery, which
showcases the work of emerging artists, a moving exhibition

knows that challenges remain and that there remains much work to be
done. The threat from dissident republican groups remains high, and
those who seek to destroy the peace and progress are still intent on
carrying out their murderous activities. It is only the bravery,
dedication and skill of the police, army technical officers and the
security services that have prevented the terrorists from succeeding.
The loyalist flag protests have shown that there is still work to be
done, so we cannot be complacent. I join the First and Deputy First

context that we are considering the Bill today. Let me say something I
have said many times before: the Opposition are committed to working
with the Government in a bipartisan way where possible. When we believe
that the Government are acting in the best interests of Northern
Ireland, we will support them. When we disagree, we have a duty to
challenge them and hold them to
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000539">I
must say that in some respects I am disappointed with the Bill, not so
much because of what is in it, but because of what is not.
“Miscellaneous” suggests that all that is needed is some
tidying up by Westminster and that it is a case of putting
forward some minor amendments and small adjustments. Indeed, most of
the Bill’s provisions have been discussed with the Northern
Ireland parties and command general, if not universal, support. In
principle, we support the ending of dual mandates, the extension of the
Assembly’s term—temporarily and then
permanently—giving security of tenure to the Justice Minister
and devolving power on the size of the Assembly. We want to move to
full transparency and accountability in political donations. Clearly,
we will look at the detail of all the proposals in Committee, but by
and large they make
sense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000540">However,
the Secretary of State will know that the Assembly and Executive Review
Committee at Stormont is looking at the size of the Assembly, the
number of Executive Departments, designation, the composition of the
Executive, and provision for opposition. These are difficult and
sensitive issues. The principles of power 
<?notus-xml column=56?>sharing and inclusivity are fundamental, but there is an acceptance that
the system could be improved and there are demands for more
accountability and more rigorous scrutiny of the Executive.</hs_Para>

precursor to the Bill, the previous Secretary of State last year
launched a review of the operation of the Assembly during a speech in
which he criticised the Assembly and the Executive. I said at the time
that that criticism was largely unwarranted and unnecessary and
suggested that the Government work in partnership with the Executive
and the Assembly to look at how they and the Northern Ireland Office
could work more effectively, individually and collectively. To be fair
to the current Secretary of State, she has taken an approach more in
line with that thinking. However, I worry that in some respects she has
gone too far the other way and has not engaged with some of the
issues.</hs_Para>

the House a chance to put its views appropriately and constructively

discussions he has had on the progress of the Assembly and Executive
Review Committee’s work? Have the Government had any requests
from that body or the Executive for the inclusion of measures that have
not been included in the Bill? These are difficult and challenging
areas and it will be hard to find agreement, but I sense from
everywhere that there is an increasing desire to make progress a little
more quickly—something, as I have said, that will undoubtedly be
discussed in Committee in more
detail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000544">Many
other issues affect people in Northern Ireland, of course, and there is
demand for politicians here and in Stormont to concentrate on building
jobs and growth, tackling youth unemployment and creating opportunity.

saying that the Government here in London should recognise the huge
impact that Treasury decisions have on Northern Ireland, which has
particular circumstances as it emerges from conflict. The Secretary of

Second Reading debate, the main point that I want to make to the
Government is that they should reflect on whether anything more could
be included in the Bill that would help to build peace, progress and
prosperity in Northern Ireland. I am always glad, and often surprised,
at how keen people in Northern Ireland are for us to visit to hear
their stories and share in some of their experiences. Nowhere has this
been more evident than in engaging with victims and survivors. It is
always an incredibly humbling and emotional experience to
speak with those who have lost loved ones. The heartbreaking stories
that I have heard have moved and affected me greatly, as I am sure they
have many others.</hs_Para>

dozens of victims and survivors, some with organisations, some
individually, right across Northern Ireland. Some months ago I spent
time with a woman whose two brothers had joined the Royal Ulster
Constabulary together on the same day—a very proud one for her
family. One of them was killed in a car bomb just a few months later,
and just as she was beginning to recover from that, the other was
killed in a mortar attack on a police station, 15 years after his
brother. It devastated her and her family. I also met the mother of a
young girl aged 12 who died in her father’s arms just yards from
her home after being shot by a soldier. There was no explanation of or
justification for either of those events.</hs_Para>

very difficult and painful things to speak about, but we have had many
difficult and painful conversations in Northern Ireland, and we need to
have this one. Is there nothing we can propose in the Bill that would
help this process and take it forward? The Government say that there is
no consensus on the way forward and therefore no possibility of
agreement. In essence, that it is to do with them. I fundamentally
disagree, as Members will know. Dealing with the past—the legacy
of the troubles—is expressly a responsibility of the Northern
Ireland Office. It cannot act alone, of course, and I have consistently
said that we need a comprehensive and inclusive process with victims
and survivors at the centre. The last time we debated Northern Ireland
on the Floor of the House, the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon)
asked me what I meant by that. I repeat today that the
Government, in partnership 
<?notus-xml column=59?>with the Irish Government, have a duty to lead, but
not to prescribe. They must create a vehicle through which these issues
can be discussed and resolved. Of course, that will take time and it
will not be easy, but the prize will be worth it. Victims and survivors
are not afraid to talk about the past; the Governments should
not be
either.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000559" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000559">Just
last week, I went to St Ethelburga’s church, which was blown up
by the IRA in the Bishopsgate bombing in 1993, where I saw the Theatre
of Witness production, “From the Rubble”. It was an
incredibly powerful performance that bore witness to the wounds of the
past, which are still visible to many in Northern Ireland. The
performers were not acting, but telling their own real stories. One
said that we need to have an eye on the future, as well as an eye on
the past. We cannot ignore the past, but we must not be trapped
by it

still matters to Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland must matter to
Westminster. The Bill gives the House of Commons the chance to
demonstrate that through our deliberations. The UK Government should
work ever closer with the devolved Administration to do the best that
they can for Northern Ireland and its people. The key message from the
peace process that we should share with the world is that an end to
conflict is only the start of the peace. Along with the Irish
Government, and with the support of the European Union and the United
States Administration, we must continue to provide support and
encouragement as Northern Ireland continues to move forward. That is
our responsibility, that is our role and that is how we will build
peace, progress and prosperity in every community in Northern

Analysing it was an interesting task for the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee. I thank the Secretary of State and Minister of State for
taking on board a number of our recommendations and for considering the
other points that we made. I thank all members of the

and for the benefit of their experience, particularly of those who are
from Northern

do not want to single out one political party that gave evidence to the
Committee, but it demonstrates the considerable extent to which things
have moved on in Northern Ireland that the formal evidence session that
we held in Belfast with Sinn Fein was, as I understand it, the first
time that that political party had given public evidence to a Committee
of the House of Commons. I think that is a significant step forward. I
thank all the witnesses who gave evidence to the Committee in Belfast
and in Westminster. As those on the Front Benches have said, things in
Northern Ireland have moved on enormously.</hs_Para>

certainly beats impeding police officers in the course of their duty in
Belfast at the weekend during an Orange Order

Robertson:</Member></B> I agree entirely. It is sometimes a case of two
steps forward and one step back. I was in Belfast this morning and the
newspapers were full of that incident in which a person was injured.
Two weeks ago, members of the Committee visited Washington and spoke to
a number of people. There was an overwhelming feeling that much had
been sorted out in Northern Ireland, but the incident at the weekend,
flag protests and the murder of Mr David Black last November do nothing
to attract investment. They deter investment, and that is a tragedy. I
hope we can move forward more smoothly.</hs_Para>

great deal of progress in attracting Sinn Fein to give evidence to the
Committee. I would go further and say, as we did at the time, that it
is time that members of that party took their seats in this Parliament
so that they can come and make their case here. They claim they do the
job anyway, but they do not. They do a job, but they do not do the job
of parliamentarians, even though they accept the expenses and
allowances that go with it. We ought to be able to move forward a
little more in that respect.</hs_Para>

Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> I am sure the hon. Gentleman
shares the concern of many of us on these Benches and in the Province
that the onus is on elected representatives not only to obey the law,
but to do so in public. What we saw at the weekend was a travesty of
the law: two elected representatives, one of whom sits on the policing
board, clearly flouted the law. Does the hon. Gentleman feel that there
is an onus on elected representatives from Sinn Fein to be more
observant of the law?</hs_Para>

better place than we were. As the Secretary of State said, it is a
welcome change to be considering legislation relating to Northern
Ireland that is not a desperately urgent response to a terrible
incident. On at least a couple of occasions while I have been a Member,
the House has been recalled during the recess to consider such a matter
urgently. It is right to move things forward in a more measured way if
possible. The Committee looked at the Bill in great detail and supports
much of what it proposes. I will discuss three or four issues in my
speech, which will be fairly brief.</hs_Para>

the Committee welcomes the move towards normalisation. The objective
has to be to move Northern Ireland towards being a normal society and a
normal democracy. We have some way to go, but we are slowly getting
there. We felt that we ought to move quickly from October 2014 to full
publication of who has made donations. We understand that there is a
security issue. A number of witnesses and members of the Committee said
that there is a risk for people who stand for Parliament, Assembly or
council; for those who support them by delivering leaflets, canvassing
or putting up posters; and for those who sign nomination papers. The
question was whether donating money constitutes a different risk. We
were not persuaded that it does, so we want to see greater progress on
the publication of donations.</hs_Para>

though, that those decisions had to be taken in the light of the
security situation. We wanted the Bill to state that the Secretary of
State should consult the respective security services before taking
such a decision, but she has decided not to include that. I mention
that because although we recognise that there are problems, in
principle we want to move towards a more normal politics in Northern
Ireland in which there is less suspicion, and if everything is out in
the open, surely that is a better way forward than the way we have been
going so far. We also insisted, however, that anyone or any
organisation that made donations prior to the change or notification
that those donations would become public should remain anonymous,
because when they gave those donations, they depended on that
anonymity.</hs_Para>

the ending of dual mandates. In fact, we would go further, as has been
alluded to already. We think that Members of the Assembly should not
also be Members of the House of Lords, the European Parliament or the
Senate in the Republic of Ireland. I understand fully the points made
by the right hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson), who has left
the Chamber momentarily, about how important it was at the time for
experienced politicians to take the peace process forward in Northern
Ireland—that was certainly essential —but we have moved
on. Before the Assembly was restarted, many decisions about Northern
Ireland were taken upstairs in Committee by statutory instrument, which
was a very unsatisfactory way of governing Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

Conservative Front-Bench spokesperson, I attended many of those
sessions. The right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul
Goggins) was often the Minister. Because many Northern Ireland Members
had the additional burden of advancing the peace process in their
constituencies, many were the times when, through 
<?notus-xml column=62?>no fault of their own, not a single one of them could attend, and these
were Committees deciding very important things for Northern Ireland. It
was very unsatisfactory, but we have moved on, and people cannot be in
two places at once. There is also the potential for a conflict of
interest if somebody sits on two legislative bodies. We would have gone
further than the Government, and we would also apply the same rules to
Scotland and Wales, although I think that Wales is moving in that
direction anyway.</hs_Para>

Committee welcomed the changes to the appointment and tenure of the
Justice Minister—we feel that the Ministry should be more
secure—and the fact that taking the position will count against
the number of Ministries a party can hold, but we are a
little concerned about what will happen if agreement cannot be reached.
We urge the Government to seek a way forward when that happens. Could
the Justice Minister be appointed another way without bringing
everything down? The appointment of the Justice Minister under a
d’Hondt system might be possible, although I understand the
sensitivities around that. Nevertheless, we identified that as a
potential problem; it has not happened, and I hope it never
will, but there is a potential problem.</hs_Para>

with the Government over delaying the next Assembly elections to 2016.
We think that people in Northern Ireland are perfectly capable of
voting in two or even three elections, where necessary, and who is to
say that the general election will be held in May 2015? We have
legislated for it—although I voted against it—but who is
to say that the coalition will last that long? It might do, but who is
to say that elections will come in neat five-year terms after that? It
might be the case, but it might not, so we did not see the need to
change that arrangement, although we accepted that it was not
necessarily the main part of the Bill.</hs_Para>

discussions about government and opposition, and a number of witnesses
said that they wanted to see an opposition developing in Northern
Ireland. I think I am representing the Committee’s views
accurately here, but it is certainly my own view that we have to allow
the politicians and the people of Northern Ireland to come forward with
their own proposals and solutions to the situation. The Assembly was
created in the way it was for a reason, and we all know what that
reason was. We must bear in mind the Good Friday agreement requirements
for a shared future, and it is difficult to come up with a solution to
the problem. We recognise that there is an issue, but we feel that the
solution ought to be home grown and brought to this House in the form
of a
proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000579" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000579">We
hold a similar view on the size of the Assembly. This is not so much
about the fact that 108 Assembly Members represent 1.8 million people;
it is more about the fact that there are six Members of the Assembly
for every Westminster constituency. Again, we know why that was
done—it made the maths easier at the time—but things can
move on. We should not throw away the principles of the Belfast
agreement, but I do not see why we cannot, with consent, move forward
on certain aspects of it.</hs_Para>

collection of some of the Select Committee’s thoughts. I should
like to thank all the members of the Committee for their work and for
their proposals, and to thank the Government for listening to what we

Nigel Dodds</B> (Belfast North) (DUP):</Member> I join others in
welcoming the Bill. It has had a long gestation period, and the
previous Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the right hon. Member
for North Shropshire (Mr Paterson), who is now the Secretary of State
for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, heralded it as a normalisation
Bill. We heard about the Bill in many meetings with him and others at
the Northern Ireland Office, and we were led to believe that it would
contain all sorts of wonderful, amazing things for Northern Ireland.
Yes, it represents progress, but it is certainly not as far-reaching as
was originally envisaged. It is certainly not as ambitious as the then
Secretary of State suggested when he became the holder of that
office.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062415000582" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000582">The then
Secretary of State said many other things, too, and I shall deal with
those in a moment. One such matter was allowances for Sinn Fein
Members. We have talked about dual mandates, but the issues of
non-representation and the non-fulfilment of mandates are equally
important. The right hon. Gentleman promised that not a single
Conservative Member in this new Parliament would dream of sustaining
the position whereby Members who did not take their seats could claim
money and expenses. I hope that the House will shortly have an
opportunity to consider that matter further.</hs_Para>

fact that we are debating the Bill at a time when there is no crisis in
Northern Ireland relating to the Assembly or the Executive. On many
occasions, we have had to debate all the stages of a Bill in one day to
deal with the suspension of the Assembly, with some other crisis, or
with its reinstatement. Thankfully, those days have gone and we now
have relative stability. Indeed, we take that stability for granted.
The very fact that we are debating an extension of the current
Assembly’s term for another year, and fixed terms of five years
thereafter, is in indication of the progress that has been made. Who
would have previously imagined that we would be discussing these
proposals here today? People would have said that we were living in
fantasy land if they had been suggested before. Previous Assemblies did
not have this kind of stability, and even the current one that was set
up under the 1998 legislation did not have it until 2007. So we have a

been made in Northern Ireland, but we should not take it for granted.

of State and the shadow Secretary of State have mentioned that we are
debating these matters against the background of a propitious event.
The hosting of the G8 summit by Northern Ireland was enormously
successful, and tribute has rightly been paid to the Police Service of
Northern Ireland and the security forces in the Irish Republic and to
the help given by other British police and security services. We have
had great news, too, in recent days with announcements of significant
numbers of fantastic, good-quality, high-value jobs for Northern
Ireland. All those announcements are highly significant. As has also
been pointed out, however, major challenges remain despite the progress
that has been made. The challenge posed by dissident terrorists and
other republican groups is significant. The police and security
services deserve all our gratitude and our support—given in
material ways—to make sure that they are ready, able
and fit to combat that threat.</hs_Para>

is also crucial that the political parties in Northern Ireland’s
civic society continue to give their full support to policing, the
courts and the rule of law. One deeply disturbing issue already alluded
to in this debate is the selective approach to policing that we
have seen in recent months from Sinn Fein. We have seen its members
picketing outside police headquarters when certain people are arrested,
protesting against certain investigations and now we have seen the
incident mentioned by the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson),
the Chairman of the Select Committee, and others, in which a Sinn Fein
Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive and a Sinn Fein member of
the Policing Board, Gerry Kelly, were both seen openly obstructing
police and clambering on police vehicles at a peaceful parade held in
my Belfast North constituency last
Friday.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000586" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000586">Clearly,
there is outrage at this loutish and hooligan behaviour. It is not the
job of Assembly Members, elected representatives or members of the
Policing Board to interfere in that way in the conduct of police
operational matters. Holding the police to account is not, as Gerry
Kelly seems to think, a question of clambering on a police vehicle and
trying to stop an arrest. It is about doing the job of being a member
of the Policing Board by asking questions or coming to this House, if
elected to it, and asking questions; it is not about vandalism or the
loutish behaviour and hooliganism that we have seen. I have written to
the Chief Constable today to ask what action he is going to take to
investigate fully and ensure that action is taken against those who
engage in this kind of provocative and inciting behaviour, which could
have resulted in serious trouble. As we saw on the night, these actions
led to others getting involved in attacking the police vehicle. There
are challenges that we in Northern Ireland
face.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062415000587" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062415000587">Let

issue of political donations and loans falls into three main areas:
transparency of donors, the timetable for moving to full transparency

Northern Ireland for granting exceptions to the rules that apply to
parties in the rest of the United Kingdom. Evidence about the security
situation presented to the Select Committee in its investigation of
this Bill cannot be set to one side. That evidence has come from not
just the Unionist side, but the nationalist side and, as I mentioned in
my intervention on the Secretary of State, the independent Electoral
Commission. It shows that many brave individuals and businesses stepped
forward during the darkest of days to make donations. They took great
personal and corporate risks coming forward with donations, and their
main concern was rightly—there is evidence that when the
donations were discovered, these things did happen—that they
would suffer personal loss, a downturn in trade and, in some cases,
even physical attack. The

into being? It was brought into being so that the public—the
people who send us to this place—could have some degree of
certainty that those who gave money to political parties had a stake in
this country, and in affairs of state here. They did not want political
parties to be flooded with money from people in the United States,
Europe and elsewhere who had interests in the making of certain
decisions, but who did not vote here, represent anyone here, or have

briefly with the change in the size of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
As the Secretary of State has said, the powers will change from being
in an excepted category to being in the reserved category. The Northern
Ireland Assembly will, thus, be able to legislate, with the consent of
the Westminster Parliament, and that is right and proper. We believe
that there should be more such provisions, making it easier for the
Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate in other areas, such as its
working, the make-up of the Executive and how they are formed. Of
course, this should be done on a cross-community basis and as a result
of negotiation, agreement and a cross-community vote, but it would send
a strong signal that more of those powers are for the people and
parties in Northern Ireland to agree.</hs_Para>

Northern Ireland is over-represented, but we have 108 Members because
the parties that supported the Belfast agreement in 1998 wanted the
Assembly to be that big. We opposed that, for the reasons of
over-representation that many Members are now talking about. The choice
of six Members per constituency was a blatant attempt, once again, to
get smaller parties that were, at that stage, in favour of the Belfast
agreement into the Assembly at the expense of others. It did not work
out that way because the Northern Ireland electorate had much greater
common sense, voting for parties that would fight for change and
reform, and for a better way forward. We achieved that, which is why we
have the stability we have had since 2007.</hs_Para>

and insight. When strand 1 was negotiated, the agreement between the
Social Democratic and Labour party and the Ulster Unionist party on
that holy Thursday night or early hours of Good Friday was for a
90-Member Assembly based on five-seat constituencies. What we disagreed
on was whether there should also be a top-up, in either the first
Assembly or, possibly, the first and second Assemblies, of an
additional 10 Members that could account for smaller parties that might
be under-represented because of the spread of the vote. That idea was
not agreed by the UUP and, in the absence of agreement between us, Tony
Blair stipulated it had to be six-Member constituencies—108
Members. None of the Northern Ireland parties proposed
that.</hs_Para>

they would be phased out, in line with the recommendations made by the
independent body—I cannot remember its name, because we had so
many of these bodies at one time. That was what was said should be
done, we committed to it and it is what we are doing. The Bill’s

are Members elected to this House who do not do their jobs and do not
carry out parliamentary activity but get expenses, allowances and
money, and not just to carry out their constituency

way to the courts—European Courts—and had been defeated,
but it was introduced as a special concession because it was argued at
that time that it was necessary to bring Sinn Fein into the political
process. If anyone can argue today that Sinn Fein is not in the
political process, I would find it staggering. The time has now come
for the House to address this issue. If we are concerned about dual

reducing the number of representatives in the Legislative Assembly
should also be welcomed as there is massive
over-representation. I accept that Staffordshire has a slightly smaller
population than Northern Ireland, by 0.6 million—we have a
population of only 1.1 million—but I find it hard to justify
such over-representation in the Northern Ireland Assembly, with 108
Members, to my electorate. I am sure that a sensible number can be
reached, to which all parties can agree. We should perhaps be willing
to accept that some cages should be rattled if all parties cannot buy
into the idea of bringing the number of Members down to a more
sustainable level, whether that is 90 or 70—I will leave that to
people who are far more knowledgeable about the matter than I am. Such
a reduction will be progress. It will not only reduce the cost of
politics but make those democratic representatives more relevant. I
cannot think of a more horrendous idea than having six members of
another assembly sitting below me in my constituency—I imagine
it makes local politics a little more interesting. I am not saying that
all Northern Ireland Members would be in favour of reducing the number,
but it will make politics simpler and easier to understand. It will

have heard differing views on whether the election date should be

different years, there is not so much of a national story or a local
story. We must not underestimate the importance of a devolved Assembly
to the lives of the whole United Kingdom. As one who believes in a
united kingdom, the success of the devolved Assemblies is as important
to me as it is to those who live in Northern Ireland, Wales and
Scotland. So often, the BBC and our national press ignore stories in
the devolved Assemblies; I hope that holding all the elections together

Northern Ireland today, but we should not lull ourselves into a false
sense of security that everything in the garden is rosy and just a few
tweaks here and there will make everything perfect. Attention to
Northern Ireland from this House is needed. I believe it was the shadow

will comment on the Bill, I feel there is a need, before I do so, to
set it in context. The context is that, yes, progress has been
made—I agree with others on that—but there is a lot more
to do. The Bill is concerned with some details of the interior
decoration of a structure whose purpose and future are still being
debated. Fifteen years ago, we had the Good Friday or Belfast
agreement, and legislation followed in this House to put much of that
agenda into law. This country—indeed, the world—thought
that we had achieved the impossible and that lasting peace was
copper-fastened. Sadly, that is not quite true.</hs_Para>

wonderful to have an end to the violence and to hear almost all the
guns and almost the bombs fall silent. Hope gushed eternal from the
people who had been oppressed, smothered, injured and damaged by
violence, and they dared to dream of a life and a future, but an end to
violence was not peace in any meaningful sense. Really, it was just
what it said on the tin: it was an end to violence. Peace does not
happen; it has to be built, and when it has been built, it has to be
sustained, and it can be sustained only by people’s hope for a
better life and a better future. There is no doubt in my mind that in
1998 the people of Ireland, north and south, were voting not just for
peace, but for a better life that the peace would make
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062430000017">We
need our people to make a long-term personal investment in that peace,
and we must show them what return they will get on that personal
investment. In other words, the peace process can be sustained only if
it is followed up by a prosperity process. Unfortunately, the financial
boost required to pump-prime a prosperity process has never quite been
delivered. We have heard much talk about rebalancing our economy
towards wealth creation and away from over-reliance on public spending,
but we have seen little action other than cuts in welfare. We have had
a great debate about cutting corporation tax to put us on a level
playing field with the rest of the island of Ireland to attract serious
foreign investment, but the Treasury did not want a cut and priced it
right out of the ballpark. The economy in Northern Ireland is
fragile and the private sector small and extremely fragile. To date,
too few of our people have seen any prosperity or, indeed, any economic
benefit arrive on the back of the peace process. That is unfortunate,
because they were entitled to some economic
advance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0002.htm#13062430000018">As
a result, many people—those on the economic margins of our

former provos peddling themselves as dissidents, or loyalist

Incidentally, that protest wiped out most of our Christmas and
hospitality season and left many of our hotels, restaurants and
retailers bankrupt. Whatever the source or the excuse for disruption,
Northern Ireland has quite a way to go before we can say that
we have true peace. I am anxious that the Bill should not be taken as
some sort of a final touch on the whole process. We will not
have true peace until we have attended to all the factors that
undermine peace, including economic factors, and we will not
have it unless the sovereign Government recognise the responsibilities
they undertook back in 1998. Devolution has been used by Government as
an excuse for walking away. I repeat what the shadow Secretary of State
said: devolution should not be an excuse for disengagement.</hs_Para>

remembered that devolution in Northern Ireland is based on an
international agreement between two sovereign Governments from which
neither can walk away. The British Government have an obligation to see
the Good Friday agreement through to completion. Unfortunately, it is
still not complete. There is an obligation to act, in co-operation with
the Irish Government, to ensure that devolution is not an excuse for
stagnation. I regret to tell the House that, in terms of the special
objectives, devolution in Northern Ireland has stalled to some extent.
The two main parties have pushed the other three parties, including
mine, to the margins—they have pushed us aside and are carving
up the cake in their own self-interest, rather than the public
interest. The Prime Minister and this Government cannot turn a blind
eye any longer: they must recognise that the two-party stranglehold
within a structure that was designed to be inclusive is now preventing
that structure from achieving its

<?notus-xml column=76?>could be restrictions on Irish citizens making donations to political
parties in the north. Many of the greatest friends and supporters of
the peace process are in the south, and without their support we would
not be where we are today. Indeed, those people supported all the
parties across the north, not just one or two. I would be deeply
concerned about any perceived restrictions on donations from Irish
citizens, because something has to be realised in these
debates: we are not talking about Surrey, Sussex, Essex or, indeed,
Yorkshire. Northern Ireland is different: many of us are Irish and many
of us see ourselves as Irish. There is an ambiguity around the
settlement that we had, which has created ambiguity. Thank God for

assumed. I do not want to take up any more time, but I think I was

that should allow for some flexibility where appropriate, and clear
lines of communication between the House of Commons and the devolved

That had kicked off in 1848, with the Irish potato famine.
Today I was reminded by one of my hon. Friends that when Churchill
introduced the Bill to establish the Irish free state in 1922 he
famously remarked that despite the cataclysm of the first world war
which had swept the world, the “integrity of the quarrel”
between the people of Fermanagh was one of the few institutions that
had been unaltered. Today that situation has been transformed by peace
in a way that was barely imaginable 20 years ago, let alone in the
1920s. This month Fermanagh was not at the heart of a quarrel, but was
the home of the world’s leaders at the G8 conference at Lough
Erne. This year we are celebrating the city of culture in Londonderry,

been made at a political level in recent years, notwithstanding the
many serious issues still to be addressed, and indeed the occasional
setback, but it afforded the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee
the opportunity to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny and the
Northern Ireland parties and general public the opportunity to express

first issue I want to address is transparency on political party
donations and loans, which I have raised in the House on a number of
occasions over the past few years. Whatever the historical
arguments regarding the need to protect the identity of donors, I
firmly believe that the time to lift that veil of secrecy has passed.
The Northern Ireland public have a right to know the identity of
significant donors to political parties, as voters do in the rest of
the UK, and then to judge for themselves whether such donations
influence the decisions, policies and actions of parties. As long as
mystery surrounds that, parties will be open to the charge that they
are influenced in that way, but they will be largely unable to defend
themselves against such suspicion. Although that is disclosed to the
Electoral Commission, it is not made public, and that is key.</hs_Para>

I will briefly address each in turn. First, there is the fear of a
threat of violence against a person, their family or property as a
result of their association with a particular party becoming known.
Despite the genuine concerns expressed in that regard, there appears to
be little tangible evidence of specific targeting of donors as part of
campaigns. However, nowhere can that be entirely ruled out. Therefore,
donors should carefully consider the risk when deciding whether to
donate; it is not compulsory. Knowing that their donations will be
published will help to inform them as to which decision to
make.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000076">I
am certainly not oblivious to, or cavalier about, the risk that being
politically aligned or identified in Northern Ireland can still carry.
My party leader, David Ford MLA, who is the Justice Minister in
Northern Ireland, is likewise cognisant of the continued risks.
However, that does not insulate Northern Ireland politics from the
wider public perception that politics is organised for the
benefit of the few rather than the many. Notwithstanding any security
concerns, if we are to increase trust and confidence in the political
system, we need to maximise openness and transparency. As a result, and
despite ongoing security concerns, the Alliance party voluntarily
publishes our returns to the Electoral Commission on our website and
has done so over the past few years, and to no disadvantage. I call
again on other parties to do likewise in order to help grow confidence
in the commitment to public scrutiny, regardless of a legislative
requirement to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000077">Secondly,
in the case of business, concerns have been expressed that opponents of
a particular party might boycott a business if its owner or company are
seen to support a particular party political view. However, in 
<?notus-xml column=83?>theory the same could happen in any part of the UK. Again, it is a
matter that donors should consider carefully before donating, rather
than a reason to deny the public their right of scrutiny. In my view,
and incidentally that of Sir Christopher Kelly, as expressed in his
evidence to the Select Committee, neither risk should automatically be
given primacy over the principles that guide public life: openness,
transparency and
accountability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000078">Thirdly,
as parties are not publicly funded and therefore rely on donations to
survive, one could argue that any action that could deter donors could
restrict party political activity or even the range of choice available
to the electorate. I challenge that on two grounds. In order to stand
for election to a council, candidates need the signatures and addresses
of residents in the council area on their nomination papers, and those
are published. I am not aware of parties being unable to field
candidates, even in the worst days of the troubles, due to people being
unwilling to have that information published, despite it being a more
direct link to elected politics. People clearly weigh up those risk but
still opt to be involved, whether as candidates, canvassers,
supporters, nominees or otherwise, and there is evidence that since
1998 the public’s willingness to do so has
increased.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000079">Furthermore,
most parties have said, including in evidence to the Select Committee,
that they receive very few donations that reach the £7,500
threshold for donor names to be declared and instead are heavily
reliant on small donations from members and supporters. Even if all of
those large donations were to cease, according to their evidence that
would not have a disproportionate effect on party finances or activity
and would not jeopardise the continued functioning of our
democracy.</hs_Para>

noting, as a measure of just how opaque donor information is in
Northern Ireland, that it is against the law for the Electoral
Commission even to confirm or dispute a party’s claim that it
receives few donations of that magnitude. Such anonymised data pose no
risk to anyone and would provide considerable insight for the public
into how parties are funded and how reliant they are on a small number
of donors. I think that the move towards publishing anonymised data in
the interim, between now and October 2014, would be good preparation
for
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000081"><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="13062430000151" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000151"><B>Bob

respect to the retrospective publication of donor information, I think
that it is reasonable that where people had an expectation, even though
the letter of the law suggests otherwise, that donations they made
during the prescribed period would remain confidential even 
<?notus-xml column=84?>after the prescribed period ended, that should be honoured. Such
historical information should be published only with their express
consent, as to do so otherwise would be a fundamental breach of
trust.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000086">However,
I support the Electoral Commission’s proposal that the
expectation of anonymity should be removed from the date the Bill
receives Royal Assent, making it clear that all donations made after
that date will be subject to future publication. Whether the Secretary
of State decides that such publication should happen routinely from
October 2014, the expiry of the current prescribed period, or chooses
again to extend that period, they should be published at a subsequent
juncture. I think that that ought to be pursued in Committee, as it
adds clarity for donors in the interim and increases public confidence
without limiting the options available to the Secretary of
State.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000087">With
regard to the prescribed period and its continuation, I remain
disappointed that a firm commitment has not been given to remove
anonymity at the first possible opportunity. The Bill gives the
Secretary of State maximum flexibility specifically to increase
transparency, and I welcome the presumption in favour of publication,
but both fall short of a commitment to end the inequality that exists
between Northern Ireland residents and their counterparts in Great
Britain. I hope that the Secretary of State or the Minister of State
will be able to give some reassurance in that
regard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000088">Finally,
with regard to donations, I believe that there might be merit in
considering further whether the threshold for publication of donations
to Northern Ireland political parties should be reduced from
£7,500 to a lower figure, given the smaller income of most local
parties and the likely lower threshold at which donations may be
considered large enough to influence a party’s decision.
Clearly, that requires the striking of a very delicate balance between
the administrative burden that it would create for what are, in the
main, small organisations, and increasing transparency for the public.
Such matters are not unique to Northern Ireland, so the Bill may not be
the ideal vehicle for advancing them, but it would be helpful to
consider them at Government level in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062430000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062430000089">On
multiple mandates, I welcome the clauses that will disqualify a Member
of Parliament from also being a Member of the Assembly. I do not
believe that MPs should be permitted to continue as Members of the
Assembly. The primary argument that they should is that the fledging
Assembly structures were unstable and senior political figures who left
Westminster for the Assembly could find themselves with no mandate in
the event of a collapse. Those points no longer hold true, as the
Assembly is in its second successive, uninterrupted term, which
represents positive progress.</hs_Para>

argument advanced in favour of allowing such a dual mandate is that,
for key people in party leadership roles or holding key ministerial
positions in the devolved Assembly, the direct linkage with Parliament
can prove valuable in keeping them fully informed of developments in

the current situation.</hs_Para>

leader of the Alliance party and MP for East Belfast, it is incumbent
on me to keep abreast of developments in the devolved institutions and
keep in close contact with Assembly colleagues about the implications
of matters discussed in this Chamber and the Assembly. I do not need to
sit in both places for 
<?notus-xml column=85?>that. There are also mechanisms for the Ministers in the Executive who
are not MPs to meet their counterparts in Westminster and address
issues with them and vice-versa, and the majority fall into that
category.</hs_Para>

fulfilled the roles of MP and MLA, I strongly believe that both jobs
are at least full time and require a focus that could not be achieved
effectively with a dual mandate and consequently competing demands on
time. It is a crucial part of the role of an MLA that they should be in
Stormont to vote on legislation passing through the Assembly, to
question Ministers and to hold the Executive to account. Equally, an
MP’s work demands that they be in Westminster for a significant
and conflicting proportion of the week to scrutinise and
vote on legislation and policy, question Ministers and provide a voice
for their constituents. Although there is a considerable overlap in the
constituency casework element of both jobs, the locations and timings
make them incompatible with each other, regardless of the talent,
energy or ability of individual Members. Put simply, no
person can be in two places at once.</hs_Para>

benefit of ending dual mandates would be the creation of an opportunity

electorate to see the electoral cohort refreshed, reinvigorated and

I recognise that the House of Lords is not structured in the
same way as the Commons—its Members have no electoral mandate

for Members of the Lords. I am disappointed that currently the Bill
does not disqualify Members of the Lords from belonging to the
Assembly. Given the important role of the House of Lords as a revising
Chamber and the burden of undertaking detailed scrutiny of Government
Bills, it would be challenging for a peer who was also an MLA,

reflects the fact that many peers have careers outside Parliament, some
of which may also conflict with the sittings of the House of Lords, so
I would have been content for the measures to end dual representation
to be considered in the context of wider Lords reform, which would have
addressed remuneration and allowances at the same time. However, as
that has not been advanced and is unlikely to be in this Parliament,
the Government should revisit the possibility of action in this

move on to the structures of the Assembly. We believe that the Assembly
and parliamentary elections should be decoupled. The roles and
responsibilities of each legislature are separate and distinct, and it

the electorate should be given a full opportunity to engage in issues

propose that the number of elected representatives to be returned by
each constituency should, as a starting point, be five rather than six.
Should the number be reduced to fewer than five, there would be a risk
of imbalances in terms of how reflective of the population those

for a reduction to eight departments are a matter of record as part of
the discussions of the AER Committee at Stormont. We believe that
that, coupled with an allied reduction in Government
Departments, would lead to a reduction in the number of statutory
committees, thus not significantly increasing the burden on a smaller
number of MLAs. We would also argue that such reform would lead to no
discernible drop in the level of governance, as evidenced by the
Scottish Parliament, which has similar powers and functions to
those of the Assembly but fewer MSPs per head of population.</hs_Para>

increased transparency of donations. I commend the hon. Lady and the
Alliance party, who have been very open about this issue for a number
of years. I am glad that we are sticking to the timetable of October
2014. I urge the Secretary of State, when we get there, to implement
the measure post-haste, because we have reached a point in
Northern Ireland at which it is very important to normalise
donations and their transparency. Like everyone in the Chamber, I fully
understand that Northern Ireland is in a different situation, and has
certainly come from a very different place, but I am firmly of the view
that it is time that donations there are completely normalised and that
they become as transparent as they are in the rest of the
country.</hs_Para>

second issue is the proposal to change the process of appointment and
dismissal for Northern Ireland Justice Ministers. That is clearly a
very sensitive post. I appreciate the thought and consultation that has
gone into the Bill in this context as it will provide greater security
of tenure. The complexity around d’Hondt should provide a
discipline to the whole process that means, one hopes, that it will
never need to be implemented. It is a very practical and sensible
addition to the Bill.</hs_Para>

the challenges over the past 24 months. It is a very positive sign that

Northern Ireland is going in the right
direction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062440000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062440000005">The
right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds) flagged up the issue of
2016 and all the historical issues and challenges that we will have to
move through. He rightly pointed out that in 1916 many people from the
Ulster regiments served and died on the Somme. My grandfather served
and was wounded on the Somme. He originally hailed from County Mayo and
that fact demonstrates the complexity of the whole issue. When we get

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062440000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062440000009">Another
issue is the creation of an opposition in the Assembly, which
is concentrating the minds of the Assembly and the Executive Review
Committee at Stormont. For my sins, I am a member of that Committee and

restricted me from maintaining my representation role either there or

discussing a reduction in the size of the Assembly. Other Members have
made their position clear on that. My view, and that of my party, is
that we should be considering a much more significant
reduction—for cost purposes, if for no other reason. The
over-representation in the Assembly means that we have the almost
ludicrous situation of a population of 1.8 million being represented by
108 MLAs. We should remember 
<?notus-xml column=90?>that the salary of an MLA is £48,000, plus an
office costs expenditure allowance of £71,378—a total of
£120,000 for each MLA. It should be possible to get to the point
where we have four MLAs per constituency, making a total of 72. That
would be a significant reduction of 36, from 108 to
72.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062440000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062440000011">If
we do not agree to such a reduction in the Northern Ireland Assembly
and we make dual mandates illegal, the cost to the taxpayer will be in
the region of £100,000 per year per MLA. If a dozen MLAs were
also MPs and they stood down—thankfully we have moved beyond
that—it would cost £1 million a year every year, unless
there were a reduction in the number of MLAs at Stormont. Each of the
parties has handled the issue of dual mandates voluntarily. I made
representations to Sir Christopher Kelly about my party’s
position, which is that we will phase out dual
mandates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062440000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062440000012">Given
that the Government introduced a non-salaried role for those of us who
were in both legislatures, I would have thought that most people would
say to those who want to do a second job and not get paid for it, but

have made fleeting reference to the normality of life in Northern
Ireland and to the way in which the Bill reflects that. Over the last
few months, Londonderry has celebrated being the first ever UK city of
culture. The many celebrations over the past week have indicated the
normality that is returning not just to Londonderry, but to Northern
Ireland as a whole. We hope to demonstrate that normality more and more

difficulty in another land. In Northern Ireland we have a problem that
I have raised with the Secretary of State and her predecessors. Some

in Northern Ireland are entitled to have either passport or even both
passports if they so wish. The anomaly relates to the thousands of
people who were born in the Irish Republic after 1949, when it left the
Commonwealth, but who have lived for decades in Northern Ireland. Those
people are British. They are British by courtesy of their tax-paying
and their voting arrangements. They are British voters and British

hope that the matter will be raised at the appropriate point in the

Republic, why can people who were born in the Irish Republic, but who
have been British and have lived in the United Kingdom for decades not
have British citizenship? They demand

that it would go further, particularly in respect of Members who do not

individuals and businesses in stepping forward in dangerous and
perilous times to make donations to political parties that stood up for
justice and democracy against the forces of intimidation and terror.
Many did so at great personal and corporate risk, and their sacrifice

Northern Ireland forward to a more normalised society. We acknowledge

uncertainty involved for businesses that make public donations. Moving
too quickly to a fully open and transparent system could be detrimental

my right hon. Friend the Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds)
acknowledged, one aspect of the Bill needs greater consideration and
reflection. Individuals and bodies in the Irish Republic can donate to
parties in Northern Ireland, in contravention of the law in
that country. Indeed, it is much worse than that, because individuals
and bodies in the Republic of Ireland could be used as a front for
donations from other foreign countries. The Government must address
this matter in the Bill to ensure the integrity of donations to
political parties in Northern Ireland. If the hon. Member for Belfast
East (Naomi Long) reflects on this, she will understand that it is a
greater danger to the coffers of political parties than anything else
that the Secretary of State has been asked to do in this

Members highlighted the major issue of dual mandates, and it is a hot
political potato. I can speak with some experience, as I
entered public life 40 years ago last month when, after a local
government reorganisation in 1973, I was elected to the district
council for the area in which I live. I represented my area on the
council for thirty-seven-and-a-half years. In 1982, I was elected to
the Northern Ireland Assembly and in 1983—30 years ago last
month—I was elected to this Parliament. I have 40 years’
experience of elected office right across the spectrum—district
council, first and second Assemblies, the forum in between, and
Westminster. I noticed what the hon. Member for Belfast East said
earlier about “what the public want”. What did the public
want? The people decided that I would be elected: they decided; they
made the choice. In Assembly elections they had six possibilities, but
they chose me as number one. When it came to district council elections
there were five other candidates and I was elected first, on the top of
the poll. When it came to Westminster elections, I was elected top of
the poll. People talk about what the public want and we have to be
careful about that, but I speak with all those years of
experience in public life.</hs_Para>

remember that during those years Northern Ireland was plunged into one
of the most bloody and terrifying IRA campaigns. Many of my friends and
constituents were butchered by the provisionals. Some of those who
carried out or engineered those acts are now strutting around the
corridors of power. At that time, the law-abiding people wanted a voice
against terror to be heard, but not their voice—they were too
afraid. People were very reluctant to put their heads above the
parapet. They did not want to come forward to stand for election due to
fear and the risk—the very real risk— to their own
personal security and that of their families.</hs_Para>

dual mandates, that risk was very real. Putting my head above the
parapet meant receiving a real bomb on my 40<Sup>th</Sup> birthday from
the Provisional IRA. Coming to this House and speaking up for the
people I represent meant that 50 bullets riddled my house when my
family—my wife and my children—were just going into the
house. Every window in our house was a bullet-proof window. For 25
years, I had to drive 
<?notus-xml column=94?>around in a police car for protection. That is what it cost to be an
elected representative in this House, the Northern Ireland Assembly or
the district council. Why was I doing it? It was because others put
their trust in me and asked me to do it. They were too afraid. They had
to have a voice, however, and they were looking for one, and I was
honoured and privileged to be it. Thankfully, we have moved on, and in
fact after 37 years, although it was a wrench, I voluntarily stood down
from the council. I did not need legislation to tell me I had to stand
down from the council if I was to be in the House, and I did not need
it to tell me to stand down from the Assembly. I voluntarily stood down
from the Assembly, too, and others are now taking my place.</hs_Para>

that we bring others to this House or the other Chambers to be the
voice of the people, but never let us forget that those who had those
mandates before held them at great personal risk to their lives and
their families. When fathers left in the morning, their families did
not know whether they would be back again in the evening, so let us be
careful when we talk about those dual mandates. In 1973, when I joined
the council, what we got financially did not cover the stamps, so we
certainly were not in it for the money. I can assure hon. Members that
there were not many others offering to take our places, and what we got
certainly did not cover the petrol. We did it because we loved our
country, we loved our people, and we wanted to be their voice. It is
without apology, therefore, that I look back over those years and I

they so wish, but the situation where people do not take their seats
but are allowed to claim expenses must end. In many ways,
non-representation in the Commons is a much greater affront to
democracy than dual mandates, and the House must shortly take a
decision on this issue. I am happy to welcome many of the provisions in

Durkan</B> (Foyle) (SDLP):</Member> Like others, I am glad of the
opportunity to address several matters relating to Northern Ireland. As
other hon. Members have said, the many positive recent developments
have confirmed the benign trajectory in which Northern Ireland is
headed, thanks to the peace process and a well-embedded agreement that
gives us a broadly settled process. It has made the difference because
it allows us all to give allegiance to shared institutions for the
first time, to work through our differences and, I hope, increasingly
to work through common challenges and to do so more productively and
ambitiously than in the past.</hs_Para>

tapas Bill: there are slivers of meat in it, but there is not very much
of it. Some of it might be to some people’s taste, but less so
to others, and perhaps we are not quite sure exactly what some of it is
and must accept other people’s assurances and technical
descriptions of it. On the broad issue of political donations, like
others, I recognise that historically there have been serious
difficulties and challenges for people engaged in politics, whether by
virtue of donating, canvassing or being a party member. The hon. Member
for South Antrim (Dr McCrea) rightly pointed to the many
risks that people have taken in elected politics, and I pay tribute to
all of them, particularly those who were threatened and victimised in
very real and vicious
ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062446000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062446000003">I
extend that tribute, however, to the many people in political parties
more generally who faced such threats, challenges and various levels of
intimidation, whether in their neighbourhood or working lives. A
forthcoming book on the Glenanne gang will point out that some of its
targets were picked precisely because of their membership of, or
association with, the Social Democratic and Labour party. Of course,
that was a loyalist gang, but members of my party were also targeted by
republican paramilitaries for their own twisted reasons. I know that
many other people in many other parties have suffered the
same.</hs_Para>

true, but things are changing, including the public’s
expectations and understanding. When I was leader of my party, I said
that the then extension of the anonymity arrangements should be the
last one and that we could not keep kicking that can down the road, 
<?notus-xml column=96?>but we now appear to be granting another extension and leaving the way
open to another one after that. Hon. Members are right that the
anonymity promises on donations made in recent years should be kept,
unless people expressly say that they want their donation declared, and
I agree that there should be no retrospective revelations to which
people have not agreed. But if the public are to accept that sort of
protection for historical donations, they will want to know that there
will be a definite end to anonymity for future donations. The one
should go with the other, on a fair’s fair, everything square
basis.</hs_Para>

of donations also gives rise to a situation in which people might think
that parties have more to hide than they actually have. When I was
leader of my party, I said that the change should happen because there
was nothing for us to hide. In a small place such as Northern Ireland,
people sometimes get suspicious about donations, not only to individual
parties but to several parties. They can create suspicion in the mind
of the public that decisions are being influenced at various levels and
in various policy areas. If the threshold for publication were
significantly lowered, some people might worry that complications could
arise because they had given to a number of parties on different
occasions, or even at the same time. Those issues are going to have to
be addressed by the people and the parties concerned, however, and
people cannot be protected against that potential for embarrassment
under the guise of security sensitivities.</hs_Para>

sensitivity about donations, I know that my party colleague, Alex
Attwood, who is currently the Minister for Environment in Northern
Ireland, imposed a rule on himself and his Department that if a
planning application came in from anyone whom he was aware of
being a donor to our political party, he would declare that fact to his
officials. His officials said, “There is no official
need to do that. No one has ever thought of doing it before.”
But he has made a point of saying that it should be done because, in
some people’s eyes, the donation could be a material
consideration that may influence him and he must therefore inform his
officials. The officials can then bear the information in mind when
carrying out their work on the planning application.</hs_Para>

issue beyond the provisions in the Bill on donations and political life
in Northern Ireland. Many significant public appointments are made by
Ministers in Northern Ireland and perhaps we need to address whether
such people who are known donors to parties should be duly registered
at departmental level and open to scrutiny. These things should be
looked at beyond the level of electoral donations.</hs_Para>

question of donations from people based in the Irish Republic, I
believe that the current provision is right and equal. We have parties
in Northern Ireland that have a Unionist outlook, and those with a
nationalist outlook. We also have parties that do not frame themselves
specifically in relation to Unionism or nationalism. Within that broad
base, if people are able to collect donations and win the support and
approval of the members of the body politic throughout the United
Kingdom who regard themselves as British, I do not see why those who
regard themselves as Irish should not be able to collect donations from
the democratic body politic to which they see themselves as
belonging—that is, people living on the island of
Ireland.</hs_Para>

do not believe that the answer is to have a general ban on donations
from people living in the Irish Republic. If we were to say that anyone
living there who wanted to make a donation had to be registered on the
list of electors there, that would go some way towards strengthening
the provisions. If there are loopholes that allow moneys that would
otherwise be unacceptable to arrive in the north, and if those
loopholes are being used to “wash through” money,
mechanisms will have to be put in place to stop that happening.
Declarations would have to be made in relation to any such money. I
would have no problem with a requirement for such declarations, not
only from those giving the money to say that it was truly coming from
them and not from someone else, but from those receiving it. That would
fix minds quite clearly. That is where the responsibility should rest,

needs to be recognised that there are many people in the south whose
roots are in the north. Many of them have business and professional

the arguments for and against the dual mandate. I made my own decision

that if I was elected as an MP again, I would give up my seat in the

any longer. On that basis, I also resigned the leadership of my party,

During various negotiations and initiatives, some of us had made the
point that we 
<?notus-xml column=98?>needed to draw a line under the dual mandate. We
said that the parties needed to agree on a date or a point in the
electoral cycle when dual mandates would stop, but it was impossible to
reach agreement on that. I recall debates in the Assembly in which the
Democratic Unionist party voted against any such move against dual
mandates. It praised them, saying that they were the best thing since
sliced bread and that they were saving us money. Then, in the wake of
the pressures resulting from the expenses scandal, the DUP suddenly
started playing leapfrog over the rest of us. It suddenly wanted to get
rid of dual mandates, too. In many ways it hid behind the Kelly
recommendations, saying that if an outlying date of 2015 were set, that

the dual mandate could be justified by the uncertain circumstances that
existed in Northern Ireland. Indeed, it is arguable that many people
were able to do great work carrying dual mandates, not least John Hume
and Ian Paisley when they were in this House and in the European
Parliament. Along with their Ulster Unionist colleague, they were able
to do productive and effective work in Europe and to bring home
significant benefits. As with the question of openness over donations,
however, public expectations have moved on. People can see that
circumstances and standards have changed. Change changes things. That

is, rightly, set on dual mandates in this House, the Bill should also
make provision for that in respect of any possible membership of Dail
Eireann. Any such provision should apply not only to MPs but to
Teachtai Dala. It would be right to extend that to Members of the House
of Lords and to Members of Seanad Eireann as well. If the rule
specifies membership of one legislative chamber and one only, it should
apply regardless. I agree with the hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi
Long) that that should apply whether or not the proposed abolition of
Seanad Eireann goes ahead. I hope it does not; I would much prefer to
see reform of that good constitutional tool. The fact is that people
should be members of one legislative chamber and one

to the size of the Assembly, I made the point in an intervention that
the position on which parties were negotiating at the stage when we
negotiated the agreement was broadly based on a 90-member Assembly,
with five Members for each of the parliamentary constituencies. It was
not the case that it was a matter of principle that we wanted the
Assembly elected from the existing parliamentary constituencies. The
point was that if we were going to get an Assembly established on the
back of an agreement, it had to be on the basis of some existing
constituencies, and the parliamentary constituencies were obviously the
available and relevant ones.</hs_Para>

Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011 creates
five-year parliamentary boundary reviews, but I think that will cause
problems, not just in respect of the potential impact of boundary
reviews in parliamentary terms, but in Assembly terms, too. What might
appear to be a small change in a constituency in parliamentary terms
could be very significant for Assembly members. Somebody’s
well-established Assembly bailiwick could be directly split in a way
that might appear marginal to the parliamentary constituency, so I
think there are difficulties there. I know that there has been 
<?notus-xml column=99?>some discussion in the Assembly and Executive Review Committee about
whether the Assembly still needs to rely on or stick to absolute
coterminocity of Assembly and parliamentary constituencies for the long
term. If we end up having a difficult experience from five-year
boundary reviews—I hope this will be revised in the future so
that we can move to something more sensible than having reviews for
every single Parliament—the Assembly might well be advised to
consider something different.</hs_Para>

on the number of Members was, as I said, five for each constituency.
If, under the boundary reviews, the number of constituencies is
reduced, that will obviously reduce the number of Members in the
Assembly in turn. In the context of previous negotiations, including
those in Leeds castle and elsewhere where there were reviews and half
reviews on the agreement, the SDLP put forward its views, but there
were no takers for the changes, just as when we offered proposals to
improve the transparency of the Assembly and to make it a bit more
robust as a chamber of accountability.</hs_Para>

who talk most about transparency and accountability resisted. I
remember Peter Robinson saying at Leeds castle, “Well, we do not
want that much accountability.” The proposals did not even go as
far as saying that there should be a formal opposition in the Assembly,
but sought to ensure that there were ways of holding Ministers
to account to the Assembly. One way of doing that was that after
budgets, all Ministers would make statements on what they were planning
to do with the moneys allocated to them rather than hide behind one
statement by the Minister of
Finance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062446000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062446000023">As
other hon. Members have said, the question of opposition is important.
When we negotiated the agreement, just as we were clear that the
Government would be inclusive for those parties that wished to exercise
the right to take their mandate into ministerial office, so, too, the
scrutiny and accountability role of the Assembly had to be inclusive.
Some of us, perhaps naively, envisaged that members of the
Ministers’ own parties would challenge them and put questions to
them; unfortunately, that is not what we have. Anyone looking at the
Parliament channel, for example, is likely to see question time and
debates, and there are more plants than at a garden centre! It is not

discussion that many people are having is important. What it reflects
is not necessarily the absolute need for an opposition that some have
seized on; it is more a feeling that there is not enough challenge,
scrutiny or debate. Some people think that real debate ends up falling
to “The Nolan Show” or other talk-back radio programmes,
but questioning and challenging decisions should be taking place in the
committees of the Assembly and on its floor. We should have other types
of committee —more cross-cutting committees, for example, with
the sort of teeth that the Public Accounts Committee has. They might be
rated more highly not just by Ministers but by civil servants than they
are under the current committee model. As other hon. Members have said,
there are a number of things that we can look at.</hs_Para>

the appointment of the Justice Minister, we recognise that there are a
number of anomalies. The proposed changes seem neatly to answer the
problem of the d’Hondt excess enjoyed by one party, which goes
against the proportionality provisions and the inclusion promise of the
agreement. I fear that in resolving the anomaly in the proposed way,
however, we will end up creating a predicament for the system and
potentially for a party that could find itself typecast, particularly
through the role of the Justice Minister, in ways that might well prove
frustrating in the future. Other parties might find that frustrating or
might abuse their sense of frustration. We need to be careful that in
fixing one problem, we do not create another problem for the long term

Long:</Member></B> As my party provides the Justice Minister in the
current arrangements, I understand the hon. Gentleman’s point.
The arrangements being put in place here would apply equally to any
party, and the anomaly would apply regardless of which party provided
the Justice Minister. The fix, as it were, would apply regardless, too.
I do not think that anybody is typecast in that sense. I
would also take issue with the him about what counts as normal. I
happen not to think that using d’Hondt to appoint Ministers is
normal; it is actually a mechanism to deal with division, which is
abnormal. I would not want to move in that direction; I would prefer
the other Ministry to move towards cross-community

Durkan:</Member></B> I note the hon. Lady’s point of view, but
it is not the one from which I come to this debate. I was involved in
the negotiation and drafting of parts of the agreement, not least in
respect of strand 1. I would certainly defend the understanding and
agreement that we secured then, but I would never pretend that we are
stuck with it or that we can never adjust or change it. I certainly
recognise that when it comes to the institutions and the fundamental
architecture we have to see differences between fixtures and fittings.
That is why review mechanisms were built into the agreement and why my
own party has proposed changes and developments in a number of
reviews—and we would certainly envisage more in the future. They
should all be based, however, on the firm and clear foundations of
inclusion that are guaranteed in the
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062446000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062446000028">On
the issue of the Justice Ministry, I was not saying that it is a given
and that it will always go to the Alliance party; I was simply stating
a caution, in case things end up being that way. We know all the
reasons why the Ministry ended up with an Alliance party member on the
first and second occasions. What I am saying is simply a point of
caution in that regard.</hs_Para>

to electing other Ministers by cross-community support, I am
disappointed that the Bill does not take the opportunity to restore
something that was in the Good Friday agreement—that the First
and Deputy First Minister should be elected jointly by cross-community
support. That was in the Good Friday agreement, and it was important
that the administration of the Executive would be headed and chaired by
people who had a mandate from the Assembly and were accountable to it.
Instead, what we have is a system whereby those two positions are
simply appointed from their respective parties by a letter, which goes
to the Speaker. That is not the right and proper way to do
this.</hs_Para>

change in how the First and Deputy First Minister were
appointed—no longer elected by the Assembly but simply appointed
by their own parties—was a result of a so-called comprehensive
agreement in December 2004 between Sinn Fein, the DUP and the British
and Irish Governments to create a new rule whereby parties could only
appoint Ministers if those parties voted for the First and Deputy First
Minister. The agreement was published, but because there were not
photographs in relation to decommissioning, and people were using
language about sackcloth and ashes, it did not stick. However, it
remained the desired outcome of Sinn Fein, the DUP and the British and
Irish Governments until the very day of the St Andrews talks that
parties could only be included in government if they voted for the
First and Deputy First Minister. That was a complete violation of the
basic principle in the Good Friday agreement—the promise of
democratic inclusion. The DUP was able to appoint Ministers without
having voted for Seamus Mallon or David Trimble; they were able to vote
against David Trimble and me, but it did not preclude their holding
ministerial office, and rightly so, because that was the promise in the
agreement. Similarly, Sinn Fein were able to abstain on the election of
the First and Deputy First Minister and still hold ministerial office.
The DUP and Sinn Fein, however, were prepared to say that the SDLP, the
UUP and, if it qualified, the Alliance party, could only take
Ministries if we voted for the First and Deputy First Minister. We
would have to submit our mandate to them; we would not even be allowed
the right of abstention.</hs_Para>

people who would be excluded from office under the agreement, under a
Labour Government, were those in the SDLP, not for having committed any
crimes or transgression, whether in office, in terms of standards in
public life or breaching commitments to peace and non-violence, but
simply because we were prepared to exercise our democratic right to
abstain on the election of those from other parties. Only because the
DUP got the message from us clearly in a meeting upstairs in a
Committee Room, on the morning we were all flying to St Andrews, that
we would not be voting for them, and we understood that the UUP would
not be voting for them, so the DUP would be in the Lobby voting on
their own with Sinn Fein—the very thing they wanted to
prevent—to elect Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness, and only
because we stuck to our threat did the DUP scramble to get a different
basis whereby people would be appointed to ministerial office by a
letter to the Speaker.</hs_Para>

not returning to the agreement in the Bill? Things seem to be bedded
down quite well now between Sinn Fein and the DUP—they seem
quite happy to go through the Lobby together on lots of things, whether
it is to force through future local government boundaries that suit
them, or anything else. If they can use their muscle or mandate
together in those respects, why should they not be able to do it in
relation to electing the First and Deputy First Minister as originally
provided for in the
agreement?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062446000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062446000033">In
relation to local government boundaries, Sinn Fein and the
DUP put through a Bill a couple of years ago for the appointment of a
boundary commissioner, but the Bill actually fixed the boundaries, and
all the boundary commissioner could do was pick the names of the
councils and make recommendations around some of the wards. The Bill
contains other welcome measures, 
<?notus-xml column=102?>on the face of it, to transfer further powers in relation to electoral
matters, to change their reserved status, and to give more latitude,
potentially, to the Assembly, but we need to register some caution.
Decisions that can be taken at Assembly level can essentially be taken
by Sinn Fein and the DUP themselves, so we need to be careful about a
significant reduction in the size of the Assembly that would mean fewer
than five Members per constituency, which will affect proportionality,
democratic opportunity and fairness, and about other changes in
relation to electoral
matters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062446000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062446000034">Northern
Ireland began with a Parliament set up after partition, and there was
proportional representation. One of the first decisions taken was to
remove proportional representation in local government, and then to
remove proportional representation for the Parliament itself. The rot
set in, and the difficulties came from there. If we get to a situation
where everybody else’s democratic opportunity is dependent on
the decisions of Sinn Fein and the DUP, to borrow from the late, great
Paddy O’Hanlon, that is a bit like asking Attila the Hun to mind
your horse. We are asking for trouble if we just say, “It will
be up to them.” We ought perhaps to consider ensuring that the
Electoral Commission has a bigger, stronger and more defined role in
relation to such matters, rather than leaving them to the Executive
level and to some parties in particular.</hs_Para>

other powers being fully exercised in Northern Ireland. Nobody has

of State overwhelmed by consultees pressing for the extension of the
life of the current Northern Ireland Assembly? No; that is not the
answer either. Several political parties, including my own—the
SDLP—and the Ulster Unionists, as well as the Green party,
Conservatives and others, were emphatically against this
anti-democratic proposal. The DUP and the Alliance were in favour of

the Secretary of State might say that a combination of the DUP, Sinn

embarked on her consultation; she knew then that the leaders of those
three parties all wanted to extend the life of the Assembly. Indeed,
elsewhere in this Bill there are provisions aimed at correcting the
anti-democratic nature of the Minister for Justice’s current
position, which has already been referred to by the hon. Member for
Belfast East (Naomi Long) and my hon. Friend the Member for

addition, the CBI expressed concern in its consultation response that,
at the end of a four-year programme for government, an additional year
could just be a year of unproductive drift. Indeed, the proposal to
extend the term takes little account of the very significant public
disbenefits of moving to 2016, such as having the election so close to
the 100th anniversary of the Easter rising, when certain political
extremists will try to raise, and then exploit, community tensions on
the nationalist side. There are also sinister elements in loyalism that
will try to do the same around the important world war one centenaries.
That is not a great time to have an election for a fixed five-year term

with no “large measure” of agreement and no
“public benefit”, what could have made the Secretary of
State change her mind? Could it have been the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee? After all, the views of the Committee on Standards in Public
Life were given considerable weight in the Bill’s provisions on
double-jobbing. No, however, it is not the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee, because, as its Chairman, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr
Robertson), said earlier, it did not support the proposal to extend the
term either. Indeed, when the Secretary of State met the Committee in
March this year, she
stated:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13062446000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062446000093">“But
it is quite an unusual thing to do, and we would have to be clear about

even as late as March this year, the Secretary of State seemed to have
no appetite for extending the term of the Northern Ireland Assembly,
yet by 9 May, when this Bill was published with the explanatory
document, all of that had changed. All of the consultation responses
and the Secretary of State’s own decision criteria had been cast
aside in just a few short weeks. What changed the mind of the Secretary
of State remains a mystery, and it is a mystery that she must unlock;
indeed, the Minister must unlock it here tonight, and it will need to
be explored further in Committee.</hs_Para>

decision to extend the Assembly term is an atrocious anti-democratic,
and potentially dangerous, development, and flies in the face of most
of what the Secretary of State has ever said on the issue. I can find
no rational explanation for the change of heart in the Command Paper
that was a response to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report.
The Government do not provide much enlightenment in unlocking the
mystery, except that they wish to be consistent with Scotland and Wales
in extending the terms of the existing mandates. The Government and
Secretary of State have ignored a vital point, however: that the people
of Wales and Scotland were aware of the change to the fixed-term
mandate before casting their votes in May 2011. The position in
Northern Ireland was totally different. The people of Northern Ireland
were not involved in this, and they voted for a four-year mandate. The
only person who could do something to overrule the Secretary
of State is the Prime Minister himself. Is a prime ministerial
intervention the answer to our mystery?</hs_Para>

to the Minister, who will be responding to the debate: how often, and
when, did he and the Secretary of State discuss this matter with the
Prime Minister? Did the Prime Minister direct the Secretary of State to
concede the Assembly’s term extension to those who lobbied him
for it? And we know who lobbied him for it: the DUP, Sinn Fein and the
Alliance party. If he did, what explanation did he give? Can the
Secretary of State, or the Minister of State, as it will be in this
instance, tell me what impact this sordid U-turn had on the credibility
of the Northern Ireland Office and will have on any future NIO
consultations? What faith will the people of Northern Ireland have in
such consultations? The NIO and the Secretary of State must never
forget that she and her equivalent in the Irish Government are
the custodians of the Good Friday agreement. <I>[Interruption.]</I>
This is no laughing matter, because when we went to vote in the
Assembly elections in 2011 we voted for a four-year mandate, so the
people will feel duped. Given the weight of evidence against the
extension of the Assembly’s term, surely there is some way in
which the Government will be prepared to reconsider this fundamentally
anti-democratic measure. Obviously we look forward to discussing the
issue further in Committee—or perhaps we should start lobbying
the Prime Minister.</hs_Para>

social housing location in Northern Ireland. Above all, the unfinished

November 2003, I believe. Mathematics was not my strongest subject at

going on with the Ulster Unionist party and Sinn Fein. They need the

Let us not hear this drivel about how it is somehow undemocratic in

extended, the term of the Assembly was extended by fiat of the Northern

Dodds:</Member></B> Given that these points were made so strongly by
the hon. Member for South Down (Ms Ritchie), it is right
that we get the facts right. As for local government, this is not
ancient history. Only in the last mandate, the term of local government
was extended from elections in 2009 to elections in 2011, so that
instead of serving four years, councillors had six years. The SDLP did
not object—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> It did not

precisely the point that I have been making: when it is politically
advantageous for members of the SDLP to do something, principle does
not come into it, but when they consider themselves potentially
disadvantaged—I am not sure why they feel they in particular
would be disadvantaged by this provision of the Bill—all of a
sudden, they find a principle on which to take a stand. Well, we are
not into revisionism. Madam Deputy Speaker, if you study the
psychology of Northern Ireland, you will find that there are
two different approaches to history: there is the revisionist approach,
where you rewrite the facts to suit your argument, depending on where
you are standing at the time; and then there is the approach that says
that what is fact is fact, and it should be recorded as fact. On this
issue—</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="13062456000297" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000297">Mark

Donaldson:</Member></B> I think I have given way enough. The SDLP is
backpedalling furiously on this issue. SDLP Members know the reality:
they have decided to make a point on the Bill tonight, but it is a
bogus point—one on which their own record, when it is subjected
to scrutiny, does not stand up for a
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000027">Today,
we have heard from the leader of the SDLP about the need to make
progress towards reconciliation. On this point, we are agreed: we do
need to make progress towards reconciliation; we do need to address the
issues of the past. I too was struck by the comments made by young
Hannah Nelson last week at the Waterfront hall. She said, yes, we have
a past and we most certainly cannot forget what happened in the past.
We must acknowledge the hurt and the pain suffered during those dark,
dark years of the troubles, and the victims need to be acknowledged and
recognised. But we also want to help to move Northern Ireland forward.
I really do not think it is helpful when during efforts to move
Northern Ireland forward and to get a discourse, a dialogue, going
about how to deal with those matters, people resort to old insults such
as, “All you lot are bigots.” That really does not
engender the sort of political climate we need to make progress on
reconciliation. What must the young people of south Belfast be thinking
this evening, when their Member of Parliament stands up in the House
and describes the leading party of one side of the community in
Northern Ireland as a bunch of bigots? Is that conducive to the kind of
reconciliation that the hon. Member for Belfast South (Dr McDonnell)
claims he wants to achieve?</hs_Para>

help towards reconciliation is having political parties that posture on
the one hand as being the moderate voice and, at the same time, take
actions that can have only one effect, which is to cause hurt and pain
on the other side of the political divide in Northern Ireland. That is
why I challenged the hon. Gentleman on the point about reconciliation.
It does not help when, in Newry and Mourne district council,
councillors from his party support the renaming of a children’s
play park in Newry after a dead IRA terrorist—and not just any
dead IRA terrorist but a terrorist who was convicted of a number of
offences, including possession of a weapon, which was used in the
murder of 10 Protestants in Kingsmill in south Armagh.</hs_Para>

think that a progressive party that claims to be a moderating voice and
which wants to promote reconciliation might reflect for a moment on the
fact that supporting the naming of a children’s play park after
someone with such a record might be offensive to a section of
our community, and might cause hurt to the families of those killed in
the Kingsmill massacre. It might be a retrograde step for our wish to
move Northern Ireland beyond the dark days that we witnessed

Durkan:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman rightly speaks
passionately about the feelings in this instance of the relatives of
those who were murdered in such a vicious, sectarian way at Kingsmill.
I have been on the record, as have party colleagues, both publicly and
privately, in saying that we thought what our councillors did at that
time was a mistake. I have subsequently been advised by those
councillors that this was not the first naming of the park—it
was named 10 years ago, and the vote was simply to confirm the original
decision. When the decision was first made, no objections were 
<?notus-xml column=112?>made by any Unionist councillor present, and the vote that my party
colleagues supported was also a vote for a procedure that would ensure
that it could not happen in future—nothing could be named in
such a way again. I fully accept his criticism, but I urge him to look

the important point that he has made in relation to the relatives of

welcome most of the Bill’s provisions. However, we will want to
table a number of amendments in Committee. The past few years have been
difficult and challenging. As the Secretary of State said—and
she was echoed by the hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon
Coaker)—the Bill, and the manner of the Bill, represent a mark
of progress. We are beginning to deal with issues that one might
describe as reasonably normal. Nevertheless, there is a legacy that we

of the legacy.</hs_Para>

my right hon. and hon. Friends, I have not always regarded elements of
the peace process as something we could fully embrace. It has been

have caused people a lot of pain and hurt, not least the early release

there is one aspect that goes to the heart of the sense of injustice
felt by many victims in Northern Ireland on both sides of the
community. I am disappointed that the Bill has not yet provided us with
an opportunity to address this and I think it ought to do so. That
relates to the definition of a victim. In Northern Ireland at
present—this is hard to believe, but it is true—a victim
of the conflict, if I may use that term, is defined as anyone, no
matter who or what they were, who lost their life in the course of the
troubles.</hs_Para>

consider that for a moment. It includes, in effect, the people who
pulled the trigger, who wore the balaclavas, who were members of
illegal organisations, who planted the bombs and who skulked in the
shadows if they lost their lives, sometimes through their own
actions—killed by their own bomb, as in the case, for example,
of Thomas Begley in the Shankill bombing in the constituency of my
right hon. Friend the Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds). Thomas
Begley blew himself up with his own bomb and murdered nine—I

Long:</Member></B> The current definition of a victim is a very
sensitive issue and I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it is
something that we need to discuss, but I take issue with what he
suggests. The definition of a victim ensures that the needs of everyone
who is a victim—for example, the mother of the bomber, who may
have suffered real pain and grief, in the same way as the husband of an
innocent person who was blown up—are addressed in the same way.
What it does not do and what it should not do is create moral
equivalence between the two people. We have to be careful how we treat
individuals who have suffered, but accept that the definition does not
create a moral equivalence, because it should not and it does
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000041"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Donaldson" PimsId="2989" UID="13062456000304" xid="173" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000304">Mr
Donaldson:</Member></B> The problem is that it creates a legal
equivalence. That is the difficulty we have. When it comes to
administering victims services—I was the victims Minister in the
Northern Ireland Executive for a time—it creates a problem. When
I was a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly I introduced a private
Member’s Bill to change the definition of a victim, and I hear
the point that the hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi Long) is making
but, for me, the person who was engaged in a terrorist act when he or
she lost their life ought not to be legally equated, even if in our
minds they are not morally equated, with their innocent victims. I
believe that is a matter for Parliament to address, which is why in
considering the Bill we will want to explore it further with the
Government. I am not convinced that there will be the circumstances in
which we can get a political consensus in Northern Ireland on the
definition of a victim, simply because of the nature of the parties we
are dealing
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000042">The
hon. Member for Belfast East talked about moral equivalence. I believe
that Parliament has a moral responsibility to examine this issue, for
the victims back home in Northern Ireland and indeed the victims here.
I have talked with victims of bombings in Belfast and met
victims’ groups here in London. I have met people who lost loved
ones or were badly injured, for example in the Canary Wharf bomb, and
they feel the same way. They do not believe that there should be this
legal
equivalence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000043">In

celebrate her birthday, which is today, she probably had in mind some
clubbing in Coatbridge, rather than sitting here for the Second Reading
of the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. However, I
like to think that the evening she has spent in our company has been
rewarding. I have no doubt that the whole House will join me in wishing

her.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000045">I
think that those who gently denigrated the Bill as some sort of
sweeping-up Bill, portmanteau Bill or bits-and-pieces Bill missed the
fact that crucially important business has been discussed here tonight.
As we heard in the last speech, some of the most important issues we
ever discuss in the House have been heard on the Floor tonight. I pay
tribute to the Secretary of State for the calm, sensible, serious and,
above all, positive way in which she introduced the debate, and she was
optimistic where optimism could be justified. I think that it was a
first-class presentation that set the tone.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker), whom we must now call
the senior shadow Secretary of State, as we have new categories, spoke
marvellously. Listening to him speak about his adventures, and from the
number of times he appears in Northern Ireland, one might wonder
whether there are not dozens of doppelgangers, or Coaker clones,
because how else could he be in so many places at the same time? I
think that we are simply fortunate that there is just one of him, but
one with an enormous amount of energy. His comments about the Theatre
of Witness production of “From the Rubble” at St
Ethelburga’s church were extremely well made, and we should all
listen to that and perhaps see it ourselves. He also mentioned the
National Crime Agency, as a number of Members did later, which I think
is one of the many aspects that will be discussed in Committee, for
there is much business to be done
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0003.htm#13062456000047">The

as the next person to hear the great former leader of our nation
mentioned on the Floor of the

worryingly, the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr Campbell) started
to go into a cost-benefit analysis of representatives. A few Members
looked a little anxious as he went down the various costs, values and
benefits. When he then whipped from his pocket a series of multiple
passports, we wondered whether he was supplementing his income with a
bit of printing on the side. However, we all know that the hon.

superb speeches from the hon. Gentleman and tonight’s was
absolutely magnificent. He talked about moving at a proper pace, which
is very important. We must realise that we cannot achieve everything
overnight. He also talked about the increase in employment,
particularly high-skilled employment, in his constituency. He then
mentioned his proud history of topping the poll over 40 years in
multi-Member constituencies. I am a great admirer of the hon.

will do my best to keep to 10 minutes, Madam Deputy Speaker. I thank
the Backbench Business Committee for putting this subject forward for
debate today. One of the main reasons that I wanted this subject to
come before the House was so that I could set out the business reasons
for careers advice. There is a major boom in manufacturing that is
being put in doubt by a lack of skills and the age profile of the
people working in the industry. I will provide some statistics relating
to my constituency of Burnley. Cities Outlook 2013 placed Burnley 10th
in the country for private sector job growth: growth of 3.5% in the
past 18 months against an average of 1%. That is a remarkable
recovery, and it happened because we are a manufacturing town. Burnley
has climbed 16 places to 22nd out of 63 UK cities in the recovery from
recession, and is rated as No. 1 out of 63 cities for the proportion of
jobs in manufacturing. We are one of the top manufacturing towns in the
country.</hs_Para>

“You’re far too clever to be an engineer. You should be a
doctor or a lawyer.” She said, “Well, I can’t
stand the sight of blood and the last thing I want to be is a
lawyer.” She got a job as an apprentice at BAE Systems at Warton

second example is of a young gentleman who went to college in Chester.
When he left Chester, he went to Oxford. He was at Oxford university
for three months and hated it—he thought it was a complete waste
of time and that he was spending money for no return—so he left
and got a job as an apprentice at Airbus. When he had served his time
at Airbus, the company sent him to university, and he is now a section
leader with Airbus. He was pleased to tell me that he had just bought a

pick up his Oxford friends and take them out for a drink. He had been
earning while learning—that is our new apprentice

of careers advice is required from age 11, but what can we do about it?
What careers advice is being offered in our schools? I suggest it is
minimal. It is minimal because many of the people giving it have only
ever been teachers and unfortunately have never been in the
workplace—there are jobs, particularly in Burnley, they do not
even know exist. There is light on the horizon, however: there is a
company in Burnley called Positive Footprints. A young lady called
Lesley Burrows, 
<?notus-xml column=122?>along with three of her friends, Josh, Lynne and Sarah-Jane, set up this
company. She is working in a couple of schools where she has set up a
virtual jobcentre. From age 11, every time a child comes to school,
they will walk through a jobcentre in which are displayed every job
available in Burnley and the surrounding area. Those young people can
see what is available and can approach one of these four people and ask
them, “What is this job?” Positive Footprints can then
advise them on what the job is and the child can decide whether they
fancy doing it. When they reach 14, they can apply for one of the jobs,
so Positive Footprints will show them how to apply for a job, how to
write a CV, how to get a reference and so on. And if they really fancy
that career, they can speak to the company and ask whether they can go
and see what it does. In that way, the young person can be aware of
what the job involves. That is the right way forward, and I see no
reason why the Government should not adopt such a system to show young
people what the future holds.</hs_Para>

calling me to speak in this important debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. It
is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Burnley (Gordon

my interest in these matters stems principally from my role in

current economic climate, in which all sides agree that youth
unemployment is still unacceptably high, it follows that the issue we
are discussing is of paramount importance. Governments of any political
make-up have a duty of care to ensure that young people are given the
best possible opportunities. Careers advice in the UK, however, is
extremely patchy, often of poor quality and frequently both. The
problem has not been improved by some of the reforms that the
Government have introduced.</hs_Para>

time available, my aim is to outline the two main areas where I feel
careers advice is suffering: first, the fundamental lack of consistency
in the offer of careers guidance to students up and down the country;
and, secondly, the concerns that I and, I know, many employers have
about the quality and standard of careers guidance as it relates to the
needs of our economy. I will conclude by offering suggestions about
what the Government could do to reverse this worrying
trend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000111">The
first area where I believe problems of careers advice lie is the fact
that it is often not delivered. One of the conclusions in the Education
Committee’s report, “Careers guidance for young people:

year, was:</hs_Para>

of Tameside, where my constituency is based, Government cuts to local
authority budgets have meant that careers advice and guidance services
for young people have been fundamentally slashed—first by 65%,
and then a year later by a further 50%. The effects are already
becoming clear, as a recent study by the Education and Employers
Taskforce showed: 12 to 16-year-olds have widely mismatched job
ambitions, with a clear lack of understanding of what jobs are out
there, of how to get them, and of the pay and expectations that go with
them.</hs_Para>

second point is about the quality and standard of careers advice,
particularly with regard to the needs of employers. As a vice-chair of
the associate parliamentary manufacturing group, I hear from many
manufacturing companies that feel that young people have little
or no understanding of their sector or their employability
needs. Those points were vividly illustrated by the hon. Member for
Burnley. Only recently, John Cridland told the Government that careers
advice is on “life support”, and that not enough was
being done to help youngsters in a rapidly changing job
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000117">It

Reynolds:</Member></B> I would like to see a number of specific things
applied to all aspects of career advice. In manufacturing, one of the
principal things to change is the perception. I find it incredible that
some people still believe that manufacturing is somehow a dirty
industry and not the high-tech example that we see in BAE Systems.
Challenging gender stereotypes is another highly important issue for
manufacturing. What may be harder to achieve is getting it across to
people that while BAE Systems and similar companies are important, it
is the associated supply chain that really generates the 
<?notus-xml column=125?>wealth and the opportunity for jobs. My constituency
predominantly has companies of that sort; it would be valuable if we
could get more information out about the success of those companies,

more action is needed to support such overarching themes and changes.

12 to 16-year-olds appears to be in emergency care. We often hear about
the danger of a lost generation, and the not in education, employment

readily available careers advice, appropriately matched to the needs of
our economy, is absolutely vital. All is not lost, however; the
Government can do a lot to remedy the situation. They do appear to be
listening, and they have accepted that there is more to do,
particularly in helping local authorities meet their statutory needs. A
more fundamental change of attitude is needed, however, so that careers
advice is not seen as an afterthought, but is at the heart of a
child’s education—I agreed with the Minister’s

people have embraced new technologies and new approaches to gathering

securing this important debate. He spoke brilliantly and passionately
about rebalancing the economy and how that might be undermined by
skills shortages, with particular reference to the aerospace industry
and the question of a gender divide and the number of young female
engineers. I take on board, too, his point about the challenge of
providing careers advice in schools. That is why the Opposition thought
it was an error to take £200 million out of the previous career

into
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000143">My
hon. Friend the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds)
spoke brilliantly about patchy careers advice and the effect that can

Committee, which said it was regrettable that the careers advice
function had been moved into schools. He spoke, too, of the axing of
dedicated careers services. We have seen that right across the piece,
which is why this debate is so important. The Government careers policy
is directly opposed to everything the hon. Member for
Burnley seeks to put in place to rebalance our economy. My hon. Friend
also spoke very well about the mismatching of jobs to ambitions. We
should also note the comments of the Government social mobility tsar,
Alan Milburn, about young people not doing the right A-levels, and then
seeking to go to university with very good grades only to find that
they have been poorly advised as to what degree to
pursue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000144">The
hon. Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley) drew on his career in
business to argue strongly for a more business-focused careers

is hopeful that the destination measures will provide some degree of
clarity. He contrasted the business GCSE with the drama GCSE, but that
was a little unfair, I think, as one of the great business strengths of
modern Britain is our drama industry—our cinematic and
theatrical industries. He was right, however, to urge that business
advocacy in
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000145">The

argued that bringing careers guidance into schools has crippled
potential pathways to technical and vocational education for many
students. While the academic route of following GCSE, A-level
and then maybe a degree is clearly understood by many teachers,
providing more specific advice about vocational qualifications,
traineeships and apprenticeships, and how to marry that with a level 3
qualification, takes real knowledge and understanding of the system,
which those who are asked to advise in schools might not possess. If we
want greater achievement in our technical and vocational sector, we
need to get talent into those quarters. Moreover, it is simply not in
the interests of schools to outline alternative routes, and for
a 
<?notus-xml column=129?>Conservative-led Government usually so attuned to the threat of producer
interest, the allocation of careers advice to schools has been an own
goal. Very few schools have the bravery to explain to their pupils the
full diversity of further education and vocational pathways while the
loss of their pupils’ funding stream is at stake. We recently
heard evidence from an excellent teacher from one of the Harris
academies, who said, “We bring in outside external guidance and
we tell them to tell our pupils that they cannot go to the college up
the road. We have no interest in losing those funding streams.”
What we then lose as a country is the capacity to go down vocational
and technical routes that are more complicated to pursue.</hs_Para>

troubled not only by the impartiality aspect, but by issues of funding,
insufficient practical guidance, a poorly defined approach to how we
share best practice, a capabilities deficit and an accountability
regime that is nowhere near robust enough. We look forward to the

the Labour party acknowledges that in the current fiscal climate it is
not appropriate to provide additional funding, but the Government
should not present the withdrawal of the £200 million that used
to fund careers advice as consequence-free. Schools have each faced a
£25,000 stealth cut as a result of this money not being
transferred along with the statutory duty. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Stalybridge and Hyde suggested, we need to know what actions the
Minister is taking to provide guidance and support, and to disseminate
best practice. As I understand it, head teachers have to know the names
and addresses of CORGI-registered boiler technicians for their schools,
but they have no guidance about or lists of qualified careers advisers.
Head teachers can fix the boiler but when it comes to their
pupils’ careers they are not necessarily given the right amount

have identified skills shortages, particularly in that area. One thing
I am passionate about is promoting mathematics, the subject with the
highest earnings premium at A-level, at degree level and beyond. One of
this Government’s aims is to ensure that within a decade the
vast majority of students will be studying the subject to 18. At the

secondary school; the evidence suggests that many children, especially
girls, form clear ideas about the kinds of career they will go into
when they are in primary school. It is very important that we see the
role of primary teachers as also helping to develop aspirations and
broaden horizons. I was pleased recently to speak to the Personal
Finance Education Group, which, as well as talking to children about
how to manage money, is also keen to talk to them about which careers

many students closing the doors on careers they could have had by not
making subject choices that keep their options open. It is entirely
sensible that schools should have that duty. I was at Springwood high
school in King’s Lynn on Friday and I saw the provision working
well in practice. The school does tremendous research on the local and
national jobs market, seeing what careers are available; encourages
students to aspire at all levels; works with local employers; and runs
visits to universities around the country. Each student has a teacher
mentor who ensures that they get good advice all the way through. I do
not think that careers advice is a one-off—it is the role of
schools to ensure that they do not just talk about future careers

things that will be successful in the future.</hs_Para>

Affairs only last

15 November 2012, 41 police and crime commissioners were elected,
representing a total population of 48 million and covering individual
populations of up to 2.6 million people, earning salaries of between
£65,000 and £117,000 a year, and between them controlling
billions of pounds of spending on police in England and Wales. Since
2010, the Home Secretary has embarked on what can only be described as
a revolution in policing: whole organisations have been changed, some
have been abolished, some merged, and others are at this moment in a
state of limbo. Names that we have become used to, such as the Serious
Organised Crime Agency, the National Policing Improvement Agency and
police authorities, have been or will be replaced by the College of
Policing, the National Crime Agency and 41 elected police and crime
commissioners. The police commissioners were introduced to bring a
democratic element into the new landscape of policing. I fully support
the vision behind them, which is one of the democratic accountability
of our police service.</hs_Para>

today that undercover officers spied on the Lawrence family are just
one of a number of recent events in policing that have shown why this
new element of democratic accountability is vital to the landscape of
policing. In creating the commissioners, the Home Secretary was seeking
to construct a new and better, more accountable policing edifice.
However, it has become clear that there may be a number of structural
faults, and if these are not addressed quickly, this gleaming new
building will
collapse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000188">The
birth of the commissioners was a long and difficult one. The original
election date had to be changed, voters did not receive a formal
election mailing—they were asked to look at websites—and
there was a record low turnout. In Devon and Cornwall, Commissioner
Tony Hogg was elected by only 5% of the electorate. In Wales, at a
Newport polling station, not a single vote was cast. The commissioners
are a new breed, although some of them are known to us. Six
commissioners are former Members of Parliament, including Alun Michael
from South Wales, Jane Kennedy from Merseyside, Paddy Tipping from
Nottinghamshire, Vera Baird from Northumbria, Sir Graham Bright from
Cambridgeshire, and Tony Lloyd from Greater
Manchester.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000189">Subsequent
to their election, the first actions of some commissioners were
to make appointments to their offices, which vary hugely in size, from
40 staff in Tony Lloyd’s Greater Manchester office to just four
in 
<?notus-xml column=135?>Vera Baird’s office in Northumbria. There are 16
Conservative, 13 Labour and 12 independent police
commissioners. The House will know that there has been much controversy

Yorkshire commissioner, Mark Burns-Williamson, for example, who
appointed the wife of his party’s regional director in Yorkshire
and Humberside, who oversaw his selection, to become his deputy on a
salary of £53,000. Both the Labour West Midlands commissioner,
Bob Jones, and the Conservative Northamptonshire commissioner, Adam
Simmonds, made political appointments to the post of assistant
commissioner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000190">Not
a week has passed without articles in newspapers about the activities
of some commissioners, and I shall give just four examples. Newspapers
reported that three police officers were arrested after allegedly
leaking details of Cumbrian Commissioner Richard Rhodes’s
undeclared expenses to the press. Richard Rhodes has written to my
Committee to clarify the position, and we have published his letter on
our website. <I>The Mail on Sunday</I> ran a splash raising questions
about the office of the Thames Valley commissioner, Anthony Stansfeld,
who is the Prime Minister’s local commissioner. Last week, the
<I>Watford Observer</I> said that in April alone, in his capacity as
Hertfordshire commissioner, David Lloyd accepted hospitality with
outsourcing companies Serco and Capgemini. It was also revealed by the
newspapers that the Surrey commissioner, Kevin Hurley, ran a private
security firm, and it was claimed that that was a conflict of
interest. Mr Hurley denies that. The House and the public need to
decide if that is just press speculation or something more serious

commissioners.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000191">So

is vital to allow a full and fair analysis of the momentous decisions
that some of the commissioners have to make. The biggest power they
wield is the ability 
<?notus-xml column=136?>to hire and fire chief constables. This month Gwent’s
commissioner, Ian Johnston, apparently forced the chief
constable of Gwent, Carmel Napier, to retire. The reason he cited was
that she was hostile to the idea of commissioners and their
relationship was “never going to work.” We hope to hear
from both the Gwent Commissioner and the former chief constable
at the Committee in the near future. In Lincolnshire
Commissioner Alan Hardwick’s suspension of Chief Constable
Rhodes was later reversed by a High Court judge, who called it
“irrational and perverse.” Ten chief constables have

police and crime panels are meant to hold commissioners to account on
all these issues. They are the only groups standing between
commissioners and a four-year period in which they can, in effect, do
whatever they like. However, as soon as the cold light of scrutiny was
shone on them by the Committee, we found that these panels were often
compromised by political allegiances, and some lacked the guidance,
legal advice and legal powers that they required. The Kent police and
crime panel never scrutinised Commissioner Anne Barnes’s
decision to appoint a youth and crime commissioner on a salary of
£15,000. Gwent’s commissioner, Ian Johnston, admitted to

Lincolnshire’s panel chair, Councillor Ray Wootten, resigned

Apparently it was he who was confused, not the legal advice that he had

is no easy task to take the first steps in a completely new and
important area of policy. The police need to be accountable to the
taxpayer for the money they spend, the priorities they choose and,
indeed, the mistakes they make. However, we must ensure that there is a
sound process in place for making commissioners accountable. After all,
we will have to wait another three and a half years until the next
election, and nothing can be done until then. That is why my colleagues
on the Home Affairs Committee have agreed to conduct a major inquiry
into commissioners on the anniversary of their elections. We want the

police and crime commissioners have been in office for six and a half
months, and in that relatively short time they have made a significant
impact. Crime has fallen by more than 10% under this Government and has
continued to fall since the PCCs were elected, against the challenging
economic climate. PCCs not only represent the most significant
democratic reform of policing we have seen; they are also proving to be
central figures in helping to cut crime. In the past 
<?notus-xml column=138?>six months all the PCCs have published their police and crime
plans and engaged with the public in a way that police authorities did
not, and indeed could not. PCCs have made pledges and put in place

a result of the arrival of police and crime commissioners, we are
seeing the development of innovative and challenging thinking that cuts
to the heart of crime reduction and prevention in our communities. That
thinking is the work of a disparate group of individuals who are

across party politics or ideological leanings—that of cutting
crime, reducing the harm that comes to our citizens from those who
would wish to do them harm, and making our streets and communities

innovations, brought about by the police and crime commissioners, can

illustrate some of the ideas being brought to life. In the first group,
we see examples such as Martyn Underhill, the independent PCC for
Dorset, who is developing a victims bureau where victims are supported
throughout their journey through the criminal justice system by a
single point of contact. Another example is 
<?notus-xml column=139?>Shaun Wright, Labour PCC for South Yorkshire, who is allocating extra

exploitation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000214">In
the second group, Matthew Ellis, the Conservative PCC from
Staffordshire, has focused on the interaction between the police and
those with mental health issues. He is looking at how officers can
reduce the time spent with such individuals, without compromising the
service to those who need it. Sue Mountstevens, the independent PCC
from Avon and Somerset, is establishing a business crime forum for
business leaders to provide input into policing best practice on such
areas as CCTV security, security staff and joint initiatives. That will
be coupled with prevention work with communities and
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000215">In
the third group, we are seeing PCCs challenge forces to drive essential
changes. PCCs of all kinds are looking at how the police can work more
closely with the fire service. Sir Graham Bright, the Conservative PCC
from Cambridgeshire, has begun work to exploit better the existing IT
systems to provide the opportunity to automate and improve the flow of
information across the force. That work is designed to get key
information to the officer on the beat when they need it and provides
the opportunity for the public to access the police quickly through
digital means.</hs_Para>

innovations have not come about by accident, but by design on the part
of the individual PCCs. That is a direct result of the Government
achieving what they set out to do all along with the introduction of
PCCs—to shift accountability away from Whitehall into the hands
of locally elected representatives, who understand the needs and the
priorities of the people in their areas far better than policy makers
in Whitehall ever could.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman implied that some kind of accountability gap is
developing between Whitehall and PCCs. That is not the case. This
Government have given serious thought to how we can improve the
accountability of the entirety of policing, not just the leadership,
and that is why we are seeing improvements in the information that is
available to the public. In the case of PCCs, the Home Secretary
rightly retains backstop powers that we do not envisage using, but the
day-to-day management, governance and oversight of the forces has
transferred into the hands of PCCs. The legislation that underpins PCCs
is enabling legislation, not preventive legislation. The supposed
accountability gap is a fiction created by people who cannot bear to
see the transference of accountability away from Whitehall, where it
was held for so long—indeed, for too long. The truth of the
matter is that what we have seen demonstrates that we were right all
along. The challenges and, indeed, controversies that we are seeing are
the product of PCCs doing the job they have been elected to
do.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman rightly made a point about the availability of
information. I share his desire for increasing transparency. We are
working towards ensuring that key elements of the information required
by legislation are published on the national police.uk website. We are
confident that this will enable the public even better to access easily
the information they need to hold their PCC to account. Under the
specified information order, PCCs have to publish a register of
interests, including every pecuniary interest or other paid interest,
budgets, contracts and tenders, senior salaries, expenses, and key 
<?notus-xml column=140?>decisions. We have been clear that it is not the role of central
Government to establish and maintain a national register of interests.
This is not co-ordinated because the public want to hold their own
local PCC, and not all 41 PCCs, to
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000219">Significant
structures and safeguards are in place to ensure that PCCs are able to
fulfil the role that the Government intended for them. PCCs already
benefit from appropriate checks and balances, as befits their status as
democratically elected individuals, through locally elected councillors
with strong powers to question the PCC, through the statutory framework
that underpins the office of PCC, and ultimately, of course, at the
ballot box. As the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, PCCs work every
day in the full gaze and scrutiny of the media.</hs_Para>

safeguards include the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act
2011, which brought PCCs into being. That is enhanced by the Policing
Protocol Order 2011, a document that has been commended in the House of
Lords for its ease of comprehension. These documents clearly set out
the powers that police and crime panels have to provide supportive
scrutiny to their relevant PCCs. Those powers include, but are not
limited to, the power to ensure that the appointment of a chief
constable is subject to the scrutiny and the potential veto of the
panel; the power to ensure that the dismissal of a chief constable is
open to proper scrutiny and follows clear procedure; and the power to
require that information held by the PCC is made available to the panel
and therefore to the public.</hs_Para>

been failings in the system—the failings that the right hon.
Gentleman mentioned—they may be the result of chairs of panels,
and panels themselves, having a lack of understanding of the powers
they hold and the role they fulfil. We are confident that panels have
the powers they need to fulfil their scrutiny roles. He mentioned the
incidents in Lincolnshire. As he knows, the chairman of the panel there
wrote to the Home Office asking for advice about whether he could hold
a scrutiny meeting. I wrote back to him saying that he could, and he
chose to ignore that advice. With the best will in the world,
there is not a lot more that the Policing Minister can do when asked
for advice than to give it, and if the chair of the panel—former
chair; he has subsequently left the job—chooses to ignore it,
that is a matter for
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000222">The

have been several high-profile cases where the performance of the chief
constable has been challenged by the PCC. That is a positive symptom of
the shift in accountability from Whitehall to PCCs. It is right that
the role of chief constable and the post-holder are open to challenge,
and that PCCs have the mandate to challenge them on behalf of the
people they represent. It would be a disservice to PCCs and chief
constables, who are professionals, to suggest that they would be unable
to maintain a professional and productive working relationship having
come through any such challenge.</hs_Para>

criticism of the size and structure of the offices of PCCs. Indeed, we
have heard some tonight from the right hon. Gentleman. There are
significant variations. In the examples that he gave, that is partly
because of the difference in size between Greater Manchester and
Northumbria. However, PCCs have the mandate and the knowledge to
determine what is needed to carry out their remit. Who else is better
placed to judge that? Equally importantly, all information regarding
the offices of PCCs is available to the public, so people will be able
to take into account the value for money that their PCC has delivered
when they next cast their vote. That is also true of the appointment of
deputies and other figures who support the PCC in their duties. Whether
those appointments are appropriate or necessary is not for me to say;
it is for the public to judge at the ballot
box.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000226">PCCs
have been complying with the requirements that we made on them to be
transparent. The Elected Local Policing Bodies (Specified Information)
Order 2011 requires PCCs to publish key information. That
includes 
<?notus-xml column=142?>a register of interests that must include all other pecuniary or paid
interests, expenses, budgets, contracts and tenders, senior salaries,
and key decisions. The intention is for the public to use that
information to hold PCCs to account. I would contrast that with the
situation that used to obtain with police
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000227">Police
and crime commissioners are doing much that all Members of every party
can be proud of. Those actions are a function of the shift in
accountability from Whitehall to PCCs. The innovation and ambition in
PCCs’ plans for their areas are testimony to their dedication to
the role, their commitment to the people of their areas and their
desire to make a real change, which is precisely what is happening. It
is evident to me that PCCs are doing exactly what Parliament had
intended and many of them are doing it extremely
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062456000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/debtext/130624-0004.htm#13062456000228"><I>Question

search for middle east peace remains an urgent global priority in 2013.
At the start of this year we were clear about the overriding need for
the United States, supported by the international community, to lead an
effort to revitalise the peace process. The events of the Arab spring,
particularly the threat posed by conflict in Syria, make the need for
progress even more pressing. We therefore deeply appreciate the
leadership which the US, and particularly Secretary John Kerry, are
showing on this issue. Britain stands fully behind these efforts to
revive the peace process. We remain in close contact with the United
States. On 12 June in Washington, the Foreign Secretary discussed with
Secretary Kerry the prospects for progress on the peace process and
stressed UK support for his
efforts.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1306241000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/wmstext/130624m0001.htm#1306241000007">The
Foreign Secretary visited Israel and the Occupied Palestinian
Territories on 23-24 May, to demonstrate UK support for US efforts to
bring about credible negotiations. He met with key figures from both
sides, including Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas, and
welcomed their clear commitment to a two-state solution and to work to
achieve peace for the Israeli and Palestinian people. With both
parties, the Foreign Secretary set out the urgent need for them to show
bold and decisive leadership and engage seriously with US efforts. The
Foreign Secretary made it clear that there was no credible alternative
to Secretary Kerry’s
initiative.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1306241000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/wmstext/130624m0001.htm#1306241000008">The

11-13 June, to reinforce our support for US efforts and the priority of
serious engagement. In Israel, I met Justice Minister and chief
negotiator Tzipi Livni, International Relations and Strategic Affairs
Minister Yuval Steinitz and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s personal
envoy Isaac Molcho. In Ramallah, I met Palestinian President Abbas and
Prime Minister Hamdallah (who has since resigned), and paid another
visit to the village of Nabi Saleh in the west bank. I also visited
Gaza and southern Israel, to understand the impact of movement and
access restrictions on the livelihoods of ordinary people, and the
reality faced by families who live in fear of rocket attacks. We are
clear that a solution to the problems of Gaza is urgently needed, that
economic restrictions should be lifted and that any negotiated
two-state solution must include Gaza—Gaza is a fundamental part

the Foreign Secretary and I made it clear to our Israeli and
Palestinian partners that maintaining the status quo is neither
desirable, nor practicable. As Secretary Kerry has said, a stalemate
today will not remain one tomorrow. We are running out of time to
achieve a two-state solution as the situation on the ground continues
to deteriorate. Yet any alternatives would be harder still. There is no
such thing as a one-state “solution”, only a one-state

parties, and we, currently face a choice: either we move towards peace,
with the strong support of the region and the wider international
community, or we face an uncertain and dangerous future. This is why
the Government will continue to do all we can to support US efforts. In
this context, we will discuss specific steps the EU can take in support
at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 24 June. And we will continue to
work actively with the United States, the Israelis and Palestinians,
and our other international partners including the Arab League, to
achieve peace before the window for a two state solution
closes.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="1"><?date 2013-06-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_24_PT_1/83C64804C1B3FAB34E8BFED05D8AC102C7CD3FFC" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 June 2013">Monday

MOJ analysis shows that, when differences between offenders are
controlled for, there is up to an 8 percentage point
difference in reoffending rates between those on community orders and
those who received a short prison sentence—currently
without statutory rehabilitation on release. Therefore, there is
evidence to suggest that extending supervision to those serving under
12 months will reduce reoffending among this group, and thereby the
cost of crime committed by offenders released from short prison
sentences, which in 2010, the National Audit Office estimated was

allowance and personal independence payment, claimants with mental,
intellectual and cognitive impairments who do not return their claim
form are referred directly to the assessment provider for a

sent to the claimant before the face-to-face consultation also

Hoban:</Member></B> The sanctions regime for people
in the employment support allowance (ESA) work related activity group
(WRAG) changed from the beginning of December 2012. As a result of the
changes to the regime, the Department reviewed its methodology for
publishing ESA sanctions official statistics. The review identified an
error in the official statistics measure leading to double counting of
some sanctions. For this reason, statisticians at the DWP decided to
suspend publication of ESA sanctions statistics. DWP is aiming to
publish the first set of statistics for the new ESA sanctions 
<?notus-xml column=32?>regime by August 2013 alongside a revised historical series. These
statistics have been delayed from a May release to allow the new regime
to bed in and to allow sufficient quality
assurance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062455000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/text/130624w0001.htm#13062455000364">Statistics

a market for their produce. DFID funding will benefit 650,000 people

conditions that are compliant with Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005 on
the protection of animals during transport. There are no inspections
conducted at the port. However, currently AHVLA does undertake
precautionary checks at the port. These checks include a careful visual
inspection of the animals for overt welfare problems and observations
of the behaviour and demeanour of the animals for indications whether

arrangements set out in Council Decision 2004/585/EC. The EU grant does

Heath</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 5 June 2013]:</I> EU legislation
requires that animals and animal products entering the food chain do
not contain unauthorised substances and that residues of authorised
veterinary medicinal products are within permitted limits. Domestic
legislation places responsibility for ensuring that residues are within
permitted limits upon the person that sells or supplies the animal for
slaughter for human consumption (Regulation 9 of Statutory Instrument
1997 No. 1729). This has been put in place to enforce the EU regulation
and protect
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306254000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/text/130624w0003.htm#1306254000300">European
legislation covering the payment of common agricultural policy (CAP)
subsidies requires farmers claiming payments to comply with a range of
public, animal and plant health, environment and welfare requirements
collectively known as ‘cross compliance’. Residues
legislation comes within the scope of cross compliance through
Statutory Management Requirement 11 (food and feed law). Where a farmer
is considered liable for a breach of the residues rules, cross
compliance rules require a percentage reduction to be applied to the
payments
claimed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306254000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/text/130624w0003.htm#1306254000301">Purchasers

recognised the need for the highest level of political leadership on
this issue and the need for co-ordinated action on: law enforcement and
criminal justice issues; demand reduction; and supporting the

such, the problem of illegal wildlife trafficking needs to be
recognised by governments at the highest levels, not just as an
environmental issue but as an essential part of ensuring national and
international security and stability. The Government will host a high
level meeting in late autumn to secure Government-wide and

rise in air passenger duty (APD) to inflation over the period 2010-11

Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond
(Yorks) (Mr Hague), last met the Foreign Minister of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, His Excellency Zlatko Lagumdzija on 17 April in London. He
expressed his deep disappointment that Bosnia and Herzegovina's
political leaders had failed to reach agreement on bringing the
Constitution into line with the 2009 European Court of Human Rights
ruling on Sejdic Finci, so that all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina
might stand for election to the presidency and the House of Peoples
irrespective of their ethnic background. The Secretary of State
stressed UK commitment to Bosnia and Herzegovina's ambition for EU and
NATO membership, but made clear that the onus was on the country's

Lidington:</Member></B> In recent months in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we
have seen actions challenging the authority of state-level institutions
and laws, and the authority of decisions made by the High
Representative, as well as inflammatory nationalistic rhetoric. In
Republika Srpksa, President Dodik continues to challenge the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state, thus undermining
the Dayton Peace Agreement. In Mostar, the failure of local
institutions to implement the Constitutional Court's decision on
Mostar's electoral system violates the peace agreement and prevents the
population from participating in a vote on their local political
representatives. I am concerned also at the continuing disregard for
the rule of law throughout Bosnia and
Herzegovina.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062511002063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130624/text/130624w0005.htm#13062511002063">As

The UK is also a strong supporter of the EU-led peacekeeping mission,
