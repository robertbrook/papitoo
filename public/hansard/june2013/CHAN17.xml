exports are not great and the reason is simple: half our exports go the
European Union, where output is declining. It has a major economic
crisis. Exports are growing rapidly to emerging markets. My hon. Friend
the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) cited the

chaired a meeting of the construction industry’s council, which
we have put together. Its members acknowledged that skills were one of
their key constraints, one of the problems being that the construction
industry has been through a very deep, cyclical depression, which has
had a major knock-on effect on skills. We are now working with it to
boost skills, so that the upswing in the industry that we are beginning

your decision, Mr Speaker, to write to the Chair of the Standards and

election guru, Lynton Crosby, addressed the Tory parliamentary party,

clients are. We do know, however, that his company, Crosby Textor, has
long lobbied lucratively for big tobacco. We know, too, that plain
packaging for cigarettes suddenly disappeared from this year’s
Queen’s Speech, despite strong hints that it would be included.
So does the Leader of the House agree with me that for the sake of
transparency, lobbyists at the heart of No. 10 should publish their

another.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000208">I

the last week, we have seen a bleak picture emerging of an increasingly
divided Britain. New figures from Public Health England reveal that
thousands more people are dying prematurely in the north than in the
south. The shocking variations show that someone living in Manchester
is twice as likely to die early as someone living in Wokingham.
Moreover, a report published by the TUC this week shows that wages have
fallen by nearly 8%. This comes at a time when prices are rising and
people are suffering unprecedented cuts in their living standards. The
regional differences are shocking, with the north-west and the
south-west seeing pay packets shrink by more than 10%. The Chancellor
used to say “We’re all in this together”, but
those figures, added to his millionaires’ tax cut, make that

response. Let me begin by echoing her expression of support for your
letter to the Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee, Mr.
Speaker—not least because I think that we in the House of
Commons want consideration of the relationship between Members’
interests and their responsibilities to proceed on the basis of advice
from the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and the Standards and
Privileges Committee, whose task is to secure those standards in the
House. However, I also think it important for all of us in recent weeks
to have recognised the importance of understanding not only what the
rules say, but the spirit behind those rules. I think that if every
Member of Parliament lives by the spirit as well as the letter of the
rules, we will avoid what might otherwise be excessive and unduly
intrusive rule-making on what Members should and should not
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000218">The

As the hon. Lady will know, the aspects of it relating to a register of

hon. Lady raised a point about Public Health England. The data it has
used serve to illustrate the tragic divide in terms of mortality
between different parts of the country, and they are, essentially, the
same data that we inherited in 2010; there is, effectively, no
difference. What is deeply worrying, and what is at the heart of this,
is that there is not just a divide between, for example, Manchester and
Wokingham; there is also a divide between Manchester and Birmingham.
The simple fact is that more can be done in many parts of our country
to reduce premature mortality and morbidity.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State for Health, we sought to address that through the
establishment of Public Health England and especially the transfer of
public health resources into the hands of local authorities. The hon.
Lady did not welcome the increase in resources for local authorities,
relative to those that were previously deployed by primary care trusts,
to support public health preventive measures. Putting that money in the
hands of local authorities will enable them to make an impact on what
we know makes the biggest difference to health, which is lifestyle. It
is not just about how much we spend on NHS services, because Wokingham
gets the least cash per head from the NHS budget, but it has some of
the best morbidity and mortality outcomes. It is also about trying to
make sure we change people’s lifestyles. On that we are agreed.
There are basic things like the social grading of health, relative
deprivation, the extent to which people are in work, the extent to
which they have good parenting, the quality of education, and the
quality of environment. Those are the things that make a difference,
and that is, I hope, where our local authorities will use these powers
to very good effect.</hs_Para>

to introduce, through the Government e-petition system, a measure that
has dramatically improved the public’s perception of how
Parliament responds to the issues that matter to them, as evidenced in
the 10th audit of engagement published by the Hansard Society. There
were negative aspects outlined in that audit, but one of the positive
aspects was that more of the public feel that Parliament is debating
the issues that matter to them. The hon. Lady is right, however: we

Working-age benefits should therefore reflect such constraint. The
Labour party, however, appears determined to allow welfare payments to
balloon. The Opposition did not support us on that cap on welfare
benefits, and their view appears to be that all the constraint on
spending should be borne by pensioners. If they were to abandon the
triple lock and do it that way, it would mean a £234 cut in the

character of care for teenagers with cancer. There is more that we can

in effect, being made on a national basis but were not accountable on a
national basis. Accountability will now be much clearer. Following what
my right hon. Friend the Health Secretary said at the Dispatch Box
yesterday, it is clear that in future NHS England will have a
responsibility for commissioning these national

taxpayers’ money through such expenditure. We must think about
how much individuals pay in tax and about how cavalierly that money has
been spent, not least under the last Labour Government, through the use
of procurement cards. The private office of a single Secretary of State
spent hundreds of pounds on dinner in restaurants and on hotels. We

would have been under the previous Government and the fuel duty
escalator. Not least, we are also helping councils to fund a council

Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Sajid Javid):</Member></B>
Yesterday, RBS announced that the group chief executive, Stephen
Hester, will step down from his position later this year. The decision
was taken in the context of moving from the rescue phase to the next
phase, and of focusing RBS on becoming a UK bank that provides greater
support to the British economy, helping businesses and job creation
here, and which can return to the private sector in a way that ensures
value for the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000310">As
we commend Stephen Hester for the job he has done, it is worth
considering how far RBS has come since the onset of the financial
crisis. When Stephen Hester took over, the bank was on the edge of
collapse with a broken culture, and posed a huge risk to financial
stability. It had been bailed out by the British taxpayer at a cost of
more than £45 billion. He brought it back from the brink, and
since then has worked hard to make RBS a safer and stronger bank that
is better able to support its
customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000311">RBS
has changed substantially over the past few years. It exited the asset
protection scheme last year, and non-core assets have been run down
from about £258 billion in 2008 to £53 billion now; total
assets of RBS investment banking operations are down from around
£500 billion to £288 billion; short-term borrowing is
down by more than £250 billion; its core loan-to-deposit ratio
is now below 100%, which means that the core bank is funded entirely by
deposits; and the core tier 1 capital ratio has more than doubled. The
size and complexity of RBS has been significantly reduced, with a far
greater focus on serving its UK customers. Entire business lines have
been exited, and there has been a dramatic simplification,
rationalisation and de-risking of the bank’s business model.
That is an impressive list of achievements, and is one of the largest
corporate restructurings in history. Stephen Hester has made an
important contribution to Britain’s recovery from the financial
crisis. I am sure that all hon. Members would like to join me in
congratulating him on all he has done and achieved during his time at
the bank. It is reassuring that he is staying on to ensure a smooth
transition to his
successor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000312">RBS
has outlined the details of Stephen Hester’s leaving package.
This is a matter for the RBS board, but I want the House to be fully
aware of the terms of this package. At the point of Stephen
Hester’s departure, and in line with his contractual
obligations, he will receive a payment in lieu of notice representing
one year’s salary and benefits. This amounts to £1.6
million. He will not receive a bonus for 2013. At the board’s
discretion, Stephen Hester will keep his unvested long-term investment
plan, or LTIP, awards. These will be reduced significantly through
pro-rating for time of service. These awards are also subject to
assessment against published performance conditions at the end of the
respective performance period. Following this pro-rating and
performance assessment, RBS estimates that the value of the LTIPs would
be approximately £3 million at their current share price. In
addition, the number of shares that Stephen Hester can receive is
capped at 65% of the total, which would be just over £4
million at today’s share price. These payments are in
line  
<?notus-xml column=510?>with his contractual terms, and the share awards will reflect
payment for performance up to the point of his
departure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000313">During
his five-year term in office, Stephen Hester received one bonus out of
a possible five. I also wanted to let the House know that Stephen
Hester’s leaving package is expected to be worth about one third
of the maximum he could have received under the contract that was
agreed in 2008 by the previous
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000314">RBS
is now moving from the rescue phase to the next phase, which involves
focusing on becoming a UK bank that provides greater support to the
British economy and is prepared for its return to the private sector.
The Government have always been clear about wanting RBS to become a
more focused retail and commercial bank that is focused on supporting
the British economy and has a much smaller international investment
banking arm. RBS has already made progress towards this
goal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000315">I
expect the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which was
established last year, to report soon, but let me briefly remind
everyone of what the Government have already achieved in the financial
sector. First, we have introduced a brand new watchdog with powers to
keep our banks safe, so that they do not bring down the economy. In
April, the Financial Services Authority was abolished and the Bank of
England is now in charge of keeping our financial system safe, with the
transfer of responsibility for prudential regulation to a new
subsidiary of the Bank, the Prudential Regulation Authority. With the
authority that comes from its history and the new powers we have given
it, the Bank of England is empowered to protect our financial system.
We have also created a strong new conduct regulator, the Financial
Conduct Authority, to ensure that London and the UK have the best and
most open, transparently policed markets in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000316">Secondly,
we are taking legislation through Parliament to introduce a law,
following the recommendations of Sir John Vickers and his Commission,
that will for the first time ever erect a ring fence around a major
retail bank, so that its essential operations will continue even if the
whole bank fails. This will protect the high street and the taxpayer
from the mistakes of the dealing floor. Following the recommendations
of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, we will be making
further changes on Report to further strengthen the ring-fencing regime
and electrify the ring
fence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000317">The
third area of the Government’s focus has been to engender a
change in the culture and ethics of the banking industry itself. As
members of the House know, we asked the Parliamentary Commission to
look at how to improve the professional standards and culture of the
banking sector. As I mentioned, its work is coming to an end and I
expect it to report
soon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000318">Fourthly,
we will give customers the most powerful weapon of all: choice, which
is the most powerful tool we have to improve markets and customer
service, reward good companies and penalise poor ones. We have made a
start with the sale of Northern Rock to Virgin Money and we are seeing
new banks, such as Metro Bank, on our high streets. This year we are
taking a huge step towards making it easier for customers to move if
they can get a better deal elsewhere. From this September, every
customer of every bank in Britain will be able to switch their
bank account from their existing bank to another one within seven days.
This is real progress.</hs_Para>

excited, Madam Deputy Speaker. RBS has been brought back from the
brink, and now is the time to move on from the rescue phase and focus

creation here and a bank that can return to the private sector in a way

Leslie</B> (Nottingham East) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> The Opposition are
very surprised that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has not come to the
House of Commons today to respond to growing speculation that he has
already decided the fate of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The
Government’s handling of this matter has already caused
widespread concern. Stephen Hester did an important job starting the
process of turning RBS around, but clearly there is a long way still to
go, as he has said himself, so I want to ask the Minister about the
four key points on which we need urgent
clarification.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000321" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000321">First,
on the departure of the chief executive, did Stephen Hester go
voluntarily or was he pushed? What role did the Chancellor have in
prompting his departure? When did the Chancellor set out to the
chairman and the board his desire that Stephen Hester should go and is
there now any role for United Kingdom Financial Investments, or has it
been circumvented in the discussion on the chief executive’s
role? Can the Minister explain why they got rid of the current chief
executive before finding a successor? Was that really a sensible thing
to do? Why have they left such uncertainty? Is the 6% fall in
RBS’s share price this morning, wiping off
nearly £2 billion from the value of the
taxpayers’ stake, a reflection of this confusion? Can the
Minister clarify reports this morning that the chairman of RBS has
indicated that he will also leave if and when a new chief executive is
found?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000322" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0001.htm#13061339000322">Secondly,

the Minister tell us now what the Chancellor told the chairman and the
board? Is it just a coincidence that the end of 2014 would fit neatly
into the Chancellor’s pre-election political timetable? Should

the British economy

are the public wrong to suspect that this generous severance payment
for Stephen Hester is just a foretaste of the wider loss that will be
made for the taxpayer if they rush headlong into a pre-election fire
sale? Given that Stephen Hester said yesterday that he was confident
that RBS was capable of being worth more than the £45 billion
the taxpayer originally paid, why is the Chancellor rushing to prove
him wrong? Stephen Hester told the BBC last night
that RBS was 
<?notus-xml column=512?>capable of being worth more than what the Government
paid for the shares. Does the Minister agree? If not, why
not?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000325" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000325">Fourthly,
can the Minister explain why it is sensible to intervene in the
executive management of RBS rather than have an orderly process of
repairing the bank and thoroughly considering the full range of future
options for this institution—a process that has incredible
ramifications for our whole economy? We look forward to the report from
the cross-party Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and any
views it might have on this, but rather than this shambolic and

start with his final question, if I may. He asked why the Chancellor is

hoping that I might get an apology from the hon. Gentleman and some
recognition that the only reason we are here discussing this topic
today is the previous Government’s failure to regulate our
banking system, which led to more than £45 billion of
taxpayers’ money being injected into bailing out a

to the hon. Gentleman’s four questions. First, he asked about
the sequence or the terms of Stephen Hester’s departure. I am
pleased to confirm to him that the Chancellor has not been directly
involved in meeting with Stephen Hester prior to the announcement
—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> He has not met with
Stephen Hester prior to the announcement of his departure on this
issue. This is a decision for RBS and its board. They have made the
decision jointly with Stephen Hester and come to a voluntary agreement.
The chairman of RBS, Sir Philip Hampton, asked to meet the Chancellor
last week—at Philip Hampton’s request—to inform
the Chancellor of the board’s decision, and that is what I would
expect, given that the shareholder is the majority owner of the
bank.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000330">The
hon. Gentleman also referred to the succession plans and asked whether
it would have been better to find a successor in the first place. If he
has looked carefully at the plans, he will note that Stephen Hester has
agreed to stay on until a successor has been found or, at the very
latest, until the end of this year. RBS has already begun its search
process. I am confident that it will find a successor in time, but it
is reassuring, as I said in my statement, that Stephen Hester is
staying on in the meantime to help to smooth the process of finding his
successor.</hs_Para>

Gentleman also referred to the share price of RBS this morning. He will
note that—I think I am right in saying—almost every major
bank’s share price 
<?notus-xml column=513?>is down this morning. The stock market is down in general this morning.
I suggest that the change in the RBS share price might also be a
reflection of global stock markets, particularly Asian stock markets
and markets in Tokyo, which, as it happens, also fell by 6%
overnight.</hs_Para>

Gentleman asked about the eventual sale of the bank and RBS’s
comments about preparing the bank for its future return to the private
sector. There should be nothing surprising about RBS having an ambition
that the bank should be returned to the private sector. That is
perfectly reasonable and perfectly normal. As for the
Government’s plans, we have always made it absolutely clear that
we have no target price when we are thinking about the return of RBS.
We have no fixed timetable, and that includes the general election. Our
major concern is to ensure, as the hon. Gentleman said himself, that
when RBS is returned to the private sector, that is done with due
regard to getting the best value possible for the taxpayer.</hs_Para>

Gentleman also asked whether the value of the shares had been
destroyed. I thought that was a bit rich, coming from him. He forces me
to remind the House that when the previous Government carried out their
bail-out following their failed policies and paid more than £45
billion for a stake in RBS, they overpaid by £12 billion above
the share price. That amount was written off by the taxpayer at that
moment, but that is something else for which we have not had an
apology.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000334">If
I understood the hon. Gentleman’s last question correctly, he
asked whether the Government had intervened in the decision-making
process of the executive management. As I have said, those decisions
are rightly made by RBS’s board. The Government’s
shareholding is held through UKFI on an arm’s length basis. UKFI
represents the interests of the taxpayer on RBS’s board. I
remind the House that that arm’s length arrangement was
deliberately set up by the previous Government; we have rightly kept it
in place. UKFI reports periodically to the Treasury and provides
advice, and we always take that into account when making our own
decisions.</hs_Para>

agree that, whatever further reforms of RBS are now implemented,
arguing about the past—about the past price or about party
politics—is not what the country wants to hear or what the

remuneration and exit package that Mr Hester will receive. I am rather
more interested in the package that British citizens will receive when
the bank is returned to the private sector in order to recompense them
for the different ways in which they have paid for the £45
billion bail-out. Will the Minister confirm that UKFI and the Treasury
are seriously examining the idea, which I first promoted in March 2011,
that all British citizens should be able to profit from the uplift in
the share price when the bank is returned to the private
sector?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/21E1DC63703E3226A1E2B3767215E34C22822332" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 June 2013">Thursday

importance of getting the best value for the taxpayer when RBS is
eventually returned to the private sector. There are many ways of doing
that, and there is an open public debate on the ideas. At this point,
however, it is right for me to say that while I welcome open debate,
the Government are looking at the options very carefully, and we will
set out a way forward after the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards has issued its final
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000341"><Member ContinuationText="Stewart Hosie" PimsId="4796" UID="13061339001225" xid="835" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339001225"><B>Stewart
Hosie</B> (Dundee East) (SNP):</Member> I thank the Minister for his
statement and for early sight of it, and add my thanks to those of
others for what Stephen Hester has done so far for the bank. RBS is
planning a £175 million investment in the retail bank in
Scotland and it also plans to maintain it as a global centre for mobile
banking and a global payments hub. When Stephen Hester is replaced and
the bank is finally returned to the private sector, will the Minister
use whatever influence the Government have to ensure that those
investments and those plans are maintained for the sake of jobs both in
the bank and in those businesses that depend on the bank for
support?</hs_Para>

it believes, as do the Government, that RBS should become more focused

that Stephen Hester, who happens to be one of my constituents, was
given a pretty poisoned chalice by the last Labour Chancellor when Fred
Goodwin stepped down and that he has actually done an extremely good
job in rescuing RBS and bringing it back from the brink? What I think
most of my constituents are concerned about now is whether RBS is going
to be a bank for small and medium-sized businesses, a bank for middle
England and a bank for market towns such as Banbury and Bicester,

If he is really concerned about shareholder value, presumably he was
against all the changes that the Government he supported made during
their time in office, which led to the true destruction of
taxpayers’ money. The Government believe that the strategy RBS
has set out and made clear yesterday—a bank that is more focused
on the UK economy and working with British business, with a smaller
investment bank—is the right one, as is the strategy of getting
a CEO who can see that process through for the next few years. We think

Field trials can be allowed without a need to amend existing EU

come forward with a programme for the field trials. However, nothing

independent US-UK group—reports 112,976 documented civilian
casualties and points out that further analysis of the WikiLeaks Iraq
war logs may add 12,000 civilian deaths to that the number. The IBC has

civilian price, one that continues to be paid and threatens to get

war. Iraqis are being hit by almost daily attacks, with tensions
growing between the Shi’a Muslim majority and the minority
Sunnis, raising fears of a return to the worst level of sectarian
violence. Just this week we have seen harrowing reports of at least
seven people killed in a single day in a wave of bombings and attacks

and miserable basic services, such as electricity and water supplies.
But even if Iraq finds a way out of its current difficulties, as we all
fervently hope it will, there is the legacy of the last 10 years of
warfare and terrorism as well. Part of that legacy is the deeply
disturbing cases being taken to our High Court, involving more than 
<?notus-xml column=523?>1,000 killings and acts of torture committed in Iraq by UK forces. We
must have public scrutiny of the systemic issues arising from these

of our own country? Do we feel more secure? Is the terrorist threat
diminished because of those 10 years of bloodshed and chaos? In fact,
the contrary is true. According to the former head of MI5, Eliza
Manningham-Buller, the Iraqi invasion increased the terror threat in
Britain, radicalising a generation of young British Muslims and
substantially increasing the risk of a terrorist atrocity on UK soil. A
major unprovoked attack without UN authorisation took place with dire
consequences. These terrible and deeply troubling outcomes add real
substance to the argument that this was the biggest foreign policy
failure of recent
times.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000394" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000394">As
an individual, I opposed the war in Iraq because it was my view that
the burden of justification for undertaking a major unprovoked attack
had not been met. I joined the anti-war protest in February 2003, which
saw between 1 million and 2 million people marching in London, the
biggest political demonstration in history. In successive polls by
different and reputable agencies, around two thirds of British citizens
say the Iraq war was a
mistake.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000395" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000395">Ultimately,
Parliament was responsible for that decision to go to war. It was MPs
in this House who questioned, debated and voted on the decision, both
on 26 February and 18 March 2003. But if this war was a mistake, what
should Parliament do now? If it were a public body—a school,
perhaps, or a hospital or local authority—we would expect an
admission that things had gone wrong and a pledge to learn the lessons
so that it could not happen again. That, I believe, is at the heart of
today’s debate. Not a blame game or resignations; not heads on
platters or humble pie; not a chorus of “I told you so.”
What I want to focus on specifically is the role of Parliament. How was
it that, with some very honourable exceptions, parliamentary scrutiny
failed? How was it that the intelligence could be so misinterpreted and
misused? How was it that facts clearly in the public domain were
ignored or dismissed?</hs_Para>

academic questions. Their relevance and consequences are all too real
today. We cannot simply leave them to others to answer. The Hutton
inquiry and the Butler inquiry had their own terms of reference.
Hutton’s remit was the death of Dr David Kelly; Butler’s
was a panel, handpicked by Tony Blair, that was insufficiently
independent and held far too many hearings in private. Shamefully, we
still await the results of the Chilcot panel fully five years after it
was established, while battles continue over declassifying material. I
know of at least one freedom of information battle that is still being
had with the Foreign Office; the sticking point is not national
security, but national
embarrassment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000397" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000397">All

sovereign even when it comes to considering its own failures and

catalogued in 29 chapters of 170 pages the unanswered questions that Mr
Blix thought Saddam had to answer, even at that stage, about all the
chemical and biological weaponry that had been known about in the past
and which Saddam had failed to explain. That is where Blix was at the

turn now to what went wrong. There is plenty of evidence that shows
that the case for war set out by the Blair Administration in 2003 was
deeply flawed. Intelligence was misused, concerns expressed by experts
were suppressed, and the legal and political position was
misrepresented. From this arises the belief among many journalists and
members of the public as well as Members of this House that they were
misled into supporting the war in Iraq. In fact, when one reads the

call it a conspiracy.</hs_Para>

Tony Blair decided to join the US in invading Iraq and removing Saddam

his supporters. Britain was indeed spun into war. This is the

by selectively quoting the words “regardless of the

selective and misleading quote in the motion in support of military

suggested that President Chirac’s use of the phrase “this

but was simply an introduction to what he was going to say that
evening. He put that argument to the panel by specifically stating the
order of Chirac’s phrasing, down to where a comma is used.
However, the transcript shows that he did not give the phrasing in the
right order. The phrase “this evening” came after
“regardless of the circumstances”, but he said that it
came first, changing the meaning of Chirac’s words to suit the

that was not right. In fact, the transcript shows that Chirac

needed, stating in the same interview that if the weapons inspector

position, then, was that progress was being made on the weapons
inspections and that France was therefore opposed to replacing the
existing inspections process with an ultimatum that would lead to war
in a few days’ time. The phrase “regardless of the

Chirac used those words, as they were easily taken out of
context. However, that does not detract from the responsibility of
those, including Tony Blair and the right hon. Member for Blackburn,
who—I argue—misinterpreted, and continued to
misinterpret, President Chirac’s interview of 10 March in order
to blame France for the failure to obtain a second UN resolution. The
reason that it was not possible to obtain UN authorisation for the use
of force is that there was no evidence showing Iraq to be an active and

Reading his resignation speech makes the hairs on the back of my neck

unnecessary and unjustified, the critique of the Government’s
position and the exposure of the misinformation and deceit. It was
delivered with eloquence and with the authority and credibility of a

point. Given that the evidence was there, how is it that more MPs did
not come to a different conclusion? The answer, which I will make in
greater detail later in my speech, is that they were whipped massively
through a system in this House that means they give up their
responsibility to make their own decisions. My point is that that kind
of whipping on a vote of such importance and conscience is not the

are many potential explanations for why Robin Cook’s warnings
were heeded by so few, but most come down to the idea that Members
perhaps trusted the view that there was a subplot to the invasion that
the Government could not be open about, that perhaps the
Government knew much more about the risk Saddam posed to the UK than
they were able to say, and that perhaps the conditions were right for
establishing Iraq as a democratic, pro-western state. In some

that the answer is much more simple: too many Members put loyalty to
their leader and to their party above their own judgment. They
swallowed their private doubts, accepted what they were told and voted
accordingly. That misplaced trust crossed party lines. It is deeply
regrettable that the tradition of loyalty meant that hon. Members such
as Robin Cook were not heard. It is also regrettable that the Tory
leadership supported the war so unquestioningly. Perhaps there was a
feeling that that level of deceit was simply inconceivable when it came

conclusion, I said at the start of my speech that the justification for

principle: there must be a limit to party loyalty, and even of loyalty
to the leader of a party. Loyalty is in some way an admirable quality.
There are times when it is right to bite one’s tongue, go along
with the majority, set aside one’s opinions and accept the
judgment and experience of others. But there are also limits.
Committing our country to war, asking our young men and women to fight
and accepting that men, women and children will die in our name must be

Of course informal whipping would have taken place anyway, but it would
have been different. Taking away the formal obligation to vote
according to the party line would have pushed more hon. Members to look

genuinely free vote. If Iraq teaches us one thing, it is that if MPs
are to vote on grave matters of conflict, for that vote to be
meaningful it must be the view of their own conscience, not their
party’s line. As individual constituency MPs, many of us have

has been 10 years since we invaded Iraq, yet the experience still casts
a long shadow, and lessons from the period are still relevant today.
Perhaps the most important lesson is that the war threw into stark
relief the importance of basing our foreign policy decisions on firm
evidence. The intelligence on Saddam Hussein’s WMD and his links
with al-Qaeda, which was used to varying degrees as justification and a
pretext for hostilities, was infamously described by Tony Blair as
“extensive, detailed and authoritative”. In reality, it
was anything but. We now know that we went to war on a false premise;
there were no WMD. The British intelligence community failed to
approach the Iraqi material with its customary thoroughness and
consequently allowed space for the Government to mould the evidence to
suit their purposes, with disastrous results. Indeed, sections of the
intelligence community became the mouthpiece of Government rather than
their ears and eyes, and that must never be allowed to happen
again.</hs_Para>

in regular touch with Alastair Campbell. A unit within the FCO, the
communications information centre, promoted the case for war. This
resulted in possibilities becoming probabilities and indications
becoming judgments. One spin doctor wrote the first full draft of the
dossier, at John Scarlett’s invitation, a full day before John
Scarlett produced his own first full draft. This evidence has come out

When Tony Blair recalled Parliament, we were encouraged to believe that

dossier upgraded or exaggerated assessments made by the JIC, while
intellectual ownership of the dossier did not reside with the JIC
alone. Indeed, the final dossier was not even approved by the whole

Iraq war is also a reminder that interventions often produce unintended
consequences that can turn out to be counter-productive to our
interests. A woefully inadequate post-war reconstruction ushered in a
vicious civil war, as other Members have outlined. Studies estimate
that many hundreds of thousands died in Iraq as a result of the
invasion. In fact, Iraq became a honeypot for extremists worldwide. In
a bitter irony, al-Qaeda only gained a foothold in Iraq after
Saddam’s downfall and then proved difficult to eradicate.

there is little doubt that the removal of Saddam Hussein fundamentally
altered the regional balance of power. We tend to forget in this House
that we supported Saddam Hussein in Iraq’s attack on Iran. At
that time, there was an approximate balance of power in the region. In

also suggest to the House that the invasion ignored the lessons of
history. Interventions have a tendency to support, reinforce or have an
embedding effect on the existing regimes. Looking back at history,
communism, for example, has survived longest in those countries where
the west has intervened militarily, such as China, Vietnam, Cuba and
Korea. Meanwhile, the neo-con dream of establishing a sort of liberal
democracy in Iraq lies in tatters. Democracy is taking root in north
Africa, in regions where the west has put in very little support, not
in Iraq or Afghanistan, where the cost to the west, particularly to
this country, has been very high in terms of lives and
treasure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000464" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000464">Meanwhile,

scratches around for positives from this period. Perhaps there are a
few. If al-Qaeda was one of the reasons for the invasion, it is now
abundantly clear that the Iraq war was a 19th-century colonial-style
solution to a 21st-century terrorist threat. There is no point invading
countries if we are chasing extremists and terrorists. Instead, our
efforts against international terrorism must be much more nimble and
nuanced. They must reflect the flexibility of the terrorist threat
itself, focusing on intelligence and operations, supporting friendly
Governments in their anti-terrorist endeavours and applying properly
resourced special forces. Indeed, there are encouraging signs that we
have learned lessons from that period. We must also better focus
international aid on the poverty and grievances that al-Qaeda and
others have all too readily fastened upon in the
past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000467">Perhaps—I
am coming to an end—there is a more general lesson to be
learned. We failed at the time to carry the international community
with us, and in doing so I would suggest that we lost the moral high
ground. The view adopted by the US and the UK at the time was that
might is right. This sets a dangerous precedent. The coming decades
will see the emergence of at least regional superpowers—or even
global superpowers—that might be eager to flex their muscles.
Our invasion of Iraq will make condemnation of any future aggression by
others less effective. The invasion showed international law to be no
guarantee of sovereignty or, indeed, security. This in itself may have
encouraged some countries to seek other guarantees.</hs_Para>

positive, it is perhaps that this war may have served to lay to rest,
once and for all, the view that the British electorate would
instinctively support politicians advocating intervention or war. I

Minister considers possible responses to Syria, he would be wise to
reflect on that. In conclusion, let us hope that these lessons have

congratulate the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) on

Whether individuals supported or opposed the Iraq war, it is not the
case that it was not a central topic of discussion, not only in this
Chamber, but throughout the whole Palace and certainly throughout the
whole country. I think she was a little unfair in a similar way to that
in which my Government’s spokesman, rather more unfairly, dubbed
all those who were opposed to the idea of a war in Iraq —this is
just one example—as knee-jerk anti-Americans. There was also
enormous pressure from the press that this war should go ahead, but it
is not true that we did not examine, read or question the evidence on a

current concern is for both the present and, partially, the future.
Syria could so easily become yet another disaster for this
country’s foreign policy. I pay tribute to the Prime Minister,
although I would have liked him to have been more categorical on the
possibility of arming one of the sides in what is essentially a civil
war, which would be a total and unmitigated disaster. To give President
Obama his due, despite his pronouncements about drawing lines in the
sand—such statements are all too easily made by politicians,
statesmen and powers—and even though the red line that he
defined has apparently been crossed, perhaps in a minor way, with the
use, we are told, of sarin in Syria, there is clearly no move on the
part of the United States to engage its troops and weaponry in Syria,
which is to be 
<?notus-xml column=535?>welcomed. It is a scandal and an absolute disgrace
that Russia, one of the permanent members of the Security Council, is
completely abdicating her responsibilities in relation to this war, but
that does not relieve us in this Chamber, in this country, from
accepting the realities of the desperate tragedies that we created by
going into a benighted
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000475">I
have had occasion to say in this Chamber and will say again that if we
are going to spend money on armaments, that would be another complete
and unmitigated disaster. There is a desperate, overwhelming need for
even more humanitarian aid to support those countries on the borders of
Syria that are carrying the biggest burden, including Lebanon, Jordan
and Turkey, all of which have a major part to play in that part of the

sides.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000476" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000476">My
major concern, in concert with the hon. Member for Basildon and
Billericay, is what I perceive to be a movement to try at some point to
encourage the western powers or other allies to engage in a similar
conflict in Iran on the basis, as far as I can see, having read the
evidence, of an entirely spurious argument that Iran is not only
desperate to make a nuclear weapon, but even more anxious to use it.
That is totally off the wall, if one reads the existing
evidence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000477">I
have sketched out some of the lessons that we must learn from the gross
intrusion that was the Iraq war—that living example of how power
can corrupt absolutely. We have learned that if a great power attacks a
smaller power, it will win. Desperate and terrible though the results
of that are, the true tragedy is that nobody ever sat down and asked
seriously, “How are we going to win the peace?” That is
the most overwhelming lesson. However, the same thing is happening with
regard to Syria. If we arm one side in that civil war, what will we do
when the bullets run out—although they never will—and
when the bombs stop
falling?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000478" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000478">We
pay lip service to the diplomatic way of solving such problems, but we
do not push it to the extent that we should. I remember clearly the
news, on the day before the Iraq war turned to shock and awe, that
52 British ambassadors had written a letter to the
Government saying, to paraphrase, “Don’t do it.”
Not only this country, but all western nations, have a wealth of
experience of the middle east. It has always been a tinderbox. At the
moment, it is more than a tinderbox. What is happening in Syria to
absolutely innocent civilians is utterly untenable. We can surely do

me, that is the screaming message that comes out of the disaster of the
Iraq war. It is desperately easy to kill, to wound, to maim, to
destroy, but how does one rebuild? It is the responsibility of those
who take such decisions to have a plan for how peace, prosperity,
justice and democracy can be established or restored. I have yet to
read a detailed plan anywhere or by anyone as to how western nations
that intrude upon other nations, as we did in Iraq, will do that. That

our bound and duty—this House has an important part to play in
this—to say that if anybody goes down that ridiculous—no,

must be a terminus at the end of the road that will produce, without

lost their lives in Iraq, as did a number of British civilians. We must

the Government are co-operating fully with it. Indeed, the Foreign
Office alone has made some 30,000 documents available, which gives a
further idea of the scale of the work. Those doing the inquiry have
indicated that they intend to begin what is called the
“criticism phase” of their work this summer. That will
give individuals who may face criticism in the report the chance to
make representations to the inquiry. Thereafter, the inquiry and Sir
John will have to assimilate those representations into the final

date it originally promised to report and, as the Minister says, it is
an important report. Had the United Kingdom not joined the war, Saddam
would still have been removed and the war would have gone on because
our support was not needed. The crucial point— I do not
know whether the Minister has confirmed this—seems to be what
Bush and Blair cooked up in 2002, because the decision to take the
United Kingdom into the war was probably taken then. That is the
essential point—not why the war took place, but why the United

challenges that Iraq still faces. Most visible and acute is the
terrorist violence that continues to kill all too many people all too
regularly, and I discussed that when I visited Baghdad in

off. In the past three months we have sadly seen an increase in such
attacks, and the UN estimates that more than 1,000 people—mostly
civilians—lost their lives in May alone. We continue to condemn
utterly such acts, and almost all the Iraqi people believe that such

are other longer term difficulties, and many fundamental political
issues remain unresolved with no settled agreement on how power is to
be shared. Ethnic and sectarian divisions remain, often exacerbated by
those elsewhere in the region—particularly in Syria, as others
have mentioned. Over the past six months, those factors have led to
protests in west Iraq, and to disputes between Iraq’s political
leaders that have prevented them from taking the decisions the country
needs. That political deadlock holds back Iraq’s stability, and
in turn its development. As has been rightly pointed out, public
services and standards of living in much of Iraq remain poor, and
corruption and bureaucracy are also problems that must be faced. As we
consistently point out, Iraq’s human rights record remains a
source of

Simmonds:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear
that he will not tempt me away from the well considered Government line
on the Chilcot inquiry. I will not get into the details of the decision
to go to war in Iraq in 2003. His point on Iran has been made by other
hon. Members. I acknowledge and respect his perspective and views, but
the international community has serious concerns about Iran’s
nuclear programme. The Government continue to believe that the
twin-track process of pressure and engagement offers the best hope of
resolving the Iranian nuclear issue. We are not advocating military
action against Iran, but all options should remain on the
table.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000521" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000521">To
return to the positive side of Iraq, the Iraqi Government’s task
is to build on that progress and make the most of the opportunities,
ensuring that Iraq’s economy is booming, and that that
translates into a better life for normal people throughout the country.
Improving the country’s security, which has been fully under
Iraqi control for 18 months, is vital, but the Iraqi Prime Minister and
other political leaders need to find an inclusive political process to
resolve the underlying tensions that, I acknowledge, remain, and
therefore to reduce the space within which the extremists operate. In
that context, I welcome the holding of last Sunday’s Cabinet
meeting in Irbil, which I hope sends a signal of serious intent to
improve relations between the Federal Government and that of the
Kurdistan
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000522" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000522">No
doubt many hon. Members will want to raise Iraq’s relations with
the region. Increasingly, Iraq has been making progress on rebuilding
its relationships with countries that were once adversaries. I was

Minister Maliki in Baghdad only yesterday. That is another sign of the
increasing warmth of relations in the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000523" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000523">The
UK will continue to support Iraq as it faces those challenges. Indeed,
the relationship between our countries is increasingly strong. That is
true at the Government level. Four UK Ministers including myself have
visited Iraq in the past nine months. We visited not only Baghdad, but
Irbil and Basra—my right hon. Friend Lord Green, the Minister
for Trade and Investment, visited Basra. We have relationships in the
Defence Ministries—a meeting took place in London only this

Government and Ministers on a range of issues, including their plans to
improve
security.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000524" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000524">Our
relationship is strongly increasing on a commercial level. Exports were
up significantly, and not only in the hydrocarbon sector. There are
opportunities in sectors such as education, health care, infrastructure
and financial services. The UK Government are doing what we can to
help. For example, when the Foreign Secretary was in Iraq in September,
he agreed we should set up a UK-Iraq ministerial trade council, which
was launched in February by my colleague, the Under-Secretary of State
for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for

Iraqi Airways to schedule direct flights from London to Baghdad for the
first time in more than two decades, which it has done. All of that
will help to cement the closer ties between the UK and Iraq at
individual level. Hon. Members will be aware of

point. When I was in Baghdad in January, there was significant concern
across the political spectrum and the religious divides in Iraq about

March 2003 vote, which I remember very well indeed. The Minister said
that little else was in the minds of Members of Parliament at the time,

sat through the entire debate on the Back Benches, but was not called.
It was only in 2006 that I had the opportunity to speak and explain why
I had made my decision. I had an advantage then, because the weapons
inspector Hans Blix had spoken following the end of the Iraq war. He
said—this is very important—that in March 2003 his belief
was that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. I believed, and
still believe, that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, also believed
that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. It was on that basis

decision.</hs_Para>

never have. It is important to recognise that 139 Labour MPs made the

instability in the middle east currently is caused partly by the Arab
awakening and the response to it, but also by the perceived increased
reluctance of the west to get involved in the region. I believe that
the roots of that reluctance are the events in Iraq in 2003. There are,
however, some positives. It is right to acknowledge that Saddam Hussein
and his sons are no longer in power. None of us in this House mourn the
passing of that dictatorship. That was brought home to me this week. I
returned last night from a visit to the Iraqi region of Kurdistan, as a
guest of the regional Government. It was my first visit to Iraq. In
Barzan, I met victims of Saddam Hussein, including women who had lost
husbands, their faces still etched with grief 30 years on. There is no
doubt in the minds of Kurds—the victims of Halabja and the
Anfal—that the 2003 intervention was justified. I also visited
the Domiz refugee camp, where the Kurdistan regional government,
working with UNHCR, has provided refuge to 150,000 fleeing Syrians,
mainly Syrian Kurds. For someone who voted against the Iraq war, this
was an important
visit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000553" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000553">We
must all today accept that foreign policy is made in the long shadow of
the Iraq war—that cannot be denied—but it should inform,
not paralyse policy. Intervention took place in Libya, authorised by
the UN, backed by the UK Government and supported by the Labour
Opposition. The consequences there are still unfolding, only serving to
confirm the lesson of Iraq: that winning a military victory in the
short term is merely the start of any process of building a stable and
functioning democracy. Ten years on from the Iraq war, I saw earlier
this week that in parts of Iraq we have the beginnings of a new
democracy. Prime Minister Maliki visited Erbil on Sunday, as the
Minister said, to work through issues and disputes that have arisen
between the different parts of Iraq. A political process is going on to
resolve those difficulties, and that is progress, but there are still
massive challenges in Iraq and we must not overstate the progress
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000554" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0002.htm#13061339000554">The

the House for the 2003 vote, and I certainly do not want to focus on it
today; I am far from sure that I would have made the right decision. In
fact, I think I would have been on the wrong side in 2003. It
was not until I was stuck in Iraq in 2003 that I saw what a mess it
was. I want to reflect briefly, therefore, on the lessons we might be
able to draw, not so much from the decision to intervene, but from the
questions about how we got stuck there and why we find it so difficult
to acknowledge our failure.</hs_Para>

point for any discussion of Iraq has to be an acknowledgment that it
was a failure and a scandal. However we look at the costs and benefits
of what happened there, it was probably the worst British foreign
policy decision since the Boer war or the first Anglo-Afghan war of
1839. Never have the British Government made a worse decision. By that,
I do not mean that had I been in the House I would have voted
differently. In fact, I suspect that I would have voted in favour of
the war, wrongly. I hope, however, that this is an opportunity to
reflect on what Parliament is, what the Foreign Office is, what the
military is and how Britain as a whole—or at least
the British policy establishment—could get something so
wrong.</hs_Para>

because there are many similarities between what we did in Iraq and
what we are doing in Afghanistan, and many similarities between those
things and what we occasionally think of doing in Mali or
Syria. At the base of the problem is our refusal to acknowledge
failure, to acknowledge just what a catastrophe it was, and the
House’s refusal to acknowledge how bewildering it was, how
little we know and how complicated countries such as Iraq are. Sitting
in Iraq for 18 months from the middle of 2003 to 2005, I found myself
facing, in a small provincial town called al-Amara, 52 new political
parties, many of them swarming across the border from Iran and many of
them armed.</hs_Para>

Foreign Office or the military, and certainly nobody in the House,
would have been able to distinguish between Hizb-e-Dawa, Harakat-Dawa,
Majlis Ahla, Hezbollah—which turned out in the Iraqi context to
consist of two men with a briefcase—or any of the other
Shi’a Islamist groups that emerged. None of us in the British
policy machine predicted in January 2005 that 90% of the votes in the
south of Iraq would go to only three Shi’a Islamist parties.
Everybody in the foreign policy machine then predicted that it would be
different at the end of 2005, and we were all wrong again. Why were we
wrong? We were wrong because we did not have the right relationship
between politicians, diplomats, soldiers and the local reality of these
countries. We have not got it right yet.</hs_Para>

got it right because it is not realistic today—as it was not
realistic at the time of the Boer war or the first Anglo-Afghan
war—to expect people in Parliament to be experts on the internal
politics of Iraq. What really began to go wrong after the invasion,
beyond the decision about WMD, was all to do with micro-relationships
in Nasiriyah and al-Amara and in the relationships between the
different grand ayatollahs in Najaf. These are not things that anyone
in the Chamber, however well briefed, can pretend to understand or
judge. Instead, we have to rely on the military, the Foreign Office and
the intelligence agencies, and there the problem starts. The problem
starts because the entire structure of our organisations—their
incentives, 
<?notus-xml column=547?>their promotions, their recruitment, how they interact with policy
makers, politicians and Ministers—does not help us ever to
acknowledge failure. In fact, these institutions are designed to trap
us in these countries.</hs_Para>

made by people going out for short tours. I remind the House and those
in the Foreign Office that the initial tours in Iraq were for six
weeks, extended to three months, then to six months. The
idea—that people living in heavily defended compounds, moving
around in armoured vehicles, generally unable to speak a word of any
local language, unable to interact with an Iraqi for more than half an
hour or an hour at a time, except if surrounded by heavily armed men
and operating through translators, could really get a sense of whether
Iraq was stabilising or what, to use the Minister’s words, Iraq
would be like in 10 years—was of course misleading. The advice
and challenge that they could provide to the Government, therefore, was
not good enough.</hs_Para>

Stewart:</Member></B> That is a very good point, and perhaps it is a
way for me to wrap up my analysis of the Foreign Office. Of course,
this is not a uniquely American problem. Within any British civil
service Department, there is no great incentive to admit failure. When
I look back at the reports I wrote stuck in al-Amara and Nasiriyah, I
find it extraordinary how every week, I claimed great success. Every
week, I would write, “We’ve hired another 300 people into
the police. We’ve held a new sub-district election. I’ve
just created 3,000 jobs. We’ve just refurbished another set of
clinics and schools.” To read report after report, week after
week, it looks as if the whole thing is getting better and better. In
retrospect, I know differently, of course. When I began, I could go
into the bazaar to get an ice cream, but by the end, I was stuck in my
compound with 140 rocket and mortar-propelled grenades flying at the
compound, and we had to abandon it and retreat back to a military base,
essentially surrendering Nasiriyah, a city of 600,000
people, to the insurgents.</hs_Para>

is not helped by the way we talk about it in Britain today. We do not
really think very much about Iraq. We do not think very much about what
exactly Iraq is doing with Iran or Syria at the moment, why exactly
Iraq got involved in dubious banking transactions to bust sanctions on
behalf of the Iranian Government or why exactly our great ally,
al-Maliki, appears to have been allowing trans-shipment of weapons from
Iran into Syria. Why do we not think about these things? It is because
we are not very serious. At some level, this country is no longer being
as serious as it should be about foreign policy. Our newspapers are not

<?notus-xml column=548?>writing enough about Iraq. The Foreign Office is not thinking enough
about the failure. The military is not thinking enough about these
things. Unless we acknowledge that something went wrong in Iraq and
that something went deeply wrong in Afghanistan, we will get ourselves
stuck again.</hs_Para>

Stewart:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman has raised exactly the point
that we need to talk about. We believe that somehow it is all the fault
of Blair and Bush—this is the myth that has entered the national
consciousness. My experience as someone inside the system is that we
have to look much more deeply at ourselves. We need to look at the
Foreign Office, the military, the intelligence services and Parliament.
These people, Blair and Bush, do not operate in a vacuum; they operate
in a culture that did not challenge and shape the debate sufficiently.
It is not realistic for Blair or Bush to know deeply about these
situations and it is simply a constitutional convention, of course,
that the people who make the decision are the Blairs and the Bushes.
However, if we look at what got us trapped on the ground in
Iraq—at why, for example, the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy
and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) found it difficult to get out of Iraq or why
President Obama found it difficult to say no to the surge—it is
because these people are part of a much bigger system.</hs_Para>

that system is threefold. First, we need radically to reform the way in
which the Foreign Office operates. The Foreign Secretary has begun; we
need to go much further, thinking all the time about the lessons of
Iraq and Afghanistan. We need to focus on people with deep linguistic
and cultural expertise. We need to ensure that we change all the
bureaucratic mechanisms. The core competency framework for promotion in
the Foreign Office needs to be changed. The amount that people are paid
for learning languages in the Foreign Office needs to be changed. The
posting lengths need to be changed. The security conditions for the
Foreign Office need to be changed, because unless we begin to
understand deeply and rigorously what is happening on the ground, it is
difficult to challenge the Blairs and the
Bushes.</hs_Para>

Lucas:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for making such a
powerful speech, but when it comes to whether it is right or wrong to
blame Bush and Blair, I think he is being a little too generous in his
assessment of them. He is giving the impression that they were sitting

here to defend that decision—it was a terrible, catastrophic
decision—but I think it is dangerous to put 
<?notus-xml column=549?>the whole blame simply on Blair and Bush, because the implication is
that if we do not have Blair and Bush around, we will never get in
these messes again. We will get in these messes again because we have

reforms—you have very kindly given me some time, Mr Deputy
Speaker, but I do not have enough to talk about this
today—involve accepting that the military have too much power in
the policy debate. That is not the military’s fault: they are
filling a vacuum. The military feel that the Foreign Office is not
taking the lead and that somebody needs to do something. I saw that all
the time on the ground in Iraq. I remember a major-general saying to
me, “The diplomats and aid workers aren’t doing anything,
so we”—the military—“need to take those
things over,” but that is not the military’s job. It is
extremely dangerous, because its puts generals in positions where they
make optimistic predictions about their capacity to sort things out,

of those aspects of governance or diplomacy.</hs_Para>

Parliament need to look at ourselves—it is on this that we need
to conclude. The hon. Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn) was exactly
right to ask us to look hard at how the Select Committee on Defence,
the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Intelligence and
Security Committee got this wrong. What reforms have we introduced to
those Committees to ensure that we do not get it wrong again? How do we
as Members of Parliament operate in a very complicated world? It is not
realistic for any of us in this Chamber to understand exactly what the
difference is between Harakat-Dawa, Hizb-e-Dawa and Hizb-e-Dawa
Islamiya. Everybody is learning desperately from briefs, trying to
sound plausible, but there are 200 nations in the world. Ministers are
busy. Politicians are busy; they are worrying about their constituents.
They are not deep experts on these issues. We therefore need to create
a system that we can rely on in the Foreign Office, the military and
the intelligence services. We in Parliament need to know how to
question those people, how to listen to them and how to promote people
who disagree with us. We need in Parliament to learn how to look at
which civil servants got it wrong and hold them accountable, rather
than promoting, as we did, almost everybody who was implicated in the
Iraq decisions.</hs_Para>

hindsight, and following debates on this topic, that one sentence of Mr

second UN resolution, when most of the world was against the incursion.
He had decided that the UK would lend its support to President
Bush’s war on terror, whatever the cost. Let us be realistic;
Bush had the might to do this in short order in any event. He wanted a
cloak of legitimacy, and that is how he lured Tony Blair in to support

Iran and North Korea, obtaining nuclear weapons, and the risk of
terrorism at home has definitely increased. We have heard quotes from

for claiming that al-Qaeda had a real presence in Iraq before 2003, but
the war itself has established one. The human cost has also been
devastating. Between March 2003 and the end of UK operations in May
2011, 179 UK armed forces personnel died as a consequence of operations
in Iraq. Of those, 136 were killed in combat. I join other Members
across the House in paying tribute to them. Whatever foreign policy

2004, I opened a debate calling for the advice of the Attorney-General
on the legality of the war in Iraq to be published in full. I said
during that debate that Treasury counsel would have received
instructions when they were advising the Attorney-General, and that,
had counsel been ill informed or misled in those instructions, the
advice would have been flawed ab initio. I said that it was of the
utmost importance to establish whether the instructions given by the
Attorney-General contained reference to the now infamous 45-minute
claim. Had these instructions contained such references and had counsel
accepted them as valid, the whole basis of that advice would obviously
have been flawed. I made it clear in the debate that the ministerial
code holds no bar on publishing such advice. In fact, the code

argued at the time and I argue now that it is in the wider public
interest on going to war that disclosure should be made, for

publishing the advice of the Attorney-General—including, for
example, the Belfast riots and the Archer-Shee cases. I cited the
opinions of five distinguished international lawyers who each had
differing views about whether the war in Iraq had been legal, but who

it to say here that I discovered that Ms Aldred, the gatekeeper for the

of foreign and defence policy secretariat, was put forward for her new
role, in which she would inquire into the actions taken in that same
foreign and defence policy, by the Cabinet Secretary himself, Sir Gus
O’Donnell. The potential conflict of interest was breathtaking.
I discovered that in her previous role, Ms Aldred had regularly chaired
the Iraq senior officials group. Let us not forget either that it was
the Cabinet Office, for which Ms Aldred had worked previously, that
drew up plans for regime change and that it was the Cabinet Office and
the Joint Intelligence Committee and its staff that produced the
“dodgy dossier”. Her hands were hardly clean for that
particular job. Thanks to the detective work of Dr Chris Lamb and
others, we further discovered that this appointment had not followed
the procedures set out in the civil service code and was neither open
nor indeed transparent. I countered that her appointment to this role
obviously made it questionable whether the inquiry was a Cabinet Office
subsidiary. In the continued absence of the Chilcot inquiry’s
report into the war, I am unable to comment further on this issue. But

truth in it, and I would be interested to see some of the papers to get

final point is that we must learn the lessons of history. I suspect my

a very difficult and torrid time, and many of the issues we faced in
2003 were identical, both in intention and implication. We must make
sure that we do not end up across the region with three countries: a
Sunni country, a Shi’a country and a Kurdish country. My group
at King’s college at that time was explicit about that, and we
see the same issue arising again now in relation to Syria. If we end up
with those sorts of conflicts arising over the next few years, we will
have to see our invasion of Iraq as being the first step in causing
some deep fragmentation, some great destabilisation and some great

Michael Meacher</B> (Oldham West and Royton) (Lab):</Member> I
congratulate the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) on
securing this debate from the Backbench Business Committee, and for her
forceful, eloquent and moving opening speech. It is difficult to say
the same of the Minister, who, constrained by the unpublished Chilcot
report, chose to say, in almost half an hour, very little of substance,
although he did give what I thought was a distinctly Panglossian view
of the improvement in the state of Iraq, grossly
overstating the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000645" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000645">There
has, however, been a great degree of honesty and frankness from all
Members, which is extremely refreshing. I particularly congratulate in
that context my colleague on the Front Bench, my hon. Friend the Member
for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), and although it is always invidious to pick
out one person, I thought the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border
(Rory Stewart) gave a remarkable speech, making what I think, in my
lengthy experience, must be a unique statement in this Chamber: that we
should be more willing to admit our own failings. It is true that there
is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, but that is not a
doctrine we normally find expounded here.</hs_Para>

over some of the fundamentals. Now, 10 years on, the facts cannot
seriously be held in doubt, and they are stark. The United States went
to war in 
<?notus-xml column=560?>Iraq because of oil and because American control of the middle east
region was considered important for their foreign policy, as clearly
set out in the Project for a New American Century document published by
the Bush election team in September 2000. As we now know from then US
Treasury Secretary O’Neill, that war was planned from the very
first day of the Bush Administration, and 9/11 simply provided the
pretext for launching
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000647" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000647">The
United Kingdom went to war because President Bush wanted UK support. I
do not think there is any doubt that at the Crawford summit in April
2002, the then Prime Minister Tony Blair in effect committed to
providing that support, publicly pledging that he was going to stand
shoulder to shoulder with President Bush. From that point on, the
assessment of the intelligence data conflated analysis into advocacy,
to find a rationale for the war which had already been decided on for
other reasons. That, I believe, is the
explanation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000648" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000648">The
decision having been made to go to war, Whitehall provided a briefing
that any rationale depended on being able to show incontrovertible
evidence of large-scale—I emphasise: large-scale—activity
by Iraq to obtain weapons of mass destruction, but because the UN
inspectors had left Iraq in 1998, evidence was non-existent or
certainly flimsy. The CIA admitted that its resources on Iraq were
“thin” and the UK’s Joint Intelligence Committee
had already concluded, in March 2002,
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13061339000921" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000921">“Intelligence

is that in the evidence put together in those crucial five months
between the Crawford summit and the publication of the September
dossier to justify the war, all the specific data were flawed. The
first and central point is that the inventory of chemical and
biological weapons and weapon parts that the then Prime Minister
presented to the House dealt with weapons that were unaccounted for in
the first Gulf war, 12 years earlier, but they were not presented as
weapons that were unaccounted for; they were presented as weapons that
Saddam Hussein was definitely believed to possess.</hs_Para>

Meacher:</Member></B> Yes—I am glad the hon. Gentleman has given
me the opportunity to say, in the spirit of honesty and frankness of
this debate, that I am utterly ashamed of what I did on that occasion.
It is the worst political mistake that I have made in my lifetime, but
I want to say why I did it. I did it because I listened carefully to
the then Prime Minister during those two crucial debates. He spoke with
enormous assurance and authority, and I believed that, as Prime
Minister of this country, he would have been presented with the fullest
degree and comprehensiveness of UK intelligence, and he would use those
data in a proper and honest manner to make the case. Perhaps I was
naive to think that—I now believe that I was—but that is
what I believed. I am 
<?notus-xml column=561?>speaking today because I am so angry at having been
deceived. That experience has deeply damaged my trust in the role of
Prime Ministers and in the link between intelligence and the various
Departments of State and the Prime Minister, who speaks for the
Government. I hope that that will be repaired in future, but the damage
done has been considerable, certainly to
me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000654" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000654">I
was talking about the 45-minute claim referring to battlefield nuclear
weapons. When the media took it up—the hon. Member for South
Thanet (Laura Sandys) forcefully recalled the <I>Evening Standard</I>
headline—that was not corrected, even though the authorities
knew very well that the wrong impression was being
given.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000655" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000655">Thirdly,
the claim that Iraq tried to buy 500 tonnes of yellowcake, which is
required for nuclear fission, from Niger was included in the dossier,
despite its having been confirmed by a visit by the former US
ambassador to that country six months before that it was completely
bogus. None the less, the claim was
included.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000656" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000656">The
fourth point, which is very important but which has received little
attention, is that the then Prime Minister of this country

Lucas:</Member></B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for the
tenor of his speech and for putting that fact more strongly in the
public domain. To clarify: that piece of information was available in
February 2003. The fact that it was covered up to such an
extent—not even covered up, but completely
contradicted—is one of the most shocking deceits in this whole
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000659" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000659"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Meacher" PimsId="1857" UID="13061339001379" xid="421" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339001379">Mr
Meacher:</Member></B> I entirely agree. That is precisely why I feel so

the Butler report points out so poignantly, all the ifs, buts,
qualifications and caveats in the raw intelligence data were dropped
from the dossier, while the positive allegations were distinctly
overhyped. We all know that. Sources were treated as reliable when they
were clearly not, and they were not checked against the expertise of
intelligence staff. Anyone who has read appendix B of the Butler
report, which was excellently put together, can see set out, step by
step, how the massaging and accretion steadily accumulated until we
were told in the final September dossier that Saddam’s weapons
of mass destruction programme was—in words that have echoed for
the past 10 years—“active, detailed and growing”
and that the intelligence on which that judgment was based was
“extensive, detailed and authoritative”. In fact, as we
now know, Blair had been told just over a month previously, by the UK
intelligence community, that</hs_Para>

great issue is accountability in relation to the Prime
Minister’s own judgment, his deceitful presentation and his
over-eagerness to take Britain into a war on grounds that far exceeded
the evidence to justify them. One cannot take a country into a war

most striking characteristic of the Butler report is this disjunction
between analysis and judgment. It is excellent on analysis and very
poor, very cautious and very fearful about judgment. It catalogues a
litany of failures and then pulls all its punches by declaring that, in
effect, no one was to blame. I have to say that George Tenet was sacked
as head of the CIA for intelligence failures over Iraq, but John
Scarlett, who held the equivalent position in the UK and was equally
responsible for the intelligence failures, is still recommended by the
report for promotion, despite all the damning evidence in the report to
the contrary. It is a very British establishment charade, when what is
really needed is genuine accountability. I think everyone on all sides
of the House is seeking that. But that the excuse is made that no one
can be held to account and that it just somehow happened is completely
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000664" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000664"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Ellwood" PimsId="4771" UID="13061339001380" xid="808" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339001380">Mr

but, on the point about the Joint Intelligence Committee, it is the
responsibility of Government to digest intelligence. The information is
slid across the table and then it is the Government of the day and
Whitehall who make the assessments. If the intelligence is scant, the
Government need to respond on the day. Does he agree that people such
as Mr Scarlett did their job? It became difficult for them when the
documents were slid back across the table by people like Alastair

Meacher:</Member></B> I agree that the intelligence community can only
do what it can do. There are limits to the amount of information it can
provide and the politicians then have a responsibility to reflect that.

selective, but that they said the opposite of what they were being

unforgivable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000666" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000666">There
are two issues on which those responsible must be held to account. One
is the presentation of the evidence to the House to agree to war. Being
sinuous with the truth may not exactly be lying but it is certainly not
open or honest. Presenting a seriously misleading account of the facts
may not be lying either but it is certainly not truthful or
straightforward. The second question is about the framework of
governance that allowed this to happen. On that point, of course, it
would have been much better if we had had the Chilcot report, but we
still have to wait for its recommendations. I think everyone in the
House agrees that it is far too long delayed and we need the report
urgently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000667" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000667">Even
10 years on, we still have not been told the crucial evidence of the
secret pledges that Blair made to Bush at his Crawford ranch in Texas
some 10 months before the war began and, of course, before consulting
the Cabinet, Parliament or the British people. Chilcot has seen this
evidence but, as I understand it, has been prevented from publishing
it, even though Blair himself, as well as Jonathan Powell and Alastair
Campbell have 
<?notus-xml column=563?>disclosed privileged information when it has suited their case when they
have given evidence to the inquiry. Being told, as we have been, that
it is not in the public interest that it should be disclosed is, in my

public interest that it should be

second dimension is what the war has achieved. On this 10th
anniversary, it has been said that the US won the war, Iran won the
peace and Turkey won the contracts. But did the US win the war? At a
cost that has been estimated at $1.5 trillion, something
over £1 trillion—Joseph Stiglitz, a former member
of the presidential economic council, thinks it is actually twice that
level—and at a cost to the US of a death toll of 4,500 troops,
32,000 wounded and with thousands of survivors still struck down with
post-traumatic stress disorder, the US completely failed to anticipate
the insurgency that eventually forced it out. Moreover, the war
actually produced the one thing that the US was desperately anxious to
prevent; namely a Shi’a autocracy in Iraq, closely aligned with
a resurgent Shi’a Iran. Even the US goal of securing control of
the enormous Iraqi oil reserves, second only to those of Saudi Arabia,
it was forced to forgo. If one had to pinpoint the moment when the US
lost unipolar power as the world’s hegemon, it must surely be
this comprehensive disaster of the Iraq
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000672" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000672">As
for Iraq itself, it remains a bitterly divided and violent country, as
others have said. It is not only the hundreds of thousands of dead and,
at the height of the war, the 4 million refugees, but after nine years
of occupation by US and British troops, thousands are still tortured
and imprisoned without trial, health and education have dramatically
deteriorated, the position of women has horrifically gone backwards,
trade unions are effectively banned, Baghdad is still divided by the
checkpoints and the blast walls, the electricity and water
supplies have all but broken down, and people pay with their lives if
they are honest enough to speak
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000673" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000673">In
the longer term, the war has undermined the moral standing of the US
and the UK across the world, not only in the middle east. It generated
the al-Qaeda presence, which certainly was not there before, and it
sent a clear message, which has emboldened Iran and North Korea, that
the only way to deter US blackmail and attack was indeed to acquire
weapons of mass destruction. It could even be said
about the war without 
<?notus-xml column=564?>exaggeration that the greatest weapons of mass destruction were those
wielded by the Americans. We saw the comprehensive and systematic
demolition of Falluja, the US-led massacres at Haditha, Mahmudiya and
Balad, and the biggest refugee crisis in the middle east since the
ethnic cleansing of Palestine in
1948.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000674" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000674">My
third and final consideration lies in the lessons, briefly, that can be
drawn from this disaster. The chief one, as I said, concerns the
governance structure that allowed it to happen in the first place. As
we know, there was the mendacious, illegal and devious manner in which
the US and the UK claimed authority in launching the war at all. Saddam
had no involvement whatever in 9/11. There were no Iraqi weapons of
mass destruction, as was widely suspected by western intelligence at
the time, but suppressed by the politicians. The ways used by Bush and
Blair to take their countries to war were, as we know all too well,
brazenly

there was, but that vote was on the very eve of war, hours before the
bombing started when, with 45,000 British troops already deployed in
the field, it was virtually impossible to draw back. So the first
lesson is obviously that in any such future scenario—God forbid
that there ever should be such a future scenario—the House of
Commons vote must be at a much earlier stage in the process when war is
first seriously being contemplated and at that stage the documentation
must be provided to justify, or purport to justify, the war, and that
must be fully disclosed to the House before the vote is

has to ask why the vote was taken so late. Maybe—I can only
speculate—it was precisely to put pressure on Members of this
House for what was virtually a fait accompli, which would compel a
majority of them to support it. I pay enormous tribute to the 139 MPs

Indeed, there was to be an alternative convening of Parliament in
Church House, at which we would have had a critical mass, and only 48
hours before the Government conceded that there would be a vote. We had
enough Members to convene a Parliament to discuss the Iraq war, and the
former Speaker, Bernard Weatherill, was prepared to chair it. It would
have included Members from across the House, including some very brave
Conservative Members, Members from the Liberal party and friends from
the smaller parties across the political spectrum. But 122 Labour
Members voted on the first occasion, and indeed the numbers went up on
the second vote, which is unheard of, given the whipping operation

It has been claimed in this debate is that the whipping was not very

second lesson—I will be quick, Madam Deputy Speaker, because I
know that I have been speaking for some time—is that the power
and wilfulness of a Prime Minister who can so brazenly override normal
democratic procedures, quite apart from the personality of Tony Blair,
is a very serious issue. He made a commitment to go to war at
Bush’s Crawford ranch in Texas 10 months before that vote and
without consulting anyone. He regularly told Parliament, right up to
the very start of the war, that no decision had been taken. Clearly an
unstoppable momentum had been deliberately built up. He lent heavily on
his Attorney-General between 7 and 17 March to induce him to chance his
legal warning that the war was not legal. On 15 February he ignored and
dismissed the biggest protest demonstration this country has ever seen,
with up to 2 million members of the public marching against the war.
According to evidence given by the UK’s ambassador to the US at
the time, Sir Christopher Meyer, Bush even rung up Tony Blair to
suggest that he could “sit out the war”, while the
Pentagon’s Donald Rumsfeld was quite happy to go in alone, but
Blair was obsessive and determined to see it through. In an interview

McCartney</B> (Colne Valley) (Con):</Member> Thank you for calling me
to speak in this debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. Please excuse my croaky
voice, but I was very keen to speak for two reasons. First, as a Royal
Air Force officer I served in Operation Warden, the no-fly zone over
Northern Iraq in the 1990s; and secondly, just a fortnight ago, I was
honoured to return Iraq 18 years on from my military service there. I
want to give my perspective on Iraq pre and post the war of
2003.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000688" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000688">In
the 1990s, Operation Warden was the no-fly zone over northern Iraq
which operated from Incirlik airbase in Turkey. Aircraft from the UK,
the US, France and Turkey prevented Saddam Hussein from waging his war
against Iraq’s 5 million Kurds. Prior to the no-fly zone, Saddam
Hussein’s forces slaughtered many thousands of Iraqi Kurds. This
included chemical weapon attacks at Halabja and mass executions
culminating in the Anfal campaigns of
1988.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000689" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000689">In
1995, during my tour, I joined coalition officers from the military
co-ordination centre in Zakho, northern Iraq. We toured Kurdish
villages near Dohuk and Irbil. Meeting village elders, we spread the
word that the only aircraft flying above were coalition ones and that
we could help with medical supplies and other immediate necessities
such as electricity generators. We were given a warm welcome. The
no-fly zone saved lives and has meant that Iraq’s 5 million
Kurds have experienced relative stability since the end of the 1991
Gulf war.</hs_Para>

of 2003, Iraq’s 2005 federal constitution gave the Kurdistan
regional government an unprecedented level of self-government. Eighteen
years on from my military service, I was back in northern Iraq two
weeks ago as a guest of the Kurdistan regional government via the
all-party group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq. I saw the peaceful and
increasingly prosperous Erbil and its surrounding areas. This fairly
secular region sees Christians, Jews and Muslims living side by side.
In fact, over 2 million tourists visited the region last year. The
Erbil citadel, 6,000 years old, is the world’s oldest
continuously inhabited settlement and a big tourist attraction. Again,
the welcome was warm and
friendly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000691" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000691">For
many years I have spoken of my opposition to the 2003 Iraq war. I come
at it from a slightly different angle—a military angle. My view
was that Saddam 
<?notus-xml column=567?>Hussein was a caged animal because the northern
no-fly zone, like the one in the south, was preventing any repeat of
his previous atrocities. However, it is clear that the
dictator’s removal has allowed Kurdistan to move on. Weapons of
mass destruction or oil are often cited as reasons for going to war, as
they have been in this Chamber today, but it is the regime change that
has made a huge difference in the north of the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000692" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000692">Having
been helped themselves, the Iraqi Kurds are now helping others. On this
month’s trip we spent an emotional day at the Domiz refugee camp
near the Iraq-Syria border. Some 130,000 Syrian Kurds have fled the
fighting in Syria. I spoke with many refugees, including children, who
continue to be educated in specially constructed schools. The Kurdistan
regional government deserves praise for funding and arranging
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000693" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000693">As
has been said, however, all is not well in Iraq. There are tensions and
rifts between the Kurdistan regional government and Baghdad, the
capital is plagued by violence—a post-2006 record of 1,000
people were killed in May alone—and there is a bitter dispute
over revenue sharing, as a new oil pipeline from Kurdistan into Turkey
nears completion. With an estimated 45 billion barrels of
oil reserves—the fourth largest in the world—and a
century’s worth of natural gas, the Kurdistan regional
government has become a major player and its dispute with Baghdad is
now based on the breakdown of revenue sharing. KRG is supposed to get
17% of national revenues and, by the same token, should pay 83% of
whatever it earns into the national
treasury.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000694" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000694">Kurdistan’s
relative stability is now a strong pull for foreign investors. It is
not just about oil—hotel and leisure groups are investing there.
I hope that this can be a model for the rest of Iraq. Given recent
events in neighbouring Turkey, the violence and civil war in Syria and
the upcoming elections in Iran, the region and western nations need a

were opposed to the war—about 30 or 40 of them—who had
signed motions and early-day motions against it were bribed, bullied
and bamboozled into changing their minds to either abstain or vote in
favour of it. Almost all of them regret that bitterly. It was the most
important vote of our careers and it is not true to say that it was
easy to make our minds up. It was not. The threat was there that we
would lose our seats and that the Prime Minister would resign. Members
who were in any doubt were called in to see Ministers to be persuaded.
Members of the Committees who had knowledge that we did not have, such
as the Intelligence and Security Committee, went around cajoling Back

whether we should stop the war. We could never have stopped the war,
because Bush was determined to go in. Saddam would have been removed
anyway. The decision that we had to make in Parliament was whether our
soldiers should be involved in that. Tony Blair admitted to the
shoulder-to-shoulder comment. He almost certainly made his decision in
2002, when he shook hands with Bush and said, “I’ll be
with you.” They then invented the facts in order to present this
House with a false agenda. If he had not persuaded 40 or so Labour
Members to vote the other way, we would not have gone to
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000705" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000705">Tony

activity of people such as the Kagans. Kimberly and Frederick Kagan are
a married couple who were at Petraeus’s right hand. They were
privy to all the private conversations, went to every secret meeting,
and wrote Petraeus’s report to the Defence Secretary on what was
happening in Afghanistan. Each time, they wanted a more hard-edged
approach to military activities and more aggression, and each time,
they tried to sabotage the peace initiatives. The Kagans were not
employed by the military or by Petraeus—their paymasters 
<?notus-xml column=570?>were the defence industry and contractors. There was a strong element of
that in Iraq and certainly in Afghanistan, and we must look to such
things and to the revolving door that means that wars go on. We are at

parliamentarians, I had the opportunity to visit checkpoint Charlie.
Anybody who visits will be aware of the big sections of the Berlin wall
that remain, covered in graffiti, as symbols of how divided that city
was. We find the same walls and constructs—blast
containers—all over Baghdad, Kabul, Helmand and so on. When will
sections of walls in Baghdad or Basra serve no other purpose than to
remind us and remain as symbols of events in the
past?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000714" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000714">I
congratulate the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) on
securing this important debate. I am grateful for it. It is appropriate
to discuss the lessons learned, considering that almost 200 lives were
lost, and that the campaign cost the taxpayer almost £8 billion.
I declare an interest as a former regular member of the armed forces
and a serving member of the reserve forces. I pay tribute, as other
hon. Members have, to those who served and to the fallen—those
whose lives are permanently changed through injury and, particularly,
those who did not

analysis should be divided into three different areas: first, the
justification for intervention; secondly, the military campaign and
defeating the enemy; and thirdly, the stabilisation and reconstruction
phase. General Petraeus, who had a long-term involvement in Iraq,
famously said that it was not enough to defeat the 
<?notus-xml column=571?>enemy, and that, if we are to intervene, we need to enable the local.
Those are wise words to remember no matter where we want to go, whether
upstream or on any campaign or
intervention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000716" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000716">Although
we might disagree with intervention, I am not sure we would be having
this debate and making the cases we are making if the stabilisation and
reconstruction had been more of a success story. I would go further
than that and say that Tony Blair would probably have continued as
leader of his party and not been taken over by his Chancellor had peace
prevailed, had Basra been a success, and had the situation not
deteriorated as it did in the aftermath of the
invasion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000717" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000717">Like
other hon. Members, I await the outcome of the Chilcot inquiry, which
will be illuminating. I and other hon. Members attended a number of its
sessions. It was interesting to hear people giving direct accounts of
their roles, small and large, in the decision-making process, not least
the military leaders who gave evidence who felt pulled between
commitments in Iraq and continuing commitments in Afghanistan, to which
hon. Members have referred. Unfortunately, I believe the inquiry will
make unpleasant reading for the Labour Government in respect of some of
their
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000718" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000718">On
the justification for intervention, I spoke out prior to invasion
against intervention. I made that absolutely clear, even though the
Conservative party seemed to be in favour. As a military person, I
define a threat as it is defined militarily—a threat is the
ability and intent to cause harm. A threat is not just the desire to
cause harm to another person, region, community or state; it must be
matched with the means. People must have capability to pose a threat.
If the two are not together, in military terms, the threat does not
exist. That is why I began to question the justification for the
invasion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000719" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000719">I
do not have the same problem as other hon. Members with the build-up of
armed forces, because that shows intent. We needed to build up capacity
to allow the politicians to make the decision. Building up armed forces
can persuade the enemy to change their minds. We cut the oak for the
ships used in the battle of Trafalgar well in advance of any admiralty
decision to attack, but it was in mind and preparations needed to take
place. I also do not have much of a problem with the vote in the House
on the war itself. As I said, I would have put my hand up to say that I
was not convinced. Many in the House were convinced by the intelligence
that was presented to them.</hs_Para>

now that there were many flaws in the intelligence and that the House
was misled on, for example, the 45-minute claim that our British bases
in Cyprus were somehow under threat from tactical weapons of mass
destruction. There was the very sad role of Alistair Campbell
interfering with John Scarlett’s report and directing British
intelligence dossiers to complement US intelligence. He was then forced
to resign following the tragic death of David Kelly. There was the role
of General Colin Powell, for whom I have a huge amount of respect. Not
long ago, he admitted that his Adlai Stevenson moment—if I can
put it that way—when he addressed the United Nations to give
evidence for the justification of war in February 2003, was one
of the most regrettable moments of his career. There was 
<?notus-xml column=572?>the CIA’s claim about yellowcake coming from Niger, which was
used in President Bush’s state of the union address, leading,
when the truth came out, to Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, Lewis
“Scooter” Libby, going to prison.</hs_Para>

what Hans Blix knew has been raised a number of times and is still
debated. It is clear that while working for the International Atomic
Energy Agency and leading the weapons inspectors, he continued to have
full access in the country, even if Saddam Hussein was not co-operating
fully. He had not found any evidence and could have continued in the
country for as long as he liked, but was told leave by the Americans
because of the impending invasion. We now realise that there was a
single intelligence source—an exiled scientist living in
Germany—stating that Saddam Hussein had tactical weapons of mass
destruction. That was never corroborated. Finally, United Nations
resolution 1441 did not actually give the right to invade—a
point made clearly by France. It leant on previous resolution 687,
which provided for the right to invade if certain conditions were not
met. The UN Secretary-General said that he was uncomfortable with
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000722" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000722">I
do not stand here as an apologist and say that war was not avoidable.
It might have been, but I do not believe that invasion was justified at
that juncture. As has been said a number of times, hindsight is a
wonderful thing, but one wonders whether Saddam Hussein would have
survived the Arab spring or whether, through a natural process of
change in the middle east, we would have seen him removed. It is
difficult to
say.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000723" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000723">In
his book “State of Denial” Bob Woodward quotes General
Franks, the United States central commander in the middle east, on
being asked, in December 2001—when we had just gone into

perspective the energy and determination to push forward with
intervention in
Iraq.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000724" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000724">On
the intervention itself, Operation Telic went as well as it could have
done. In the first three weeks of March 2003, we managed to defeat the
enemy completely and were seen as liberators. I pay tribute to the
7th Army Brigade, which had to set up in a very awkward and
difficult environment to establish the peace. The one lesson to be
learned relates to the shock and awe policy. It is a matter for further
debate, but I do not now think it is right for us, armed with these
incredible long-range weapons, to destroy infrastructure on such a
scale—the very same infrastructure that we will need a
couple of weeks after putting boots on the ground. When a decision to
invade is taken, we have to be more cognisant of the need to disrupt
and take out the enemy without causing more damage and costing us more
in the long-term.</hs_Para>

long after the initial invasion that the British started patrolling in
berets, using our skills base from Northern Ireland to win over hearts
and minds by looking less offensive in our military outfits in order to
work with locals. It soon became apparent, however, after the
successful invasion, that there was no plan or strategy—no idea
what to do or how to harness the euphoria following Saddam
Hussein’s fall in order to sow the seeds of
governance—and so nothing happened and we went from liberators
to occupiers. Where was the army of civil servants, linguists,
engineers and planners—the people with the skill sets to rebuild
Basra 
<?notus-xml column=573?>and help its people move forward? And let us not forget the significance
of Basra, whose people were elated to get rid of Saddam Hussein, who
was never a friend of the city, and whose strategic importance cannot

moving oil out of the country.</hs_Para>

explained how Clare Short, then at the Department for International
Development, which was the one organisation with the money to provide
reconstruction and development planning, decided not to participate and
sent a message around the Department to that effect. As a result, our
armed forces were left on their own. She should have been sacked
immediately. I am pleased to say that now the relationship between the
Ministry of Defence, DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has
improved immensely, but the culture at the time, underlined—I am

Iraq was not Britain’s finest hour. This was there with the Suez

plan. The decision to disband the army and de-Ba’athify Iraq in
one fell swoop was bizarre and ignored the fact that teachers, nurses
and others were forced to be part of the Ba’ath party. As soon
as we made it illegal and those who were part of it unable to work, we
lost the mindset of support from an important swathe of the
middle-class population.</hs_Para>

makes for grievous reading. In summer 2007, we failed to do any
development and reconstruction. Our military were forced to withdraw
from the city centre, as it became untenable to stay there, and
relocate to the airport. The Prime Minister, Mr Maliki,

anything happening, a vacuum developed. Gangs formed, which turned into
militia, which then ran the city. In 2008, it was not the British who
liberated the city; it was the Iraqi army. Maliki came down to Basra
and decided the situation needed to come to an end and that the Mahdi
army needed to be pushed out. In spring 2009, our military interest in
Iraq came to an end. We did not hand the base over to the Iraqi army;
we handed it over to the Americans.</hs_Para>

after any invasion or intervention, we have a window of three to six
months to get things right before the enemy can regroup and the
locals then decide, “Actually, life is no better under the new
regime than it was under the old.” We missed that window of
opportunity, which cost Britain lives—as it did
others in the international community—because of
our reluctance to do what was required. My concern is this. We
sit at the international top table. We are a power with nuclear
weapons, we have a place on the Security Council and we have centuries
of serious war fighting experience, and we could not even hold a
medium-sized conurbation. The armed forces were under immense strain
during this period. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, this
was tied in with, and happened at the same time as, our decision to
make an even grander commitment in Afghanistan, with two air bridges
operating, to the point that our armed forces were almost
unable to cope.</hs_Para>

talked about some of the success stories. Many of us have visited Iraq
many times. I recently went to Irbil. It is very pleasing indeed to see
how much the region has moved forward from the atrocities it endured
under Saddam Hussein. I only hope that such success can be emulated in
the rest of the country. Unfortunately, Iraq is not in the headlines
anymore, because our troops are not there, but as hon. Members 
<?notus-xml column=575?>across the House have mentioned, there were as many
deaths in this last month as there were in 2008. The scale of
continuing atrocities is quite shocking.</hs_Para>

conclusion, there are serious questions about our decision to go to war
in the first place, about how Parliament debates these matters and
about our ability to do post-conflict reconstruction. This House
regularly pays tribute to our armed forces for their commitment and
professionalism and the sacrifice they make for our country, but in the
long history of British military engagements, Iraq was far from our
finest hour. That was no fault of theirs, I should say, but falls
totally on the shoulders of the Government of the day, who failed to
plan for peace. I am pleased that the Prime Minister, in looking at
other interventions, which have also been mentioned in this debate, has
introduced three conditions for this House to approve any intervention.
First, is there a legal basis for intervention? Secondly, is there
regional support? Thirdly, is there an international commitment to the
cause? I hope that, as we look for solutions in Syria and the Sahel,
the Prime Minister’s conditions will not be
forgotten.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/763F5570F25072BEEFFDBFE458D3E648B13E91BF" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 June 2013">Thursday

commitment of our service personnel, the effectiveness with which they
conducted Operation Telic, and the speed with which Iraq was defeated,
if can use that word. I remember those days clearly, as the MP
representing the regimental headquarters of the Black Watch, which was
engaged in the operations. I also recall the time of the surge in
Falluja, when the media came to me for comment on the many losses
sustained by the Black Watch at that time. That was a difficult period
for all those Members of Parliament with a military interest in the
Iraq war. Those interviews, in which I paid tribute to the many
soldiers from my constituency who lost their lives during that war,
were among the toughest interviews I have ever had to do. The hon. and
gallant Gentleman is also right to mention what happened after the war:
the total lack of planning for a sustainable reinvention of Iraq and
the stripping of all state infrastructure relating to the Ba’ath
party. That was a massive mistake and it led to many of the
difficulties that followed the invasion.</hs_Para>

back to 18 March 2003, the day on which we debated the Iraq war. I was
here that day, as a few hon. Members who are in the Chamber today were,
and I remember it as a dark ugly day, a horrible day. There was nothing
like the light Whip that the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)
described. I was the Whip of our group, and I remember seeing some of
the Labour Whips’ activities on that day. People were drawn
aside and told that the Prime Minister would resign if the vote did not
go through. They were told that their careers would be at risk if they
voted against the Government. It was a horrible day. I remember lots of
good men and women being dragooned into the Lobby to support their
Prime Minister and their Government against their better instincts. It
was good to hear the right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr
Meacher)—it is a pity that he has now left the
Chamber—acknowledge that we were fed a lot of 
<?notus-xml column=576?>nonsense about the case for war. Many Members of Parliament,

listening to Tony Blair that day. I actually watched the YouTube video
of the speech this morning, just to refresh my memory of the atmosphere
in the debate. We had to listen to endless drivel and nonsense. He said
that the case for weapons of mass destruction was beyond debate, that
they were really there, and that they could reach us in 45 minutes. He
talked about collusion with al-Qaeda, and said that Saddam Hussein was
preparing a nuclear programme using uranium from Niger. It was all

2001 to 2005, and the Iraq war was the defining feature of that

Friend’s intervention. Lots of strange things were going on at

thing is that this did not have any effect on the public. The public
loathed the idea of going to war in Iraq. I was at a march in Glasgow

they knew it was wrong to attack Iraq. That is why they went out on the

was even recalled in September 2002, as my right hon. Friend the Member
for Dwyfor Meirionnydd reminded us, and we came down to listen to the
case for war. I remember arriving and there in my pigeon-hole was the
dodgy dossier. I remember sharing it with my hon. Friends, and we were
almost in hysterics at some aspects of the case for war. It was drivel,
but we had to listen to it again and again that day. We now know, of
course, that the dodgy dossier was compiled from all sorts of
plagiarised sources and that the most notable contribution came from a
graduate student called Ibrahim al-Marashi. It seems almost like some
sort of script for a failed comedy film kicked out because it lacked
credibility, yet this was the case to go to war. I know I cannot say

there were no weapons of mass destruction, still less any that could
have been deployed in 45 minutes. There was no collusion with al-Qaeda
either, but al-Qaeda is certainly there now. Al-Qaeda is all over the
region, following the political instability caused by this conflict. Of
course, there was no evidence of any uranium project and nothing
whatever could be found relating to any nuclear programme. We now know
that Tony Blair and his Government knew this. How they knew this was
revealed in the “Panorama” programme, to which some of my
hon. Friends have referred. The programme said that the intelligence
case to go to war, which was in the hands of the Prime Minister and the
Government, was so flimsy that it lacked any credibility. It was based
on an agent called “Curveball”, who saw evidence of WMD
being compiled, which he passed on to the Germans. It subsequently
spread like wildfire around the US and UK intelligence services, so
determined were they to find any shred of credibility in the evidence
to justify going to war.</hs_Para>

this issue is if we massively confess. Those who voted for the war need
to come here and say, “We got it wrong. We were lied to by a

debate falls 10 years on from that desperate, fateful time when this
country went to war with Iraq. I remember the debate on that here as if
it were yesterday. The Chamber was full. We were told there was an
ever-present threat from weapons of mass destruction. We were told that
there were nuclear weapons and yellowcake, and all the other canards
were brought up throughout that debate, and at the same time there was
a massive whipping operation going on all around the Chamber. I have to
say that I was totally unaffected by that whipping
operation—it seemed to pass me by completely—but I
observed it going on in dark corners around this building.</hs_Para>

was a shameful day for Parliament, and it was a shameful day for the
whole political system in this country. Outside in Parliament square,
there were thousands of people. They thought, naively perhaps, that
they would be listened to. Some 1 million and more had marched in
central London—maybe 2 million were on the streets of London
that day—and 600 demonstrations on every continent of the world,
including Antarctica, had been held a month before, and the opinion
polls all showed that there was no support for this war against Iraq.
They thought that Parliament would reflect their views and their
wishes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000776" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000776">The
vote that day in which Parliament, sadly, endorsed going to war not
only did enormous damage to Parliament, but did enormous damage and a
disservice to a whole generation, because they had put their hopes in
the political process to carry out their wishes and it did not do so.
That engendered cynicism and we are still dealing today in many ways
with the legacy of the war in this country. Let me deal first with the
role of
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000777" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000777">My
hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) was correct. Up
until the Iraq war, taking this country to war at any time was
completely a matter of the royal prerogative exercised by the Prime
Minister. That royal prerogative remains in operation. A number of us,
particularly my hon. Friend, argued strongly that we should have a vote
in Parliament on the war—previously, only procedural votes had
been possible. Eventually the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, agreed that
there could be vote, although I think it was a matter of self-interest
on his part: he wanted to share the responsibility and the burden. We
were pleased to have the opportunity to vote against the war, and I
suspect he was pleased to have the opportunity to get a lot of MPs
through the Lobby in support of his view.</hs_Para>

day, an MP cannot blame anyone else; it is his or her own decision and
vote, and the record will stand. I think our constituents understand
that, but the very least we can do in recognition of what happened then
is, first, in the immediate future, ensure that we have a vote before
any arms are sent to Syria; and secondly, ensure that we have a proper

million words, leaving “War and Peace” well behind, and
goodness knows how many volumes there will be when it is finally
produced. The information we are given is very important if we are to
make an informed decision. It is, however, simply not credible to say
that we were unaware of the dubiety of the information we were given. I
came here at 8 o’clock on the day the dodgy dossier was
published to pick up a copy and read it, and by a quarter past 8, I had
realised it was a load of utter bunkum and that we had been dragged

of them were not of the left and many were not necessarily
pacifists—anti-war as such—but they were convinced that

raising questions about arms sales to Iraq, human rights abuses in Iraq
and the British relationship and trade with Iraq was a very unpopular
thing to do in this place. There were not many people supporting that.
Even after Malabar—as I said earlier—in 1988, we still
participated in the Baghdad arms fair only a year later to continue
that relationship. Of course the west did support Iraq against Iran.

just want to raise a couple of more general points as a lesson
from this. What happened in 2001 was wrong, obviously; what happened at
the twin towers and the killings was a disaster. Then we merrily
invaded Afghanistan, the point at which the Stop the War
coalition was founded. We proceeded to occupy the country very quickly
and then found that it was not as simple as that. Here we are 12 years
later; still in Afghanistan, still not controlling the country and
still losing lives there. We denied international law by allowing the
Americans to call people enemy combatants, not prisoners of war.
Guantanamo Bay was set up. Extraordinary rendition took place. The
Homeland Security Act was passed in the USA and a whole raft of
anti-terror legislation was 
<?notus-xml column=583?>passed in this country. Civil rights of people all
over the world were damaged by the decision to invade Afghanistan, and
that was compounded later by the decision to invade
Iraq.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000788" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000788">Then
we invaded Iraq, after the infamous George Bush speech in 2002 in which
he talked about the axis of evil without any evidence whatever and
tried to claim that Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were as one.
They did have one thing in common, actually. There is some evidence
that, at various points in their lives, each tried to kill the other.
That was roughly the only thing they had in
common.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000789" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000789">The
behaviour of the occupying forces in Iraq has been far from perfect. We
have seen Abu Ghraib, Falluja, the bombing campaigns, the torture of
individuals and the driving of hundreds of thousands of people into
exile both as internal and as external refugees from Iraq. I have very
sad memories of visiting a refugee camp on the borders of Iraq and
Syria, where there were a few hundred poor benighted Palestinian people
whose families had been driven out of Haifa in 1948. They had been
though countries all through the Gulf states, ended up in Iraq and were
driven out of Iraq into Syria. Goodness knows where those families are
now. They have joined the steady stream of refugees across the region.
We have to think for a moment about the Palestinians and so many
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000790" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000790">I
conclude with this thought. We have to learn a lesson, and it is a
harsh one. We are not a global power. We cannot afford to be a global
power, and why would we want to be one? Have we been enhanced as a
country by our activities since 2001 in Afghanistan or Iraq, or have we
been diminished? Do we have a better image or a much worse image around
the world? It is time for us to take stock. Do we have to be a
nation with a predilection to go to war and to have a global reach for
our armed forces? Or do we wish to become a force in the world that
supports international law, human rights and recognises the limits of
the environmental destruction of our planet? Do we need Governments or
Prime Ministers who say, to use the words of Tony Blair, that this is a
chance to remake the middle east? The best way of remaking the middle
east is to recognise the injustices done by colonialism, occupation,
wars and the treatment of people who are trying to live their own
lives, and to try to promote peace. The legacy of this war is a
disastrous one. The enmity between the west and the Muslim communities,
the enmity that is played out on the streets of this country, is a
result of that. It is time for us to learn some very harsh lessons and,
above all, to put them into
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13061339000966" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000966">4.14

future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000793" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000793">The
use of depleted uranium in weapons has been controversial from its
development in the 1960s to the present. Much of the work in this area
has been done on the effects on veterans, rather than on civilian
populations. The Ministry of Defence discovered in the early research
and development programme that depleted uranium released a chemical
that was toxic and radioactive and that contaminated areas that it had
been fired into. The scientific work that has been done, as I said,
related mainly to veterans, but in recent years more evidence has been
collected from civilian populations, including in
Iraq.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000794" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000794">The
work relating to veterans shows clearly that in certain circumstances
depleted uranium has the potential to cause cancer and damage to DNA.
It can lead to birth defects and contaminate soil and ground water.
Depleted uranium was used in the first conflict in Iraq in 1991 and
also in the more recent conflict in very significant quantities. It is
thought that 290,000 kg of depleted uranium was fired during the Gulf
war in 1991, and that in the first six months of the Iraq invasion 140
kg of depleted uranium was used. Studies of the effects on civilian
populations which have been made public so far show a staggering rise
in birth defects among Iraqi children conceived in the aftermath of the
war, with high rates of miscarriage, toxic levels of lead and mercury
contamination and spiralling numbers of birth defects ranging from
congenital heart defects to brain dysfunctions and malformed limbs.
Compelling evidence seems to link these birth defects and miscarriages
to military
assaults.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000795" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000795">We
cannot sure whether these are due to depleted uranium or the effects of
other ammunition used in the area, but it is clear that there are
particularly high levels of birth defects, for example, in Falluja,
where the United States has admitted using white phosphorous
shells, although it has not admitted using depleted uranium. Findings
published in the <I>Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and
Toxicology</I> are the latest in a series of studies suggesting a link
between bombardment and a rise in birth defects. Its findings in 2010
prompted the World Health Organisation to launch an inquiry into the
prevalence of birth defects in the area affected. Although that report
was expected to be published last year, it still has not
appeared. Some claim that it is being buried and 58 scientists have
written to the Iraqi Government and the World Health Organisation
calling for its immediate publication. It is right that we, as elected
politicians, ask the British Government to use their influence and
power to do everything they can to ensure that as much information
about these issues is brought into the public
domain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000796" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000796">As
a result of previous work, the Work Health Organisation is looking at
nine high-risk areas in Iraq, including Falluja and Basra. We need to
say clearly that we want that information in the public domain. We must
do more to work out exactly the impact that some of the weaponry used
in modern warfare has on civilian 
<?notus-xml column=585?>populations. Perhaps in previous centuries the
effects of war were felt predominantly by military people and those who
went to war, but one of the clear effects of modern warfare is that
many of the types of weaponry used have long-term implications for
civilian
populations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000797" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000797">Of
the studies that have been made available in the public domain,
one shows that more than half of the babies born in Falluja between
2007 and 2010 were born with a birth defect. Before the siege the
figure was more like one in 10, and prior to the turn of the millennium
fewer than 2% of babies were born with a birth defect. According to
that study, in the two years after 2004 more than 45% of all
pregnancies surveyed ended in miscarriage, whereas the figures before
the bombing were below 10%. Between 2007 and 2010, one in six of all
pregnancies ended in miscarriage. The research that is in the public
domain is clearly incredibly
concerning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000798" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000798">Another
piece of research looked at the health histories of 56 families in
Falluja and examined births in Basra in southern Iraq, which was
attacked by British forces in 2003. It found that more than 20 babies
in 1,000 were born with births defects at the maternity hospital in
2003, which is 17 times higher than the rate recorded a decade
previously. In the past seven years, the number of malformed babies
born has increased by more than 60%, to 37 in every
1,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000799" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000799">We
have spoken a great deal today about the politics that led up to the
decision to take forces into Iraq in 2003, and that is absolutely
proper, but the reality is that families in Iraq are now dealing with
the aftermath of decisions that might have been taken by the British
Government and the action of British and other troops. I think that it
is beholden on Parliament to insist that the Government do everything
they can to ensure that this is researched more thoroughly. We must try
to find the facts and see whether there is evidence linking the use of
particular types of weaponry and the effects on civilian populations,
and we must ensure that any lessons are learned for whatever future
actions we might be involved
in.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/BE429A432EF6FEA783F61F3F015E099A9A34A4E4" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 June 2013">Thursday

Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark). I think that we are all indebted to
the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) for securing

I was not a Member of Parliament at the time, I am very proud that the

leader of the Liberal Democrats at the time, and my right hon. and
learned Friend the Member for North East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell).
The hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) talked about the
breadth of the coalition that opposed the war and said that it was not
just made up of predictable left wingers. My right hon. and learned
Friend the Member for North East Fife is far from being a raging
pacifist leftie. He is a thoughtful and 
<?notus-xml column=586?>distinguished advocate and is now, as he was then, a
distinguished spokesman on international affairs. That voices such as
his were ignored at the time is a measure of just how dogmatic certain
people in the Labour Government

have found this debate very humbling, not only because of the
first-hand accounts of intelligence, diplomacy and military experience
that we have heard from people who were connected to the war in
different respects, but because of the emotion shown by those who were,
in effect, forced to vote against their own colleagues in their
own party. The hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) made a very powerful
speech about that. We have heard about the bitter regret felt by those
who feel that they were misled into voting for the wrong thing. We
should also remember the members of the Government who honourably
resigned over this issue—Robin Cook, John Denham and others who
gave up their ministerial careers. The emotions are clearly almost as
strong now as they were
then.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000803" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000803">We
have heard powerful descriptions of what felt like the inevitable
momentum towards war. That was certainly felt outside Parliament as
well. Those of us who were watching from the outside might not have
picked up on all the details of the parliamentary debates, but every
day we saw the pictures of the troops gathering in Saudi Arabia and had
the sense that it was something that simply could not be stopped, no
matter how many people marched, no matter what arguments were deployed
and no matter what intelligence was presented to counter what was in
the dodgy
dossier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000804" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000804">If
the right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) is right,
that momentum had started long before. He mentioned the Crawford summit
in April 2002, when Tony Blair stood shoulder to shoulder with George
Bush. That was reinforced at subsequent summits between the two of
them. Although I have a lot of respect for the hon. Member for Penrith
and The Border (Rory Stewart), it is not really credible to say that
the leaders did not know the detail or had not had time to read it. I
am sure that the detail of the intelligence on the military situation
and the situation inside Iraq was all gone into in enormous detail, as
was the legal advice. As everybody has said, the Chilcot report is long
overdue, and we need to start to hear about the detail of the
decision-making process. Some of the documents that are still not
public need to be made public. It looks from the outside as though
there was a deliberate collaboration in creating that momentum towards
war in order to make it
inevitable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000805" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000805">We
have to allow that some aspects of that political mission had, in a
sense, some honour to them. Saddam’s was a despicable regime.
Thousands died in the chemical attacks in Halabja in 1988. There was
also the massacre and destruction of the entire lifestyle of the Marsh
Arabs in 1991 following the first Gulf war. There might have been a
psychological element for George Bush in the sense that, according to
the conservative psychology, his father had left the job half done in
allowing the massacre of the Marsh Arabs to take place, because they
had risen up in the expectation that they would be supported by the
allied forces, but they were not.</hs_Para>

remember that since 1991 there had been a safe haven in Iraq for the
Kurds, reinforced from 1992 by the no-fly zone described on the basis
of first-hand experience by the hon. Member for Colne

<?notus-xml column=587?>did not want to repeat his father’s error of
betraying people in Iraq who were opposed to the regime. Perhaps the
psychology of 9/11 also made people feel the need to do something to
give some substance to the supposed war on terror, which, to me, has
always had a slightly Orwellian ring to
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000807" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000807"><B><Member ContinuationText="Hywel Williams" PimsId="4619" UID="13061339001420" xid="637" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339001420">Hywel

emotional declaration of the war on terror but then a feeling that it
did not have much substance. I think that those in the conservative
right in the United States were searching for something to give it more
edge and substance, and perhaps that was part of the psychology that
led them to towards war. The psychology of the British Prime Minister
involved is something that I will not go
near.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000810" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000810">I

by the failure of Iraqi democracy. I hope that Iraqi democracy will
succeed and that a stable, federal state will emerge from the
continuing conflict. I do not want to paint everything that is
happening in Iraq as being as bad as or worse than it was under Saddam.
Nevertheless, I think that those hon. Members who voted against the war
made the right decision and I am very proud that Liberal Democrats did
so. There are three central reasons why I think they were right to

there really was no case: there were no weapons of mass destruction. A
few years later, after I had become an MP, I remember Hans Blix telling
a meeting in Parliament that he had wanted and had pleaded for more
time and that, had they been given it, the weapons inspectors could
have established the facts of the case, but of course they were
evacuated to make way for the invasion. It was not Iraq that stopped
the weapons inspections; it was the United States and the UK. As the
right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton has said, the intelligence
on which that action was based was old and out of
date.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000812" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000812">There
was no immediate humanitarian crisis. In Syria and Libya, and even in
Bosnia, people were dying or being threatened with blood baths, but
that was not the case in Iraq. There was no immediate humanitarian
justification for intervention. If there was a secondary
reason—this was sometimes mentioned—it was the idea that
Saddam might be in cahoots with al-Qaeda, but that also turned out to
be completely imaginary. In fact, the precise opposite, if anything,
was true. Subsequently, of course, we have seen the emergence of
al-Qaeda in Iraq as a substantial force of Sunni jihadists, and it is
now spilling over into Syria, where a direct offshoot of al-Qaeda in
Iraq, Jabhat al-Nusra, is making that conflict worse. The repercussions
of the intervention are extraordinary, but there was no fundamental
case for it, as we were told there
was.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000813" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000813">Secondly,
our party’s view is that the war was illegal. We have still not
seen the then Attorney-General’s advice to the Government. UN
resolution 1441 is cited, 
<?notus-xml column=588?>but as other Members have said, it did not provide a
legal justification for invasion. Actually, its central concern was
with the weapons inspection regime, which, as I have said, was brought
to an end by the invasion. The weapons inspectors were evacuated
because of the invasion. They were not prevented from continuing their
work by
Iraq.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000814" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000814">Hon.
Members’ speeches and the recent excellent BBC documentary have
highlighted how the real political objective was clearly regime change
and that other arguments and cases were deployed tactically to try to
support it. Perhaps regime change was a laudable
objective—Saddam was a terrible dictator—but the only
complication is that regime change is illegal under international law;
we therefore participated in an illegal
invasion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000815" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000815">The
third crucial reason why it was wrong to go to war was the political
and diplomatic effort behind it. It was not a united international
effort. In the end, the troops were from, I think, the United States,
Britain, Australia and Poland. Others might want to correct me. Perhaps
Spain was involved as well. NATO was disunited, the French were in
opposition and the region was disunited. The United Nations was
certainly disunited and the Secretary-General warned that the invasion
would be in contravention of the UN charter if it went ahead. This was
cowboy diplomacy. It was almost the kind of unilateral interventionism
of which the world needs to be very fearful. The decision to invade
posed a danger not just to the people of Iraq—although it
certainly did—but to the whole world, because it could be used
as justification for anybody’s decision to intervene without
international sanction, regional support or a proper legal
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000816" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000816">I
think that the coalition Government have learned those lessons. The
recent intervention in Libya stands in stark contrast to the invasion
of Iraq. There were no allied boots on the ground. It was a limited
intervention, even though militarily it was a simpler prospect than
Iraq. There was clear sanction from a UN resolution and an immediate
humanitarian case. There was also united regional support in the Arab
world. We can say collectively—those who are in the Government
in particular—that we have learned the lessons of what went on
in
Iraq.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000817" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000817">We
now have the strange situation in which we are still waiting for the
final chapter: the Chilcot report. We have been waiting for four years.
That is almost as long as Britain’s military intervention in
Iraq. If it carries on for much longer, it will outlast the war itself.
That report will raise deep and serious questions that we still want
answers to. For the former Prime Minister, it will raise some
threatening legal issues and some deep questions about his role in
taking us to war. The irony of ironies is that in the meantime, he has
been made a peace envoy to the middle east, which I find extraordinary.
All credit to him for the role that he has played subsequently in
trying to bring peace to the region. However, we still need to ask how
and why he took us to war. We need the Chilcot report and we need it

in November 2002, Tony Blair convened a meeting in Downing street with
leaders of the European socialist and Labour parties. We were supposed
to be 
<?notus-xml column=590?>discussing common challenges across Europe, but the working lunch that
Tony Blair addressed was very much focused on Iraq. In particular, he
was trying to allay the concerns that he knew were felt by members of
his sister parties across the EU. I remember being struck by the
argument he was making for what he was trying to do. He used language
saying that he was trying to be the mooring rope that would keep the
American impulse closer to where Europe would want. He said he was
trying to be a bridge between America and Europe, and that was why he
was getting so close to George Bush and maintaining a strong
relationship with the American Administration.</hs_Para>

believed that if the Americans were committed to the war anyway there
needed to be a restraint on any intervention, and he believed that his
strong alliance could provide such a constraint. He argued that action
could contribute to reigniting the peace process in the middle east. He
felt that if America ended up going in on its own, it would be hopeless
to think that anything positive could be done in the middle east,
whereas if America went in with European support, the requirement that
would come with that support would involve a new beginning to the peace
process in the middle east.</hs_Para>

the table seemed impressed and mesmerised by that, but I was not. I
made it clear—with no discourtesy to our lunch host—that
I was not there to admire Tony the bridge, and neither did I believe
that what he saw as a mooring rope was how the Americans saw things.
From my visits to Washington it was clear that they saw him not as a
mooring rope, but as a tow rope by which they hoped to take as much of
Europe as they could, and they did not care if Europe was ruptured in
the process. In my broad political movement of European sister parties
I could see exactly where the strains were showing.</hs_Para>

acknowledge that whatever criticisms anybody may have, Tony Blair did
make a significant contribution to our process, although not as much of
one as some of his writings and memoirs suggest, as they seem to write
out the fact that everybody else made contributions as well. I did not
always agree with his judgment and I certainly never always trusted his
word, but I never doubted his motives in relation to our process. I am,
however, as confounded as anybody else as to how he got himself into
such a position and the mental convolutions of his rationale on
Iraq.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/15FE540D244FB59693C655CE9AB1261A503CD24A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 June 2013">Thursday

opportunity to talk to both Tony Blair and George Bush in Hillsborough
in the weeks after the invasion of Iraq. I was the first party leader
to protest at the fact that George Bush’s visit to Hillsborough
conflated meetings on the Irish peace process with meetings on the
prosecution of the war in Iraq. Despite attempts by the Northern
Ireland Office and the British Government to limit or put conditions on
people’s presence in Hillsborough, I was allowed to present a
petition of two wallpaper scrolls, which was organised by Amnesty
International in the Foyle constituency and the north-west region more
widely. The petition was not simply a protest against the war; as we
would expect from a thoughtful organisation such as Amnesty
International, the petition focused on the responsibilities that the
invading powers had to the civilian population in Iraq—their
duties were not just observing human rights and security, but ensuring
infrastructure, utilities and the proper operation of commercial or
other transactions.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=591?><hs_Para UID="13061339000828" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000828">Protocol did
not allow me to hand the petition to the President of the United
States, as he was a visiting Head of State. Instead, the two scrolls
rested on a chair. I was able to tell the President they were there for
him. Not entirely condescendingly, he told me, “You’re a
good man, Mark, but you’re wrong and we are right and we are
proving it.” Richard Haass, who worked at the State Department
and was a special envoy to Northern Ireland, said, “You will
see. We will have this finished in weeks.” I asked, “Will
we have proof of the weapons?” He said, “Yes, we will
have that in weeks,
too.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000829" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000829">Looking
on was a frowning Tony Blair, who looked a bit peeved and a bit
jealous. He was obviously annoyed that I had taken that opportunity. I
said to him, “Don’t worry, Tony, we haven’t
forgotten about you,” and gave him two large bags of postcards
containing similar protests and making similar points. Richard Haass
probably genuinely believed what he told me. I therefore do not know
whether I can join in the sweeping judgments against everybody involved
and all parties to the enterprise, which led to such
death.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000830" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000830">A
number of hon. Members have mentioned the parliamentary aspect. We have
heard hon. Members’ recollections, including those of the right
hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher), of the
considerations and conditioning going into the vote. In my time in
Parliament, that same occasion was recalled by Frank Cook, then the
hon. Member for Stockton North, when the House voted on 42-day
detention. He compared the whipping and briefing that day—he was
told, “If you don’t vote for this, the Prime Minister
will be forced to resign and it will be a humiliation. Out of loyalty
to the Prime Minister, you have to vote for this, otherwise there will
be an election”—with the arguments to which he was
subjected on the day of the Iraq vote. He said that succumbing to those
arguments on the day of the Iraq vote was the biggest regret of his
life, and that he would never make that mistake again for any Prime
Minister or party.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061339000831" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000831">The hon.
Member for Brighton, Pavilion made a key point. We want to ensure that
there will be votes in future, but we must ensure that they are honest
and honourable. Free votes ensure that people cannot turn round and
say, “I voted how I did because it was a vote of confidence. I
was opposed to what I voted for, but I voted on a different issue. The
issue was confidence and whether we stayed in government or had an
election.” We need to ensure not only that there are votes, but
that the terms on which votes are taken are the right ones. That is
why, when we debated the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, I opposed any
amendment that would have given the Speaker the power to decide what
issues were issues of confidence. As issues of confidence can trigger
an election and abort a fixed-term Parliament, they would have been
abused to confuse what Members were actually voting on. Members would
have been told to vote not on the issue, but on whether they wanted an
election next week, or their leader out.</hs_Para>

Chilcot inquiry, I met John Chilcot in the context of the Northern
Ireland peace process. Again, I would give a mixed account of
his contribution. I worked and talked with him very early on in the
Hume-Adams process, and he was encouraging of new engagement and new
lines of dialogue opening up between the 
<?notus-xml column=592?>British Government and all interests in Northern
Ireland. After the Castlereagh break-in, he was appointed by the
Government to undertake an independent inquiry into it. As I pointed
out in a previous debate in the House, his report did not deal with
findings on what had happened, how it had happened and who had been
involved. Instead, it came up with an ulterior agenda of trying to
ensure that MI5 and the security services would in no way find
themselves accountable to, or constrained by, the Northern Ireland
policing measures introduced under the Patten report. The intention was
to try to reroute intelligence policing away from the Patten
model—under the chief constable—to one entirely under
MI5, beyond any review by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland,
the Northern Ireland Policing Board or anybody else.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061339000833" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000833">I made the
point, when we discussed the establishment of the Chilcot report, that
I knew John Chilcot and that he was someone in whom I could recognise
skills and articulacy, but he was not someone whose phone number I
would expect to find in Yellow Pages under either I for independence or
C for challenging. I hope that my jaundiced judgment is proved wrong
when we finally see the Chilcot inquiry report. At times during the
inquiry, I was given hope that I would be proved wrong. However, we
have been waiting a long time. I was particularly struck by the
contribution from the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr
Llwyd), who was able to tell us of colourful issues regarding the
background, character and composition of the inquiry team. Parliament
must be able fully to digest the report, not just respond immediately
to a statement on the day. It must be debated subsequently.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061339000834" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000834">In all future
debates, as in today’s debate, we need to remember that the
issue is not just about what happened here on a parliamentary or
political level, and not just about the wrongs of dodgy dossiers and
undue whipping. The real issue is the story of what happened to the
people in Iraq: the people who were sent out in the name of
this Parliament and sacrificed their lives and limbs. They and their
loved ones are still wondering what it was all about, and I hope we are
not adding to their sorrow, misery or sense of futility by speaking the
truth today. The contribution by my hon. Friend the Member for North
Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark) was important, because it focused on
some of the legacy issues for which we in this House bear a collective
responsibility. We still have a responsibility towards the people
of Iraq.</hs_Para>

Lucas</B> (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green):</Member> I thank all right hon.
and hon. Members who have taken part in this important and useful
debate. The honesty and frankness with which Members have taken part
does credit to this place: it has shown the House at its best. I note
with interest that no one spoke in defence of the UK’s support
for the war. Over and over again, hon. Members emphasised the heavy
price paid for the invasion, not only by people in this country, but
crucially by people in Iraq, where sectarian violence
continues to grow.</hs_Para>

focused on looking forward as well as back, and I want quickly to
underline a few of today’s conclusions. Hon. Members expressed a
lot of support for having free votes—and, crucially, votes based
on information—when the House debates going to war. Many hon.
Members spoke about the importance of basing our
decisions on information. We also heard 
<?notus-xml column=593?>about the importance of reforming the relationship between the Foreign
Office, the military and Parliament to ensure that it works better;
about the need for structural changes to the Foreign Affairs, Defence,
and Intelligence and Security Committees; and about the significance of
Iran and Syria.</hs_Para>

spoke about how the war undermined Parliament’s reputation. I
hope that this debate has been a step towards reinvigorating confidence
in Parliament. I pay particular tribute to the contribution from the
shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), whose
comments, as everyone said, were from the heart and delivered with a
frankness that made us all listen. I would like to pay tribute to other
colleagues, too. The anger with which the right hon. Member for Oldham
West and Royton (Mr Meacher) spoke about the level of deception rang
out across the House and, I hope, much wider. The hon. Member for
Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart) spoke powerfully and with an
expertise that not many of us in this place have about the importance
of acknowledging when we get things wrong and of being able to say that
we are failing. He warned of the dangers of thinking that we can only
ever succeed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061339000838" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0003.htm#13061339000838">I thank the
Minister for loyally sitting through just about the whole debate,
although I cannot thank him for the substance of his remarks, given
that he was constrained, as he explained, by the convention preventing
him from speaking before Chilcot reports. Waiting for Chilcot is like
waiting for Godot. It would be helpful to have that report as soon as
possible. The debate lacked a contribution from a Minister made
with the same degree—or any degree, frankly—of honesty
and frankness about what went wrong as other speeches.

on the Chilcot inquiry and about the importance of the
Attorney-General’s advice being put in the public domain. The
hon. Member for South Thanet (Laura Sandys) talked about the problem of
a lack of planning post-Saddam. The hon. Member for Newport West (Paul

Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) shared with us his interesting
perspective as a serving officer and what it felt like to be in that
position. He stressed that threat is a combination of intent and
capacity, which needs to be borne in mind when trying to judge what
constitutes a threat. I welcomed the contribution from the hon. Member
for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart), because he put it
clearly on the record that there was very heavy whipping during the
vote and that that day, 18 March, was a “horrible day”.
The right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) implied that the
whipping was all very nice, light and happy, but that was not the
case.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark) raised the
crucial issue of depleted uranium, while the hon. Member for Cheltenham

time. He did not say it was a lost cause and that war was the only
option—on the contrary. Finally, the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark
Durkan) gave us some fascinating insights into the mind of the Prime
Minister. Quite how he thought the invasion would help the middle east
peace process is a question that will keep me thinking for the rest of

Freeman</B> (Mid Norfolk) (Con):</Member> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker,
for your patience—and that of the House—in waiting for me
to raise this important subject at this time of the week. I also thank
the Minister for her presence. I pay tribute to her long interest in
this subject, her work at the Department of Health on cancer, screening
and public health—she is a tolerant and fair-minded advocate of
public health in the Members’ Tea Room—and her interest
in the difficulties of the early onset of dementia. I was struck the
other day by her moment at the Dispatch Box, when she was greeted with
extraordinary affection in the House, which was a sign of the great
respect and affection in which she is held and the respect for the work
she does.</hs_Para>

in this debate comes from a family interest in cancer—an
interest that I know is shared by many in the House and across the
country. Few families have been untouched by the disease, which is
increasingly understood to be a genetic disease. I lost my father and
my mother-in-law to cancer, and, as the parent of two children, take a
close interest in something that I might have inadvertently passed on
to them. I also have an interest because I come to this House after a
15-year career in biomedical research and speak in my role as
Government adviser on life sciences, taking a deep interest in how
current breakthroughs are changing the assumptions on which we base
public policy.</hs_Para>

purposes of giving some background and declaring an interest, I want to
explain what I did in those 15 years. I spent four years running a
predictive toxicology business, which looked at drug compounds and
analysed their likely toxicology and efficacy in different patient
groups. I also spent six years in translational medicine, working with
academic health science centres up and down England and Scotland,
helping to set up the Scottish translational medicine research
institute and working at University college London on the
cardiovascular institute and at King’s Health Partners on
dementia. I was delighted two years ago to be given the chance to
support the Government as life sciences adviser. I stress that I have
no ongoing commercial interest in the sector. For the purpose of
clarity, I draw the House’s attention to my entry in the
Register of Members’ Financial Interests. It details historical
investments, including a very small shareholding in GlaxoSmithKline,
which has been passed down through our family since my grandfather met
the founder and decided that the then baby milk business might have a
good
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000856" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000856"><Member ContinuationText="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" PimsId="2637" UID="13061339001429" xid="120" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339001429"><B>Geoffrey

that the revolutions in translational medicine, in experimental
medicine and in the personalisation of medicine are a huge force for
good. They raise a number of important issues, some of which we might

the House a couple of stories illustrating how I came to see
that force for good in practice.</hs_Para>

involves a project at King’s Health Partners in south London,
led by Professor Simon Lovestone, who is a pioneer in clinical research
into psychiatric disorders, particularly dementia. The project is
funded by the National Institute for Health Research, and I
congratulate the previous Government on putting in place that
infrastructure, which we have developed and continued. Professor
Lovestone and his team have developed a case register information
system, which is a portal for data for the whole of the South London
and Maudsley NHS mental health trust, involving 250,000 patients. It
brings together all the information, anonymised and in large datasets,
on medical records and clinical histories and on the often complex drug
histories involved in treating mental health, along with MRI brain
scans, to create a powerful database for the purpose of shedding light
on the mechanisms of action and the clinical drivers of early-onset and
late-onset examples of the disease.</hs_Para>

now being used by researchers on campus for purely academic work,
alongside researchers from industry who, quite fairly, pay substantial
amounts of money to King’s Health Partners in order to use the
facility. They often find themselves working alongside leading-edge
researchers. As a result, King’s Health Partners has signed up
to a number of collaborations with industry to work on some very
expensive drug programmes. That is an example of how data can
accelerate academic research and bring academic and industry
researchers together in pursuit of a common
cause.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000863" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000863">The
other company that I want to mention is the joint venture set up by UCL
Partners called Abcodia. It is based around a database of 250,000 women
who are at risk of gynaecological cancer. It was funded by Cancer
Research UK and the Medical Research Council over 20 years, but at the
end of the academic study, the database was sitting gathering dust. It
is now being used as a powerful database to provide all sorts of
screening and diagnostic molecular biomarker services, and is helping
to identify the biomarkers that predict and are implicated in the onset
of gynaecological cancer. It is also a powerful database for all the
diseases of ageing in women, many of which are the same in men.
It is a 
<?notus-xml column=597?>powerful tool for understanding the molecular
biomarkers and the drivers for the early onset of a whole range of
late-life diseases.</hs_Para>

databases are incredibly powerful, and across the NHS and across our
university academic health science centres, they are being run under
very high standards of ethical and regulatory regimes and with very

pay tribute to his advocacy, on behalf of his constituent Les Halpin,
of the access to medicines campaign. We have plans to continue to help
support it. My hon. Friend’s point is important, and the point
that Les Halpin has made is that people like himself with a terminal
disease actively want the opportunity to take part in trials and
research so that their disease and suffering will not be in vain. My
hon. Friend speaks powerfully on behalf of his constituent and on

truth is that this revolution of translational personal lives medicine
is all about the end of the one-size-fits-all blockbuster model of drug
discovery and development. The more we know about disease, the more we
discover the genetic predispositions of disease and how different
patients respond in different ways both to drugs and to the onset of
disease. We discover that what was yesterday one cancer is today three
or four and tomorrow will be 30 or 40. This is breaking down the size
of markets and requiring a whole new model of research around patients.
It puts patients right at the heart of the research process. That is
challenging for hospitals and for companies, but ultimately, I
believe—we are seeing the evidence—it is good for
patients, leading to quicker innovation and quicker access to drugs. It
is also good for our life sciences sector. It is a win-win, which is
why the Government were right to describe the report on the subject as
“health, wealth and innovation”. The three do indeed go

genetic data, the rights to DNA—that issue has been highlighted
by the Supreme Court’s ruling against Myriad Genetics—and
the rights to clinical data? Some interesting work done in the other
place suggests that, ultimately, we need to establish the idea that the

insurance scare stories we sometimes read about in the press. I call
again for the insurance moratorium to be extended. This is not about in
any way wanting to undermine the ability of those who have had testing
to receive health insurance. 
<?notus-xml column=600?>The point of this revolution is that it is about
empowerment. It is about empowering patients actively to seek, and
take, more responsibility for their health care earlier in their life,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Anna
Soubry):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mid
Norfolk (George Freeman) on securing this debate and pay a warm tribute
to him for the great work he does as the Government’s life
sciences adviser. I also thank him for his kind words about me. I pay
tribute, too, to my hon. Friend the Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey
Clifton-Brown), who yet again, quite properly, advances the campaign of
his constituent, Mr Les Halpin. There is much merit in that campaign,
and my hon. Friend has brought it to the Floor of the House before, and
so he should. We wish Les Halpin all the very best, and I pay tribute
to the great work he has done and the valid points he makes in his
campaign. I should also congratulate all the charities my hon. Friend
the Member for Mid Norfolk mentioned that are concerned with prostate
and breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease; I pay tribute to them
for all the work they do on those diseases, and all the campaigning
work they do in advancing this topic.</hs_Para>

is a good time to hold this debate, as the development of genomic
technologies, based on the individual’s genetic data, is a
rapidly developing field that will bring benefits for NHS patients and
the economy. The UK is a recognised world leader in scientific research
in genetics, and the services that are available to NHS patients are
among the best, if not the best, in the world. The NHS, in its unique
position as a single, national health care provider, is ideally placed
to harness this new technology and reap the
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000888" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000888">The
data that are obtained from sequencing part of, or the whole, genome
are limited in their usefulness unless they are linked to more
information on the individual and the results of their treatment. That
is why controlled access to patient records will be vital in our
efforts to improve diagnostic capability, understand better the
epidemiology—I hope I do not struggle in pronouncing that
word—of disease and develop better health care tools and
treatments.</hs_Para>

more data, the issue of ensuring we protect data obtained from an
individual’s DNA has been discussed in many different forums,
including the 2009 Lords inquiry into genomic medicine in health care
and the consequent work by the Human Genomics Strategy Group, which was
led by the Department of
Health.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000890" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000890">In
December last year, the Prime Minister announced that we would be the
first country in the world to put in place a programme to sequence
100,000 whole genomes. That is part of a programme that will receive an
extra £100 million in funding over the next three to five years.
The result will be the building of safe platforms of data that will
open access.</hs_Para>

is becoming a reality, access to genetic data will continue to be a
subject of keen interest to many. It is only right that it is debated
on the Floor of this House because it is so important. As with other
data, DNA sequence data will be governed by strict legal controls. It
will not be shared with other parties in a form that identifies the
individual unless there is a legal and appropriate basis for so doing,
and where such a legal basis exists, the patient has the right to be
informed about how their DNA sequence data are used. The sequencing
information will be strictly controlled within existing NHS
arrangements and managed in a way that protects patient
confidentiality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000892" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000892">As
I said, the raw read-out data are of little value to clinicians,
researchers or indeed the industry if they cannot be linked to
phenotype and clinical data, so we need to ensure that information-rich
data sets are developed that have been value-added through linking
genetic and genomic data to disease development, treatment and results.
Data need to be made available in an environment that fully meets
consent and data protection requirements. To ensure that we harness
that potential as part of the growth agenda, which my hon. Friend
mentioned, we must develop an industry ecosystem that helps to promote
innovation within a healthy, competitive economic atmosphere, which
respects data protection and consent boundaries and allows open data
sharing for academic
research.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000893" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000893">While
the protection of personal data is important, we should not forget that
sharing data has immense benefits. Those patients with cancer or rare
diseases who will have their whole genome tested as part of the Prime
Minister’s initiative may well argue that they want more of
their data to be shared, to help research into their condition and to
help fellow sufferers. The recent review carried out by Dame Fiona
Caldicott recognised that people’s concerns about what happens
to their information, who has access to it and for what purposes, is
hugely important; but people also raise 
<?notus-xml column=602?>concerns about why their data are not shared more frequently when common
sense tells us all that it really should be. On the other hand, there
was high level of anxiety among some clinicians about when it is safe
to share information and what safeguards are required, including
concerns about breaching data protection laws or threats to their
professional status.</hs_Para>

cultural change is required to rebalance sharing and protecting
information in patients’ and service users’ interests. We
believe that the Caldicott recommendations strike a good balance
between the rights of the individual and the need to develop new
treatments and services for the greater good. There is no contradiction
between demanding rigorous safeguarding of personal information and
enthusiasm about sharing information. We want to develop systems that
provide open data from what we call safe platforms. There should be no
surprises to patients or service users about who has access to their
information, and they should be fully informed about their rights in
relation to their data. That includes explaining to individuals how
their information will be used, including de-identified information,
and that it may be used for public health prevention and research, as
well as providing assurance that any misuse will be tackled
vigorously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000895" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000895">If
we are to get better, less fragmented care and to harness the potential
of genetic and genomic data for the benefit of all, any lack of trust
between individuals, be they individual patients or organisations, in
relation to their practice of information governance has to be
overcome. The Department of Health research indicates clear public
support for using health and care information in research to better
inform and develop new treatments. We want to ensure that individuals
retain consent to any use of their personal information. That is why we
have asked the chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, to
retain oversight of the programme to sequence 100,000 whole genomes, to
ensure that the patient and public interest is
protected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061339000896" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/debtext/130613-0004.htm#13061339000896">I

provided me with many of them already, and my officials have compiled a

and welfare issues have been central for the Select Committee over the
past 12 months. Out-of-control dogs are an increasing menace: hospital
admissions due to dog attacks doubled from 3,000 in 1997 to more than

health service is approximately £3 million a
year.</hs_Para>

people have been killed since 2007 by dog attacks in the home. Five of
those victims were under the age of four. Opposition Members here have
had constituency experience of such cases, and I commend how they have
represented those who have suffered such losses. Offences relating to
dangerous dogs increased by 39% in one year alone—from 855 in
2009 to 1,192 in 2010. As we know, some eight guide dogs a month are
attacked by other dogs. We also know that there are countless attacks
on other dogs and protected animals, such as cats, horses and
livestock. That has huge implications for rural constituencies such

they are left abandoned as strays on the street, when it is impossible
to bear down on the irresponsible dog owner. Each and every one of us

sum up, we welcome the extension of legislation to attacks on private

sentencing, it has been put to me by a constituent that a sentence of
two years is insufficient for a fatal dog attack. Death by dangerous
driving carries a 14-year prison sentence, whereas death by careless
driving carries a five-year prison sentence. Where prosecutions under
these new laws on dogs are brought, perhaps somewhere between a
five-year and a 14-year jail term would be a more fitting tribute to
those loved ones who have been lost rather than the two-year term that
is being proposed.</hs_Para>

must differentiate between those people who are deliberately setting
their dogs on other people and deliberately training their dogs to be
vicious and to be attack dogs, and those people who have not cared for
their dog appropriately, with the result that the dog becomes vicious.

share the Committee’s disappointment that the Government are not
introducing holistic legislation to cover the issues of dog control and
dog welfare, because the two issues cannot be separated. This debate is
about control but fundamentally it is about dog welfare, because the

attack because of how they have been trained, or not trained, and how
they have been socialised and educated.</hs_Para>

mastiffs—in her friend’s house, where she was staying
overnight as a special treat because she had done so well at her new
school. By all accounts, Jade was a very bubbly girl who was loved by

as seriously as they should be. It is fortunate, although I am sure the
victim does not feel fortunate, that one person who had to go to
hospital after an attack was a young man in his 20s. Had he been a

that it is cruel to keep a dog muzzled. However, that is only in
specific situations and with specific instructions about what to do
with a specific animal. There is also concern that the proposed
legislation will get rid of dog control orders as well. Such an order
is a good, simple mechanism whereby local authorities can introduce
exclusion orders in parks; orders about clearing up after dog fouling;
orders about keeping dogs on leads in particular areas; and orders
about people having to put their dog on a lead, if instructed to do so
by a responsible person. I am concerned that, again, we may lose those
measures in a much larger piece of legislation that does not allow such

taken away from its mother too soon. I appreciate that there is now
consensus that people breeding more than two litters a year should be
registered, but I was interested to hear the comment from the ex-chief
vet of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who
believes that anyone who breeds a litter should have their dog
registered, even if it is an accidental breeding. That is his personal

<?notus-xml column=132?>would have walked around with a Heinz 57, which is a mongrel; now people
choose big, powerful dogs that need a lot of exercise, which they will
not necessarily get in their environment, and a lot of care, and they
are not necessarily safe around children. I am not castigating all the
bull breeds—I am not castigating Staffordshire bull terriers or
anything else—because we know that some of those dogs are well
socialised, well trained, well cared for and well controlled, but I am
worried by the proliferation of such big breeds in areas where they are

around dogs, how to behave around dogs and how to understand the signs
that dogs give out so that they know whether it is, “Yes, you
can come and stroke me,” or “No, please stay
away.” We need children to understand how dogs behave and the
signals that they give. The training also teaches children how to care
for their pets, particularly dogs, how to train them and how to look
after them. Again, part of the problem with dangerous dogs is the way
those dogs are treated, whether accidentally because people just do not
know enough or, as I said in my earlier intervention, because people

course, microchipping will only be as good as the database that is put
in place. If people go to Blue Cross or Battersea Dogs Home,
they will find that of the dogs that come in with microchips, which is
probably only 30% or 40% of the total, only 30%—10% or 15% of
the total—can be traced back to their owners; the microchips are
often not up to date. I am sure the Government will bear that in
mind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000095">We

can be properly traced. People who sell their car have to ensure that
they know exactly where the car is going because otherwise if someone
is later done for speeding, the original owner would receive a notice
through the post stating that they were driving the car when they were
not. I suggest, therefore, that if the previous owner of a dog receives
a fine or a summons to court, they are responsible for it. That would
concentrate people’s minds. People who sell their dog would then

have talked this afternoon about the need to be careful that, as with
dog licences, microchips are not just for the law abiding, which is an
issue I have raised before. The last thing someone who is breeding a
dog to be dangerous or to be a weapon wants is for that dog to be
traced back to them. There are people out there who will wilfully
ensure, as far as practicable, that their dog is not microchipped, or
if the dog is microchipped, that it is not linked with them. That is
fundamental<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:18:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000097">When
police and council dog wardens come across people who are, say, beating
their dogs in the park to train them to be vicious, that is the moment
to take in and microchip the dogs, and probably take them away from
their owner. At the very least, the dogs should be linked with the
owner so that the owner can be held responsible for what the dog does
thereafter. Again, I agree with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:18:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bolton West that it is not necessarily the dog that is at fault; it
is about the owner who has trained the dog to be vicious. We have to be

brings me neatly to my next point. It is right that we extend the
legislation to deal with people who have dangerous dogs in their home
that bite postmen or social workers. In doing so, however, we must be
aware that if the dog is protecting the property and someone goes in to
trespass or burgle, the dog will take some sort of action against that
person. In that case, I do not see 
<?notus-xml column=134?>why any individual should be prosecuted as a result. That will be the
difficult balance in the legislation. Often, when postmen or
social workers going into people’s houses are bitten, it is not
the first time it has happened. The dogs are sometimes well known for
being vicious, and we need to take action on those types of dogs and
owners. That is absolutely
clear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:20:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000099">Furthermore,
while breed-specific legislation is okay up to a point, we now have
people bringing dogs into the country and breeding them to be
dangerous, so we have to be clear that our concern is the act of the
dog and not necessarily the breed of the dog. Leaving the
breed-specific legislation as it is does not help when dogs from all
over the world are being brought in to breed a more vicious breed of
dog. People who do that are outside the law and they do not want to be

dogs of a breed that is considered vicious, yet an individual dog need
not be vicious. Once such a dog is taken into care, there is a death
warrant on it, irrespective of whether the dog deserves it. We could go
round such conundrums all day, but we should rehouse dogs if possible.
Sometimes dogs are taken into care just because people cannot cope with
them—they are not training the dogs to be vicious, they simply
cannot cope with them any longer. Dogs of a good temperament, but of a
breed that might be considered more dangerous, are often the ones that
have to be put down, and I do not agree with

beyond dangerous dogs as such, an issue at the top end of dog breeding
is that many are bred to be too pure. Pugs might be bred so they cannot
breathe properly, because that is how masters and breed judges see the
case; Alsatians are bred with bad hips, because sometimes that is how
the pedigree breeders think that breed should be. Linking with the
microchip measures and, clearly, back to the breeding, therefore, the
Government need to be absolutely certain that dogs are bred to be not
only pure, as in that instance, but healthy. That might be going beyond
the subject of today’s debate, but the Kennel Club and others
are working hard on the issue, and we need to do more. If some pedigree
dogs are being bred from a gene pool that is too small, we need to
introduce other breeds to ensure a proper gene pool so that they can
breed properly—so that they have good hips, for
example<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:24:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000103">On
puppy farming, it is right that for more than two litters the farms or
breeders should be registered. DEFRA is working on that; people need to
be clear where dogs come from—through puppy contracts, such as
those used by the British Veterinary Association—what the
dog’s parentage is and where its mother is. If possible, people
should see the puppy with the mother, so that they know exactly what
they are buying; they should 
<?notus-xml column=135?>not buy something advertised over the internet or
out of the back of a white van, because they have no link to
the mother. Such puppies could have been taken from their mother far
too young and they could be traumatised and may also be suffering from
many diseases. When something happens to a puppy because it has many
illnesses, the children of the family it was brought into might be
traumatised as well. Again, proper linking to the original breeder
through the puppy’s microchip will make all the difference,
because people will find it much more difficult to bring puppies in and
pass them off as bred somewhere else, which is often the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:25:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000104">This

the Member for Thirsk and Malton: the vast majority of dog owners in
this country are good and responsible. We must ensure that we go after
those who are not. We must also act against dogs that attack not only
people but a dog guiding a blind person—that has to be just as
bad as an attack on a person. It is terrifying enough to have a dog of
one’s own attacked by another dog, but imagine people walking
down a road unable even to see the other dog approaching before it
attacks their guide dog. That must be absolutely terrifying, and all
those things should be taken into

as has been said, if horrendous crimes have been committed by dogs, and
if the owners have trained the dogs to carry out such acts, we must
ensure that the book is thrown at those people, and that they receive
sentences commensurate with their crime. Sometimes, of course, a dog
that is not normally dangerous goes out of control, and that has to be
looked at slightly more leniently. The situation now is that we must

was keen for the Select Committee to look at this issue, because there
has been a sharp increase in the number of problems associated with
so-called status dogs. The number of people hospitalised as a result of
dog attacks has doubled—it went from around 3,000 as recently as
1997 to well in excess of 6,000 in 2010. That is a real problem, and I
welcome many of the measures that the Government have brought forward
to date, all of which have been referred to already.</hs_Para>

only concern is the possible final unintended consequences of such
legislation, which we need to think about. I hope that the courts will
have wide discretion to take into account individual cases. For
example, a couple of border collies could be working dogs on a remote
farm, running loose most of the day, but they might nip someone who is
not trespassing and who might even be delivering a political leaflet.
The implication of that becoming a dreadful offence might be that dogs
would have to be locked up all day because someone canvassing for a
political party might come round once every couple of years. We must be
careful and give some discretion to the
courts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000111">I
want to focus most of my comments on dog breeders. My one concern about
community protection notices is that there is too much emphasis on
irresponsible behaviour by dog owners and the dog is treated as though
it were an accessory to antisocial behaviour and crime in the same way
as a knife or baseball bat might be.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:30:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bolton West (Julie Hilling) said and as I have stressed, the issue
is not as simple as that. So much about how a dog behaves and whether
it is unpredictable and likely to bite someone depends on whether it
was socialised in the first few months when it was a puppy and whether
it was cared for properly. If it was brutalised in those first few
months, it will never be right, however responsible the current owner
might be.</hs_Para>

from dog charities, such as Battersea Dogs Home, was very clear. Many
of the dogs they receive were bought as puppies from a disreputable
breeder who did not raise them properly. It might be a mastiff, and a
year down the line the buyer finds that they have a huge dog that they
cannot control. They do not know what to do with it so they abandon it

that go to charities have been abandoned by people who have bought
puppies from disreputable breeders and then did not know what to do
with them, so abandoned them. That is a real problem; so many of those
dogs end up being destroyed because their experience as puppies means
that they are completely unsuitable to be rehomed with
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000115">As
hon. Members have said, we recommended that one way of dealing with the
problem was to change legislation so that the maximum number of litters

local authority was reduced from five litters a year to two. The
Government rejected that, and I want to press the Minister on the
current position. Our understanding was that a hobby breeder could
breed up to five litters a year. That is a lot of dogs; an
irresponsible hobby breeder could send 50 dogs into the outside world

Does it mean anyone who sells a dog? Does it mean that if someone
breeds one litter of puppies and gives five away to friends but sells
three, they would have to register because they had sold a dog? Does it
mean someone who earns their full-time income in that way, or a
part-time income, and is there an income threshold? Does it mean that
someone receiving more than £500 from puppy sales must be
licensed, but not if they receive less than that? The figure is vague
and I would like to know what the phrase means. If there was clarity
and someone breeding fewer than two litters would be a hobby breeder
and exempt, but those breeding more than two litters would
automatically be caught, that would remove the vagueness. That is
important, and I would welcome the Minister’s
comments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000120">After
the publication of the report, I met some dog wardens who raised
various issues with me. They said that the most important one was that
doing what I suggested and reducing the threshold from five to two
litters would be for the birds because they did not have the resources
or powers to carry out the necessary surveillance to pick up such
breeders. When I pressed them on how much such work they do, the answer
was, “Not a great deal.” We must not delude ourselves
into thinking that this simple tweak in the legislation would solve the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000121">Those
wardens said that one obstacle to their looking into such problems is
the difficulty, bureaucracy and complexity of obtaining the relevant
authorisation from the right authorities to carry out surveillance on
people they suspect of running illegal puppy farms. They said that what
usually happens is that the police or a local authority decide to
conduct surveillance on a household for some other
reason—suspected cannabis growing, selling of drugs or dealing
illegally in something else—and only incidentally do they find
out that dogs are being illegally bred and sold, and that there is a
business in dogs that is not properly
licensed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000122">An
interesting area that we did not look at in our last inquiry, and which
I hope the Government will take on board, is whether more should be

many other examples, including boxer dogs having heart diseases and

problems caused by those who buy problem dogs are extensive both
financially and emotionally. Such puppies often die prematurely and
their owners have to face the associated costs, including
vets’ fees, and the emotional trauma that goes with that. I will
concentrate on dog welfare today. We should remember that dogs are
sentient beings who can feel both pain and fear.</hs_Para>

Government must not wash their hands of all aspects of dog breeding,
particularly when welfare problems are involved, and they could use a
light regulatory touch with a sector of welfare groups operating
properly through the Animal Health and Welfare Board for England. There
must be responsible dog-breeding regulation so that puppies are sold to
suitable owners and socialised properly, which would alleviate many of
the dog control problems to which hon. Members have
alluded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000129">I
turn first to the lack of funding. The Animal Health and Welfare Board
for England is, rightly, weighted towards farm animals and received
£200,000 from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs. The Farm Animal Welfare Council received £280,000. In
contrast, the Dog Advisory Council, which is so ably chaired by
Professor Sheila Crispin, had to make do with a mere shoestring budget
of £28,000 last year. It tried to approach the pet food industry
for more funding, but that has so far failed. The Dog Advisory Council
has been widely acknowledged as providing the most independent,
far-reaching welfare advice of any of the dog organisations.</hs_Para>

brings me to the second, perhaps most important part of my speech, and
the issue that is causing so much unhappiness; I hope that the Minister
pays close attention. It seems that a new canine and feline sector
group has been established, with a surprising lack of consultation
anywhere. If there is to be a new organisation, it should be fully
independent from any sectoral interests. Only with an independent group

also question the establishment of the group. I do not understand why

or how the group is to be funded, and I would be grateful if the

that the new group will be under the chairmanship of Professor Steve
Dean. I have met him, and he is extremely knowledgeable about
dogs—the problem is that he happens to be chairman of the Kennel

Kennel Club and DEFRA, which, as I said in a letter to the noble Lord
de Mauley, is seriously dividing opinion-formers in the dog world, and
compromising, I believe, the welfare of dogs. The creation of the new
group and the choice of chairman have frankly created hostility in the
dog world. Any chairman of a dog welfare board, I suggest to the

imposing tougher health requirements. Given that conflict of interest,

should remain in any canine and feline group, due to the population of
dogs and the problems that we have heard in today’s debate.

are being pressed to do something urgently about microchipping in
horses, to deal with horse diseases and the issue of traceability,
including dog meat. The technology required for the chipping of dogs

third issue is so-called puppy farms, which others have discussed. I

puppies in environments with inadequate welfare conditions and
inadequate genetic disease control. Puppies are often poorly nourished

tackle.</hs_Para>

fourth issue, which my constituent, Carol Fowler, was at the forefront
of proposing, is puppy contracts. It is important that members of the
general public have access to an effective public education campaign
about genetic welfare issues. The poor welfare standards of many
commercial breeding establishments and dealers mean that many innocent
puppy buyers will still purchase a puppy on emotional grounds rather
than as informed consumers. Choice of breed can often be based on
appearance or even fashion, with little regard to potentially harmful
conformational traits or known breed-related genetic diseases, let

current, unregulated system is failing to protect dogs from suffering
from the effects of inbreeding, genetic diseases, exaggerated
conformational traits, poor husbandry and the poor welfare that can be
associated with the breeding of dogs. The majority of purebred dogs are
owned by the general public, who often pay a very high financial and
emotional price in dealing with such
problems.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:46:11"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

to be a nation of animal lovers and, on the whole, I am sure that that
is true. However, there will be a falsity behind that claim if we do
not ensure the highest welfare standards possible. The UK’s
standard of welfare of companion animals often falls below that of
Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and
possibly other European countries as well.</hs_Para>

summary, I believe that the case for an independent regulator for the
welfare of dogs is clear. A clear distinction has to be made between a
sectoral council, which represents the interests of the industry
concerned, and an independent regulator, which will act on behalf of
the welfare interests of animals. With the creation of the new canine
and feline body, it very much feels as though the poachers are
regulating the gamekeepers.</hs_Para>

independent body, with statutory powers, would have the capability to
ensure both the protection of dog welfare and that dog breeding was
carried out to the highest possible standards. Having those safeguards
in place would, in turn, alleviate many of the dog control
issues that we have discussed today, including that of dangerous dogs.
I hope that the Minister will be able to comment on those important
welfare issues
today.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_13_PT_1/1AC877662C3D35C3CA8EF286E4451AC893DE2ED2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="13 June 2013">Thursday

it took and in its comprehensive insights on dog control and

point has been well made that one difficulty we are experiencing, both
in this debate and in governmental terms, is about who champions the
matter in Government. 
<?notus-xml column=141?>A forthcoming Home Office Bill deals with one aspect, while other
aspects, such as sentencing, are dealt with elsewhere. In his response,
the Minister—good chap that he is—might want to identify
the individual who champions the whole remit. In the absence of a
holistic reform of dog welfare and controls, and given that we are
dealing with it in a more piecemeal way, who champions the issue right
across Whitehall? Who bangs heads together? Who chairs the committees
in Government? Who drags the Home Office and others together and says,
“This is the way it is all going to hang together.”? I
think that role is vital, and it would be good to have information from
the Minister when he makes his remarks.</hs_Para>

for Thirsk and Malton (Miss
McIntosh)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:49:00"></hs_TimeCode>, for
their truly excellent work on this report and others that relate to
such issues. It is right to recognise, as hon. Members have done, the
intense suffering of many families who have been traumatised, not only
through injuries, but through deaths in their families because of
attacks by dogs. That includes most recently Jade Anderson, John Paul
Massey four years ago and the 79-year-old pensioner, Clifford Clarke.
It is true that they and others personify the tragedy of dog attacks,
which has been so ably and eloquently set out here today by my hon.

give immense credit to all the dog and animal welfare charities, the
police, the Royal College of Nursing, other health care professionals,
veterinarians, postal workers, represented by the Communication Workers
Union, and many assorted others who have come together to campaign with
an immense degree of unanimity and sense of purpose on the issue. I
remember at one point a Minister—I am not sure whether it was
this Minister, but certainly it was a predecessor—saying to me,
“One of the difficulties is that there isn’t a unified

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:50:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

this area. Those issues include animal welfare and

a personal level, I thank not only the CWU and Dave Joyce, but Mark, a
postal worker from Pencoed, who took me out on his rounds delivering
letters in my local patch and talked to me about this and other
matters. I also thank Tina, who took me around Euston blindfolded with
a guide dog. She took me through Euston and across the front of the
station, through busy areas, to show me not only the expertise of guide
dogs, the immense amount of training that they receive and how easily
it can be lost if they are attacked by other animals or scared in other
ways, but the real bond of trust that develops and how that trust can
be so easily broken by an inadvertent or a deliberate attack on a
precious companion animal or guide dog. Jonathan, a black lab, took me
round the course, with Tina 
<?notus-xml column=142?>instructing me as we went. Jonathan was a black lab—not black lab
as in Labour, but as in Labrador, although he could have been Labour. I

also thank Blue Cross, the RSPCA, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home and
others for the time they have spent with me on frequent visits to their
institutions to see their work and how a multifaceted approach is
needed to dealing with abandonment, stray dogs and breeding; I will
come to some of the detail in a moment.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:53:19"></hs_TimeCode> that basis,
one message I have for the Minister, or one thing that I would like him
to ask today and when his colleagues go into Committee with the Home
Office Bill is this: why not consolidation? I suspect that his civil
servants, good people as they are, will have said, “There is a
more pragmatic way to do this. Let’s do a little bit here and a
little bit there and so on.” But there are real concerns about
that.</hs_Para>

to this point: how do we pull together a very comprehensive range of
issues? They are not simply about sanctions, penalties and stepping in
after the event. They are about education, early intervention, stepping
in at an early stage when we see that there are problems to prevent
them from getting worse, and dealing with what is now in some ways the
factory turnover of dogs, and other animals, through the internet and
elsewhere. How is that to be dealt with if we do not pull things
together in a consolidated Bill? We come back to these points. First,
who is championing the issue, and secondly, where is the overall
strategy? We have little bits here and there. Many of those things I
will welcome in my contribution, but other things could easily be lost.
We have to do this
properly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:54:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000153">One
of the biggest lessons for us on the issue comes from what we did with
the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. That was a classic case of well
intentioned legislation that had perverse consequences, which is why we
need to get it right this time. The DDA was poorly targeted, which has
led to good dogs being seized from good owners and all the personal
trauma and inconvenience that go with it. We see dangerous individual
dogs that are not from the four proscribed breeds and thus cannot be
seized under the
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000154">There
is confusion. Veterinarians regularly tell us, “We find it hard
enough ourselves to identify whether that dog is from one of the four
proscribed breeds, but we know that that one needs to be lifted up,
taken away and either retrained or kennelled for some time and re-homed
with someone who will look after it.” Alternatively, they say,
“We think that dog is dangerous, but we can’t actually
get to it to lift
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000155">The
DDA was a classic piece of well intentioned but not well designed
legislation. To get the legislation right this time, I urge the
Minister, including in discussion with Home Office colleagues and
others, to really think about it, because we may not have another good
opportunity for a while to get the detail right and to work on the
measure with very experienced organisations outside the House, with the
EFRA Committee and its members, who have a great deal of knowledge, and
with other hon. Members. Working with those people means occasionally
giving way and acknowledging that some points that are well and
democratically made from the Floor of the House may trump what the
Minister is being told by his very able and expert civil

point well in terms of the organisational structure that is now giving
input to Government and advising them. He is also right in terms of
parliamentary consensus and outside organisations. There has been a
fair degree of consensus on the holistic way to take this forward. Blue
Cross is not the only organisation that is very strong on education and
early intervention; so are many others. There is a degree of consensus
on the issue, so the hon. Gentleman is right to urge me, as the
Opposition Front Bencher, and the coalition Government to work together

things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000158">There
are many points on which we agree with the Government. I have made it
clear to the Minister and his colleagues in the other place that we
want to provide support and ensure that the legislation goes through in

have to focus on deed, not breed, and replace crude lists of proscribed

medium term, we are with the Government, and the police, in their
argument that we cannot scrap the DDA, despite my criticisms of
it—because it is fundamentally flawed—without looking
much more at causes than symptoms, without that holistic approach. For
the moment, we have to focus on both deed and breed. We will have to do
that until we get the whole package in place. In many ways, I regret
saying that. I would like to say that we can turn a switch and do it
now, but we are in a process. If we can get it right, we will get to
the idea of focusing on individual owners and individual dogs, rather
than castigating whole breeds or castigating pet owners or dog owners
generally, but we are not quite there

overhaul of our approach is long overdue. We cannot yet discard one of
the few tools that we have in the DDA, crude as it is, but I have to
say to the Minister that it is more a blunderbuss than a rifle; it is
more a cutlass than a rapier. Innocent owners and innocent dogs get
caught up in it as well, and that is a matter for
regret<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T14:53:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000161">On
that basis, great care should be taken in extending the range of the
DDA. This is one area where we are concerned about the line that the
EFRA Committee has taken, because I understand that it suggested that
we might extend it and add to it. I have some concerns about that,
because we would be reinforcing the use of the blunderbuss approach.
With all the concerns of veterinarians about identifying the right
breeds and the development of mongrel mixes—huskies with other
dogs and even wolf hybrids and so on—I wonder whether extending
the DDA is the right approach. We should be ensuring that we get the
mix right: we should be looking at the individual dog, looking at the
individual owner and getting the packages in place to intervene very
early before the dogs attack and we have to lift them. I am sure we

If he is not on the Committee, he ought to ensure that that point is
raised at that stage. The idea of proportionate intervention may avoid
the heavy-handed, further-down-stream measures, if we can get in early
with a lighter touch. We also do not want to take unduly
disproportionate measures against individuals who might be identified
by a neighbour who says, “I’ve had enough of this one.
I’ll go in and sort it out.” There must be some
evidential test and measure to say whether there is an issue that we
need to deal with. I agree entirely with what he said, both in terms of
sanctions and the types of measure that could be deployed. We need
flexibility, before we lift a dog or take stronger, more punitive
action against an owner. In that way, we hope to reduce the number of
attacks, rather than wait for them to happen and then take punitive
action.</hs_Para>

that some form of draft guidance is being worked up in DEFRA, the Home
Office or both combined, and that that can be presented at the earliest
opportunity. For the benefit of taking the measures through and getting
them right, the guidance needs to be presented in Committee, not on
Report. If the Minister says that he cannot do it, I can tell him that
I regularly did it as a Minister. I have been told by a Committee,
“We need this next Monday.”, and I have had to do it and

me turn briefly to a couple of other issues. We welcome the proposals
to extend to private property the ability to prosecute somebody for an
attack by a dog. We also welcome the fact that the Government have
listened on the issue of trespass, but we will need to test in
Committee what trespass entails, and that will include the issue of a
property’s curtilage. Sheep dogs or other dogs belonging to
farmers, but not just farmers, will often be free to roam in
outbuildings. Such buildings are private property, and the dogs will be
there for good reasons—often for animal husbandry reasons,
because they are working dogs, not pets. We need to test how that will
work, because we need to get it right.</hs_Para>

on livestock and protected animals are another issue on which we agree
with the EFRA Committee, and we need to look at it. Again, it is partly
about taking a holistic approach. How do we pull things
together so that not only guide dogs, assistance dogs and companion
dogs, but a wide variety of other animals, are protected? Such animals
are quite easily defined under the protected animal provisions of the
Animal Welfare Act 2006. That may be the approach the Government want
to look at, or there may be some other way. We certainly do not want to
create a new list of animals—“We’ll have llamas,
but not alpacas” and so on. There is a ready-made opportunity
under the Act to deal with the issue.</hs_Para>

Members have mentioned the breeding and sale of dogs, and they are
absolutely correct that we have far too many poor breeders. The EFRA
Committee is correct that the current threshold for licensing dog
breeders needs reviewing, and I hope that will be part of the overall
approach the Government bring forward. Good dog breeding is to be
welcomed, and good prospective owners welcome the fact that a dog has
been reared and looked after well and that it has had all the medical
treatment and some of the early elements of training, if appropriate,
before they take it. However, through ignorance or sheer greed, far too
many individuals out there are breeding to no good standard or to no
standard whatever. Unfortunately, much of that spills out on to the
internet. It amazes me—perhaps it should not—that there
is now a trade in all sorts of animals on the internet, and we have to

takes me to my next point, on which the EFRA Committee also made some
wise recommendations. We need to look at how we promote good,
responsible advertising for animals on the internet, and the Government
are doing some good work on that. We accept that there will be some
advertising on the internet, but how do we stamp out the practices of
those who are churning out dogs and other animals that will end up
abandoned and wasted? Those dogs will wash up in kennelling, with all
the costs that go with that, or in places such as Battersea Dogs and
Cats Home, or they will be euthanased. That is an absolute
tragedy.</hs_Para>

education, because we often miss this aspect. Many charitable

that commentators will stereotype, saying things such as, “The
problem is on that working-class estate down the road.” Such
views are not always true; there are plenty of problems with poor
ownership and poor welfare conditions across all social groups.
Organisations such as Blue Cross and the RSPCA are going into areas
where they perceive there is a problem. They use the generous funding
people have given them to do educational work. I would like to hear
from the Minister how the Government tie that together. How do they
assist and encourage that work? What do they add to it? If we are

Are things not in place, and are they preventing us from getting this

good reasons for the delay, but I would like to hear them. I agree with
the Committee’s Chair that we need to get this absolutely right.
It is a welcome move, but it does raise a number of points, which were

their dogs and take

should pass the information on, whether to a database or whatever. If

the issue is about tackling those owners who for one reason or another
do not understand about the control and welfare of their
dogs—their pets or companion animals. It is also about
recognising that the majority of owners are good ones. We need to
design policy that does not unduly affect the responsible owners while
leaving the others aside: that must be its thrust. We look forward to
working with the Government, and thank the EFRA Committee for its
continuing work, which has flushed out some of the issues. I hope that
in a few months we will be able to bring forward part of what is
required, and that the Minister will deal with all the other aspects of
the matter. Then we can genuinely and radically take the action that we
should have taken at the time of the Dangerous Dogs Acts. They were
flawed: let us get this one

Bill is before the House that will enact parts of our response to the
undoubted issue raised by hon. Members, on which some have campaigned
for a long time. I welcome the support that the Committee has been able
to give to the Government’s position. As I have said, there are
several aspects of the matter on which we have gone further than was
perhaps originally intended, in recognition of the strength of the
Committee’s arguments. There are some areas on which we still do
not have 100% agreement, and I shall deal with those in my
remarks.</hs_Para>

Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which amends the
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, had its Second Reading on Monday, and there
was an excellent debate. The House broadly endorsed the
Government’s approach. The Bill includes provisions that will
extend the 1991 Act to all places, including private property. It
provides legislative backing for the police and Crown Prosecution
Service to pursue prosecutions for attacks on private property. That
will reassure victims and their families that the law is on their side.
I hope that once the Bill is passed the circumstances that

almost 
<?notus-xml column=151?>an extension of the person with whom it works. It is part of that
person’s being, and an attack on a guide dog or hearing dog
makes a huge difference to their life. It is right to clarify and

Bill will also clarify the fact that courts should consider the
character of the owner when taking decisions about dogs of prohibited
types, and dangerously out-of-control dogs. That point was raised by
several hon. Members: it is not the breed, but what the individual dog
is doing, that is important. There is no breed that cannot be dangerous
in the hands of an irresponsible owner. Sometimes that fact is taken to
considerable lengths, because there are people—a very small
number—who deliberately have dogs that they use as weapons, to
intimidate and on occasion actually cause hurt to another
person.</hs_Para>

to <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:28:16"></hs_TimeCode>a point
raised by the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Bolton West: new legislation is not needed to deal
effectively with a dog being deliberately set on a person, to injure
them. It would be covered by the Offences Against the Person
Act 1861, and the maximum penalty would be life imprisonment. The
question of the appropriateness of the maximum fine level does not
apply: the law treats such action as a very serious offence, and the
prosecuting authorities have the capacity to deal with it.</hs_Para>

Bill would also provide the police with discretion to use the civil
route in cases involving prohibited types of dog, with improved
welfare, reduced kennel time and police savings in time and money. It
would provide comprehensive powers for the authorities to take
preventive action to stop dog attacks and nip issues in the bud,
through, for example, a community protection
notice.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:29:22"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

was raised by many hon. Members in the debate, and we need to discuss
the fundamental question whether our proposed measures in the
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill treat the same issue and
have the same rigour as the so-called dog control notices that many
advocate. My answer is that they do. In fact, they are an even more
flexible tool.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061347000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000209">I accept,
however, that we need to substantiate that position and satisfy
people’s concerns. One thing I would say to everyone involved in
the debate is, “Please let us not get hung up on the label of
dog control notices”. It is profoundly unhelpful to the debate
about providing protection if the only thing people are arguing for is
something with that name, rather than something that does what they
want to see done. That is my first
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:30:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000210">Secondly,
many people have pointed with approbation to what is available in
Scotland, saying, “That is the answer. Why on earth are the UK
Government so stupid or obstinate as not to follow the Scottish
route?” Of course I respect what the Scottish Government do and
the measures they introduce, but we need carefully and critically to
consider whether the dog control notice legislation in Scotland
actually achieves the objectives it was set. There is some evidence
from Scottish local authorities that the notices are not working as
well as hon. Members would believe—if, indeed, they believed
everything that was sent to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000211">At
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:33:15"></hs_TimeCode> 21 May
meeting of the cross-party group on animal welfare in Edinburgh,
Scottish local authorities expressed a number of concerns, which
highlighted the 
<?notus-xml column=152?>ongoing problems with the dog control notice—or
DCN—system. The meeting was also attended by a number of dog
welfare organisations from across the UK, and a series of detailed
problems were identified.</hs_Para>

notice in Scotland must be served by two officers, and any breach needs
corroborated evidence from two officers to pursue a case, which is a
limiting factor in bringing successful conclusions. A person who is
served a dog control notice must attend the council offices, or two
officers must visit their home, so it is hardly the on-the-spot
mechanism that some have suggested it is. A dog has to have been out of
control on at least one occasion before a DCN can be served, so the
measure does not nip the issue in the bud. Since some people have
strongly advocated that we need to be able to identify the problem
before it happens, I am not sure that the notices satisfy that
test.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000213">Another
problem is that the
police<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:33:15"></hs_TimeCode> in
Scotland have no powers to serve DCNs; only local authorities do.
Importantly, there is no requirement for a dog owner to advise their
local authority if they re-home a dog with another owner, or to inform
it of the new owner’s address. A potentially
dangerous dog, therefore, can easily appear in a different local
authority area with absolutely no recourse.</hs_Para>

make clear what the DCNs in Scotland do that we do not and, likewise,
what we can offer that DCNs do not. When we have done that critical
comparison, I hope that hon. Members will take a view as to whether we

but I ask people to treat the arguments with the necessary respect and
care, rather than simply adopting the slogan that this is the only

get out of control, and to be able to deal with that at an early stage.
Crucially, they are personal to the owner and not the dog—a
point stressed by everyone—and that is an important difference
between our measures and the dog control notices. The focus must be on
the individual understanding of the person’s responsibility for

be in the hands of local authorities in combination with the police. I
can only express the hope that such behaviour will be a key area, but
we will not give it a greater priority just by giving it a different
name. Either it will be seen as something that local authorities and
constabularies need to address, or it will not. I hope and expect that
local authorities will address it because of all the cases that hon.

they do not do so, I hope that they will swiftly be reminded by their

issue that has repeatedly been raised, with several Members covering
common ground, is consolidation of legislation. I perfectly understand
the argument that it is nice to have a neat legislative bundle with
everything that relates to a particular subject. The fact is that
English and Welsh law is not like that, and never has been. It is quite
difficult to achieve, and we have sometimes found that consolidated
legislation misses out important elements of former legislation. To be
perfectly honest, I am not convinced that the substantial resource
required to consolidate legislation is worth it, because practitioners
perfectly well understand the legislative tools at their
disposal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000231">We
should instead concentrate on consolidating our approach to, and our
strategy for dealing with, dog control and welfare issues.
That is different from getting the legislation into some sort of legal
Napoleonic code. For instance, when we considered consolidation, we
found that the provisions are reasonably accessible and that there is
no great confusion. It certainly has not been brought to my attention
that there are significant confusions in existing
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000232">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:43:57"></hs_TimeCode>
we consolidated, would we retain all the civil and criminal options
currently available? Some people ask why on earth we rely on
legislation from 140 or 150 years ago, but such legislation
is sometimes a good basis for dealing with illegal activity. Many
practitioners have told us that it would be a great mistake to
consolidate the Dogs Act 1871 into current legislation because it is
very useful and covers some areas that are not obviously covered by
other
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:44:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061347000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/halltext/130613h0001.htm#13061347000233">I
hear the arguments for consolidation, but, first, we could not have
introduced the measures currently before the House in the time scale
available—that is important, because this is urgent—and
secondly, it would not necessarily achieve anything. I agree with

Irranca-Davies:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his explanation.
To give him some comfort, when I was in his position and I was asked to
consolidate legislation, wise civil servants always said, “Keep
well away from it. If you do that, we will not be able to do a dozen
other important things, because of the timing.” If that is his
approach, I urge him to consider how to bring forth a more consolidated
strategy across Government, and not just have a piecemeal approach. All
the issues that we have talked about show the clear necessity of having
a joined-up approach—not just in Whitehall, but in local
government and agencies—to deal with a range of measures. If we
are not going to have
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:45:31"></hs_TimeCode>consolidated

for Ogmore. People must know, first of all, what is and is not
appropriate, and the consequences of breeding puppies. Buyers also need
to know whether they are buying a breed that needs a five-mile run
every morning, so they do not keep it in a flat on the 17th floor. They
need to know—the hon. Gentleman will know—how adorable a
Jack Russell might or might not be before they buy one, and what

ignorant cruelty can be involved when people buy the wrong
breed of dog in the wrong circumstances and then find that they cannot

important.</hs_Para>

important point was raised by the Committee and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:56:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Camborne and Redruth about the threshold for needing a
licence. I would love to be able to give him an absolutely explicit
response, so that he could say, “Yes, that’s the
answer.” It is not as simple as that, as is so often the case
with licensing. Although there is a five litter cut-off for what is, in
any circumstances, considered a business, it is for the local authority
to determine who is in the business of breeding and selling dogs when
it comes to smaller numbers of litters a year.</hs_Para>

definitive term that has the sanction of statutory law behind it; it is
for the courts to agree or not agree with the local authority.
Actually, there are a variety of circumstances in which that sort of
decision comes before the court: there is a degree of flexibility, and
trading standards officials must satisfy the court that what they are
dealing with is a business in the legislative sense. One litter
produced in a 12-month period is unlikely to be considered a business;
five litters almost certainly will be, but local authorities have a
number of tests that they are asked to apply to determine whether
somebody is trading. I will not go into them now, because that is for
another Department to determine, but those are the criteria used, and
they have the support of case law, if not statute law, in deciding
whether somebody falls into that category.</hs_Para>

Eustice:</Member></B> The point I was making is that there would be
clarity if the number was simply two litters. Local authorities could
work to that. The situation that the Minister outlined means that if a
local authority has concerns about a breeder producing three litters a
year, it must then go through a legal process. The breeder could use as
a defence the fact that there were fewer than five litters. Then there
is an expensive, difficult legal process, which does not incentivise
local authorities to enforce standards in those
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-13T15:59:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for The Cotswolds set out clearly why he is concerned
about the canine and feline sector council. Let me be absolutely clear
that it is not a Government organisation; it is independent of
Government. I hope that immediately sets some of his concerns to rest.
However, as an independent sectoral body, it could be a useful vehicle
that pulls together the views of the sector and feeds them into the
Animal Health and Welfare Board for England, which again is not a
regulatory body. It simply provides advice for Ministers from the
perspective of the users of welfare legislation in the widest sense.
Therefore, what we are talking about is not a regulatory or a policy
formation body, but a conduit for information, hopefully with the
benefit of proper discussion within the sector.</hs_Para>

FY14/15 we currently have less certainty about peacekeeping demands. We
have provisionally estimated a peacekeeping top-up of £85
million from the conflict pool, giving a projected available allocation
of £224 million for conflict pool programmes. Once
the position is clearer, and further negotiations on UK contributions
to UN peacekeeping have taken place, we will update these figures and
would expect to be able to allocate some additional funding to the
conflict pool for the FY 14/15. The table below shows the

member states including the UK stressed that further work was needed,
that clarity was required on where exemptions would apply, and
supporting a properly-defined “risk-based” approach. The
UK stressed the need to take account of the effect on small and
medium-sized enterprises as well as major ones. A number of states,
including the UK, argued that it was too soon

presidency made it clear that the general approach was conditional on
the text being based on article 83(2) rather than article 325 of the

temporary internal border controls, with a greater role for the
Commission in the implementation of the evaluation system and increased
European Parliament access to documents. The presidency also welcomed
the third biannual Schengen governance report. The Commission noted

highlighted what he saw as key achievements, the greatest being the
full operation of the new asylum service, as well as the
appointment of a single co-ordinator to administer the structural
funds. He noted that the focus would now be on raising the standards by
opening new reception centres, introducing mobile screening units and
through quicker processing. The Greek Minister thanked the UK for its
financial support for returns from Greece. The Commission welcomed
Greece’s progress, but remained concerned about conditions in
some detention centres, and reminded Greece that, given continuing
under spending of EU funds, increasing absorption capacity should be a
focus for the Greek
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13061331000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/wmstext/130613m0001.htm#13061331000150">The
main Council started with a discussion on foreign fighters and the
potential threat they pose if and when they return to Europe. Member
states expressed concern about the matter and I agreed to take forward
work with a small number of affected member states. The EU
counter-terrorism co-ordinator (Gilles de Kerchove) provided an
overview of his recent paper on foreign fighters and urged Ministers to
take immediate action to address the potential threat to EU internal
security that jihadists travelling to Syria posed. The UK highlighted
the importance in supporting those who wanted to do all they can to
support the humanitarian effort, while deterring them from actually
travelling out to Syria where they are at risk of putting themselves
and innocent Syrians in danger. I expressed my disappointment that the
European Parliament had failed to adopt its report on the EU PNR
directive. The external action service (Maciej Popowski) cautioned
against viewing all those who travelled to Syria as terrorists and
reminded member states of the need also to address
counter-proliferation. The Commission declared its intention to carry
out a risk assessment on foreign fighters and enhance the work of the
radicalisation awareness network. The presidency concluded that there
was broad support for the ideas in the CTC’s paper which would
be taken forward at working level. The UK also provided a brief update
on the recent attack in Woolwich and thanked colleagues for their
messages of
condolence.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13061331000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/wmstext/130613m0001.htm#13061331000151">Next
the presidency sought views on the Commission’s proposal for a
new Europol regulation focusing on the proposed merger of Europol and
the European Police College (CEPOL) and strengthened obligations on
member states to provide Europol with information. There was a clear
consensus against the merger despite the Commission  
<?notus-xml column=19?>highlighting that the Council had a duty to follow the common approach
on EU decentralised agencies and make efficiency and cost savings. The
UK spoke out against the merger, agreeing with 18 other member states
that it would have a negative impact on both training and operational
activities and that the Commission’s own calculations had failed
to demonstrate cost savings. The presidency concluded that work would
begin at expert level on the assumption that the merger would not be
included in the
regulation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13061331000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/wmstext/130613m0001.htm#13061331000152">On
the proposed obligation to share information, a number of member states
expressed opposition to the Commission’s proposals. The UK
acknowledged the importance of information sharing but said we could
not accept any proposal that made national law enforcement agencies
accountable to Europol, or that would lead to member states losing
control over decisions on what data they share and with whom. Increased
obligations could also result in member states overwhelming Europol
with information in order to comply with the regulation, to the
detriment of the quality of the information. The UK also raised
concerns over obligations to carry out domestic investigations at the
request of Europol. No other member states intervened on this point.

level.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13061331000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/wmstext/130613m0001.htm#13061331000153">There

was a discussion on the protection of refugees from Syria. The European
external action service was pleased to announce that President Barroso
had secured additional aid for Syria, and hoped that the Geneva II
process, the international peace conference held in Geneva that
discusses the conflict in Syria, would make progress in the medium
term. According to the European asylum support office, Syria remained
in the top three asylum intake for the EU member states and anticipated
that this trend would remain. The Commission welcomed the increase in
humanitarian aid and noted that the UNHCR would shortly call for the
humanitarian admission of 10,000 refugees, with a further 2,000 set
aside for resettlement to the EU. The Commissioner welcomed the
high recognition rate within the EU, but remained concerned
about the divergent practices between member states and the detention
of Syrian nationals. The UK noted an increase in Syrian asylum seekers,
and pointed to increased humanitarian aid as the most urgent short-term
priority for the EU; the UK had pledged £170 million to date.
The medium-term priority should be the establishment of the regional
protection programme (RPP) to provide support in the regions affected
and the UK hoped its place on the steering committee for the programme
would be confirmed soon. Finally, the UK welcomed work by the European
Asylum Support Office (EASO) to develop an accurate picture of asylum
claims and in co-ordination of any special support that would be
requited as a result. The presidency noted that this discussion would
continue at the Informal Council in July, where the UNHCR would outline
further the plans for the admission and resettlement of Syrian
nationals.</hs_Para>

expressed a wish to work together to look at possible abuse of free
movement. The UK, supported by a number of other member states,
stressed the need to tackle abuse to ensure continued public confidence
in the principle, and called for follow-up work in the Council with a
report back to JHA Ministers. However, led by the Commission, a number
of member states resisted, arguing that the discussion should be led by
the Commission with a focus on the evidence of the problem. The
presidency asked a Commission-led group to investigate the issue to
provide an interim report to the October JHA Council and a final report
in December. It was decided that the EPSCO Ministers would also be
given the opportunity to feed into the report. The UK thanked the
presidency for the discussion and for the recognition that there should

not a separate approach to oversight of the commissioning of NHS
fertility services. However, NHS England has general intervention
powers in relation to clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), should it
be satisfied that a CCG is failing or has failed to discharge any of
its functions, or there is a significant risk that it will fail to do
so. These include directing the CCG to discharge a function in a
particular way and within a specified period. NHS England also has
powers to require documents and information, and to require from a CCG
explanation of how it is proposing to exercise any of its functions.
Legislation requires NHS England to publish guidance setting out how it
proposes to exercise its intervention powers, so as to ensure that the
arrangements are clear and
transparent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061353000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/text/130613w0001.htm#13061353000048">The

Children under 18
have the lowest risk of suicide of any age group. However,
the risk is higher among some vulnerable groups of teenagers, including

as a group for which tailored approaches are needed.</hs_Para>

their knowledge of the patients they serve, are best placed to plan and
employ a workforce appropriate to the needs of their patients, based on
clinical need and sound evidence. Where changes are planned to the size
and shape of the workforce, health care organisations must provide
assurance that the safety and quality of patient care is maintained or

approach to cutting its expenditure on property to address the wasteful
situation it inherited at the time of the last election where millions
of pounds of taxpayers’ money were spent on unnecessary and

the property estate ensured savings of £620 million last year

year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061357000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/text/130613w0001.htm#13061357000077">The

Whitehall (which have been re-used by the Department for International
Development) and Admiralty

agricultural county shows with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and
DEFRA is taking no steps at present specifically to reduce the
regulatory burden on agricultural county shows. However, DEFRA is keen
to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens wherever possible, so I would
welcome a letter describing the specific burdens of DEFRA regulation on
such shows along with suggestions for improvement. DEFRA will launch a
new Red Tape Challenge theme later in the summer covering agricultural

place a burden on agricultural county shows, we would welcome comments

of the Early Departure Payment (EDP) scheme were set under the previous
Administration and came into effect when the Armed Forces Pension
Scheme 2005 (AFPS 05) was introduced in April 2005. To qualify for an
EDP an individual has to reach age 40 or over and have at least 18
years relevant service. Relevant service includes any period of AFPS 05

had a break in service prior to 6 April 2005 cannot normally
count their previous service—which would have been as a member

with a subsequent period of AFPS 75 service for pension purposes and
the individual transferred their benefits to AFPS 05 under the 2006
Offer to Transfer, it can be counted towards the
EDP.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061357000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/text/130613w0002.htm#13061357000268">There

Lidington:</Member></B> As part of a wider process of Alliance Reform,
the NATO Secretary-General initialled a review aimed at strengthening
NATO's external audit function and the resulting report was considered
by the North Atlantic Council on 29 May. The UK has pushed for the
highest possible standards of fiscal governance, and for a strong and
effective audit arrangement in order to assure compliance. More
specifically the UK has sought improved transparency through the
automatic publication of NATO audit reports (unless there is a security
reason not to do so) and improved accountability through the update of
NATO's financial regulations to draw clear lines of responsibility. We
have also sought improved financial reporting across the Alliance,
including through the appointment of a head of financial reporting. The
UK has also sought to improve IBAN's accountability and it has been
agreed that IBAN will be peer-reviewed by national supreme audit
institutions (SAI); a pilot study will be conducted to explore how IBAN
might make the best possible use of the expertise that exists in
SAIs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061357000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/text/130613w0002.htm#13061357000326">We

reform. We have pressed for the need for an efficient and effective
NATO that makes the best use of its resources. We want any NATO
auditing authority to be effective in holding NATO to account, using

Fixed length sanctions: A sanction of between one week and 26 weeks is

is no immediately apparent policy for extending derived entitlement to
basic pension to individuals who reach state pension age after the
implementation of single tier, as any continuation of this facility as
it currently stands would essentially involve a continuation of the
current system in tandem with the new system. Administratively this
would be complex, and more importantly it would mean that the new
system would not result in the clarity of outcome which is central to
the reform
package.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061357000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130613/text/130613w0002.htm#13061357000530">At
the same time, the Government notes the decreasing need for this
facility in Great Britain. As the paper ‘State pension
entitlement derived from a current or former spouse's or civil
partner's National Insurance contributions’, published on

consistently improved, and the significant majority of women reaching
state pension age in GB can now expect to receive at least the

applied for a licence and 92 have had their application rejected on the
basis that they fall within one of the excluded categories that are
necessary to prevent the rights of the IOC sponsors being infringed.
Notwithstanding the need for some exclusions, the new Recognition
