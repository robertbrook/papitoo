Secretary of State for Defence (Mr Philip Hammond):</Member></B>
Providing transitional support to service leavers is a high priority.
Those who have completed a minimum duration in the armed forces are
offered a framework of support services. Of those who make use of this
framework, over 90% of those seeking work find employment within six
months of leaving the armed forces.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T14:38:48"></hs_TimeCode>, we
believe we can do more, and I announced in September the appointment of
Lord Ashcroft as the Prime Minister’s special representative for
veterans’ transition. He has a long-standing interest in the
armed forces and a track record of support for veterans’
charities. He will review the support available to service leavers
making the transition to civilian life and make recommendations for
improving that support and for better co-ordination across Government
and with service charities. We look forward to receiving his
recommendations in due
course<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T14:35:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1210222000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0001.htm#1210222000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Hazel Blears" PimsId="4035" UID="1210222000254" xid="51" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0001.htm#1210222000254">Hazel
Blears:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that
reply. Over the next two years, 9,000 brave men and women who have put
their lives on the line for our country will be coming home from
Afghanistan. They will need help to find a home and retrain to find a
job, and support for their families. At the moment, they are often
pushed from pillar to post around local authorities. If there were a
veterans champion in each local authority who could co-ordinate those
services, they could make the system work effectively for those
veterans coming home. Will the Secretary of State consider the campaign

all advertising expenditure by the Ministry of Defence is to attract
and recruit the best personnel for the armed forces. In the current
financial year, the MOD has to date had approval from the Cabinet
Office efficiency and reform group to spend £12 million on
recruitment marketing operations to fund general service recruitment
activities. A further £18 million was approved for specific
recruitment marketing campaigns to address pinch points. The efficiency
and 
<?notus-xml column=689?>reform group is due to decide soon whether to grant a
further request for £250,000 for marketing
operations and just under £3 million for pinch point campaigns.
Further requests may arise during the course of the year. Like all
Departments, the MOD seeks to minimise the cost of advertising.
Spending has, for example, been reduced from nearly £60 million
in
2009-10.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2012-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2012_10_22_PT_1/83B06313FEAB5787AF43C4CAC0E5C6BEA8D0BEA0" __version__="1.15"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2012">Monday

past—I recall it happening in the 1970s, under the Labour
Government of Wilson-Callaghan—so one must continue to recruit;

some specific good news and one direct example: BT is set to bolster
its current work force by recruiting 250 further engineers from service
personnel already committed to leaving the armed forces. That will make

The Ministry of Defence and other Departments have made important
changes in service children’s education. We have introduced the
service pupil premium, and we have extended it to children of military
personnel who have died in service and to eligible service children
whose parents have left the armed forces. In addition, the MOD
introduced the support fund for state schools with service children.
The new schools admissions code now enables infant schools in England
to treat the children of UK service personnel as a permitted exception
to class size regulations. That means that infant schools may admit
service children and increase the class size  to more than 30
if they feel they have the resources to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T15:16:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

has already said, more than 150 local authorities have signed the
community covenant, and we are now on track to get to 200. They are
coming in fast, which gives us the nice problem of tracking them as
they come in. If I can give my hon. Friend another example of how the
scheme works in practice, Oxfordshire county council has amended its
admissions procedures so that service personnel who apply to move their
children into an Oxfordshire school before they move to Oxfordshire can
use a British Forces Post Office number on the application form. That
might sound like a small thing, but prior to the change service
personnel could not apply for a school place until they had moved into
an area. Allowing service personnel to apply in advance of their
children moving to an area materially affects their family’s
quality of life. I commend Oxfordshire county council for its
initiative and I hope others will copy

me now turn to the eurozone. Britain is not in the eurozone and we will
not be joining the eurozone, but it is in our national interest for the
uncertainty surrounding the eurozone to end. I have argued for some
time that a working eurozone needs a working banking union. It is one
of the features that a successful single currency needs. Obviously you
do not need a banking union because you have a single market; you need
it because you have a single currency—so Britain should not, and
will not, be part of that banking union.</hs_Para>

banks will be supervised by the Bank of England, not by the European
Central Bank, and British taxpayers will not be guaranteeing or
rescuing eurozone banks, but we do need eurozone members to get on with
forming a banking union. At the Council, I joined those who were
arguing for progress to be made on the plan that had been announced in
June. To put it simply, I believe that it is not enough to have a
banking union that is stripped of the very elements—such as
mutualised deposit guarantees, a common fiscal backstop and a 
<?notus-xml column=700?>framework for rescuing banks—that are needed to break the
dangerous link in the eurozone between sovereign debt problems and the
stability of eurozone banks. But because not all countries outside the
eurozone—like Britain—will want to join such a banking
union, it is also essential that the unity and integrity of the single
market is fully respected. The organisation that currently ensures a
level playing field for banking within the single market is the
European Banking Authority. We need to make sure that it will continue
to function properly, ensuring fair and effective decision making.

the next Council in November will discuss the financial framework for
Europe between 2014 and 2020. We have not put in place tough
settlements in Britain in order to go to Brussels and sign up to big

want that any more than British voters, and that is why our Governments

We need to see how the banking union proposals develop. We do not yet

not think it would be in our interests to stop the eurozone putting in
place something that a single currency needs in order to function. Our
economy is suffering today because of uncertainty in the eurozone.
Those high interest rates in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal affect
us too, and they need action, including a banking union. We in the
United Kingdom have a single currency—the pound
sterling—and we are going to keep it. It works—and it
works partly because we have a banking union. The countries of the
eurozone need one too, so blocking it just for the sake of it does not
make sense.</hs_Para>

constituents, as I would say to everybody, that I think Britain
benefits from having a positive and strong relationship with our
European allies and partners. We are a trading nation and have been
throughout our history. Some 50% of our exports go to European
countries and we need not only those markets to be open, but to have a
say in how the rules of those markets are written. That is in
Britain’s interest. As the European Union changes, and
particularly as the eurozone becomes a tighter bloc with its own
banking and fiscal union, the relationship between those outside the
single currency and those inside is clearly going to change. We as a

fiscal union, the tighter the political union will be drawn,
because—for instance—German voters having to stand behind
Greek deposits, or French voters having to pay for the restructuring of
a Spanish bank are deeply political questions. In my view, as the
eurozone deepens its commitments, as is inevitable for a working single
currency, there will be pressures for further political union, and for
further treaties and treaty changes. That is why I believe it is
possible for Britain to seek a new settlement and seek fresh consent on
that settlement, but we have to show some patience, because right now
the issue in Europe is how to firefight the problems of the
eurozone—get down interest rates and get the eurozone economy
moving—rather than thinking through all the consequences of

I do so, however, I want to remind the House of some of the
panel’s findings. First, it found that the safety of the crowd
entering Hillsborough’s Leppings Lane terrace was
“compromised at every level”. The capacity of the terrace
had been significantly over-calculated, meaning that hundreds more
tickets were sold than the area could safely accommodate. Crush
barriers were lower than set out in safety rules. Their layout was also
inadequate. The small number of turnstiles meant that delays were
always likely at a capacity match. There were three times more people
per turnstile at Leppings Lane than at the opposite end of the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T16:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

officers, both serving and retired. It will be thorough and
wide-ranging. As I have previously said, I remain committed to ensuring
that the IPCC has all the powers and resources it needs to carry out
its investigations thoroughly, transparently and exhaustively. The
Government are already looking at what additional powers the IPCC will
need, which includes proposals to require current and ex-police
officers who may be witness to a crime to attend an interview, and
whether this might require fast-track legislation. I therefore welcome
what the shadow Home Secretary set out at the weekend about the
opportunity for us to sit down and discuss the proposals, and to see
whether fast-track legislation is the right way forward—I think

sort of collective view came to be held across the country—that
the fans had been responsible. We can discuss how that came
about—it is quite clear in the report how it was fuelled by
certain newspaper reports—but everybody came to accept that view
and not to question it. It is to the great honour of the hon. Gentleman

There are also wider problems that give cause for concern in relation

constable and a chief constable dismissed for gross misconduct, and a
number of senior officers across the country are currently under

They were failures that spanned nearly three decades: the failure to
improve the safety of the ground in the years before
Hillsborough; the failure to learn from previous crowd
problems; the failure to organise crowd safety before the match; the
failure to deliver crowd safety during the match; the
failure to close the tunnel once the gate was opened; the failure to
help fans in the crush speedily; the failure to be honest about what
happened and to investigate what happened; a failure to get to the
truth; and a failure to provide justice. That is a long list of
failures, which have caused untold sorrow and anguish, and which
underpin the tragic death of 96

long list, too, of untruths have now finally been exposed: the untruths

account of how and why their loved one died; a failure to hold anyone
to account, either through the criminal courts or through disciplinary
procedures; a systematic cover-up; and a campaign of misinformation
that maligned innocent people.</hs_Para>

there is agreement right across this House about the importance of both
action and accountability. Although the Hillsborough panel was set up
before the election, she and the Prime Minister have supported it since

happened at the time of Hillsborough, for things that happened
subsequently and for the things that have happened most recently. The
hon. Gentleman will know that the Home Secretary and I are both limited

me make a few points about the inquest. Clearly, everyone is keen for a
new inquest to be reopened as soon as possible although we recognise,
of course, that the proper legal processes must be pursued and that the
Attorney-General has 450,000 documents to consider. Given how long the
families have already waited, I hope that the Ministry of Justice and
the Home Office can consider together whether any additional support
must be provided for the Attorney-General’s Office so that it
can complete that in as timely a manner as possible. Clearly, the
process must start as soon as is practical.
<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:05:47"></hs_TimeCode>I hope, too,
that the families will be listened to on the importance of holding the
inquest not in Sheffield but in the north-west.</hs_Para>

panel’s report was clear that the coroner’s decision to
implement a 3.15 pm cut-off was flawed and that some people survived
for a significant period beyond that time. The report also found,
tragically, that a swifter, better focused and properly equipped
response would have had the potential to save more lives. The emergency
response after 3.15pm has never been challenged and it must be
now.</hs_Para>

concerns about the inquest that have long been raised by the families
emerge clearly from the panel’s report: the way it was
structured; the continued credence given to the unfounded claims about
drinking and alcohol levels; the reliance on altered police witness
statements rather than on the original testimony of officers; and much
more besides. Clearly, it is important that a reopened inquest is not
confined to considering the events that took place after 3.15 and there
must be a proper answer for every one of the 96 families about what
happened to their loved ones. That means that the families will need
legal representation, too, and I hope, given the exceptional
circumstances, that the Home Secretary and the Ministry of Justice will
ensure that that happens directly so that the families do not need to
go through further hassle and uncertainty with the Legal Services
Commission<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:07:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102221000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102221000017">Let
me turn to the criminal investigation. The IPCC has already identified
two kinds of potential criminal or misconduct issues based on the
disclosures in the report. The first concern what happened at
Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 and the events that led up to it,
as well as the potential culpability of individuals and institutions
for the deaths, which will mean reconsidering those unheeded warnings,
the safety standards, the lack of an updated safety certificate, the
planning, the operational decisions, the failure to close the tunnel,
the failure to 
<?notus-xml column=730?>declare a major incident on the day and more. The second concern the
cover-up, the potential perversion of the course of justice and
misconduct events.</hs_Para>

want to dwell on the second group of issues for a moment. The purpose
and role of the police are to protect people and to pursue truth
without fear or favour, wherever it might take them, in the interests
of justice. The panel’s report shows that at Hillsborough the
police failed to keep people safe, that they distorted and buried the
truth, and that justice was betrayed. The panel’s report was
devastating in its exposure of what happened in South Yorkshire police,
with 164 statements taken from the officers on the day identified for
substantive amendment, of which 116 were changed. A series of
statements that revealed the lack of leadership from senior officers as
the crisis built were all deleted and so, too, were statements about
normal practice on closing the tunnel once the gate was
opened.</hs_Para>

scale of anything that the IPCC has done before. It will also require
powers that the IPCC does not have. For example, evidence will need to
be taken from large numbers of serving and retired police officers, and
also from police staff, former police legal advisers, former civil
servants, even MPs and maybe even journalists. However, the IPCC does
not have the powers to do that. Although it can pursue officers where
it has good reason to believe that they have committed a criminal
offence, if it is seeking witness statements or pursuing disciplinary
offences, its powers are much more limited. The IPCC itself has told

there is a delay in any part of the investigation, then somebody, or a
group of people, can press the body concerned, whether it be the IPCC,
the DPP or individuals, to get on with the job. An investigation must
be done fully and properly to uncover the truth and bring about
justice, but we also need to make sure that it is not going to drag on

I welcome the points that Government Front-Bench representatives have
made about resources. The IPCC has said that a substantial amount of
work is required initially to scope the investigation, including
identifying the resources required. It is, therefore, likely to be many
months before officers are contacted by the investigation team.
Any further delay would be of considerable concern. I hope that the

final point on the disciplinary investigations is that the IPCC has
noted that retired police officers are not liable for any misconduct
sanction. That is obviously very troubling for the public in many
cases, because it makes it possible for police officers who have
committed 
<?notus-xml column=734?>serious misconduct, or who have breached the great trust put
in the office of constable, to retire on full pension without any
further investigation or sanction. Given that 23 years have passed
since Hillsborough, this is a particularly sensitive concern. Many
officers have already retired and many more may do so before these
investigations are concluded. Will the Home Secretary consider the

respond to the hon. Gentleman’s important point. The wider issue
applies to a whole series of cases. If officers have taken early
retirement or retired at the normal age, further investigations or
sanctions should be considered if there was serious misconduct while
they were in office. The issue is complex, but I will happily discuss
it further with the Home Secretary to make sure that justice is not
denied in the case of Hillsborough as a result of long-standing

example of the inappropriate actions of West Midlands police relates to
the special constable who held Kevin in her arms as he passed away
shortly before 4 pm. Special WPC Debra Martin’s original
statement, made within weeks of the disaster, described finding
Kevin’s pulse, resuscitating him, hearing him 
<?notus-xml column=737?>call for his mother and holding him as he died just before 4 pm.
However, a few months later Miss Martin was visited at her home by West
Midlands police officers. In total, she was visited on four separate
occasions by senior police officers whose aim was to convince her that
her original statement was mistaken and that Kevin was not alive when
she treated him. Considerable pressure was put on Miss Martin to ratify
the amended statement, and I understand that she was even told that she
could not have looked after Kevin because she was not at Hillsborough.
She was accused of standing by and doing nothing as people
died; she was told she was making the whole thing up. In the end, she
succumbed to pressure and signed the second statement without reading
it. In that second statement, everything that referred to signs of life
in Kevin was gone, and there was no reference to a pulse or to
him saying, “Mum”. Miss Martin has stated on numerous
occasions that she stands by her original statement and that she was
bullied by senior police officers to sign the second,

either altered or deliberately ignored, prosecutions must follow.
Secondly, the Attorney-General must deliver on his promise to ask the
High Court for new inquests into the 96 deaths. Previous inquests have
been shown to be false, and they must be quashed in law.

that it was not given the Kop end to accommodate its larger support;
that extra tickets were given to Nottingham Forest, which had smaller
support; and that there had been a significant crush incident in 1981
and problems between then and 1989, but nothing significant was done
and Hillsborough continued to be used as a venue. They would not have
believed that the police had decided they wanted to put side fencing on
the terracing as segregation and requested that the turnstiles should
be altered to direct supporters into the correct pens, but Sheffield
Wednesday rejected the suggestion on the basis of cost. They would not
have believed that the ground did not have a valid safety certificate,
and that an experienced commander, Superintendent Mole, was replaced 21
days before the match. We do not know to this day, and neither did the
panel ascertain, why that happened. The panel said that it was a

they had done in previous years; that the police lost control outside
the ground; that communications between police officers in the command
posts inside and outside the ground were, to say the least, chaotic;
that the police opened an outside gate and did not block off the tunnel
to pens 3 and 4; and that the officer in charge of the operation
ignored what was happening in front in his own eyes—supporters
were in serious trouble, being crushed, and, as we know, dying. He then
lies about what happened, and police officers engage in a co-ordinated

successive reports, it is unlikely that everyone will agree on every
detail of the awful events of 15 April 1989. Each person, depending on
how they were placed and why they were there, will have their own
slightly different perspective, but I am sure that they would all agree
on one thing. No one, whether supporter, player, steward, policeman, or
council or FA official, whether partly responsible or utterly
blameless, would not if they could go back in time do absolutely
everything they could to prevent something like from this happening.
That is because the victims, as we know now, were not ticketless or
drunken or badly behaved, but those to whom all owed a duty of care. It
simply should not have happened, and we now know that, for a whole
range of different reasons, it could have been prevented from
happening.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102225000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102225000003">When
the story was told, people saw different things and offered different
explanations, and obviously some had a different agenda other than
simply to get the facts out in the open. The South Yorkshire police,
for example, were aware from the start that potential civil and
criminal liability was an issue, and they got the lawyers in. What
shocked me most reading the report was the tampering with the evidence
of their own officers and their apparent complicity with
misrepresentation in the media. The tampering was of a very formal
kind; we have heard some horrific examples, but it was more
institutional than that. They drew explicitly and openly on an unclear
distinction that they made between opinion and fact, and then
eliminated, with the knowledge of the West Midlands police and the
assistance of their lawyers, a stream of inconvenient statements they
had had from their own officers, including the plentiful references to 
<?notus-xml column=741?>“panic”, “chaos” and
“disorganisation”. They were all eliminated as
“just opinion”.
<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:49:38"></hs_TimeCode>They even
changed evidence of “non-existent” radio communication to
“hard to hear” radio communication. In other words, they
engaged in an organised rewrite or editing of history. It was a clear
institutional
strategy<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:49:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Admittedly, officers signed the amended scripts, but it would have been
hard to insist on the re-inclusion of items that criticised their
superiors and police performance, once they had been eliminated higher
up—not exactly a smart career move.</hs_Para>

do not believe that the world is peopled by saints and
sinners—as we have all learned, there are many shades of

they were doing the right thing. Many of us have met a lot of people
involved on that day. I think, for example, of Norman Bettison, then
chief constable for Merseyside, with whom many of us are acquainted in
other contexts. Everyone needs a fair hearing, and there has to be a
huge moral gulf between someone putting a good gloss on their own
actions and those of their police force, and incriminating others,
particularly those who can no longer defend themselves. That has to be
reflected in any subsequent judgment.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) said,
that tells us something about this country. It tells us that there is a
huge inequality, not of wealth, but of power—power to get a fair

sheer breathtaking commitment of the families for what they have
achieved with the support of politicians of differing parties and, in
particular, my colleagues from Merseyside and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:52:45"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

reiterate what has been said about Ken Sutton and the secretariat, who

Friends the Members for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) and
for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), have been a lifelong supporter of
Sheffield Wednesday. As such, I want to say that the hearts of the
people of Sheffield are, as then, with the people of Merseyside and the
families. On that terrible afternoon, kindness shone through the
darkness: people took families and individuals into their homes around
the ground, used telephones in a day when mobile telephones were not
available, ran people back to Merseyside, where appropriate, and did
their best to indicate a humanity that I hope we will also
remember.</hs_Para>

debate has so far been of the highest order, and I want only to
say one or two things that might add to it. I commenced representing
Brightside in 1987. At the time, I did not hear from any thinking human
being who genuinely believed that the deceased had anything to do with
the events of that afternoon. How could they have anything to do with
it, given that they were in the ground well in advance of 3 pm and so
at the front of the dreadful pens that existed at the time? As I said
two months ago, the tales that were made up and the way the so-called
facts were reiterated demonstrated that we could only really rely on
truth and justice being revealed when we had absolute transparency.
Today, that is more possible, given mobile technology and the way
everything is recorded—we have seen that in recent
days—and that is a good thing, but it can only really work if
there is a change of heart from the top down.</hs_Para>

want to refer to the three elements of the case—the events of
the day, the cover-up and the inquest. I was not in the ground on the
day, but I visited Northern General hospital the following morning and
talked to those with minor injuries and to some of the parents. I was
impressed by what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:56:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for City of Chester (Stephen Mosley) said about Kevin’s mother,
Anne, whom I heard on the radio a week last Friday, showing the most
enormous dignity, having demonstrated the most enormous courage in
pursuing this matter and having coped with what she has had to
live with ever since. I do not know whether the inquest will bring any
kind of peace, but it will certainly bring greater truth.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="12102225000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102225000011">I<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:56:36"></hs_TimeCode>
understand that such an inquest has incredibly difficult barriers to
overcome. The bar was set extremely high by those who took the civil
case 12 years ago, and the Stuart-Smith inquiry set the bar at a height
that makes it difficult, 23 years on, to achieve the kind of justice
that those in the Gallery today rightly seek. What is absolutely sure,
however, is that the cover-up must be revealed if we are to prevent
such a thing from happening again. It is about culture and perception.
The fact that on the day 116 officers wrote down what they believed had
taken place but had their testimony altered is a testament to their
efforts to tell the truth. The scandal was that senior management in
South Yorkshire police and the West Midlands force—the latter
has also been tellingly referred to this afternoon—overrode
their decency and honesty.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:58:00"></hs_TimeCode> is the
lesson for us. The issue is about how senior management, not those at
the bottom, should be pursued. I believe that 100 members of the 1989
force are still in place. I hope that their experiences in respect of
senior management will be listened to and that they will not be made to
feel that they are being pursued. Otherwise, we will get the wrong
conclusion by pursuing the wrong people.</hs_Para>

with the organisation and supervision on that tragic afternoon and as
with the cover-up, the inquest, which, of course, turned out to be a
scandal, was based on presumption and a particular perception of the
fans. I say that regardless of what Bert McGee, with whom I am glad to
say my relations were nil, might have written in the programme that
afternoon. As the MP covering the stadium, I never repeated any of the
garbage told to the then MP for Sheffield, Hallam, Sir Irvine Patnick.
I believe that the perception had arisen out of the previous
years—out of what had happened at Ibrox, Heysel and Birmingham,
where two people were killed, and the hysteria around the situation
with fans. Action by the Taylor committee was taken on the back of
that. Here is a thought: the Taylor committee, which got to part of the
truth, came out with recommendations that were more about dealing with
fans than they were about the outcome or the truth and justice of what
happened at Hillsborough in April 1989. We have to ensure, in detection
and investigation in future, that that never happens again—that
we do not have a police force or inquiries that build on existing
perception, but that we genuinely try to get to what
happened.</hs_Para>

have a challenge before us, because the truth is virtually out. The
families are near to getting some sort of peace and settlement, if that
is possible. The Parliament that we stand in today is revealing and
opening up what has been covered up for 23 years, but to go forward we
need to be able to pick up some of the issues around future
transparency and strong outside investigation. My right hon. Friend the
shadow Home Secretary referred to this issue. I was the one who set up
the Independent Police Complaints Commission, because its predecessor,
the Police Complaints Authority, was totally and utterly inadequate. I
would like us to strengthen the IPCC immediately, because waiting to
legislate on something new would not be the answer. Therefore, we
should by all means provide greater powers, but this is also about
process, as well as culture and enforcement. The top-down examples that
I have referred to are about changing the way we operate our police
service. This is also about what happened with the other emergency
services—not least the ambulance service—which led to the
terrible tragedy of those who might have been saved being left on that
afternoon.</hs_Para>

a corporate affairs unit was established under Chief Superintendent

Leadership means setting the style and tone of an organisation, and it
means taking responsibility when things go wrong. Whether it was a
systematic attempt at rewriting events or the activity of individual
over-zealous officers, it is still not good enough for senior officers
at the time to say that they did not know what was happening. They
ought to have known. They are responsible, and we do not pay them
healthy salaries so that they can abdicate responsibility when things
go wrong. It now falls to the IPCC to identify where misconduct took
place and who was culpable, but it should not have taken this long, and
we should not have to rely on regulators and inquiries to get to the
truth. We need to instil in public servants an emphasis on doing the
right thing and on placing that ahead of protecting their reputations.
The truth will out in the end.</hs_Para>

learn that the source of that material was a former Member of this

officer, his statement as published also records that another officer
told him to take what he had heard with a pinch of salt. It is
extremely regrettable that that advice was not heeded. As a result, an
untrue account of events relating to the behaviour of fans was allowed
to be perpetuated. It is that account which has denied them justice for
so long. All of us in this House should never forget our role as
community leaders; nor should we forget the respect that our comments
command. We should never repeat anything unless we can be satisfied

for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price), who made an eloquent and balanced
speech drawing on 
<?notus-xml column=746?>her own experience and putting what we have heard
over the past few days and weeks into the context of overall policing.
I also want to pay tribute to the Home Secretary and the shadow Home
Secretary. They both made outstanding speeches today, and they showed
the House at its very best. The Government have reacted and, frankly,
they have not put a foot wrong following the publication of the
independent panel’s report. I am grateful to the Home Secretary
for the way in which she has given her personal attention to this
issue, knowing that, as Home Secretary, she has a lot of things to do.
It is one of the toughest jobs, if not the toughest job, in the

time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102225000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102225000026"><hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:10:27"></hs_TimeCode>The

I want to concentrate on the future, because there is a danger that,
despite all the good will and all the work being done by the various
agencies, we could lose track of precisely how we are going to arrive
at a conclusion on this subject. I want to refer to the evidence given
by David Compton, the South Yorkshire chief constable, when he appeared
before the Home Affairs Select Committee last Tuesday. We are not
holding another inquiry into Hillsborough. We have had the definitive
inquiry. All that the Committee wishes to do is monitor on a regular
basis what is happening, just as we have done with Operation Weeting,
which was set up following the phone hacking scandal. We will therefore
call back the chief constable and the families on a four-monthly basis
to ensure that things are going in the right direction. We are not
holding an
inquiry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102225000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102225000029"><hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>The
chief constable gave excellent evidence. He was forthright and
transparent, and he promised that he would write to the IPCC by last
Friday with the names of the officers who were involved in some way in
what happened at Hillsborough. As I said earlier, the names of 1,444
officers have now been sent to the IPCC, of whom 304 are still serving
in the South Yorkshire force. It immediately becomes clear, given the
number of names involved, that there will be a problem with resources.
I welcome what the Home Secretary has said about that today, but she
should not wait for the IPCC to come to see her. A meeting should be
convened pretty quickly to ask the IPCC what it needs, and to give it
those resources. I am watching the Home Secretary’s face as I
speak, and I am sure that she has already fixed such a meeting. We
often say in the House, “If they need the resources, they should
come and ask for them”, but we should go to the IPCC and offer
it what it needs.</hs_Para>

also received evidence last week from the families themselves. Many of
their names have already appeared in parliamentary reports, including
those of Trevor Hicks, Jenny Hicks, Margaret Aspinall and Sheila
Coleman. They all came and gave evidence to us, alongside Lord
Falconer, who is advising the Hillsborough families. They were
concerned about co-ordination and they suggested that the Director of
Public Prosecutions should have overall superintendence of the various
agencies. However, I am not absolutely convinced that it would be the
best course of action to place this matter into the hands of the DPP,
another very busy senior official.</hs_Para>

favour the idea of appointing a special prosecutor to look into all
these cases and to act as a co-ordination point, because it is really
important that we wrap this up in the personality of one person. I put
the idea to the Home Secretary right at the start that this could
perhaps be done by Tom Winsor, the new chief inspector of constabulary.
This is a role for the inspectorate. It should not be about police
officers investigating police officers; it should involve someone
completely new coming into the system to look into it. I do not know
whether he has the resources to do that.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:14:57"></hs_TimeCode> are a
number of other people who could take on the task. I would also like to
throw in the name of Denis O’Connor. He has just stood down from
the role of chief inspector of constabulary, and would therefore be
unburdened by day-to-day management duties. We need a figure with
experience who can command respect and who can bring all the various
agencies
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102225000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102225000032"><hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:15:08"></hs_TimeCode>I
am glad that the Home Secretary said that she would hold meetings this
week. It is really important that we take on board what the families
say, and that we try to cut through the bureaucracy that will
inevitably result from all the agencies trying to do their very best by
those families, and by the stated views of Members on both sides of the
House, as I am sure they will
do<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:15:33"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope that

am glad that the Home Secretary was able to see the Hillsborough
families. They had contacted her office before they came to appear
before the Committee, but they said that they had not received a
definitive reply. I was therefore pleased that she was able to meet
them at such short notice. It is they who have been driving this whole
issue over the past 23 years, and we should put them right at the
centre of what we are seeking to do. We all have our views and opinions
but, at the end of the day, it is the families who should turn to
Parliament and say, “We need closure, and this is how we are

hon. Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) mentioned Norman
Bettison earlier. I was surprised recently to be rung up by <I>The
Times</I> newspaper and to be told that, 23 years ago, I had been to a
briefing meeting held by the police officers who had policed
Hillsborough, and that I had left the meeting before the end. The press
asked me why I had done that, and I had to tell them that I cannot
remember what I did last week, and that I certainly cannot remember
what I did 23 years ago. I can only imagine the detail of the reports
of such meetings, if Norman Bettison was able to write in his report
that Keith Vaz had left a meeting early, as though that suggested
something pejorative about the way in which the meeting had been
conducted. Officers in the South Yorkshire police force were clearly
keeping detailed notes on what Members of Parliament were doing in the
meetings that they had organised in 
<?notus-xml column=748?>order to discuss these issues.
<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:17:20"></hs_TimeCode>We should give

the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) has raised some questions in the
press today, and I know that he will raise them in Parliament when he
speaks. The<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:17:56"></hs_TimeCode> fact
is that we need to look at the new policing landscape. The Government
are right to try to change it with the creation of the National Crime
Agency and the new college. All these issues need to be addressed. I am
not convinced that we should reform the IPCC in the middle of these
negotiations, but we can clearly take on board what the shadow Home
Secretary has said about giving it additional powers so that it can
complete these investigations properly.</hs_Para>

felt that his case was not properly dealt with by the IPCC, so the
Hillsborough families are not alone in criticising the organisation. We
want to hold a proper inquiry and give proper recommendations to the
Home Office, taking on board what the shadow Home Secretary and others
have said. At the end of the day, according to the families, the only
way to get closure will be for people to be prosecuted for what
happened. Who those people are, Parliament does not know at this
moment. All that we can do is ensure that we have a good, robust
process so that justice can finally be done.</hs_Para>

Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram). That relationship comes
down to the bond that people gather from being football fans. Although
we sit on totally opposite sides of the political divide, we get on
exceptionally well through our love of football. Football binds many
people together. My sister is an Arsenal fan whereas my brother-in-law
is a Liverpool fan, and they live in Sheffield. Quite where on the
football spectrum my niece and nephew will end up remains to be seen,
but what about the prospect of their going to a football
match—something that binds together people who love the

children—lost their life going to one of the events that so many
people in this country go to, watch, enjoy and love, and were then

came about because people had made a mistake. The police made mistakes,
but instead of standing up and admitting the terrible mistakes that
they made that day, they tried to push the blame on to those who had no
reason whatever to have that blame put upon them. I think that every
single person in this country needs to think about that and about the
events they go to enjoy together as a family. They should think about

general sense of shock—about what had happened. I remember
reading the Sunday newspapers along with my parents the next day, and I
clearly recall seeing a picture of somebody being crushed up against
the fence. It had a deep impact on me. The following day a newspaper
came out with “The Truth” plastered across it, and some
accusations were made. Let us remember what they were. It was claimed
that people, including children, were drunk. It was said that people
were pickpocketing the dead, urinating on dead bodies and attacking
police officers. If that was true, why was nobody arrested, as there
were plenty of police there? There were plenty of television cameras

that they have suffered for far too long, and is a major step forward
in their search for truth and justice. However, as all of us who are
taking part in the debate well know, the report represents not the end
of that struggle, but merely the beginning of a new
chapter. For 23 years the families and survivors have

welcome the Home Secretary’s announcement that, if the

extent of the cover-up, the pain that too many have suffered over two

make an application to the High Court for new inquests to take place,
and join other Members in asking him to ensure that the process is
completed as quickly as possible. New inquests are vital if the wrongs
of the past are to be righted. Although the original coroner’s
report returned a verdict of accidental death, the independent
panel’s report clearly shows that the deaths of 96 innocent
people that day were anything but accidental. That verdict must be
overturned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102226000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102226000006">The
deaths and suffering of the survivors were a result of systematic
failures by football authorities, the police and the emergency services
before, during and after what happened on that tragic day, 15 April
1989. It was clear before the game that the stadium was not a safe
venue. The independent panel’s report shows that the risks were
already known before 1989, and that the crush was therefore avoidable.
The ground did not have an up-to-date safety certificate, and problems
with congestion at the Leppings Lane end had already occurred during
the 1981 and 1987 FA cup semi-finals. There had been actual crushing
during the 1988 semi-final the year before, but little action had been
taken as a result. Although some work had been done between 1981 and
1987, it was not sufficient to ensure that the ground met minimum
safety standards. The fact that the ground was used for such a
high-profile match, without an up-to-date safety certificate, shows a
complete lack of concern for fan
safety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102226000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102226000007">On
the match day itself, key safety procedures were not followed. There
was a failure to recognise that the turnstiles were inadequate, or to
foresee the problems that would be caused by not sealing off the tunnel

<?notus-xml column=753?>leading to the central pens. The response in the
immediate aftermath of the crush was appalling. A general failure on
the part of the emergency services to recognise what was happening was
compounded by the failure to execute major incident plans correctly.
Those mistakes cost lives.</hs_Para>

concerted and shameful cover-up of those mistakes began with the
blaming of innocent victims. Hundreds of police statements were
doctored and amended. The original coroner’s report set an
arbitrary 3.15 pm cut-off time; the only reason for that seems to have
been a desire to excuse the failings of the emergency services. The
blood alcohol levels of those who had been killed—even
children—were checked without consent. There was collusion
between senior figures in the police force, the political sphere and
the media to perpetrate a campaign to smear the fans and innocent
victims. Despite the finding of the Taylor inquiry that the police were
at fault, not a single officer responsible for the conduct of the
police that day has been disciplined or prosecuted.</hs_Para>

failings, and what in some cases appear to be specific acts of
criminality, need to be investigated and exposed in more detail than is
allowed by the time afforded to me, or even to today’s debate.
That leaves the question of who is best placed to conduct such
investigations. As my hon. Friend the Member for Garston and Halewood
said in the House on the day the report was published, this cover-up,
the lies, and the failure to bring prosecutions show a complete failing
on the part of our legal system. Securing justice for the families of
the victims must of course be our immediate priority, but once that
process is complete, we must also consider the wider failings of our
legal system. The fact that a public inquiry, a judicial inquiry, and
the coroner’s inquest in the 1980s and 1990s failed to establish
the truth of what happened at Hillsborough is deeply disturbing, and
such a situation must never be
repeated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102226000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102226000010">I
think that it is clear from the report, and from today’s debate,
that a number of things need to happen. First, the Attorney-General
should submit his promised application for new inquests as soon as
possible. Secondly, if that application is successful, it is crucial
for the inquests to be held in Liverpool, for the costs to be borne by
central Government rather than by any local authority, and—most
important—for no legal costs to be borne by the families. The
Home Secretary said this afternoon that her Department was looking into
that, and I hope that its response will be favourable. Thirdly, a
special prosecutor needs to be appointed and given the powers to
conduct a full inquiry—including powers to question the
police—in order to determine what criminal charges can and
should be
brought.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102226000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0002.htm#12102226000011">What<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T16:59:30"></hs_TimeCode>

protect us. Now that we have the truth, we all have a duty to the 96
victims, their families and the survivors to secure justice and ensure

own view is that we need to be willing to look at cover-up allegations
by establishing committees of inquiry in Parliament. However, there are
other things that could be done to improve the accountability of public
officials. Judicial review proceedings are used to deal with the
accountability of public officials, and they were used in dealing with
Hillsborough. The General Medical Council is also subject to judicial
review. However, public bodies have very deep pockets, and there
are cost risks for ordinary individuals if the costs of
such a process are not covered by public funding. If cost
limitations on judicial review are not set at an early stage, ordinary
people cannot take on the system—the GMC, perhaps, or a local
council planning decision, or a coroner as in the Hillsborough
case.</hs_Para>

the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg) listed a number of authorities,
from the football club that is based at Hillsborough through to the
media, that, to say the least, made mistakes, crass errors or whatever
one wants to call them. When dealing with the issues the report
highlights, the one point it is impossible to get one’s head
around is the motives of those people who were involved in this complex
series of mistakes. We can, perhaps, understand that the club was
desirous of the revenue coming in from hosting such a prestigious game,
but the subsequent actions of a number of senior people in the police,
the emergency services and the media lead us to the conclusion that
their motives were completely scurrilous.</hs_Para>

report’s findings have confirmed what witnesses and the families
of the victims have always maintained: the allegations of drunkenness,
ticketlessness and violence were deliberately and maliciously spread by
the police, the authorities and elements of the media. It is difficult,
looking back now, to understand the culture and attitudes towards
football fans in the 1970s and 1980s. As a Manchester United fan who
attended matches during this period, I know that a small minority of
people gave the beautiful game a bad reputation. The distrust with
which football fans were viewed gave some individual members of the
authorities a smokescreen behind which they could hide. The fans who

people I used to go there with and the positions they now occupy in
modern society—perhaps we wish we had known then what we know
now, as we might not have been so compliant. I also remember BBC Radio
5’s Alan Green mentioning that he went to a Sheffield United
game a few days after the Hillsborough disaster and saw members of the
South Yorkshire police laughing 
<?notus-xml column=758?>and joking while they were looking after the crowd. He shared with his

am thankful that many of the contributing factors that led to the
events on 15 April 1989 have led to reform. Notably, standing has been
removed at matches, and more rigorous health and safety policies at
football grounds and comprehensive crowd management policies have been
implemented. What we used to go through in the 1970s bears no
resemblance to what we find at the modern game. However, we now know
that many of these issues had been highlighted in the lead-up to the
disaster, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:57:15"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Halton highlighted in his excellent speech. The
revelation that at the same match a year previously there had also been

lessons were not learned. Crowds of men, women and children went into

failures of the police, the stadium management and the other emergency
services are clear. There is responsibility, and it was avoided through
a systematic abuse of power. The report found that 164 statements were
significantly amended and criticism of police actions was removed in
116 of them. Blame was deliberately placed on the victims. Vicious and
wholly untrue allegations were passed to and published by the media.
Those allegations, it has finally been revealed, were the reported
conversation between South Yorkshire police and the then Member for
Sheffield, Hallam.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:58:05"></hs_TimeCode> public,
sections of the media and Parliament were deliberately misled. We have
to ask why West Midlands police were used as an independent police

Midlands police and was visited twice by officers and shown videos of
Hillsborough, but his statement does not appear in the documents
provided to the independent panel. That situation is very strange,
given that he obtained a copy of his statement in 2004. He tells me
that other people are in the same position. It appears that not all the
statements have been provided to the panel and I would be grateful if
the Home Secretary could look into that matter, find out what has

the coverage of the Hillsborough tragedy, the focus on South Yorkshire
police, the Government’s actions and the complicity of sections
of the national media and those who perpetuated the lies that

Association appears largely to have disappeared below the radar, but it
chose the venue that led to the events unfolding that day and allowed
the game to take place in a venue without the appropriate safety
certificates. There is no question about the culpability of
the Football Association in the entire fiasco, but it has been
distinctly quiet in recent months apart from its attempt to apologise

have also been asked whether the coroner and his collusion with South
Yorkshire police will be included in the criminal investigation. Given
the historical problems of crowd safety at Hillsborough, why were 100
fewer police officers on duty in 1989 than at the 1988 FA cup
semi-final at the same ground? There were actually fewer officers there
than in 1987<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T19:06:26"></hs_TimeCode>.

that that did not happen just in the immediate aftermath of the
Hillsborough disaster. The Taylor report exonerated Liverpool fans from

will not relay again all the different issues, but I have been trying
to put myself in the mind of the former Member of the House, to whom my
hon. Friends the Members for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price) and for
Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) have already referred. No
Liverpool fan will ever forget the tragic events that happened in
another country, in Heysel, just a few years earlier, when other
football fans were resentful at what had happened because all teams
were banned from European football as a consequence of what happened
that night. I do not want to read out again the statement to which my
hon. Friends referred, but I will always struggle to understand how
someone could repeat a few days later the smear of somebody who implied
that Liverpool fans were sexually abusing a dead person, and indeed
were going to go further than that. I realise that that person cannot
be in the House to defend himself today and I know that he has
expressed his regret.</hs_Para>

clear today that two forms of investigation are needed—one into
what actually happened on the day, and one into the potential cover-up.
Of course it will be for a court of law to make that decision. Since
the last time we discussed the matter, a school friend has contacted me
by e-mail to say that he did not go into the stadium that day because
he saw the police officers opening the gate, he saw what was going on
and he walked away—and thank God he did. I hope that such
evidence will be put to people, even though they may now be quite
elderly. As we heard earlier, when one of 
<?notus-xml column=762?>those officers retired on medical grounds, it was decided not to pursue
justice. I know that there was a private prosecution, which did not end
as we may all have wanted, but I still hope that such people will be
brought to

of the things I would like to say to the people who have kept the fight
going is “Please, have a little more patience.” That may
seem a terrible thing to say after 23 years, but people were patient
for the unveiling of all the terrible things that came out in the
Hillsborough independent panel report. Although we can say freely in
the House what we believe, it is important that we allow justice to
come to its full term and that the IPCC or the special prosecutor, if
that is deemed appropriate later, is brought into play. One of the
things that I hope those outside the Chamber will recognise is that we
know that Parliament has let people down in the past, but there is
unanimity here today that Parliament is definitely on their side and we
will not let people get away with
it.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="12102226000161" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102226000161">7.14

establishment and to not worry too much about the 96 who found
themselves in that position. It is clear to me that the London-based
media and establishment believed that all football fans were potential
hooligans, who deserved what they got. They believed the police, the
emergency services, the establishment and the football authorities
without question. They took the view that they were right and that
football fans were wrong. I believe that all Liverpool people and fans

“Stick It Up Your Punter: The Rise and Fall of the Sun”,
which goes through the conversations that went on in the media and
parts of the establishment in some detail. After the tragedy, the
London-based media and establishment were ready to pounce, led by
<I>The Sun</I> and its editor, Kelvin MacKenzie. Once <I>The Sun</I>
had ignored the facts, its editor could do what he wanted. He could not
wait to put the knife in. Apparently, the first headline that MacKenzie
came up with was, “You Scum”. That was later replaced
with, “The Truth”. What does that tell us about editors

MacKenzie now claims that he was misled. However, he said before the
National Heritage Committee that he did not stand by the claims that he

from the Select Committee saying, until a couple of weeks ago, that the
false allegations were absolutely true and repeated them on a regular
basis. He and <I>The Sun</I> obviously will not support my view of how
the media dealt with this matter. They will point out that some
northern journalists work for their newspapers. I am sure that that is
true, but most of them have been away from their northern roots for too

been hidden from public view and would not normally have been available

Merseyside police force, and he spoke passionately as a Liverpudlian
about what had happened in 1989, but he also spoke passionately, as a
committed police officer, about how different the police of 2012 are
from the police of 1989. He expressed a concern that I have heard

undermined by what has been revealed. Nobody in the House wants

over a year ago, here in this House, the Hillsborough families and the
campaign for justice made history. Having fought a 23-year campaign to

and thousands of voices, they told us that this was the issue that must

emotion. As I know, if someone already feels like an outsider,
this House can be a difficult place to come to. But when the
Hillsborough families needed Parliament’s help to get full
disclosure, they broke down barriers that had been in place for
centuries which said that only the Government or Her Majesty’s
Opposition could call a debate here. Theirs was the first public
campaign with enough signatures to reach the threshold needed
for a Backbench Business debate. Tens of thousands of people signed the
e-petition, and just one year later we have the truly open and frank

and who listened to those who were in Sheffield on that day and never
got over it, I say this, “Your words helped to tell that story.

disaster were a couple of horrendous decisions taken by police officers
in charge on the day. Against a background of disrespect for
fans, and a cavalier attitude to safety, they made the wrong choices
with horrific consequences. Despite the magnitude of the disaster, the
response could have been very different. The agents of the state could
have looked after the families and treated them with
kindness—not blood alcohol tests and allegations, but proper
respect for the deceased; not the so-termed “black propaganda
unit”, but honesty and frankness; not the hesitation

are two good reasons why the families pursued their cause—there
are many more, but I shall isolate two. First, they did so because had
those in positions of responsibility on that day—not only the
police—carried out their duties properly, they could have helped
to avoid the disaster; and, secondly, because of the cruel and baseless
allegation that the fans themselves were responsible for what happened.
Often, because it was not always easy to articulate what justice would
amount to, too many were either unable, or in some cases unwilling, to
comprehend the voice of the
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000023">Before
the independent panel got to work, there were a lot of strands to the
story of what happened. Among other things, we knew—because of
the Taylor report—that the principal reason for what happened
was the failure of South Yorkshire police to manage the event properly.
We also knew—I saw this first hand—that the so-called
mini-inquests were a cruel travesty that seemed interested only in
undermining the characters of the 96 people who died.
Moreover, that was compounded by the 3.15 pm 
<?notus-xml column=777?>cut-off point decision, which effectively served to insulate the
authorities from any responsibility for anything that happened after
that time. We also knew that parts of the media, and most shamefully
<I>The Sun</I> newspaper, had grotesquely misrepresented and twisted
events in such a way as to paint those who lost their lives and the
survivors as partly the architects of their own misfortune. The
survivors were also painted as bearing the responsibility for those who
so tragically lost their lives. I recently watched the Jimmy McGovern
drama to which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T20:12:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern) referred in her emotional
speech. It powerfully illustrated how, on top of the trauma of being
present and surviving, some felt that the finger of suspicion, despite
everything, including the Taylor inquiry, was still being pointed in
their direction. That ghost had not been firmly been
exorcised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000024">What
the independent panel managed to achieve—by so doing, it did a
great service to truth—was to weave all those strands together
into a coherent and damning narrative. In my view, the report shows
convincingly how the strands combine to form a distinct and discernible
pattern. Two unambiguous conclusions among others can now be accepted
with absolute confidence by all fair-minded people. First, there is no
foundation whatever to the victims-as-cause theory that, we now know,
was scandalously orchestrated by South Yorkshire police to such
grotesque effect. I am not normally a conspiracy theorist, but in this
case there clearly was a conspiracy. I know from comments that
constituents and others have made to me that the conspiracy shakes the
very foundations of their belief in institutions that they have always
respected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000025">As
somebody recently pointed out to me, had there been a fire at a theatre
or classical music concert, nobody would ever have tried to blame those
attending for having had a gin and tonic or glass of wine during the
interval. The fact that so many people were at least tacitly prepared
to accept or even half accept that version of events speaks to a more
general and regrettable aspect of our society: the implicit prejudice
many have towards football fans and working-class
culture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000026">Secondly,
the report’s conclusions call into question the means available
to investigate major disasters. As we have heard, the Taylor inquiry
got it right, but provided no real pointer as to how those responsible
could be held to account. Because of the prejudiced assumption on which
the inquest was based, the inquest system was deeply flawed to the
extent that it was both grossly offensive and cruelly ineffective. As
the Prime Minister has said, the approach taken by the independent
panel—I join others in praising the work of the Bishop of
Liverpool and the panel—might serve as a model for the future,
should that ever sadly prove to be
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000027">Finally,
the question of what happens next must be addressed. As many have said,
we know the truth, but what about securing justice and accountability?
As I have said previously, the key action will be to hold fresh
inquests. I have described on previous occasions what was wrong with
the so-called mini-inquests, and I will not repeat what has already
been said, but I welcome the Attorney-General’s statement of
last week. I hope the courts take note of the strength of feeling and
of the strength of evidence in favour of holding fresh
inquests.</hs_Para>

different outcome could unlock the door for other action against bodies
and individuals who either failed to carry out their responsibilities
or tried to cover up what happened before, during and following that
fatal football fixture. The recent Independent Police Complaints
Commission statement is, in addition, a welcome step in that direction,
as is what the Home Secretary has said today. I know she will listen
and I hope she takes note of the many points that have been made on
resources, keeping the House informed and, most importantly of all,
keeping the families abreast of what is
happening.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000029">One
small point that has not so far been raised with the Home Secretary is
this: I hope that anybody who claims they are too ill to give evidence
will be rigorously tested—some will make such a claim, and some
serving police officers of the time are getting on. I hope it will not
be taken as read if they get a doctor’s note saying they are too
ill to give evidence. That needs to be independently tested, because it
is all too easy in such cases—it is a cop out. I hope she takes
that point on

Smith</B> (Penistone and Stocksbridge) (Lab):</Member> I begin
my short contribution by acknowledging the work of the panel, and in
particularly the Bishop of Liverpool, as all hon. Members have done,
and I pay tribute to the families. On Friday, I spoke to the BBC about
a constituent who lost her boy on the island of Kos 21 years ago. I
said that it is impossible to understand what it is like to lose a
child. All hon. Members must acknowledge that if they have not lost a
loved one or a child in tragic circumstances, it is impossible to
understand it, but we can understand and be amazed by the strength and
courage of the families over the past 23 years, and acknowledge that,
without their campaign, we would not be where we are today. The House
has acknowledged that
fully.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000032">I
should refer first to the culture that informed the management of
football in 1989. It was, of course, a culture that encouraged the
characterisation of football fans as heavy-drinking hooligans. My right
hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley (Mr Howarth) pointed out, rightly,
that having a drink before or at a football match does not make someone
a hooligan or mean that they have done anything wrong. The stereotype
was far from being true. The vast majority of fans, even if they do
have a drink, are genuine fans and law-abiding citizens. Even then,
many fans going to football matches were part of families—dads
taking sons, dads taking daughters, mums and dads taking their
children. That is something that we should always
remember.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000033">Nevertheless,
the stereotype of the hooligan was very powerful, and it underpinned an
approach by the authorities that led to fans being treated as something
less than human. It had three tragic consequences at Hillsborough. One
was the erection of the barriers, way before 1989, to prevent fans from
going on to the pitch. The second was the crush itself, which was
thought at first by the police to be the result of hooliganism. When
the crush occurred, the police thought that it was hooligans kicking
off. The final consequence was the vilification of fans 
<?notus-xml column=779?>by South Yorkshire police, the direct consequence of an all too easy
assumption that any trouble at a football match is down to the
behaviour of the
fans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000034">Justice
has to be delivered, and I welcome the referrals to the IPCC and the
involvement of Keir Starmer in the ongoing investigations. As
my right hon. Friend the shadow Home Secretary said earlier, the
investigation is in two parts. We have the events leading up to the
disaster and the cover-up in what happened afterwards. We have to have
a thorough investigation and, if there is clear evidence of criminal
wrongdoing, charges have to be laid and those accused should answer
those charges in court.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="12102230000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000035">The cover-up
was especially shocking because it was so deliberate and led to the
vilification of the fans for all these years. The investigation of
South Yorkshire police and the cover-up has to take place in the
context—there is no point in avoiding it—of the screening
tonight of a programme about a cover-up and the changing of statements
about an earlier event in south Yorkshire. It is clear that there was a
culture, and we need to ensure that there is a thorough and rigorous
investigation of that culture in relation to both Hillsborough and any
other aspect of policing in the 1980s, so that we can defend the
integrity and standards of British policing in the long term. If we are
to continue to have policing by consent, we have to get to the bottom
of what was happening to policing in the 1980s. I suspect that it was
not just a problem in the South Yorkshire police and that the problem
went beyond that force—we already know that Hillsborough also
involved the West Midlands
force.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000036">I
have been clear about the need for rigorous criminal inquiries with no
holds barred in getting to the bottom of what went wrong, but it is
also important to recognise that the South Yorkshire force is very
different now. It has moved forward. It is not perfect by any
means—far from it, as recent events have shown—but it is
important to remember that it has made progress under two former chief
constables, Richard Wells and Med Hughes, and we now have David
Crompton. It was Med Hughes who, readily and without question, agreed
to release the South Yorkshire police archives for the purposes of the
panel’s work. We need to acknowledge that, and we also need to
remember that football policing in Sheffield has improved radically in
recent years. Police officers in charge of policing at Hillsborough and
at Bramall Lane have to be accredited and trained, and anyone taking
command at Hillsborough has to have significant experience, especially
when taking charge of a big match such as a local derby. I need to say
that for the sake not just of South Yorkshire police, but for police
morale across the country, as my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool,
West Derby (Stephen Twigg) said earlier. If the public are to continue
to have confidence in the ability of the South Yorkshire police force
to protect our streets, we have to say now, publicly, that it is
different from the force that was functioning in
1989.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000037">Equally,
Sheffield Wednesday football club is a different club. Bert McGee went
a long time ago. It has a different structure now. In fact, the
previous club was dissolved and we have a new club with new personnel
and new people in charge. The chairman and those new people did not
hesitate to release their documentation to the panel so that it could
be as thorough as possible in reaching its conclusions. Sheffield
Wednesday is not 
<?notus-xml column=780?>perfect in how it functions—no club
is—but progress has been made, and that should be put on the
record in the context of this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000038">We
have to address the injustices of the past, but we must also recognise
progress. More than anything else, we need lessons relating to
accountability and transparency arising from Hillsborough to be learnt
and applied. I therefore welcome the commitment from the Home Secretary
to bring forward proposals in the new year, and I look forward to being
able to examine them. I welcome the consensus that appears to be
growing on this issue across the House. My right hon. Friend the shadow
Home Secretary made it clear that the House will work collaboratively
to ensure that we learn the lessons and move forward on the key
fundamental issue of police accountability and transparency. There is
no other guarantee for public confidence in policing other than the
ability to see what is going on within the police, and the knowledge
that they are doing their job properly and with integrity. Transparency
is the only means by which we can properly guarantee that that is the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000039">More

although two thirds of the families affected are in Merseyside, there
are many in Scotland and the south, and, in an extraordinary act of
generosity, they have asked me to say that Liverpool might not be the
most ideal place to hold the inquest, because a minority of other
families will wish to come from other parts of the country. They ask
that their needs are also borne in

given the tale of horrors we have heard from the independent inquiry
and in our debates, the families want to know who will run the inquest.
A large number of people set in authority over us have not done
terribly well, so why should the families trust the next person? The
Home Secretary partly answered my third question when she said that she
would give us some idea of the scope of the next stage of the inquiry.
As their Member of Parliament, I have listened to this debate and have
the advantage of representing what I guess is their opinion so far. We
have heard many phrases. As one family member said, truth has at last
come home, but, as the Home Secretary said, that must be followed by
justice and accountability. To be honest, though, I do not know what
the next steps will be. We know that there has been an application to
set the inquests apart, but I do not know how we will ensure that truth
is followed by justice, and I am not sure what steps will be taken to
ensure that those people who should be held accountable are held
accountable.</hs_Para>

make this plea: it is a question of urgency. People have waited 23
years. People have died waiting for this report and debate, and time is
of the essence for many family members still alive. Although they are
still alive, part of them died with those events 23 years ago, and they
wish to see truth followed by justice, not in any vengeful sense but
because they believe it is important. They believe that those who were
in authority should stand
accountable<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T20:33:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102230000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102230000048">If
I may say so, however, the issue for Parliament extends even beyond
Hillsborough. The latter has thrown up a terrible divide in this
country between those who are done to and those who do the doing. There
is a huge crisis of confidence in the people set in authority over us.
Hillsborough could go some way to healing a divide that, if I may say
so, is far bigger even than that faced by those who suffered the
terrible horrors and blight of Hillsborough. Let us think of
Hillsborough as an X-ray, as the barium meal going through the system.
It shows up some terrible weakness in our country, where many people
feel that they are done to, where it is terribly difficult for them to
be heard, where it is nigh on impossible for justice to follow through
when truth is established and where those who have taken money to be
accountable do not accept that accountability.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State for Health sums up he will give my constituents who
will be following this debate some clarity on those two key issues. Now

<?notus-xml column=782?>that we have truth, what is the road map to justice
and how do we get accountability? The plea I make, through him to the
Home Secretary, is this. Tomorrow she will have another crisis, and the
day after she will have another. It is crucial that there should be
somebody who is now accountable for ensuring that the truth that has
been established in the independent inquiry is followed by justice and
accountability. I do not doubt for a moment the Home Secretary’s
good will or her wish to see that through herself; I think it will be
very difficult for her to do so. That task has to be delegated. That
person needs to be named and we need to support them in taking truth,
which has at last come home, to the stage of justice and, even more
importantly,
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T20:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2012-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2012_10_22_PT_1/6320F864D762DC1AD9122799C7655BE4952571EA" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2012">Monday

Mann</B> (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</Member> In paying tribute to the families
for their campaign, I want to thank them for something additional:
empowering people across the country. One of the things we will find in
future months and years is that a lot of people now feel empowered to
take on the establishment, be it the state or whoever else. That is a
change. <hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T20:36:22"></hs_TimeCode>I
certainly do not intend to use my time to go through all the major
issues that people have been bringing to me, but Hillsborough and the
campaign of the families has been cited as the reason for doing
so—to quote one person: “I wish I’d had the
courage to speak out
before<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T20:36:43"></hs_TimeCode>.”
We are going to see more people speaking out about more things. That is

will list one of those issues, however, because the revelations
today—about an hour ago on the BBC—of what happened at
Orgreave would without question not have come out without the
Hillsborough campaign in the last year. The two are directly linked,
because what happened at Orgreave was a comparable cover-up of
statements made by the police. One of the police constables—now
retired—has been prepared to speak out, spelling out exactly
what happened and who did what. I salute his courage in doing so, but
the culture that came out of what happened in the aftermath of
Orgreave—done by the same police force and the same chief
constable, albeit in co-operation with other police forces as
well—was a prelude to what happened in the cover-up over
Hillsborough just five years later. We need to learn the lessons from
that.</hs_Para>

of those lessons is about the need for people to feel confident in
speaking out from the inside about what is going on. I hope that
everyone has read or will read the police statements, which are easily
accessible and now in the public domain. I think I am the only MP in
this debate speaking from Nottinghamshire. I have a lot of Nottingham
Forest supporters in my constituency, and as I said in the last debate,
it could quite easily, by fluke or coincidence, have been Nottingham
Forest supporters at the other end.</hs_Para>

statements that I would like to pick out—I will quote from
them—because they are quite extraordinary. It is not just the
Liverpool fans who were reviled, but the Nottingham Forest fans. The
lie and the myth in the police statement about Liverpool fans urinating
was in fact a lie about Nottingham Forest fans urinating down from the
stands on to other Nottingham Forest fans. Strangely, it was never
reported anywhere in Nottinghamshire and there were no complaints about
it. It is a lie—not a statement altered, but a lie.</hs_Para>

read another statement by an officer, who was promoted immediately
afterwards, as many were, who claimed—the timing
would have been approximately around 3.40 pm—that he saw 100

then saw fights in all the stands. That is besmirching not only the

contained some language that was not quite parliamentary, so I will cut
to the chase. She told me to say thank you to the Notts Forest fans,
because they were coming on to the pitch and trying to save the lives
of the dying. That is what was going on, yet that police constable
stated that he saw something else happening at the time. This is part

one that has not yet been named: Hammond Suddards solicitors. Oh, of
course, apparently we cannot attack solicitors, as they are
representing their clients, but looking at the report, it is clear that
they were instigators in changing the statements and are probably the
people who rewrote the statements. Hammond Suddards, the great big firm

be fully investigated, and held to account for what it did in
perpetrating these lies.</hs_Para>

do not have time to go into the current state of disaster planning, but
the Government need to ask whether such an occurrence could happen

disasters, and at whether the Government are making the right

comment related to the fact that ambulance capacity in the county is
currently running at 98% to 99%. That means that, in the event of
another Hillsborough, ambulances would have to be taken off emergency
calls to go to it. They cannot rely on the north midlands for help,
because the reconfiguration of services last week cut the number of
ambulances available there. This is a fundamental issue.
Disaster planning is not being incorporated into changes in the
ambulance services. Indeed, from what I can see, the services have not
even been consulted.</hs_Para>

Hillsborough. The personal experience at Hillsborough I want to mention
arose when Sheffield Wednesday played Newcastle United in a league
game. We turned up as normal, but we could not get into the ground. And
what happened? The gates were opened, we were hurled into Hillsborough

Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) mentioned the battle of
Orgreave. On that occasion, the BBC reversed what had actually happened
in the attack involving the miners and the South Yorkshire police. In
1985, 93 miners went to Sheffield crown court, but the trial
collapsed 16 weeks later because it had become clear that
the police evidence was unreliable. Since then, as with Hillsborough,
hundreds of statements have been examined, and there have been dozens
of examples of the use of exactly the same phrases. As with
Hillsborough, police officers were instructed to describe scenes that
they had not seen or even experienced, and as with Hillsborough
officers readily admitted that statements had been narrated to
them.</hs_Para>

denominator is South Yorkshire police and cover-ups. It appears that
the policing of the 1980s needs close scrutiny, although in many senses
it is too late for the 96. Every person involved in the cover-up
deserves the full wrath of the law. I cannot even imagine the pain,
suffering and despair experienced by the families. We expect our police
to be honest, regardless of rank, and we expect them to be people on
whom we can rely. The families want a cohesive, co-ordinated
investigation. There cannot continue to be one lengthy investigation

agree with much of what was said by my hon. Friends the Members for
Bassetlaw (John Mann) and for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) about the role of
the police, and that of the South Yorkshire police in particular. I was
at Orgreave in June 1984, and I was one of those who believed that on
that day the police had decided to get their retaliation in first. I
was not surprised by that, and I was also not surprised to observe,
when I went to matches in the 1970s and 1980s, that the police adopted
the same attitude in the football stadium. The truth was that the
police decided that because some people, either on a picket line or at
a football game, might decide to behave like animals, the best thing to
do was to treat everybody as if they were animals. We need to see what
happened at that time through that
prism<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T20:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
not a surprise that Hillsborough happened, because we expected to be
treated in the way that I have described and, even more worryingly, we
accepted that we would be treated in that way. We cannot lay the blame
entirely on the police, however. We need to clarify the role of
Sheffield city council, too. I take on board what Sheffield Members
have said about the council having done the right things, but the
report says the safety advisory committee carried out inadequate and
poorly recorded inspections. I cannot think of another scenario in
which an organisation that is refused a safety certificate just goes
ahead with business as normal; that is unheard of.</hs_Para>

overall capacity for a ground, there was no mandatory requirement for
individual parts of the ground to have a special capacity
limit—that simply was not a requirement. Furthermore, even if
there was a capacity for individual parts of the ground, there was no
requirement—this was a crucial problem at
Hillsborough—to have mechanisms, electronic or otherwise, to
count people into each individual pen. I went to football grounds all
around the country and I found that, generally speaking, people went

on the occasion of the Hillsborough disaster the police did not see the
pens overfilling and opened the gates, which led to more people going

overcrowding. That was what Lord Justice Taylor found and I do not

for those failings, why was there an attempt at a cover-up afterwards
and how will we deal with the issues to ensure justice for the
families? They are the key points and if we focus on them and on the
responsibilities and actions, we will, I hope, get to the

families and their supporters deserve huge credit for how they have
stuck to their guns and for the dignity, restraint and perseverance
with which they have continued their fight in the face of a catalogue
of smears from the press and cover-ups by the establishment. Ninety-six
people went to watch a football match and died, but their families have
been treated as if their loved ones were criminals. That has now

Kevin Williams, 17-year-old Steven Robinson, 18-year-old Gary Jones and
18-year-old Christopher Devonside were among the 18 victims from the
borough of Sefton. Their families have told me that they want new
inquests and that they want those responsible to be prosecuted.
Christopher’s father, Barry, was at the match and saw what
happened to the victims as he sat in the stand while his son was in the
Leppings Lane end with a friend. Barry was given the run-around on the
day by the police. We now have confirmation that this was while the
cover-up was starting and senior police officers were desperately
trying to agree a story blaming the victims for their own deaths. Barry
also attended the inquests. He told me what happened when the results
were announced. In front of Barry and other family members, the police
celebrated the accidental death verdict. In his words, “Crates
of wine and beer were brought into an adjacent room where about 20
senior police officers toasted their success with the coroner.”
As he said to me, “How’s that for
impartiality?”</hs_Para>

the inquests were carried out, the way that the evidence was ignored,

carried out, part of a massive miscarriage of justice, alongside an
arbitrary decision by the coroner that all must have been dead or
beyond saving by 3.15 pm. No wonder, then, that Barry Devonside and the
other families have always maintained that the inquests did not tell
them how or why their loved ones died, and that it protected those
responsible for their
deaths.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102232000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102232000038">Other
Members of the House have addressed the key issues which come from the
independent panel’s report. I add my congratulations to the
panel on the work that it has done, and to colleagues in the House who
have worked to help the families reach the position that they are in
today. The Prime Minister gave a full apology in his statement last
month, and the Home Secretary and Attorney-General have done everything
that has been asked of them. For that this Government deserve praise.
Previous Governments have failed the families and we need to ensure
that no more time is lost. It is not possible to make up for lost time,
but it is possible to minimise future
delay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102232000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102232000039">The
report of the independent panel highlights what went wrong before the
event, on the day and in the immediate aftermath, and in the days,
months and years after. Much of the evidence in the report is not new,
of course, but the report has set it out in a way which allows calls
for new inquests to be addressed and for prosecutions to be considered.
The report makes the simple point that the policing of football matches
was regarded as a matter of control. Public safety was completely
ignored. Anyone attending a football match at the time knew only too
well that we were regarded with suspicion at best and outright
hostility at worst by many of those supposed to be there to keep us
safe. The culture of watching football meant that Hillsborough was an
accident waiting to happen.</hs_Para>

the 1987 semi-final at Hillsborough. I was in the Leppings Lane end. My
hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) described his
experience of attending a match with Newcastle in the same location and
in the same end. When we left that ground, we felt that we were lucky
to escape without serious injury or death. The same thing happened in
1981 and 1988, yet the lessons learned were not applied in full. Some
would argue that the behaviour of the police meant that this was no
accident, but that is no doubt something for the special prosecutor to
consider when he or she looks at the evidence. As the report makes
clear, the disaster could have happened at any one of a number of
matches in previous years or at a number of other football
grounds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102232000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102232000041">The
Attorney-General has already announced that he will apply to the High
Court for fresh inquests into the deaths of all 96 victims. Gaining new
inquests is the top priority for the families. At the original inquests
the coroner decided that all victims must have been dead by
3.15 pm, despite evidence that many were still alive, including
15-year-old Kevin Williams, whose mum Anne has worked so hard to have
the verdict overturned. The fact that the Attorney-General is convinced
that he can succeed in having the verdicts overturned in the courts
this time shows how right Anne and the other families have been all
along. The independent panel has found 
<?notus-xml column=792?>evidence that at least 41 of the victims may still have been alive at
3.15 pm, and that number may be higher. The decision to have a cut-off
at 3.15 pm has meant that evidence about the emergency response has not
been fully examined. Only 11% of the evidence was considered by the
coroner. As the independent panel says in chapter
4:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="12102232000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102232000068">“The

different verdict would show that the victims died as a result of the
failings of the police and would at last allow the families the
official recognition of how and why their loved ones died. The Home
Secretary has announced the potential appointment of an independent
prosecutor so that any criminal prosecutions do not drag on any longer
than necessary. This is the least that can be done after the 23-year
wait by the families. The independent prosecutor will explore possible
criminal charges—whether manslaughter relating to the original
tragedy or conspiracy to pervert the course of justice following the
exposé of the cover-up. Consideration by a new coroner of all
the evidence will at last allow for examination to take place of what
did and did not happen after 3.15 pm. It appears that the CPS and the
DPP did not consider the evidence of what happened 
<?notus-xml column=793?>after 3.15 pm when they decided not to prosecute.

right in making sure that justice is done this time round. An

in our part of the country, and that that culture was almost encouraged
by the then Government in the way in which the miners’

people thought they would not live to see. The truth has finally been
established—more difficult to take, not less, for the passage of

truths have been told only because of the sheer love of mothers,
fathers, brothers and sisters—a love that would not let them
give in, a love that provided strength when hope was lost and provided
dignity in the face of provocation. Those truths were also told because
of the people of a city that truly understands what solidarity and
loyalty mean, who locked arms around these families—red and blue
together—and supported them for every step on the hardest road
imaginable. At last, the entire country can see what Liverpool has
lived with for 23 years. Parliament, too, has finally woken up to the

Liverpool, has brought light to people who for 23 years have been
trapped in the blackest of tunnels, but he has done more. Through his

will start with football, because of all the organisations in the
frame, I believe that the football organisations have the furthest to
go in facing up to their responsibilities—in fact, I do not
think they have ever really started to do that in 23 years. The
Hillsborough independent panel presents football with failings of the
first order. A decade of warnings, starting with the 1981 FA cup
semi-final, was not acted on. A ground known to be unsafe was made
dangerous by modifications that were not recorded in the safety
certificate. In short, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T21:35:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

possible explanation can the club offer for failing to ensure the
safety of people who paid money to enter Hillsborough, and why did the
FA choose a ground for one of the biggest games of the season that, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T21:36:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Lancashire said, was not certified as safe? Neither
Sheffield Wednesday nor the FA has ever answered those questions. What
are we to make of the revelation in the panel’s report that the
FA received complaints about the 1988 semi-final between the same two
teams, one of which warned in stark terms that the ground was “a
death trap”? Were those complaints acted on? Not only does it
seem that nothing was done, but the guardian of the game in this
country chose to bring the same fixture with the same teams back to the
same ground the following year, prompting the question of whether the
game’s governing body believed that it had any responsibility to
listen to supporters, act on their complaints or ensure their safety
and welfare. It is hard to conclude that it did.</hs_Para>

frightening breathlessness, and authorities that do nothing about it?
It reveals an unpleasant mentality that still pervades parts of the
football industry, and a casual disregard for the paying customer.

the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery), I remember my experiences at
Hillsborough, and it angers me to remember that, when I stood with my
younger brother and my dad on the Leppings Lane terrace in January 1988
for an FA cup third-round game, throughout the whole second half I was
not watching the match but the backs of their heads. I did not let them
out of my sight because I feared for their safety in the unbearable
conditions of those central pens. There was a feeling that the football
club had taken our money but could not be sure of our safety, having
failed to take essential legal steps. It makes me angry to think of
that and the thousands of people who were put at risk.</hs_Para>

is why I found it hard in September to see a response from football
that was stunning in its inadequacy and left people wondering whether
the football organisations will ever face up to their responsibilities.
In their initial statements, neither the Football Association nor
Sheffield Wednesday football club offered one single word of apology to
the families. On Thursday 13 September, the FA had to issue a
second statement when that was pointed out, and Sheffield Wednesday
convened an emergency meeting on 11 September to rewrite a draft
statement that contained no word of apology. That says it all, and as
far as I can establish, the FA has not yet had a meeting to consider
the panel’s report and its implications for the game’s
governing body.</hs_Para>

an up-to-date safety certificate. Their failure to do that was, in my
view, grossly negligent, as was the failure to act on warnings and
complaints. That is why the families, rightly, cannot accept that the

Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough that the

will watch how the police service responds to the report, which will
affect public confidence. I make this simple statement: the service

accountability, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T21:42:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

learn in the panel’s report of a campaign orchestrated from the
very top—it was ordered by the chief constable of the
force—and of the shocking revelation that his officers were to
have a “free hand” in preparing a “rock solid

kind—self-protection over public
protection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102235000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102235000032">In
responding to the panel’s report, we must not make the mistake
of thinking that it was a one-off, exceptional, isolated event. David
Conn was the first to draw the parallel with Orgreave, which a number
of hon. Members have mentioned, and which has featured today on the
main BBC news for the first time in many years. There are echoes of the
Hillsborough story in the Orgreave story—statements amended; an
institutional effort to shift blame. It is uncomfortable, but what has
been revealed goes far deeper than many people would like to believe.
The temptation will be to box Hillsborough off as isolated, but that
cannot happen. The cultural problem must be
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102235000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102235000033">That
brings me—fifthly and finally—to the questions for this
Parliament and this House of Commons. We are good at asking questions
of others, but this one is for us. How did we let an injustice on this
scale stand for so long? Ultimately, the failings are ours. The
panel’s report is an invitation to us to ask the most searching
questions of ourselves. We failed to legislate for public
accountability. We allowed a culture of cover-up. An entire English
city was crying foul, rightly saying that there had been a great
injustice, but their voices were not heard here in this House. No
political party did enough to help them and, worse, we have a political
class that looked down on Liverpool. I am left wondering whether this
could ever have happened to another city. 
<?notus-xml column=800?>Every Member of this House should read chapter 12 of the panel’s
report and ask how it ever happened that a propaganda campaign to
impugn ordinary citizens of this country got a platform in the rooms of
this Parliament and how, beyond a few stray voices at the meeting, the
alarm bells were not ringing throughout this place.</hs_Para>

proudly of the mother of all parliaments, and of the reputation of
British justice, but this adversarial tradition in politics and the
law, in which two versions of the truth battle it out, allows on
occasion the wrong version of “the truth” to win and it
is often the version with the greater connections to power. For the
Hillsborough independent panel report we can pick up the same threads
as we find in the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday and as we have
heard in the Leveson inquiry. All three reveal a country where the
powerful and the connected hold the cards, where the concerns of
ordinary people were dismissed—a country with an unaccountable
establishment that at times colludes in its own self-interest and
self-protection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102235000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0003.htm#12102235000035">Hillsborough
is a story of an abuse of power, of class and of unequal access to
justice. I do not want to live in a country where that can ever happen
again, where ordinary people can ever be treated in this way again.
That is why I want this to be a watershed moment when this generation
of politicians, this Parliament, truly learns the lessons of
Hillsborough and builds a country where power is properly shared, where
it does not take 23 years for ordinary people to overturn injustice and
where news organisations cannot ride roughshod over people at their
lowest ebb. Let us work together for greater powers to hold the police
to account; let us bring proper redress for people damaged
by an out of control press and implement Lord Leveson’s
recommendations; and let us make more changes that connect Parliament
with people, never forgetting that it was the public who forced
Hillsborough back on to the Floor of this House a year ago. This must
be a humbling moment for this proud Parliament, but in honour of the
96, let us make it a moment of
change.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2012-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2012_10_22_PT_1/76DC162E5CAC2819B6AA8B09CA4F032B528C2737" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2012">Monday

victims of that terrible day 23 years ago. I have been privileged to

panel found significant failings in the response and actions of the
South Yorkshire Metropolitan ambulance service. Ambulance staff at the
stadium were slow to respond and to realise that a major incident was
unfolding, despite being close to where the crush was taking place.
Poor communication between the emergency services led to delay,
misunderstanding and, importantly, a failure fully to implement the
major incident plan. The result was a lack of leadership and
co-ordination by senior officers and that resources, including the
emergency foot team with essential medical equipment, were not
deployed. This clear failure continued for at least 45 minutes after
fans were released from the pens. There was no systematic assessment of
the condition of the victims, and there was a lack of basic equipment,
much of which, again through poor communication, remained in ambulances
parked outside the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T21:49:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102235000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0004.htm#12102235000040">A
number of doctors and nurses happened to be in the ground at the time
as spectators. Their accounts, critical of the lack of leadership,
co-ordination, triage and equipment, were vigorously refuted at the
time by South Yorkshire metropolitan ambulance service. Sadly, they
were an accurate portrayal of what happened that day. There is also
evidence that a number of written statements were altered. In a number
of cases, they deflected criticisms and emphasised the efficiency of
the ambulance service response.</hs_Para>

Hillsborough independent panel also re-examined the evidence around the
cause of death. In most cases, post mortem results stated that the
cause of death was traumatic asphyxia, with the assumption made by the
coroner that unconsciousness would have taken place within seconds and
death within three to four minutes. As a result, it was repeatedly
asserted by the coroner, by the High Court in the judicial review and
by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny that, by the time those
who died had been removed from the pens, death would have been
irreversible.</hs_Para>

regret to inform the House that the panel found clear evidence in at
least 41 cases that that was not the case. The post mortem reports
found that 28 people did not have traumatic asphyxia with obstruction
of blood circulation and would have taken much longer to die. There was
also separate evidence that in 31 cases the heart and lungs had
continued to function after the crush, and, in 16 cases, for a
prolonged period. However, these people would have remained vulnerable
to a further incident brought on by something as simple as being placed
on their back, which would further have obstructed their airway.

am going to focus on two specific areas. The first is the educational

age range and for those who are somewhat older. The two issues arise as
a result of similar causes. I have forewarned those in the

where we are in danger of falling between two stools. There is
education funding up to the age of 16 and then adult social funding
from the age of 18, but if something goes terribly wrong in that
two-year gap, the cost—in terms of both human suffering and
additional support from the state resulting from the fallout of

provide the care themselves for their young person on 2 weekdays every

I said in response to the intervention from my hon. Friend the Member

that those in the education department will say “We simply
cannot carry the funding burden for the whole of that period.”

education department, if the education department is going to shuffle
off that responsibility, it surely has a duty to find another

The explanation, as I understand it, is this. Following the
introduction of foundation learning qualifications, the basis was
changed from generic or broad learning aims to education that would
lead to the achievement of specific qualifications. That is fine for
people who are not learning-disadvantaged or disabled, but it obviously
has a huge negative impact on that category who are. There was also a
reduction in what is called “entitlement funding” from
117 hours to only 30 hours a year, and a restriction excluding what are
known as “enrichment” activities from the process. Such
activities are not designed to lead to the world of work, but are
designed simply to give greater quality to the life of a
learning-disabled person.</hs_Para>

The national special needs charity to which I referred earlier, Contact

welcomes the draft provisions published last month as far as they go,
but it is deeply anxious that they do not guarantee a right to
full-time education to those with learning difficulties and

tonight that if his Department is unable single-handedly to fill the
gap between these ages, it will work with other Departments so that,
between them, we avoid this problem of falling between two stools and
we reinstate the situation that used to apply before 2008 and has
progressively—or regressively, I should say—deteriorated
since then and that we return to the position in which, one way or
another, people have five days a week of support between the ages of 16

the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) for welcoming me to my new
role and, I think, for reminding me of those heady days of 2008 in
Crewe and Nantwich. More importantly for the purposes of the debate, I
thank him for bringing before the House the important question of
funding for students aged between 16 and 18 with learning difficulties
and disabilities, and in particular those who are being educated in our
further education colleges. As I have frequently heard my hon. Friend
speak in this House, it comes as no surprise to me that he argues this
case clearly and with passion on behalf of his constituents who are the
parents of just such young learners. He has brought home the very real
issues that they face in getting the best education for their
children<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T22:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102238000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0004.htm#12102238000029">Although
I am still relatively new in my post as Minister in the Department for
Education, I have already become aware of the responsibility that rests
with me for these young people. My Department has already set out our
commitment in our May 2012 document “Support and aspiration: A
new approach to special educational needs and
disability—progress and next steps.” That approach
follows on from the proposals in the earlier Green Paper. Our
proposals, which we have drawn up into draft legislation that is
currently being scrutinised, are designed to move away from the
disjointed, labyrinthine and label-focused current system my hon.
Friend described to a more seamless, supported and outcomes-focused
system. In doing so, we seek to offer real hope for young 
<?notus-xml column=809?>people with learning difficulties and disabilities,
and to help them meet their desires and aspirations, in the
same way that other young people can.</hs_Para>

parents, as has been so eloquently expressed by my hon.
Friend<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T22:19:54"></hs_TimeCode>, is
whether their children are getting the level of education and support
they need, and whether appropriate funding is available to make sure
that that happens. Although his constituents point to this concern as
having begun in the 2008-09 academic year for the colleges in his area,
which my<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T22:20:27"></hs_TimeCode> right
hon. Friend the Member for New Forest West (Mr Swayne) also represents,
we know that it is a concern in other parts of the country as well. It
is, of course, right that parents expect to receive an appropriate
level of provision for their children’s needs, and so it is
right that local authorities and colleges work closely with parents and
the young people themselves to ensure that their needs are being
properly met at all
times.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102238000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0004.htm#12102238000031">My
Department funds local authorities to make provision and support
available for young people with learning difficulties and disabilities
in a way that allows for five days a week learning where that is
appropriate. The funding behind that has not declined, and we are not
changing the overall funding for schools and high-needs pupils and
students aged up to 25. The amount we allocate for these children and
young people through additional learning support—a key
feature—has increased year on year. The amount of high-level
additional learning support we make available for 16 to 24-year-olds
has, in fact, increased by more than a quarter in the past two years,
from £97 million in 2010-11 to £124.9 million in 2012-13.
Additional funding has been made available from the learners with
learning difficulties and disabilities placement budget for students
with high levels of learning difficulty and/or disability placed in FE
colleges. That has also increased by a quarter, from £24.8
million to £35 million in the same time

know from a visit I made last week to Hereward college in Coventry that
the one thing that most young people aged 16 to 18 want is to have, as
far as possible, the same opportunities and life chances as the rest of
their peer group. For some young people, who may have learning
difficulties and/or disabilities but are quite capable of undertaking
unsupervised independent study on their own, a course involving three
days a week of supervised learning in an FE college will be wholly
appropriate to their needs. However, for
others—this touches on the case that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T22:22:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for New Forest East cited—it will simply not be
enough, particularly for those with more profound or limiting
disabilities. So where it is clear that a young person would have
difficulty managing their learning in a three-day-a-week setting with
periods of unsupervised study, we would expect a programme to be
offered over a longer period each week. That would and
should be accompanied by additional support for learning, the funding
for which I have set out, and support outside formal
lessons, to be provided as
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102238000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0004.htm#12102238000034">Of
course, it is not the business of government to tell autonomous FE
colleges how to arrange the courses they provide or how to set their
timetables. By the same 
<?notus-xml column=810?>token, it is essential that the provision on offer in these colleges is
right for each individual. Nor is it true that all FE colleges have
looked at the overall funding available to them from their local
authority and decided to reduce the length of courses they offer to
their students; many have worked together to find innovative solutions.
For example, Luton local authority has funded a “broker”
to put together programmes for its young people with highest needs,
combining education, health and social care as appropriate. It has
generated new types of day provision with very high support functions,
taking on a new role as a commissioner of services. Neighbouring
Hertfordshire has operated with two “brokers” since 2006,
but is now attempting to merge the role into personal adviser roles.
Both Hertfordshire and Luton were part of an original east of England
regional initiative Improving Choice, which developed a
“person-centred” approach, aiming to increase
availability and access to support for study within their local
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102238000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/debtext/121022-0004.htm#12102238000035">Under
the current funding approach, the provision that young people with
learning difficulties and disabilities receive will depend on what the
local authority has set out in the learning difficulty assessment drawn
up for them. This is designed to identify the young person’s
educational needs, and describe the provision that will be made
available to them that will be suitable and appropriate to their needs.

Timpson:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising
the important question of how to get the most out of the available
resources. We are under no illusions about the tight economic situation
which means we have to find more from less. That is why the reforms we
will introduce in the new year will focus on joint commissioning
between education and health so that we can try to pool our resources
more effectively; on putting a local offer on the table so that parents
can see close up what services are available to them and get as much
accountability as possible from the local authority and health
services; and on ensuring that we identify as early as possible the
needs of each individual child. That will mean that the necessary work
can be done as early as possible, preventing unnecessary work in the
future that could have been avoided if provision had been offered
earlier. Those are all reasons why the reforms, which I shall explain
in more detail in the three minutes I have left, will make an important
contribution to a more effective child and young person-centred
system.</hs_Para>

proposed special educational needs reforms will improve the situation
for this group of young people in general. More specifically, our
proposed new education, health and care plans will focus much more on
the needs and aspirations of the young person and will be drawn up in
consultation with them. It is important to note that following an
assessment of the young person’s needs and negotiation with them
and their parents, the plans will set out their education, health and
social care needs not up to the age of 16 or 18 but up to the age of
25. That is a new statutory protection for young adults in further

Access to FE provision for adults with learning difficulties is rightly
the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation
and Skills, but it is clear to me that there are issues of real concern
here that my hon. Friend has helpfully raised. The Government
prioritise funding where its impact is greatest on outcomes, and
maximising that is part of the Government’s agenda to support
people into employment. We fully fund units and qualifications for
unemployed people in receipt of jobseeker’s allowance and
employment support allowance, depending on what they need to help them
enter and stay in work. In 2012-13 we are investing over £3.8
billion for more than 3 million adult training places through the
Skills Funding Agency.</hs_Para>

concerns that my hon. Friend raises in relation to specific funding
streams to support enrichment and further qualifications. There have
been some changes to the way that they have been calculated, and that

had. I hope also to provide him with some reassurance that we

new Secretary of State for Health has responded in short order to the
facts presented to him, and I thank him for that. In a letter sent by
him today to the various councils that referred the Glenfield decision
to him, he says that the Independent Reconfiguration Panel will now
conduct a full review of the decision by the Safe and Sustainable
review. That is most certainly to be
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T16:31:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, he also says that the IRP will not consider the decision taken
by his predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for South

decision was not taken by the joint committee of primary care trusts; I

the new Secretary of State can reverse the decision on ECMO. As I am
sure contributors to this debate will demonstrate, it would be sensible
for him to do that and I look forward to receiving confirmation from my

happen<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T16:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>. Cardiac

be seven surgical centres: at Glenfield, at Freeman hospital in

Birmingham children’s hospital, at Bristol royal hospital and at

received the greatest support. The consultation was the largest ever
public consultation within the national health service, with more than

number of people who signed the e-petition that provoked this debate.
Option A was supported by six of the 10 health regions in England. It

demand and capacity—I appreciate some of these points might be
for the review committee, but it is important to get them on the

on demand and the capacity on offer at Birmingham that the joint
committee of primary care trusts used. As I understand it, the national
projections used by the review assume that demand will be flat, yet the
most up-to-date data show demand increasing, because birth rates in the
east midlands and west midlands are well above national averages. The
projections of population trends used by the review team were based on
data from 2006-07. Using those data would suggest a relatively stable
work load rising to 3,990 cases in 2025, but, if the latest data on
population expectations from the Office for National Statistics are

would be interested in hearing the Minister justify the decision not to
allow the IRP to consider the ECMO decision. Was not the decision to
move ECMO taken and presented as a necessary consequence of the
decision taken by the JCPCT in relation to the Safe and Sustainable
review? Given that that was the context in which the ECMO decision was
made, does it not seem odd that the review committee will not now
consider the decision to move ECMO? If the justification is that there
is a procedural argument that the various local authorities have asked
the committee to consider the outcome of the Safe and Sustainable
review and that ECMO was not part of that, fair enough, but it would
leave a rather sour taste in the mouth of many campaigners who signed
the petition. If that is the case, is there any way in which the ECMO
decision can be reviewed? Can the Secretary of State consider reversing
the decision of the previous Secretary of State? Many of us who are
involved in this cross-party campaign would be grateful for guidance on
that from the Minister. I am not sure whether the campaigners would

his light touch. The fact that we now have a second chance to consider

hon. Friend the Minister has already intervened to point out that she

first point I want to make is that there is real concern that we are
working on faulty statistics. The data used to make the decision were
based on 2006-07. We need only consider the recent publication of the
census in London to see the huge increase that there has been in
population. There are shifting populations, and there is concern that
the analysis is fundamentally flawed. It is not only my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Health who has had to consider flawed
data recently. What about the west coast main line, whereby we found we
were operating with completely inaccurate
information<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:08:58"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:08:58"></hs_TimeCode>?

reasonable people, it seems absurd that the two decisions will not be

next point concerns the site of Glenfield. Glenfield is a hugely
popular hospital not just with patients, but with surgeons. From, one
might say, a feng shui point of view, it is on top of a hill outside
the city, and it has a good, clean, clear energy. That is why everybody
likes 
<?notus-xml column=174?>working there: it is nicer for everybody than the Birmingham site, as is
proven, I would suggest, by a survey showing that
only 2% of the staff in Glenfield want to move to Birmingham. It is not
just BBC current affairs programmes that are jumpy about moving out of
their current locations, as there is a real problem with the decision
to move from Glenfield to Birmingham, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:10:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

silly to close such a popular centre? As he said, there will be a
knock-on effect if other centres close, but patients are already being

Department of Health were queried. It has been calculated that
Birmingham children’s hospital will be expected to deal with 611
cases a year. However, clinical teams have suggested that it could be
900 to 1,000 procedures a year. Birmingham children’s hospital,
having done its own modelling, expects the number of procedures to be
more than
900.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102210000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102210000087">I
understand that senior commissioners acknowledge that the number is
likely to be significantly higher than the figure of 611 used in the
review, as does Sir Roger Boyle, the recently retired cardiac tsar, who
initiated the project. The calculations demonstrating that the closure
was a safe and sustainable option for the midlands, which considered
travel, access, quality, deliverability, sustainability and
affordability, were based on 611 operations, not 900 or 1,000. Doctors
at Glenfield doubt very much that Birmingham children’s hospital
has the capacity to handle that volume of work. In addition, Birmingham
children’s hospital has stated that it wishes to move to a new
site within 10 years, as it has already reached the limit of what can
be achieved in the space that it has. Based on that, I would like the
points that I have raised to be addressed to ensure that the Safe and
Sustainable exercise was carried out using the correct data.</hs_Para>

turn to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, a life support
service currently delivered at Glenfield. There is a strong argument
that the value of the service has not been fully appreciated throughout
the review. Glenfield pioneered ECMO treatment in the UK and delivers
education, training and clinical support to other ECMO centres in the
UK and abroad. Survival after ECMO treatment in the Glenfield unit is
far more likely than in other UK and international centres—that
is, more children
survive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102210000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102210000089">Several
concerns have been raised with me about the Safe and Sustainable
process for assessing the risks and practicalities of moving the
service. I understand that only two experts were consulted about moving
ECMO, and that the Swedish ECMO expert Kenneth Palmer, of the
Karolinska Institute, has publicly expressed his anger at how his views
have been used to justify the move from Glenfield, and has withdrawn
his support for the process. Another issue is how a Sea King helicopter
carrying a patient might land in central Birmingham. Glenfield can
handle that, because it designed a system to accommodate it. Although
the use of a Sea King helicopter is rare, we have heard that when they
are used, as in the recent fire in Wales, they are life-savers. I would
welcome a further review of the
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102210000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102210000090">I
remain concerned that Birmingham children’s hospital will not
see ECMO as a strategic priority and might contemplate splitting the
service among other providers, which would defeat the principles of the
Safe and Sustainable review and put at risk the world-class results
that we are achieving. The review’s aim is to concentrate
expertise and deliver more positive outcomes. However, 
<?notus-xml column=176?>there are no plans for any other ECMO provider, including Birmingham
children’s hospital, to use what
my<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:18:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough termed the mobile retrieval
service. That goes against the principle of the whole review.</hs_Para>

mobile retrieval service that Glenfield provides is a fundamental
aspect of the service, and it partly explains why Glenfield produces so
many positive outcomes. Its team travel by ambulance to the hospital
where the sick child is located, taking all the necessary kit with them
to start ECMO treatment. ECMO is then started on site and continued in
the ambulance on the way back to Glenfield, ensuring that children
receive the treatment as soon as possible at a time when their life
expectancy without treatment might be measured in hours rather than
days, and avoiding a much riskier ambulance journey on a simple
ventilator. If that aspect of the service is not taken up by others in
Glenfield’s absence, there is a danger that fewer children will
survive horrific illnesses.</hs_Para>

the Minister clarify the level of scrutiny of the results achieved at
Glenfield and Birmingham children’s hospital? Since the decision
was made, the unit has stated that it invited various members of the
Safe and Sustainable review to Glenfield to show them the results of
the past 10 years, which, it believes, demonstrate the success of its
service. It has no record of that data being shared previously, and I
would welcome clarification on what data were looked at during the
initial review process.</hs_Para>

staff who deliver the service at Glenfield will relocate to Birmingham.

is also concern regarding the air of uncertainty that surrounds these
units. Once a unit is earmarked for closure, the most able and gifted

want to be frivolous, but if, for example, some of my constituents were
involved in an accident, Humberside police would attend and summon an
ambulance from the east midlands, which would then take them to Grimsby

be unable to move due to family commitments. Many of the nurses there
have homes, families and children, and they may be second earners. A
family cannot simply be uprooted and
moved<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:36:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Indeed,
an anonymised survey of all staff at the unit found that 80% are

advice about the future of ECMO services from the Advisory Group for
National Specialised Services. There was no representative from any UK

turn to the specific point about why the decision to move the
children’s ECMO services over to Birmingham from Glenfield is
not part of the review, or at least part of today’s decisions.
Decisions about ECMO for children at Leicester being moved to
Birmingham follow from the decision to transfer heart surgery to
Birmingham. In other words, it was a consequence of the JCPCT’s
decision. Children’s ECMO services are a nationally commissioned
service, so the decision was taken by the Secretary of State, not the
JCPCT. The Secretary of State made his decision based on the Advisory
Group for National Specialised Services. To be clear, the JCPCT having
made the decision, AGNSS then looked at the children’s ECMO
services at Leicester and recommended to the Secretary of State that,
in light of the JCPCT’s decision, those services should also be
transferred to Birmingham.</hs_Para>

make it clear that it is unfortunate that the word
“equipment” has been used. I am more than aware that the
matter involves considerably more than pieces of equipment at
Glenfield, and I pay full tribute to the team who work there, and
indeed to the children’s heart surgery team there and to every
team throughout the country. It is important to make it clear that no
one is saying that a good service is not being provided, or that a
service is bad or poor. The issue is all about ensuring that we get the
very best service in fewer but bigger
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102229000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102229000055"><hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:53:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T17:58:49"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="David Tredinnick" PimsId="4327" UID="12102229000101" xid="599" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102229000101">David

review of all that has happened—it effectively calls into
question the whole process, and so on—it obviously flows from
that that the ECMO children’s service at Leicester must be
retained in that event, because it flows from the JCPCT’s
decision about where to have the specialist children’s heart
services. In any case, if there is some other new or exceptional
evidence that can be placed before the Secretary of State, or that he

remind everyone, as I conclude my remarks, what led to the review, the
recommendations and the decisions. Concern about children’s
heart services began a long time ago as a result of serious incidents
in Bristol back in the 1990s. For some 15 years, therefore, it has been
accepted, almost by everyone, that children’s heart surgeries
were of great concern. National patient groups all agreed that what was
needed was to ensure that we had surgeons, nurses and other health
professionals based in larger, but fewer, specialised centres. That is
why, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:02:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Leicester West has identified, the previous Government set
up the review<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:03:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
In many ways, it took courage to do so, because there had been a lot of
talk about the issue but not much action. Everyone agreed absolutely
that reducing the number of centres was necessary, so that we would
have bigger numbers of surgeons, nurses and other specialists, and that
the service could be better, but in fewer units. Therefore, to put it
crudely, somebody was always going to lose out.</hs_Para>

this is an example in which we do not want a greater number of smaller
units; it is a good example of where we want fewer, but much bigger
units. It is perhaps worth remembering that children’s heart
surgery has advanced considerably over the years, so that surgeons now
operate on children who are often only two days old, with hearts the
size of walnuts. It is argued that that is the most specialist,
delicate and difficult of all surgery.</hs_Para>

surprising, given the service’s nature—the fact that it

other places that have been told their facilities will be moved
away—for example, from Leeds up to Newcastle. I pay tribute to
all who have gone to the trouble of signing the e-petition in support
of Glenfield. I can speak about the great campaign that was organised,
having attended a Leicester Tigers rugby match some time last year;
every seat had a leaflet on it and an event was organised in support of
Glenfield. Other places, too, have organised campaigns, and rightly so.

has done that independently, and with considerable support from
clinicians, royal colleges and many eminent bodies, as well as others
who have spoken out in favour the proposals. However, today’s
decision by the Secretary of State is to be welcomed. Everybody can now
be assured that there will be an independent review of the

Back Benchers. It has been thoroughly useful, informed and informative,
and I am grateful to everyone who has assisted in the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:07:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102229000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102229000065">On
the process, I suspect that my hon. Friend the Minister was tiptoeing
around the issue, not wishing to trespass across a difficult line, but
it is important not to confuse process with what we are sent here to do
as Members of Parliament and as Ministers, which is not to confuse the
substance with the means by which we make decisions. Our constituents
expect us, as elected politicians, to come here and speak for them and
say things that may be disobliging to those who hold the levers of
power—and that is what we have
done<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102229000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102229000066">I
know that the Minister is concerned—of course, she should
be—that anything she says might be taken as ammunition that
would fuel someone’s thoughts about a judicial review of a
decision made by a previous Secretary of State, and I do not want to
push her in any direction that might cause her that problem. None the
less, we all know what lies behind her careful words. At least I
do—I am sure that many others do as well—and I am
entitled, as she is not, to rip away that veil and get to the heart of
this question: what is to happen to the ECMO services, both adult and
children’s, at the Glenfield centre, and what is to happen to
the cardiac services for children at Glenfield? As has been agreed
across the Chamber this afternoon, those are inextricably linked
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the question is put. The question this afternoon has been put, and the
Minister has done her best to answer it, but the message that she must
take back to her Department is that we are not as fascinated as some of
her departmental lawyers might be
by<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:09:28"></hs_TimeCode> who made

Secretary of State has the levers of power in this question and he must
pull them—he must exercise them—and make a decision. That
is what he is paid to do, what he was appointed by my right hon. Friend
the Prime Minister to do and what he was elected to Parliament to do. I
am sure that the Minister will give him every assistance in reaching
what is the inevitable answer to the questions posed this
afternoon—namely, that the Glenfield ECMO unit, for children and
adults, and the Glenfield cardiac services unit should remain
open<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:10:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102229000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102229000069">I
do not care who made the decision or how the dainty route was created
to get to it. We all know that the current decision is wrong and needs
to be dealt with. The Minister, please, will go back to her Department
and inform the Secretary of State that Parliament thinks that that
decision is wrong and that Parliament requires the Government, through
the Department, to change it. How they do that is up to them, but they
must do
it<hs_TimeCode time="2012-10-22T18:10:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102229000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102229000070">I
thank the Minister for her patience in listening to us. I thank her for
dealing with a difficult and, as she rightly says, emotionally charged
subject. None the less, we have to set aside the emotion and the
personal and heart-rending stories, make the right decision and just
get on with it. I look forward to the Secretary of State writing us
another letter, in a very short time, in which he adds to the letter of
today’s date a decision to review the ECMO matter as well,
because, as we all know, it is not possible to separate the two, and it
is not possible to separate us, as elected representatives for our
constituents, from this issue. We will stick to it like a barnacle
until we are satisfied that the matter has been properly resolved. I
look forward to having further such discussions with my hon. Friend the
Minister in the very near future, but I thank her most sincerely for
her presence here today and her
contribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102229000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/halltext/121022h0001.htm#12102229000071"><I>Question

Vaizey:</Member></B> Unwanted sales calls from companies based outside
the UK fall outside the jurisdiction of the UK. However, measures are
in place for sales and marketing calls that are made on behalf of UK
companies, through the Privacy and Electronic Communications
Regulations (PECR) 2003. Callers are legally required not to call a
number that is registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS),
or if they have previously notified the caller that they do not wish to
receive such calls. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)
considers complaints about the TPS and can issue a fine of up to
£500,000 for the most serious breaches. Residents can also
further protect themselves, as most service providers offer a range of
services that can help to reduce the need to answer such calls. This
includes Calling Line Identification Display, Automatic Call 
<?notus-xml column=566?>Rejection and Choose to Refuse. A range of other devices are also
commercially available that can help to block unwanted sales
calls.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1210227000020" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121019/text/121019w0006.htm#1210227000020">Dismissal</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1210227000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121019/text/121019w0006.htm#1210227000226"><B><Member PimsId="5952" UID="1210227003008" xid="1231" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121019/text/121019w0006.htm#1210227003008">Dan

Arts Council England's (ACE) ‘Own Art’ scheme makes it
easier and more affordable for people to buy and sell contemporary art
and craft by offering interest free loans of up to £2,000 for
the purchase of work by living artists. During the past year over 3,700
customers used the ‘Own Art’ scheme, generating an
estimated £1.8 million worth of income for artists. ACE also
supports artist-led galleries that focus on showing emerging, talent

national health service reconfigurations and major service changes
should be locally led and clinically driven. The underlying rationale
should be that changes deliver an improvement in quality and outcomes
for patients. The guiding principles are the Secretary of 
<?notus-xml column=576?>State's four tests, which are that schemes should be able to
demonstrate: support from clinical commissioners; clarity on the
clinical evidence base; robust patient and public engagement; and
support for patient choice. It is for the local NHS, working with their
partners, to plan, develop and implement proposals for change and
assure these proposals against the four tests.</hs_Para>

practitioners (GPs) to identify and respond to victims more

general practitioner surgeries, walk-in clinics or hospitals for
treatment of an injury but may not disclose that an injury occurred as

Data are as at 30 September in each
year.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. PCTs provided are those in
existence at the time of the relevant census. East and North
Hertfordshire and West Hertfordshire PCTs merged in 2010 to form a
single Hertfordshire PCT. Wherever the name of a PCT has changed over
the time series but the boundaries remained the same the most recent
name as at 30 September 2011 has been

Registered patient figures used for the calculation in the data were
taken from the annual GP Census publication, which is collected
directly from the Exeter GP payment system. They are numbers of
registrations only and do not represent a precise count of physical
people as some people are registered multiple times at different
practices and similarly some people are not registered with a GP at
all.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5. Headcount
Methodology:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The new headcount
methodology from 2010 onwards means these data are not fully comparable
with previous years, due to improvements that make it a more stringent
count of absolute staff numbers. Further information on the headcount
methodology is available in the census
publication:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>http://www.ic.nhs.uk/statistics-and-data-collections/workforce/nhs-staff-numbers</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>Headcount

Quality:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The Health and Social Care
Information Centre seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of
missing and invalid data but responsibility for data accuracy lies with
the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually being
updated to improve data quality where changes impact on figures already
published. This is assessed but unless it is significant at national
level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local level is
footnoted in relevant
analyses.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table>

not directly comparable with the annual workforce census; they include
only those staff on the ESR (ie they do not include Primary care staff
or Bank staff), they also include locum doctors (not counted in the
annual census). There are also new methods of presenting data
(headcount methodology is different and there is now a role count).

RTDS collects activity data on intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)
by trust provider. These can be identified by the preparation coding
for IMRT, although they do not distinguish inverse and forward planned
IMRT. Coding for IMRT has been evolving since the establishment of the
RTDS and so additional guidance has been issued to provider trusts.

sees the Afghans take the lead for security in areas home to 75% of the

services to a wide range of other Government Departments and police
forces. It is the largest single provider of vetting services and has
developed an electronic vetting capability to further improve
efficiency and effectiveness. We continue to discuss with the Cabinet
Office and other organisations whether additional benefits could be
driven from consolidating all of the provision of vetting into a single
organisation, but no decision has been taken at this time. It should be
noted that a change in structure in October 2011 resulted in the
Defence Vetting Agency becoming part of Defence Business Services and
being renamed National Security Vetting. The role remains the same and
a key priority is to widen further DBS-NSV's customer base across
Government Departments and other public

Heath:</Member></B> Reducing environmental exposure to potential
endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is not straightforward. Both
naturally occurring and synthetic substances may have such properties.
Some EDCs may have beneficial health or societal applications. These
include the phytoestrogens present in foods such as soya and
ethinyl-oestradiol, an active ingredient of the contraceptive
pill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102228000472" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0001.htm#12102228000472">Research
has indicated that ethinyl-oestradiol and natural human hormones via
sewage treatment effluent can have negative impacts on fish in UK
freshwaters. In response, the Department collaborated with
the Environment Agency, Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the
water industry in the Endocrine Disruption Demonstration Programme
(EDDP) from 2006 to 2010. The EDDP aimed to evaluate the effectiveness
of conventional and “advanced” sewage treatment in
removing these chemicals. The results demonstrated that the improved
processes put in place over the last 15 years or so to meet
stringent ammonia standards have reduced the risks from endocrine
disrupting
substances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102228000473" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0001.htm#12102228000473">DEFRA

suspected endocrine disrupting chemicals, including several pesticides,
are subject to long-standing regulations because of specific toxic
effects, which may be due to endocrine disrupting activity. There is

that were found to cause significant endocrine disrupting effects in
some marine
organisms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102228000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0001.htm#12102228000475">There
are longstanding provisions under EU legislation to subject potentially
dangerous chemicals, including endocrine disrupters, to a risk
assessment. Where risks are identified, European-wide measures can then
be taken to control them. For example, this has been done with the
chemical nonylphenol and the flame retardants octa- and penta- BDE
(bromodiphenyl ether).</hs_Para>

be subject to the authorisation procedures under the EU Registration,
Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH)
Regulation, which aims to substitute hazardous chemicals unless there
are good socio-economic reasons to justify their continued use. EDCs
are also controlled by EU legislation on plant protection and biocidol
products. DEFRA is actively collaborating with other Government
Departments and agencies in the development of EU regulatory criteria
for EDCs. We are also working in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development to produce new scientifically-based test

should be brought. There will be a public consultation before the final
guidelines are published. Certain offences, for example the publication
of the name of a victim of a sexual offence, require my consent to
prosecution; this therefore allows me to consider how such crimes are
being prosecuted.</hs_Para>

specific arrangements in place for dealing with cases involving deaths
in police custody or after contact with the police. To ensure
consistency and to 
<?notus-xml column=634?>build expertise to deal with this challenging caseload, the CPS
centralised the handling of such matters to the Special Crime and
Counter Terrorism Division (SCCTD). Only very experienced senior
lawyers are specifically designated to review death in custody cases in
SCCTD. The reviews carried out by the senior lawyer are examined by the
line manager (the "Unit Head") and then by the Head of Division (or
Deputy). All such cases are then referred to the Director of Public
Prosecutions (DPP) at the end of the review for consideration. In any
case where the decision is not to proceed, and if the DPP is not
satisfied that it is "plain beyond doubt" that there is no case to
answer, then experienced external counsel will be instructed to advise.
This is in accordance with the recommendations from the
Attorney-General's "Review of the Role and Practices of the Crown
Prosecution Service in Cases Arising from a Death in Custody"
2003.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2012-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2012_10_22_PT_1/079781701A25FD1B16D3E18678853E59340657FC" __version__="1.20"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2012">Monday

streamlined the application process by developing an online eligibility
checking service (ECS), which allows local authorities to check data
held by the Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs,
and the Home Office to establish a family's free school meal
eligibility quickly. We are encouraging local authorities to increase
their use of this resource, 
<?notus-xml column=652?>which, as well as reducing bureaucracy and cost at a local level,
encourages more parents to sign up their children for a free school

January 2012. I occasionally receive letters from members of the House
about particular cases, for example, when an application made by one of
their constituents is refused. It is a matter, however, for the
relevant local authority to decide whether or not a person is eligible
for a badge under the terms of the regulations. An applicant must
re-apply for a badge every three years, in most cases. They will be
assessed at the time they apply and there should be no assumption on
their part that they will be issued with a badge simply because they
have had one before. They must meet the eligibility criteria at the
time of application.</hs_Para>

It should be noted that levelised cost estimates for different types of
electricity generation are highly sensitive to the assumptions used for
capital costs, fuel and EU ETS allowance prices, operating costs, load
factor, discount rate and other drivers and this means that there is
significant uncertainty around these estimates. It is perhaps more
appropriate to consider a range of cost estimates as pipeline projects
show a large range around these central values. Total power sector
system costs are largely driven by the capacity and generation mix of
energy technologies (including renewable energy technologies) as well
as methods of energy sector balancing (i.e. back-up plant, storage,
interconnection, demand-side response, etc). DECC does not allocate
total system costs to individual
technologies.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>2</Sup> A report by

changing the old interpreter booking system, which was inadequate in

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are
used.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">Justice

last year's consultation on ‘Options for Dealing with

longer need to spend time and money seeking to evict squatters because
they can report them to the
police.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2012-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2012_2013/DailyParts/2012_10_22_PT_1/BAA93B8DC253E9534EF29FD9BD14EFCF37DA093B" __version__="1.18"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2012">Monday

was approved in the European Union for food and feed use in 2004,
following a rigorous safety assessment. The original evaluation was

information has recently been published concerning an animal feeding
trial carried out in France, where the authors highlighted an apparent
difference in the incidence of certain tumours between animals fed
NK603 maize and non-GM maize. However, no statistical analysis was
provided to show that these differences were other than chance
observations. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the body
responsible for carrying out the safety assessment for GM food and
feed, is reviewing this new study. In its initial statement EFSA
advised that the published report cannot be used in the safety
assessment of GM maize NK603 and it does not see a need to reopen the
existing safety evaluation of GM maize NK603. The Food Standards Agency
agrees with this
conclusion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102237000407" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0004.htm#12102237000407">EFSA

Soubry:</Member></B> Over the last five years, NHS Blood and Transplant
(NHSBT) has been delivering an ambitious, but carefully managed, change
programme which has included the removal of significant excess capacity
within the blood supply chain. NHSBT has consolidated its processing
and testing sites, with most of the sites in the south being
consolidated to Filton. As part of this, NHSBT very thoroughly
considered business continuity impacts and there are robust protocols
for transferring testing to another centre during an emergency, as
demonstrated by the recent flood at
Filton.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102237000443" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0004.htm#12102237000443">When
designing the Filton site, a flood analysis was carried out which
calculated the maximum water level that would occur once in every 200
years. This was double the requirements of the original developer's
planning application. An additional 20% was also added to the
calculated water levels take into account the potential impact of
climate change. As a result, the finished floor level was 50.5 million
above ordnance datum (sea
level).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102237000444" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0004.htm#12102237000444">NHSBT
regularly assesses risks that may affect its operation on any site,
including flooding and other natural events. When the risk is
considered significant, resilience measures are put in place to
mitigate risk and response measures put in place that enable NHSBT to
continue to provide service to hospitals while managing the
event.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="12102237000445" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121022/text/121022w0004.htm#12102237000445">During
the flood, NHSBT continued to provide an uninterrupted service in which
all hospital demands were met and the Filton site was fully operational
within a fortnight of the flood. This clearly demonstrates that the
contingency plans NHSBT has in place are robust and enable the
organisation to maintain delivery of a vital national service in the

psychosis demonstration sites are focused around EIP so will be
routinely evaluating employment rates. The pathfinders are using the
Work and Social Adjustment Scale as the outcome measure to record the
level of self-reported disability by patients. This scale measures
patients’ ability to undertake work, education and training as

attacks by violent extremists have sought to provoke religious
division. Such attacks, as well as inter-communal violence, have caused
suffering in both Christian and Muslim communities in Nigeria.
Responsibility for many of these attacks, including, increasingly,
those against places of worship, has been claimed by the Islamic
extremist group popularly known as Boko Haram. Boko Haram has also
claimed responsibility for attacks against political and traditional
leaders, as well as members of Nigeria's security forces. The British

in Islamic Maghreb (AQ-M) in particular has repeatedly taken western
hostages. In some cases these operations have been co-ordinated with
al-Qaeda leadership. Funds raised from ransom payments have
significantly enhanced AQ-M's operational capability, including its
ability to recruit and retain personnel and buy new equipment. The
British Government's policy on kidnap for ransom is long-held and
clear: we seek the swift and safe return of hostages, but do not pay
ransoms or make other substantive concessions to hostage takers
(prisoner release or a change in policy). We do so on the basis that
making concessions serves only to fuel the problem and increase the

addition, Energy and Utility Skills (EU Skills), the Sector Skills
Council for the renewable energy industry, and RenewableUK, produced
"Working for a Green Britain: Vol 2, Future Employment and Skills in

terms of activity, there has been significant success for the offshore
sector in securing skills capacity funding managed by UKCES. For
example, RenewableUK received support to establish a Renewable Training
Network aiming to tackle skills shortages in the renewable energy
sector and EU Skills received funding to create a Group Skills
Purchasing Scheme to support the provision of quality assured training
addressing the skills needed for the delivery of renewable energy.
There is also a range of initiatives aiming to increase awareness of
green skills, such as information provided through the National Careers
Service and improve, green skills provision in the Further Education
sector through the work of the Learning and Skills Improvement
