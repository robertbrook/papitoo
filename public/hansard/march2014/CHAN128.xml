2 would simply add a line to clause 1 to the effect that a peer may not
resign until they have been a peer for a minimum of 10 years. If
somebody accepts a great honour from the Crown, it seems to me that
they have an obligation to live up to that honour. Circumstances might
change and require a different lifestyle that makes it impossible for
them to attend the House, but to enter lightly into the receipt of a
peerage—that great honour bestowed by our sovereign of being a
legislator in the second House of Parliament—and then to give it
up after a day or two or, conceivably, even after a minute, seems
improper.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000095">People

peerage or a dated peerage, but a life peerage. One of the glories of
the House of Lords is that it represents age. It is not full of

the Bill is simple, it would fundamentally change the nature of the

life would allow people appointed to the House to remain there for a
term. That change in structure would allow Governments that are not
necessarily as benign as this one—I will talk about this further
in relation to some of my other amendments—to ensure that peers
are in the House for only a certain period, and possibly to get them
post-dated cheques for when they might resign. I think that that reform

2 ties in with amendment 3. The point of amendment 3 is to insert a
minimum age for retirement, whereby no peer under 65 could retire.

be a marker in somebody’s career. It should not be a point on
their CV so that when they apply for jobs in merchant banks, or
wherever, they can say “I was a peer for 10 years”.
People who take it on should commit to do so for an extended period, so
that if a peer is raised to that rank, style and dignity at the age of
40, there will be an expectation that the major part of their future
life and career will be a commitment to serve the House—this
country—in the second Chamber.</hs_Para>

4 is about the witnessing of the peer’s statement that he wishes

fraudulent certificates will be issued by random people wandering
around signing things and pretending to be witnesses to statements that
peers have not made? No, I do not think that, but these resignations
are essentially proceedings in Parliament, and they should be a formal
parliamentary proceeding registered by people who are also Members of
Parliament. This would be a safeguard to ensure that somebody did not
resign in a light moment and then regret it, or have the statement
signed in their office and send it in having been pushed into doing it
by offers of who knows what—perhaps an offer of becoming a
European commissioner or something grand and fancy such as that,
although I know that there is a special way for such people to stay in

sensible to explain. The Bill says that if somebody signs a form
resigning from the House of Lords, that notice is irrevocable from the
point at which it has been signed, even if it is a long-post-dated
cheque. So if a peer entered the House of Lords and said that he
intended to resign in eight 
<?notus-xml column=527?>years’ time, the document would be
irrevocable, even though all sorts of things may change. That person
would then be ineligible to be a peer again in future. I think that
that is a mistake. There should be an ability to withdraw the notice

amendment 7 is perhaps a little obscure, for which I apologise. It
occurred to me that the Bill as drafted has forgotten about the Lord
Great Chamberlain and the Earl Marshal. It is extraordinary that anyone
could ever forget about them. I think about them most days, at
considerable length, and the many onerous duties they have. Anyone who
paid attention to the visit of Mrs Merkel yesterday will have noticed
that the event was held at the other end of this Palace by permission
of the Lord Great Chamberlain, who has a role in Parliament. He is an
hereditary office holder—it is one of the few hereditary offices
in this country—of a most interesting kind, because the office
is shared between families according to reign. I believe the
Cholmondeleys had it for two reigns out of three, and two other
families share it in the third
reign.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000116">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T10:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>

his great office of state. We could reach the ridiculous position where
the Lord Great Chamberlain and the Earl Marshal would remain the Lord
Great Chamberlain and the Earl Marshal but would not be Members of
their lordships’ House. That would inadvertently and
specifically contradict one of the aims of the House of Lords Reform
Act 1999, which took away hereditary peers, namely that of keeping 90
plus two. The two were specifically kept because of their hereditary
constitutional role and it was felt suitable that they should remain in
the House of Lords. I would be sorry to see something that Parliament
deliberately decided when reforming the House of Lords in the late
1990s being accidentally removed, because if the Earl Marshal decides
to retire from his public duties when he becomes an elderly
man—which in due course of time he undoubtedly will—he
will not be able to retire as Earl

of Lords were not adorned in this way. As I said earlier, it is such a 
<?notus-xml column=529?>wonderful and elegant Chamber, but to remain wonderful and elegant it
needs to have these fantastic, historic posts. The Earl Marshal is
such an important figure in our history. His
predecessors were present at so many of the great battles in which
Britain—or England, more accurately—fought. He is a

tell me whether it is still possible for a writ of acceleration to
promote the holder of a lower title to be eligible for election as an
hereditary peer. He will remember that the now Marquess of Salisbury
took his seat by writ of acceleration rather than by being given a life

that this is sensible from the point of view of widening and keeping
refreshed the pool from which the 90 can be elected. The right to sit
in the House of Lords and to be among those elected hereditaries should
pass along a clear and defined route, and if the top of the root is cut
off, its stalk should be allowed to flower. It might not flower,
because it might not be elected in one of the by-elections to the House

is one step up in the peerage and it is also hereditary rather than for
life. That would be a fine thing for families to have. It would also,
importantly, continue the tradition of creating hereditary peerages,
which I am in favour of, not because they can sit in the House of
Lords, but because if we want to allow people throughout society to
rise and advance themselves, the highest posts in the land should be
open to everybody. By freezing the hereditary peerage we create a
tighter class structure than when that peerage is open. Instead of
saying, “Unless you got your title before the last ones were
given in 1983, you can only have a life peerage”, we could say
that a grocer’s daughter who became Prime Minister, for example,
could become an earl, or a countess in the case of that

would be wonderful to allow that degree of social mobility. If social
mobility is a good thing—I think most Members in this House
think it is—people should be able to rise to the top. A viscount
is not quite the top, but it is jolly near the top. It would give a
real incentive to peers, particularly those with a sense of history and
an interest in their family line. Most peers are likely to be in that
category. If the amendment was agreed, it would be fascinating to see
whether, on balance, socialist peers or Conservative peers were keenest
to get an hereditary peerage by stepping aside. One might be quite
surprised by how many die-hard socialists suddenly wanted to improve

than something that somebody can enter lightly. I accept that people
will ask, “What if somebody falls ill and cannot carry out their
duties?” If somebody falls ill, they can leave the House of
Lords in other ways—by not turning up, which we will come to in
a later set of amendments, or they can get a leave of absence from
their lordships’ House until they are better. If we always take

better, but I still disagree. For the reasons that he has given, I

who decides to retire or resign may not subsequently be reappointed to
the House of Lords. We did that for the very reasons that he has given.
Sitting in the House of Lords is a lifetime commitment and it should
not be the norm to leave. One should not leave with the expectation
that one may simply waltz back in later. When a Member decides to
submit a notice stating that they wish to leave, it would not be
helpful if they could think, “I can always change my mind before

a year. I am confident that if that situation arose, the Government, in

effective measures to ensure that the functions of the officer were
executed properly while they were in custody. I do not believe that
Members of the House of Lords should be able to retain their seats if

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T10:26:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Warwickshire said that he would expect a witness
to be a doctor or a solicitor. I submit that unless the Bill states
that a specific qualification is expected of a witness, a court will
not impose such a restriction. A court might expect a witness to be an
adult, although even that is debatable, but it would place no other
special requirement on who could or should be a
witness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000152">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T10:28:02"></hs_TimeCode>
think that, as a minimum, the witness should know the peer in question.
The great advantage of amendment 4 is that, by specifying
that the notice must be witnessed by two other peers, one could
reasonably expect that they would know the peer who has signed the
document. The reason we specify in legislation that a document must be
witnessed is so that, if the document is questioned, a court can be
reassured that the person who signed it did so of their own free will
and was of sound mind. A witness could give evidence as to the
person’s state of mind when they signed the
document<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T10:28:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000153">As
the Bill is drafted, the peer could get anyone they wanted to witness
the document. The problem with witnesses is that, when a document is
called into question, it is very often because there is some doubt
about the intention of the person who signed it. Usually that is
because there has been foul play and somebody has put forward a
document that is not what it purports to be. In such a case, if there
is a squiggle from the witness, how can the person who made that
squiggle of a signature be called to give

there is a purpose, must be to give evidence to a court as to the
identity of the person who executed the document, and about their state
of mind and their position when they signed it. I accept that it may be
the will of the House that such evidence can be given properly by
someone without their having a special qualification. However, given

incompetence so that they require another witness to witness the

regress, with further witnesses being necessary in case the reliability
of the earlier witnesses is not sufficiently established. It would be

6 would ensure that, once a resignation has taken effect, it cannot be
rescinded, the implication being that circumstances might
change—as my hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset
pointed out—and the peer might want to change his mind about
resignation. While I have great sympathy for the thought behind the
amendment, it raises a difficult and troublesome possibility. It would
introduce the threat of resignation. It would be possible for a peer in
dispute with, say, the Government of the day or the leadership of the
House of Lords, to postdate a resignation in the knowledge 
<?notus-xml column=538?>that they had the ability to withdraw it at any point. It is always a
good principle in life, whether in this House or beyond, that if
someone threatens to resign, they should have in mind carrying out that

consequence of following it through could introduce a degree of
brinksmanship into proceedings that I know my hon. Friend in particular

of Lords. The Earl Marshal is the eighth great officer of state and is
responsible for several ceremonial duties, including the organisation
of coronations, state funerals and the state opening of Parliament. The
importance of those duties is such that the Government do not believe
that either officeholder requires a seat in the House of Lords in order
to discharge them, for the very good reason that my hon. Friend the
Member for North East Somerset mentioned—they are not, as
individuals, immune from prosecution at the moment. It is almost
impossible to contemplate the eventuality, but it is possible in theory

serious criminal offence. The points that my hon. Friend the Member for
North Warwickshire made in response to that capture the essence of the

status of a viscount is also contained in the amendments. I have some
difficulty with the amendments, as I am sure my hon. Friend would
imagine. The name of our venerable upper chamber is the House of Lords,

ingenious argument for social mobility. He has anticipated the
objection that the ratcheting up to the level of royal dukedoms might
cause a problem for Her Majesty. In any event, I should have thought
that before embarking on such an approach, one would need to be assured

me begin by saying something about my amendment 1. The
origin of the requirement—in this place, and, indeed, in the
United Kingdom’s other Parliaments and Assemblies—for
someone to have been given a jail sentence of more than a year to be
disqualified is almost accidental. The hon. Member for North East
Somerset will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that until the
1960s there were two classes of criminal acts, felonies and
misdemeanours. I think that it was Roy Jenkins who, as Home Secretary,
abolished the distinction. Until then, someone who was convicted of a
felony would automatically be disqualified from serving in the House of
Commons. Thankfully, it had been a long time since any Member had been
sent to prison, so the rule had fallen into desuetude, and, at the time
when the classes of felony and misdemeanour were scrapped, it did not
occur to anyone to introduce a provision for that
purpose.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000197">Let
us now fast-forward to 1981, and the election of Bobby Sands as a
member of Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland. His election understandably
prompted a great deal of public outrage, and the Government of day, Mrs
Thatcher’s Government, introduced a law providing for the
disqualification of anyone who had been given a sentence of more than a
year. That would have caught Bobby Sands, and the other terrorists who
were on hunger strike in the Maze prison. Again, no one really thought
about it at the time. As far as I can ascertain after having consulted
the records from the period, there was not a great deal of
consideration about whether a year and a day was a particularly
suitable target. The provision was designed to capture a very specific
group of people; it met that test, and it was therefore
passed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000198">As
I think all Members know, there is a long and noble tradition of the
right to protest, and, in particular, to engage in political protest.
Anyone who visits the Tea Room will see a painting hanging at the
Labour end of the room. If Government Members wish to pop down to our
end to have a look at it, they are more than welcome to do so. It
depicts one of the great protesters and pamphleteers of the 18th
century, who was regularly incarcerated for speaking out against the
Government. It is an important principle that we should maintain the
right to speak against the Government, and that there should be
protections against politically motivated arrests and imprisonments. We
would not want someone who was simply sent to jail to be disqualified.

in the House of Commons. The voters in Brighton, Pavilion should have
the chance to do that in 14 months’

statutory or other disqualifications following conviction. If a peer

agree that criminal justice systems in different countries vary, and of
course other jurisdictions sometimes try people in very different
circumstances from those in which they would be tried in the United
Kingdom. In addition, some countries impose lengthy sentences on

real problem with the exclusion of peers for criminal offences is that,
in 1948, they gave up the right to try themselves for felonies. That
had been an ancient, historic right that they had used from time to
time; we perhaps know it best from “Kind Hearts and
Coronets”. The last case, in 1935, involved Lord de Clifford,
who was found guilty of manslaughter following a motoring accident.
Their lordships judged him not to have been guilty, on the ground that
the other driver had been going too fast.</hs_Para>

previous case, in 1901, involved Earl Russell, who was found guilty of

because he had got divorced in Nevada, and their lordships did not
think that Nevada was a proper place in which to get a divorce. They
decided that it was not valid, and that he was therefore a bigamist.
That leads me to my suggestion that we do not always take the views of
foreign courts into account, and that they do not necessarily have
standing in the United Kingdom. Poor old Earl Russell was known to his
contemporaries as the wicked Earl. I am allowed to say that, Mr Deputy

Nevada was not taken seriously and Earl Russell was found guilty of

variety of foreign countries, and with good reason. The reason for
including Ireland along with the United Kingdom is that it matches the
form used for exclusion from the House of Commons, and there seems to
be a logic in maintaining that. It is also set down in statute that we
recognise the unique relationship that the United Kingdom continues to
have with Ireland. Irish citizens are the only ones other than
Commonwealth citizens who are always allowed to vote in United Kingdom
elections, and travel from the Republic of Ireland to the United

and he himself said in his own speech that it would be peculiar if we
did not trust the judicial system of Canada. I happen to share that
view; there is no particular difficulty with Canadian justice. When we
come to some of the smaller Commonwealth realms, they have appeal to
the Privy Council and that is the safeguard—that it becomes
essentially a British form of justice. In the end, a peer would be able
to appeal to a court based in this country. It is actually based in the
Middlesex Guildhall; if you have a good arm, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a

the Commonwealth realms, it is reasonable that the House of Lords
should be able to recognise a conviction in one of them and it would
then be able, by an ordinary vote, to expel the peer from the Lords.
That seems a perfectly reasonable approach, because one can have
confidence in the justice that would be meted out in those realms. In
relation to other Commonwealth countries, expulsion would require the
unanimous agreement of the House of Lords. That is because there are
certainly Commonwealth countries where one would have some concern
about the standard of justice that applied and would worry that having
an automatic acceptance, or even a simple majority acceptance, of their
judgments would not necessarily be helpful.</hs_Para>

the United States of America, the noble Lord Black was basically told
that he could either plead guilty or face decades in prison if he was
found guilty. There was a charge sheet against him as long as your arm,
and there was a witness to give evidence against him. The witness was
told, “If you plead guilty and turn the equivalent of
Queen’s evidence, then we will give you a few weeks in a country
club.” That approach to plea bargaining ought to raise serious
concerns. In this country, it would not be allowed. There is not the
possibility to say to somebody giving evidence, “We will give
you something very cosy if you help us to find somebody guilty”,
and guilty not just of an offence but a whole string of offences with
huge sentences, and all in proportion to what was being alleged, so
that people are bullied into pleading guilty. The reason that America
does that is that it has so many constitutional safeguards to provide
for a fair trial that it is consequently very difficult to get
convictions. Plea bargaining is therefore used as a means of getting
the result that was sought in the first place, but which the

should protect our own constitutional rights zealously. We should not
allow other places to interfere in how we run our business. The right
way to go about it is set out in amendment 23, which achieves what I
was aiming to achieve and is pithier. It does not give any special
status to the Commonwealth realms, which I was giving not particularly
out of a sentimental attachment to them, but more because of the
ability to appeal to the Privy Council and the safeguards that builds
in. It ought to be the right of the House of Lords to expel
people—this House has that right and it is unfortunate that the
House of Lords does not. It would be a good power for it to have as
part of regulating its own affairs. It has the power to imprison peers
but it does not have the power to expel them. However, it should use
that expulsion power only if it wants to do so; it should not be forced
to do it because a foreign court has told it that it has to.</hs_Para>

which we have the friendliest relations. However, we do not
understand—we are not party to—their legal systems. A
British person accused in a foreign country is often at a disadvantage
to a national accused in that country because they are not in sympathy
with the systems that will be used against them. Therefore, having this
protection whereby it must be an active decision of the Lords to expel
somebody convicted in a foreign country will protect the peer arrested
in Kiribati for waving a flag or in Uganda for being homosexual or in
Singapore for using the internet unlawfully. It is absolutely right
that a judgment can be made as to whether in our terms, under our law
and under our rules a peer has done something so serious and manifestly

Tragically, similar laws have recently been in passed in another

legal systems of other countries is not sufficient and not proper in
determining our own constitutional arrangements. As he says, even in

cases. So he was absolutely right to

the promoter of the Bill has responded with amendment 23, which

people from all sides of this House and also of some in the other

disparity between the 12-month limit here and a lower six-month limit
in the other place because Members in this place are subject to
re-election. That argument interests me and it is food for thought as

immediate recollection is that even where Members of Parliament have
been convicted of serious offences and sentenced for a period of less
than 12 months they do, generally speaking, resign. That has certainly
been the case in relation to recent issues that arose from the expenses
scandal. The only case I can think of in recent history where MPs did
resume their seats—I stand to be corrected on this by Members
from either side of the House—was where they were briefly sent
to prison for not paying the poll tax. I cannot think of any other
recent cases where a Member of Parliament has been imprisoned for a
period of less than 12 months and resumed their seat having come out of
prison. There is a case for us to examine the matter, but I do not
think that this Bill is the right vehicle for us to do so. I therefore

of Members of the House of Lords going from the Lords to the Commons.
As the Bill was initially drafted and as we debated it on Second
Reading, it would have been possible to have a revolving door or
ping-pong back and forth, depending which phrase is preferred. It would
have been possible for someone to 
<?notus-xml column=556?>leave the Commons, go to the Lords, leave the Lords, come back to the
Commons and go back to the Lords again. I am glad to say that that was
amended in Committee, which has at least to some degree ameliorated the
situation. But there is a problem with the House of Lords being changed
into a place that can be used as a way of preparing people for
political life before bringing them to the Commons. As more and more
professional politicians come through—I know this is a matter of
concern to the electorate—people can have the following career
path: becoming special advisers, going to the Lords and then coming to
the Commons, without any real pause in-between. As the Bill stands, it
would be possible to resign a seat in the Lords immediately before the
close of nominations for the House of Commons at a general

is indeed a precedent, which I was well aware of, and it is not just
the late Lord Home of the Hirsel; Lord Hailsham did exactly the same.
Both of them resigned their peerage for the 1963 Conservative
leadership contest, at which point Tory leaders emerged from the magic
circle—a very satisfactory way of doing it, but it now done in a
more modern way, and I am glad to say that all Conservative Members
have an equal vote in our leadership elections. I cannot quite remember
how the trade unions sort it out in the Labour party, but I know that
they have a lot of fun with it.</hs_Para>

is indeed a precedent, but the hon. Gentleman will remember that when
the ability to disclaim peerages was introduced, a limited time was
provided when all peers could disclaim their peerage, regardless of
when they had received it. Thereafter, peers who disclaimed their
peerage had a limited time in which to do so after inheriting their
peerage. It was all done so that Tony Benn, the then Viscount
Stansgate, could get back into the House of Commons to be elected for
Bristol. That was done to provide for an extraordinary circumstance
where people had no choice but to be peers. They had become peers by
the wonderful accident of birth that had raised them to such a status,
which took them into the House of Lords and forced them to leave the
House of Commons, whereas the precedent had already been set in
relation to Lord Curzon and George V that the Prime Minister had to
come from the House of Commons. Therefore, to allow the widest choice
of candidates for that leadership election, peers were able to resign
their peerages and come into the Commons. However, people becoming
leaders of the party in that way is very different from it becoming a
standard part of the career progression of a politician to go to the
Lords first and then come to the Commons. The first should not be seen

between these two Houses, where the role, the position, the place of
activity are so very similar. It is perfectly reasonable to foresee
someone who has just lost a seat spending five years as a Lord
preparing to campaign for it again. As it becomes clearer, and parties
are well aware of this, that to win seats we have all modelled
ourselves on the Liberal Democrats—I say that with not a single
one present in the House now. We have worked out that to win marginal

return to my point, it has been established that the best way to win
marginal seats is to select candidates early and have them working in
the constituencies for a long time in the run-up to a general election.
That presents difficulties, however, because candidates have to earn a
living, need to find the resources to finance their campaign and have
to put other parts of their life on hold. If they can do that from the
House of Lords, that is an enormous advantage. It gives them an income
of sorts and it gives them status, which they can use to intervene in
constituency affairs—a local council or Government body will
take a letter from a peer just as seriously as a letter from a Member
of the House of Commons. There is the risk of setting up an MP and an
unelected peer to fight for a constituency for five years, with the
peer simply standing down before the election to put himself forward
and conceivably take the seat 
<?notus-xml column=558?>and go back to being a Member of the House of Commons. That seems to me
to be fundamentally undesirable.</hs_Para>

may say that the risk is slim and that that will never happen, but we
are becoming a more professional political class. There is certainly
evidence that length of campaigning in constituencies helps. There is
currently a very good proposal from “ConservativeHome” to
provide candidates with funds to help them with that. How much easier
it would be if there was a nice, cosy billet in the House of Lords from
which it could be done. Admittedly, that could not be done again,
because the peer would have burnt all his bridges in relation to
returning to the House of Lords, but that is not too bad, because they
would still have got 15 years out of the system: one Parliament as an
MP, one as a peer and, if they are clever, another as an MP. It begins
to look like a means of forming a political
career.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000309">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T11:57:14"></hs_TimeCode>
that system becomes a means of forming a political career, it also
becomes—I return to what I said earlier—a means of the
parties asserting more control over their lordships’ House. A
key thing about being in their lordships’ House is that there
really are no further baubles the Government can offer. There are very
few carrots and no sticks. That encourages independence of mind. It
encourages peers, once they get there, to be more rigorous in
considering the merits of the issues before them and to act in the
proper way of a revising Chamber. The more possible it is for
Governments to encourage, coerce and persuade peers to stick tightly to
the party line, the less use their lordships’ House will serve,
because it will be unable to do its job as a revising Chamber
effectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000310">Even<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:00:11"></hs_TimeCode>
if the risk is relatively slim and the numbers involved will not
necessarily be huge, it seems to me that some sort of stop ought to be
placed on that and that people go to the Lords knowing that they have
accepted it for life, as we have already discussed, and that it disbars
them from the House of Commons. It seems perfectly reasonable to me
that people should face the consequences of decisions they have freely
made. That is where it is different from hereditary peers and
disclaiming, because a hereditary peerage is not a decision freely
made; it is an accident of birth. However, any life peer has received a
letter from the Prime Minister saying, “Do you want to be a life
peer?”, has had letters patent issued by the sovereign and has
had to pay Garter King of Arms to draw up the paperwork. They have had
to do something to get that noble status. They know, because they have
been told, that it excludes them from the House of Commons, by their
voluntary choice.</hs_Para>

ridiculous understanding of human rights. I know that it has been
argued that it is against their human rights to stop them coming back

ineligible for the House of Commons. Surely with rights go

think that the failure to include that exclusion in the Bill is a
mistake. It is something that ought to be remedied, because it could
lead to problems in future.  It could damage the standing of
the House of Lords. It could easily be misused by a powerful political
party, because obviously the party in government is more able to decide
who the working peers will be, and therefore 
<?notus-xml column=559?>to use it for its marginal seats, to the detriment of opposition
parties. No party is in government for ever, so it
is always worth all sides bearing those difficulties in mind. It also
fundamentally takes away from someone the consequences of their
actions, which I think is wrong. I think that people should bear those
consequences, and once they have been elevated they should not be
allowed to sink back down, at least for a
period.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_28_PT_1/F702270202234FF0C7D73853808F63DB49B88392" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 February 2014">Friday

I said earlier, we already have a system whereby Members of the House
of Lords can serve simultaneously in both the Lords and the Scottish
Parliament. Lord Steel served ably for four years not just as a Member
of the Scottish Parliament, but as its Presiding Officer while serving
in and on occasion, I think, attending the House of Lords. Lord Watson,
who was previously an MP, took a life peerage in 1997 and then stood
successfully for election to the Scottish Parliament in a constituency
in Glasgow in 1999. Lord Foulkes of Cumnock went from the House of
Commons to the House of Lords and the Scottish Parliament and
maintained his very active role in both the House of Lords and the
Scottish Parliament at the same

is no suggestion in any of those cases that being a Member of the House

respected for his 30-odd years’ service to the people of the
Borders. That was why  Lord Steel was successful when he stood

right to mention Lord Hailsham and the issue with Alec Douglas-Home. I
read Alan Clark’s diaries a few months ago, as I am sure the

Thatcher was considering the merits of Lord Young as a possible
successor. It is utterly inconceivable in the 21st century, never mind
the 20th century, for a peer to become Prime Minister. That would be
unacceptable  to the electorate, and possibly even

danger with the argument that the hon. Gentleman makes with some
sincerity is that it would close down the possibility that someone may
go into the House of Lords and then emerge as a serious contender for
high office, though perhaps not the highest office, but if they wished
to be Foreign Secretary or Chancellor of the Exchequer, for example, it
might be felt more appropriate for them to be a Member of this House.
We have a slightly quirky situation at present, and that was true also
under the Labour Government when the First Secretary of State was a
Member of the House of Lords and a junior Minister had to answer in
this House. Personally, I hope we will look at that again. Putting in

resigns or is disqualified through non-attendance from being elected to
the House of Commons during the course of the next two Parliaments,
thereby making provision for a cooling-off period. I think we all agree
that would not want the House of Lords to become a training ground for
a seat in the House of Commons and thereafter provide an opportunity to
ping-pong between the Houses. As my hon. Friend the Member for North
East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) said,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:06:15"></hs_TimeCode> Bill does not
allow departing peers to return to the House of Lords, so the ponging

am conscious of my hon. Friend’s concerns, but the likelihood of
many of them becoming reality are quite slim. On the first group of
amendments, he spoke with great eloquence about how desperate many
people are to get into the House of Lords. In my experience and, I
think, that of most people in the House, people are very keen to go in
that direction but there is not necessarily quite such a large queue
waiting to come in this direction. When I have discussed this with
colleagues, they have looked at me and said, “Why on earth would
somebody want to go from the Lords to the Commons? Most of our
colleagues seem to be trying to go the other
way.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000323" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000323">On

impose a favoured candidate on a safe seat, the fact that they are

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:07:39"></hs_TimeCode>needs to be

when he says that someone will have made this decision when they chose

them, “You, as a British citizen, are one of a small group of
people who, through dint of your previous job, are not permitted to
seek election to the House  of Commons.” We have

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:10:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) has raised a serious issue
and I have given it a lot of thought. It has been pointed out to me by
experts on this matter outside the House that previous proposals for
reform of the other place have included some sort of cooling-off period
and that it should, therefore, be considered as part of the

the hon. Gentleman moved his earlier amendments, he discussed the risk
of this becoming a standard part of career progression, which is a fair
point. However, we also have to balance that risk with the arguments
made by other hon. Members during this debate. The decisive argument
that leads me not to support the amendments is that made just now
by  the promoter of the Bill,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:11:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

the basis of their previous
occupation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0001.htm#14022871000330">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:14:41"></hs_TimeCode>

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>of the system
being abused. On the other hand, there could be some advantage to
people who have experience of the other place standing for this place.
I think it is fair to say that, whatever our different views about the
composition of the other place and the method of appointment and lack
of election to it, it is often better than we are at the scrutiny and
of Bills. If a small number of people with experience of scrutiny and
revision in the other place came to this place, that might not be

gather those measures of reform that command the greatest possible
consensus. This is not the last word on House of Lords reform and some
of the principles that even this short debate has thrown up are very
serious and have consequence, such as whether it is right to restrict
someone who is not a Member of Parliament from standing for Parliament.

carefully and to happen in the context of other debates that will no

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:15:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North East Somerset was gracious enough to acknowledge,
the Bill is different from the one first introduced, so it cannot be

those covered in previous

When Lord Steel promoted his Bill in the other place, it made progress
and was accepted by their lordships, who were content for it to proceed
without what might be called the cooling-off period. I know that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:15:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Warwickshire has been influenced by, and has
consciously modelled his Bill on, proposals that have already attracted
a degree of support and consensus, following considerable scrutiny in

the Council, because to be fair to him—my right hon.
Friend!—having not been able to get through a massive reform of
the House of Lords that would have had enormous constitutional
implications, he has shown good grace in not sulking in his den and
trying to obstruct this reform. This Bill allows transitions to take
place which, although minor in themselves, are actually quite
fundamental. A life peerage is now no longer for life, the problem of
peers committing offences is dealt with at last—which in some
ways is long overdue—the House of Lords is now able to expel
peers, and non-attendance has a sanction. I think those reforms make
the upper House stronger. That is not to say that I do not have minor
qualms about some of the detail, but my hon. Friend the Member for
North Warwickshire has been incredibly successful in piloting the Bill,
and has done so in such a way that even those of us who are accused of
being Neanderthal about constitutional matters are on his

Twigg:</Member></B> I start by joining the congratulations to the hon.
Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) on his Bill and his success
in reaching Third Reading, and I reaffirm the Opposition’s
support for 
<?notus-xml column=566?>the Bill. In many ways, as he said, this is a housekeeping Bill: it is
modest, but important and sensible nevertheless. Without this Bill, we
face a real risk of heading towards an upper House with as many as
1,000 Members. That is more than can fit into the other place for a
popular debate—surely a farcical position to be
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000363" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000363">Clause
1 is a sensible step that allows peers to retire or resign. As the
shadow Attorney-General said on Second Reading, a peerage should not be
a life sentence. It remains remarkable that one cannot retire from the
House of Lords, and gives an impression of the other place as a
members’ club, rather than a serious place of democratic
scrutiny. The option of resignation will be useful in a number of
different scenarios, such as when a Lord is ill, as was said earlier,
or unable to keep up their attendance. To have peers who do not or
cannot play their role in the parliamentary process, but who
nevertheless remain entitled or expected to do so, surely devalues our
democratic process, and I am pleased that the Bill will change
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000364">Clause
2 provides that a Member of the House of Lords who is a peer and does
not attend the House during a Session will cease to be a Member of the
House at the beginning of the following Session. The public are
understandably frustrated when they wonder why Members of the Lords
remain ennobled and able to vote in the Lords when they are never
present to undertake that role. The measures in the Bill ensure that
that will no longer be the case. To be a member of the House of Lords
should not merely be a line on one’s CV or a hobby, but a
serious role that requires
attendance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000365" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000365">Clause
3 means that a Member of the Lords who is convicted of a serious
offence ceases to be a Member. Again, that is a sensible measure to
ensure that we protect the legitimacy of the other place. The public
would be very concerned if convicted criminals, guilty of serious
offences, were still able to play an active part in our lawmaking and
democratic process, and I am pleased that the hon. Member for North
Warwickshire was successful in his amendment to clause 3 which,
rightly, offers further protections for peers who may be incorrectly
convicted abroad under foreign jurisdictions.</hs_Para>

it remains the view on the Labour Benches that these changes do not go
far enough. They should not be seen as the end of the road, but merely
as the next stage of reform. The upper Chamber is in need of much more
radical reform and indeed this Chamber has voted for that both in this
Parliament and the previous one. There are only two countries in the
world—the other being Lesotho—in which the upper House
combines non-elected Members with Members selected by birthright and
patronage. It is an institution that has eight times as many Members
over the age of 90 as it does under the age of 40, but it plays a
central role in our democracy—despite having no democratic
mandate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000367" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000367">Beyond
democratic legitimacy, there are practical considerations. The Bill
will help to tidy up the Lords, and is therefore welcome, but the
problem will keep coming back. After each general election, new
Governments will always seek to reflect the balance of the vote at the
election in the composition of the Lords, creating a further pressure
that means we still risk having 1,000 Members in the other place.
Disqualifying convicted criminals and allowing peers to resign is
tidying up a molehill when there is a mountain of reform still needed.
Nevertheless, the Bill is an important step in the right 
<?notus-xml column=567?>direction and I reaffirm our congratulations to the hon. Member for
North Warwickshire and commend the Bill to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14022871000656" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000656">12.32

it is subject to the will of the House—piloted his Bill through
its stages. I commend him on his bravery in taking forward—as my
hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)
said—an important constitutional Bill as a private
Member’s Bill. It is a brave Member of Parliament who, when he
comes high up in the ballot for private Members’ Bills, chooses
House of Lords reform. It is not the most obvious choice, but my hon.
Friend the Member for North Warwickshire made it and has piloted his
Bill in an exemplary manner.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend’s achievement is to have worked tirelessly to
consult and listen to respected voices, many of whom have spoken in the
debate today, so that both the formulation of his propositions, and the
amendments to them, have been able to establish a degree of support on
both sides of the House. I hope that that will also be the case in the
House of
Lords.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000370" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000370">I
also wish to put on record my thanks to the Members who participated in
Committee on 15 January, considering a large number of amendments that
were made without any Divisions. The Bill is not the last word on
reform, and there will doubtless be more debate to come. I echo the
words of other hon. Members in paying tribute to the officials and the
Clerks who guided my hon. Friend in the drafting of the Bill and
dealing with some of the questions that arose. It is a tribute to their
wisdom and advice that we have been able to make the progress that we
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000371" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000371">I
hope that the other place will accept the strong and positive
endorsement of the House for the Bill. While discussions on the wider
membership and structure of the Lords will continue, the Bill is
useful. The three elements that it will introduce—a statutory
resignation process, a disqualification mechanism on conviction of a
serious offence and removal for those who persistently fail to attend
the House without reasonable excuse or leave of absence—are
steps in the right direction. It is  
<?notus-xml column=568?>right that a conscientious peer who has played a full and active role in
the House of Lords, but feels in all conscience that they can no longer
maintain that level of commitment, should be entitled to an honourable
release from that commitment. The Bill, very sensibly, will provide for
that.</hs_Para>

also think it consistent with the enormous privilege that comes with a
peerage—to which my hon. Friend the Member for North East
Somerset has repeatedly drawn attention—to provide for those who
do not attend the House of Lords or take their duty to it seriously to
be permanently removed from their seats. I think that allowing
persistent non-attenders who do not play a role in the work of the
House to keep their seats damages the reputation of those who are
diligent, and who contribute their time, effort, energy and learning to
the debates that take place
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000373">It
is vital for all Members of the legislature to uphold the highest
standards of integrity. Allowing peers who commit serious criminal
offences to keep their seats in the House of Lords can only harm its
reputation and undermine its important work, and it is right for
Members who fall foul of the rules to be permanently removed. Indeed,
our colleagues on the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee who
considered the Bill noted that every witness who had given evidence
during its inquiry into House of Lords reform had supported a provision
to remove Members who committed serious criminal
offences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000374">For
those reasons, the Government fully support the important and
reasonable measures that the Bill seeks to implement. We are grateful
to my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire for giving the
House an opportunity to consider them, and for the way in which he
allowed the debate to be conducted. Following careful and detailed
consideration, not just today but in Committee and on Second Reading,
the House of Commons has given the Bill full and good consideration,
and I think that we are sending it to the House of Lords in a good
state. I hope that it will be possible to build  on the work of
Lord Steel—who, similarly, took great pains to ensure that his
own Bill received a degree of scrutiny and support—and that the
union between that heritage and my hon. Friend’s Bill will
enable it to make good progress in the other place. I commend it to the

of closed-circuit television in fighting crime. My hon. Friend is

question him on briefly. One of the reasons this Bill is seen as
particularly sensitive is that the two groups he has referred to are
very separate. One may be out to break the law—they may be
covering their face because they intend to break the law and not be
seen—while the others are law abiding and are covering their
face because of their religion. It is that conflict between those two

am triply blessed today, given that he too is in his place and
contributing to the debate. He is without parallel in his scrutiny of
private Members’ legislation, which is to the advantage of us
all. I want to make it clear from the outset that I know that there are
strong views on both sides of this argument. There are strong merits
and strong demerits to the Bill. I said earlier that, in many respects,
I was sorry that it has come to needing legislation. The problem is
that law-abiding citizens who cover their face for supposedly religious
reasons are, by their actions, alienating so many of our other citizens
in this country. It causes alarm and distress to many of our citizens
who are not part of those religious groups to see Britain’s high
streets being increasingly dominated by, especially, Islamic women who
are covering their faces in full. I would be doing my constituents a

undertaking normal everyday human interaction with people who are not

and I have had communications from deaf people who have raised it. They
tell me how frustrated they feel whenever they are faced with a woman
wearing a full-face veil, because they are simply unable to
communicate, unless in a written form. That must be extremely difficult
for deaf people and it is a real concern. It must be extremely
difficult for veiled women who are deaf to engage with other veiled

I go to my local Salvation Army. I am very much from a Christian
background, but I have huge respect for people of faith, whatever their
faith might be, and that includes Islam. Of course, I am not an Islamic
scholar, but I have researched the matter in some depth and nowhere at
all, anywhere in the world, can I find any proscription that women are
required by Islam to cover their face. As I understand it, the Koran,
the holy book to Muslims, requires women to dress modestly, and the
vast majority of Muslim women in this country adhere to that without
covering their
faces<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:58:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Hollobone:</Member></B> I am most grateful for that reference. My Bill
has absolutely no impact on the hijab or on any kind of Islamic
headdress that does not cover the face, but it would proscribe the
niqab and the burqa. Some people have been jumping up and down saying,
“Philip Hollobone’s Bill is going to ban Muslim
head-dresses”, but that is absolutely not the case. In lots of
Christian
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T12:58:10"></hs_TimeCode> around
the world, although not so much in this country nowadays, women have
worn head-dresses as a sign of modest dress. Nuns wear head-dresses,
and in this country in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, although perhaps not
so much in the 1970s, people often wore head scarves when out and
about. So the concept of a head-dress is not alien to the British way
of life, but covering one’s face in public is absolutely alien
to it. That is why it is more than just an issue of dress; it is about
concealing one’s identity.</hs_Para>

does not mention Islamic veils or balaclavas. The proscription applies
to somebody covering their face in a public place. Of course, it is
part of the natural way of things that when we go about our daily
lives, we interact with our fellow human beings because we can see
their face. Imagine how difficult it would be in this Chamber were

the moment, a motorcyclist, male or female, pulling up at a petrol
station to fill up and then going to pay is required to remove their
helmet for security reasons. The owner of the petrol station does not
want someone coming into their premises whose identity they cannot
check or record on CCTV. They might even recognise them, or they might
be able to identify them to the police if a theft were to take place.
But somebody going to buy petrol wearing a burqa causes problems,
because the owner of the petrol station will be unsure whether they can
require that person to remove their head-dress. The person wearing the
full-face veil might have already filled up their car or motorbike, but
what will happen if the owner of the petrol station is unhappy about
whether they are legitimate and does not know whether they can require
them to remove their veil? If the person wearing the veil refuses to
remove it, what does the owner of the petrol station do? My Bill would
remove that ambiguity. It would be an absolute requirement that if,
say, someone in a petrol station, a shop, a post office or a bank,
wanted someone to remove their full-face veil, balaclava or motorcycle
helmet, they could do so without fear of breaking any race relations or
equality law. In many respects, as my hon. Friend the Member for

cul-de-sacs that the debate can go into is in saying that this is a
debate between the west and Islam. Of course it is nothing of the sort.
The right hon. Gentleman will know probably better than I that there
are restrictions in Islamic countries on wearing the veil. The veil is
an issue not just in the west but in Muslim countries. In Turkey,
Tunisia, Syria and quite a large number of other Muslim countries,
there are restrictions on where one can and cannot wear the veil. The

think that most of my constituents, and most people in the country,
would say that in court someone’s face should be visible all the
time. I know that there are circumstances, sometimes involving
vulnerable witnesses, in which evidence is given from behind a screen
or via a TV link, and I understand those issues. However, in cases that
do not involve those special circumstances, I think that most people
would think it entirely reasonable for everyone in the court to be able
to see everyone else’s face at all times, because so much of the
evidence and court proceedings is about reading somebody’s face,
seeing their reaction to a point someone else makes and listening to
their own evidence. I hope that whoever in legal circles is drawing up
the guidance gets on with it, frankly. My submission is that in all
circumstances, unless especially vulnerable witnesses or child
witnesses 
<?notus-xml column=577?>need to give evidence by TV link or from behind a screen, everyone
should be able to see everyone else’s face at

other case concerns schools. Again, I think that most people in this
country would say it is entirely wrong for a teacher to be able to
teach a class while wearing a full-face veil. The Government have been
reluctant to spell that out in black and white, which I think they
should do. Likewise, I think that it is abhorrent that in some schools,
as I understand has happened in a number of cases, the uniform code
requires really very young girls to wear full-face veils. I think that
is entirely inappropriate. I would therefore welcome a clear direction
from Her Majesty’s Government, perhaps to be given by the
Minister on the Floor of the House today, that it is completely
unacceptable for either teachers or pupils to wear full-face veils in

police officers are covering their faces, it is for health and safety
reasons. Where they are dealing with a terrorist incident and there is
a likelihood that weapons could be deployed or explosives could go off,
often a balaclava is required as a protective device for the police
officer’s face. Everybody understands that. What would be
completely unacceptable would be for ordinary beat
officers—ordinary police officers whom the right hon. Gentleman,
I and other Members see every day of the week—to wear full-face

parallel between balaclava-wearing and the wearing of full-face veils
first struck me when I took my children to a local park. I was sitting
in the children’s playground watching my children playing, and
this Muslim woman wearing a full-face veil came across the playground
with her children and her husband, I suppose, as well. I thought to
myself, here I am, sitting in a children’s 
<?notus-xml column=578?>playground in the Kettering constituency in the middle of England, and
here is a woman who does not want anyone else to look at her.
I thought to myself that at a very basic level,
this is discourtesy. Why would anyone want to hide their identity from
everyone else?</hs_Para>

thought, “Well, maybe it is a religious requirement.”
Then I found out that it is not a religious requirement for a woman to
cover her face, and I wondered how I would feel if, instead of the
woman covering her face, it was her husband next to her who was wearing
a full-face balaclava? How would that make me feel? Of course it would
make me feel very concerned indeed about why a man was walking across a
children’s playground wearing a balaclava. I asked myself what I
would do about it? I would tell somebody in the park security
department that there was a man wandering about wearing a full-face
balaclava in a children’s

but unfortunately it did not relate to my question. I asked a much more
specific question, and I got the impression that, uncharacteristically,
he was trying to dodge it. My question was: where anybody else would be
expected to remove their particular face covering—for example, a
balaclava at a petrol station, in a bank or at passport
control—does he expect people 
<?notus-xml column=582?>with an Islamic face covering to be subject to exactly the same
requirement? It is not a question of whether they accept or refuse to
do something, but whether they should be required to do the same thing
as others. Some people pussyfoot around that issue for politically
correct reasons. It would be very helpful if he made it clear that he
expects the same from people with Islamic veil coverings as from those
with
balaclavas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T13:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000462"><B><Member ContinuationText="Keith Vaz" PimsId="4426" UID="14022871000877" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000877">Keith

If there has been an example of a security breach and something needs
to be fixed, we certainly need to consider that and to undertake proper
consultation. I do not, however, know an example of that, apart from
Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed wearing a burqa. I am sorry if the hon.
Gentleman is not satisfied with that answer, but I do not believe that
we should sit here passing laws just for the sheer hell of it, or
because someone comes up to us in Kettering high street saying that
they do not like a woman in a burqa whom they met in a playgroup and we
therefore decide we must change the law of the land. Frankly, I think
that we need to be very careful about these issues. If there are

the trouble of asking a couple of Islamic scholars this morning about
the authority for Muslim women dressing in the way that they choose to
dress. The Koran instructs both Muslim men and women to dress in a
modest way. The clearest verse on the requirement for the hijab is in
chapter 24, verses 30 to 31, which ask women to draw their
khimar over their bosoms. Two other verses in the Koran concern
women’s dress. Verse 31 of the Surah an-Nur contains two
commands that particularly relate to women’s dress. The first is
that women shall cover all of their beauty
except</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14022871000639" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000639">“what

men who are not related to them. The second is that women should extend
their head coverings to cover the rest of their body, should they
choose to do so. Verse 59 of the Surah al-Ahzab commands that women
shall wear long, loose outer garments when they go out from their
houses. These two verses, taken together, set out three parts of the
hijab or modest dress—the headscarf; modest clothes that
together with the headscarf cover everything but what has been
exempted; and, for outdoors, a modest outer garment to cover the
clothes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000491" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000491">The

come to listen to him, and we are on the same side on the question of a
European referendum—but I will not go into that as it is not
mentioned in the Bill. I am therefore astonished that he should want to
interfere in the issue of the clothing of Muslim women, and that he
feels—somehow—that the fact that a woman chooses to wear
a burqa undermines the multicultural nature of 
<?notus-xml column=586?>this country. What makes this country great is that we have people here

different languages and religions all come together in London, and

caused controversy, and I am worried about him, because he is normally
a very fair and balanced person. I will not go down the route of how
many doors that he has knocked on, Madam Deputy Speaker, because I do
not want to upset you again, but I think we shall find that, very
unusually, he has taken the views of only one section of his
constituency. I doubt that he spoke to a single member of the Muslim
community about the Bill before presenting it to the House, because if
he had done so, he would have been aware of the concerns that would be
raised in that
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000495" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000495">I
think that I dealt with the issue of security in response to a number
of points made by the hon. Gentleman and by the hon. Member for
Shipley. As for the position in the courts, when a judge has required a
person to remove a veil that person has, so far, done so. As the hon.
Gentleman said, the legal profession is concerned because some of the
stuff that goes on in court is not just about voice, and may be about
demeanour. I am not suggesting that it is somehow possible to look at
someone’s face and know immediately whether that person is
telling the truth. After all, the hon. Gentleman misjudged my face
earlier: he thought that I was making a funny face, but it was actually
my normal face.</hs_Para>

the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, but our current system
already covers it. In November last year, the Lord Chief Justice
initiated a consultation with the judiciary and the Bar to see what 
<?notus-xml column=587?>they thought about the issue. However, the hon. Gentleman has been
unable to cite any case from the tabloids, or from the internet
worldwide, in which someone has been asked to remove a face covering
and has refused to do so. The only security-related case that can be
cited is the one involving Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who put on a burqa
and left a mosque in Ealing. Ibrahim Magag did not put on a burqa when
he went out of his house and hailed a taxi in order to leave the
country. It is not as if that is happening every day; it is very
exceptional and very unusual. I therefore do not think that the
security issue should concern us in the context of the Bill.</hs_Para>

three more points. First, although this may not have been the hon.
Gentleman’s intention—he may have presented his Bill
because he wanted a wider debate on the issues, or because his
constituents were concerned—the Muslim community feel very
strongly that it discriminates against members of their faith. As I
have said, 20% of my constituents are members of the Muslim faith.
Although I am a Catholic, I represent people from different religions,
and if someone comes to me and says “This discriminates against
me as a Muslim”, I believe that person.</hs_Para>

there is the far more fundamental issue of the violation of a
woman’s right to choose what she wants to wear and where she
wants to wear it. Thirdly, there is the general point that we should be
extremely careful about intervening to tell our citizens what they
should wear in this country. There can be no end to that: we shall be
on the slippery slope. The hon. Gentleman does not like political
correctness—his whole political life has been opposed to
it—but he is paving the way for more legislation providing for
it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022871000499" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000499">I think that
if the hon. Gentleman reflects, he will realise that rather than
putting his Bill to the vote, he should withdraw it and engage in the
consultations in which he ought to be engaging in Kettering and
throughout the country. If members of the Kettering Muslim Association
will not talk to him, I shall invite him to come to Leicester and talk
to members of the Federation of Muslim Organisations there. They will
tell him exactly what they feel about the subject. I urge him—I
beg him—not to force the Bill to a vote. Let us accept that it
will not help us to retain the wonderful multicultural country in which
we
live.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_28_PT_1/E5EC348E14FDE3519816C998BF4BC073A08EA934" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 February 2014">Friday

with a matter which, while we may not like to admit it, is a concern
for many people, because it is unusual in this country.
Traditionally, of course, it has not been usual for
many believers in the Christian religion to cover the front of their
face, although, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T13:57:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Kettering said, it was traditional for Christians to
cover their heads in going about their everyday business.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T13:59:39"></hs_TimeCode> my early life
I attended a Christian church at which many of the women would cover
their heads; they made a special point of wearing a hat in church.
Conversely, men were expected to take their hats off. I should declare
an interest: I am a practising Christian and a church warden, and in
that role still to this day I have sometimes very gently and discreetly
had to ask gentlemen to remove their headgear when they enter church
wearing a hat, just because of the sensitivities particularly of some
of the older members of our
congregation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T13:58:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000503" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000503">I
am conscious of the fact that other Members have waited very patiently
and want to speak on this matter, so I will not use up all the time and
will instead try to allow sufficient time for others to speak, but I do
want to make two brief points. First, the difficulty with this whole
topic is that there are two groups that would be most affected by
introducing a general ban on face coverings. In the first of those
groups are those whose primary purpose, having committed or intending
to commit a crime, is to escape detection by covering their face. I
think we all agree that that is wrong, and it would be helpful if there

cutting of legislation and the peeling back of red tape that restricts

highly illiberal Bill ever made it to the statute book, we would see an
increase in the number of people with face coverings, not the decrease
that the hon. Gentleman seeks. In a fundamentally British tradition,
the introduction of such an illiberal law would encourage civil
disobedience and an affinity with those who were seen to be targeted by
the measure. In fact, I think that those completely unaffected by the
legislation would deliberately don facial coverings in demonstration
against this illiberal Act. I confess that when I was a student union
president—only a few years ago, obviously—I would have
led as many students as possible in demonstration against such an
iniquitous law. We would have donned veils, marched, and taken the
consequences.</hs_Para>

some professions and services—for those in hospitals and police
forces, or for firefighters, for example—dress codes are
prescribed, but that is a very different issue from restricting
personal freedom in public places. It is right that the police and
other law enforcement agencies have powers to ask individuals to remove
face coverings—for example, to remove balaclavas during riots.
As far as I am aware, however, this new law is not being called for by
the police, and to give the hon. Gentleman his due, he did not suggest
that.</hs_Para>

careful to exempt people obscuring their faces for any activity or

Bill is about singling out Muslim women, telling them how to dress, 
<?notus-xml column=590?>and threatening them with arrest if they do not comply. In spite of the
general wording of this Bill, it is clear that it is designed to target
Muslim women who wear the burqa or the niqab, both of which cover the
face, as a means of religious or cultural expression. It is important,
therefore, that we set this debate in context. According to the 2011
census, Muslims make up just 4.8% of the population of England and
Wales, and only a very small number of women in that 4.8% wear the full
face veil. In my constituency of West Ham—one of the most
ethnically diverse areas of the country, and home to a large Muslim
community from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Africa—there is
not a significant number, and this is not a significant issue.
Nationally, we are talking about a tiny minority of an already small
community.</hs_Para>

imprisoning in their own homes the very women he claims he will rescue

us<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:10:30"></hs_TimeCode> look at the
results of the ban in France, which was implemented in April 2011.
There has been only one conviction since its introduction, and I admit
that I have a very different view from the hon. Gentleman about what
that teaches us. An Open Society Justice Initiative report on the
results of the French ban reveals that the majority of Muslim women in
France who wore the veil have not stopped wearing it. Those women
believe the law to be an affront to their religious rights, and since
the ban came in, some have, predictably, started to wear the niqab.
Thus, an otherwise law-abiding group have potentially been criminalised
and, indeed, barred from participation in public
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000521" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000521">The
report also highlights the increased mental health issues that these
women face, as well as their social anxiety, their fear and their
overwhelming reliance on male relatives, which they did not have
before. Their movement has been heavily restricted and they now feel
unable to walk freely in public, fearing abuse or attack by members of
the public—and possible arrest by a policeman. Far from this law
creating social cohesion in 
<?notus-xml column=591?>France, these women report “legitimised” Islamaphobic
attacks and speak of how, in effect, in passing the law the state has
sanctioned racist intolerance and abuse. That law
not merely affirmed a wider prejudice against a section of the French
community; it emboldened those who seek to divide society and prevent
integration. Is that really the kind of society we wish to create in
Britain
today?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000522" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000522">We
want to build a society of tolerance, cohesion, understanding and
pluralism. The state should not seek to discriminate against its own
people on the basis of how they look or dress. In opposing the progress
of this damaging Bill, we defend the right of women to make their own
independent choices about how they dress. Although I am sure that some
who wear the veil will do so in keeping with the values of their own
families or relatives, it is equally true that many women wear the veil
because of deeply held religious or personal convictions. I will not
condone the wearing of anything under the duress of others, but we
should recognise that for many Muslim women that is far from what is
happening. It is a perfectly consistent position to condemn both those
who force women to wear the veil and those who seek to prohibit the
wearing of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000523" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000523">So
let us be clear: I do not believe it is for me, or indeed for this
House, to decide what women should or should not wear. It is not for
the state to be prescriptive on this and, least of all, to criminalise
the individual choices of women. This issue is about taking away the
freedom of choice from a very small portion of our community. That

recent high-profile cases have indicated the need, however, for
exceptions, whereby the veil should be lifted. I am talking, for
example, of the case last year at Blackfriars Crown Court. I welcome
the consultation on the issue of wearing the veil in some legal
settings, but it is emphatically the responsibility of judges to
provide this guidance, and not for this House to intervene. Of course
there is a need for identification at the UK border, or in other
circumstances for security reasons. That is already provided for in
legislation; we do not need to add to it. The vast majority of Muslim
women recognise that the needs of security are paramount in certain
circumstances and are happy to remove their veil for identification. I
welcome the provision of female officers in such cases so that women
can comfortably remove the veil to prove their identity. All of those
cases are specific, and none provides any excuse for the Government to
criminalise wearing the veil in all public places and at all

and by all-male game show panels on TV. I get offended on an almost

the right not to be offended. What could be more offensive to a sense

for Kettering (Mr Hollobone), with whom I worked closely in the
all-party parliamentary group on Palestine, talked about the
traditional British way of life. I do not know what the traditional
British way of life is. This country has been conquered and inhabited
by waves of immigrants ever since the Romans came here. Manchester is
called Manchester because the Romans went there and they had a camp,
which was 
<?notus-xml column=593?>castra, which became the suffix chester. We have had the Danes and
the Norwegians. Of my constituents, 40% originate
from Ireland. They are as loyal and as British as anybody else. They
worship in a Catholic church. I have a large number of Muslims in my
constituency. I do not have so many Jews, but I am a Jew myself. I was
brought up in Jewish surroundings with kosher food, going to Hebrew
school and the synagogue on Friday evening and Saturday morning. Is
that the traditional British way of life? It is part of the way of
life. The way in which Muslims live in this country is another part of
the British way of life. It is not for us to tell them how they should
live<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:21:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000534" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000534">I
was mugged here in London by two muggers with balaclavas over their

as distinct from the fact that they stole a great many things from me.
The hon. Gentleman talks about identification when one is voting, but
people are not identified when they go to the polling station on the
basis of their faces. We do not have photo ID in this country. They are
identified by their names and addresses. Muslim women wearing the veil
vote in exactly the same way as everybody else.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman is an honourable gentleman, and while he says that he is
doing this without pressure from constituents, there is a possibility
that if he had 7,000 Muslim constituents he might have thought up
another subject for his private Member’s Bill. It is not a
question of us being here to obey our constituents whatever they say,
and to reflect their views whatever their views may be. If constituents
tell me that they are in favour of capital punishment, as no doubt a
number are, I will not vote for capital punishment because some
constituents want it. If constituents of mine are in favour of fox
hunting and hunting with dogs, I will not listen to them just because
they are constituents who may or may not vote for me.</hs_Para>

that people change or conceal their appearance, ultra-Orthodox Jewish
women are required to wear wigs. They are not allowed to show their own

Speaker, may I say what a great pleasure and privilege it is to have
you in the Chair for this debate today? I believe it is the first time
I have made a full speech with you in the Chair, and it is a great
honour to see you in your
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:34:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000592" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000592">I
am very grateful for the opportunity to raise the issue of the MKFM
radio station in my constituency and the difficulties it is having in
obtaining a permanent FM broadcasting licence from Ofcom. Before I move
on to the specifics of the issue, I will set out MKFM’s role in
the provision of radio stations in the Milton Keynes area. Milton
Keynes, like anywhere else in the country, has access to all the
national radio stations. I believe that radio is becoming an
increasingly important medium in transmitting news, entertainment and
thought-provoking programmes. I personally probably spend more time
listening to the radio these days than watching television. Whether I
am listening to the “Today” programme or my favourite
John Suchet Classic FM programme, it is a great source of information
and
pleasure<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:35:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000593" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000593">In
addition to the national stations, Milton Keynes is fortunate to have
two local radio stations—BBC Three Counties Radio and Heart,
which happens to be based in Milton Keynes. These provide a valuable
local service, but there is a gap in the market for a specific Milton
Keynes radio station. BBC Three Counties and Heart do a very good job
reporting local news, stories and campaigns, and they engage enormously
with the local community. For example, when
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:36:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster) and I organised a
jobs fair last year, Heart was able to help by advertising it on its
station and providing other practical support at the fair. BBC Three
Counties regularly has me on to talk about particular local stories,
and it does a very good job representing the local
area<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:37:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000594">However,
because of the trends in radio broadcasting, neither of those stations
is specifically for Milton Keynes. Cost pressures and other commercial
issues mean that they have to cover a wider area than just Milton
Keynes. Heart used to be called Horizon, and initially it was just for
the Milton Keynes area, but now it includes the surrounding counties.
The same goes for BBC Three Counties. As its name suggests, it has
never been just for the Milton Keynes area, but it used to have a
specific Milton Keynes news output. In changes made a couple of years
ago, the specific Milton Keynes service was lost, and the station is
now broadcast throughout the three counties.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022871000595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000595">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:38:16"></hs_TimeCode>
do not in any way wish to diminish the importance of those stations and
the role they play in Milton Keynes, but I do believe there is room, in
addition to the national and local stations, for a very specific Milton
Keynes-focused radio station, and that is where MKFM comes in. It has
been broadcasting since 2011. It is on the
internet—online—all the time. On a number of occasions,
it has been able to broadcast on FM for one-month segments, but it has
not yet been able to 
<?notus-xml column=598?>acquire a permanent licence. It also broadcasts on DAB, but that is a
problem as well; I will turn to that in a
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:39:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000596" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000596">In
the two or three years for which MKFM has been broadcasting, it has
quickly built up an impressive reputation as a real champion of the
local community. In a new town such as Milton Keynes, where we do not
have as long a history of an established community as other places, it
is particularly important to have local champions like a community
radio station to give support to all the different activities, events
and campaigns that go on in the area.
During<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:39:41"></hs_TimeCode> the
relatively short time the station has been broadcasting, it has
received great testimonials from local organisations. I have letters
from the citizens advice bureaux, the Milton Keynes Dons sports and
education trust, the food bank, Milton Keynes council and local
charities, such as the Henry Allen Appeal and Hope for Hollie. They all
greatly endorse MKFM’s role in championing their causes and its
engagement with the local
community<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000597">When
I go out and about in my constituency to all the sports events, summer
carnivals and charity appeals—you name it—MKFM is there,
not just reporting what is happening, but giving a bit of pizzazz and
excitement to the particular event. It is becoming a cherished addition
to the local community in Milton
Keynes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:40:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000598">The
problem with not being on FM is that the station is restricted in who
it can broadcast to. It has had five one-month trials on an FM
frequency under the Ofcom procedures and that has been enormously
successful, but just when it gets traction in building up an expanded
listenership, the trial comes to an end and it is not able to sustain

I have said, the station is now broadcasting on DAB, which is an
important step forward, but it is not ideal. It has a cost implication.
I am told by MKFM that the transmission cost is in the region of
£50,000 a year, which is a significant sum for a community radio
station to bear. Moreover, not everyone has a DAB radio. According to
the figures I have—the Minister may have more up-to-date and
accurate figures—only about 50% of the population have access to
a DAB radio. The Minister may recall a debate last year in which a
number of colleagues, who were very keen to get the names of their
local stations on the record and for them to be broadcast on FM, had
concerns about the digital switchover process, but that is a matter for
another

is absolutely convinced that in order for it to fulfil its potential it
needs a permanent FM licence. I understand that the process is not
simple or straightforward. The spectrum does not have an abundance of
spare slots that can just be handed out to anyone. In advance of this
debate I received a very useful briefing from Ofcom in which it
explained the technical reasons why the spectrum is crowded, that it
can award new licences only in particular circumstances, and that it
does not want to cause interference to other stations. I understand all
that and accept that Ofcom has a relatively limited budget to process
applications for new
licenses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000601"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:43:11"></hs_TimeCode>MKFM’s
situation, however, is particularly problematic, because Ofcom’s
timetable to allocate new licences to such stations has changed.
MKFM’s business plan and strategy were based on a timetable
published in 2011, which was in place until last December. In that
timetable, the south-east of England, in which Milton Keynes 
<?notus-xml column=599?>falls, was the last of seven areas from which applications would be
invited in the first half of this year. Last year, however, the
timetable changed and now nine blocks of applications have to be
considered, the south-east being the ninth. The timetable has also been
pushed back to the second half of this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:44:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The reason
for that was twofold: first, a decision was made to include
applications from community radio stations in Guernsey, and secondly,
applications were invited for stations wishing to broadcast on the AM
band<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:44:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000602" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000602">The
six-month delay is likely to be compounded by growing evidence that it
is taking longer for licences to be assessed and approved. In the first
and second tranches of the timetable, it took an average of three to
four months from an application being received to a decision being
made, but the third and fourth tranches are now taking nearly a year.
Given those two factors, MKFM’s bid will be one to two years
later than it anticipated, which will cause it significant difficulties
for its business
strategy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:45:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000603">Why
was it necessary to put Guernsey in front of the south-east of England
in the timetable? I have absolutely nothing against Guernsey. I am sure
that it is a lovely place. I have not yet had the opportunity to visit
it, but I hope to do so one day. The Bailiwick of Guernsey has a
population of 66,000 and is already served by two dedicated local radio
stations—the BBC station and the commercial Island FM. I am sure
that they are excellent stations that provide very good local coverage,
but I am not sure why there is a pressing demand for community radio
stations in addition to the two island-wide ones. Milton Keynes has a
population of 250,000, and we do not have a dedicated community radio
station with a permanent FM licence. Will the Minister comment on why
there was a sudden change in
priorities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:46:19"></hs_TimeCode>? Why
have applications for AM broadcasting been considered ahead of the
assessment of bids for the south-east of England? I would appreciate
some feedback on why that has
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:46:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000604">I
appreciate the constraints under which Ofcom has to operate, and
neither I nor MKFM want to moan about this problem; I sought this
debate to try to secure the Minister’s consideration of some
potential solutions. I would be grateful if he took them away and used
his good offices to discuss them with
Ofcom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:46:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000605" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000605">The
first suggestion is simply to restore the south-east’s position
in the original timetable. There may be perfectly good reasons why that
cannot happen, but if so, they are not apparent either to me or to
MKFM<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:47:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The second
possibility is to consider all the remaining regions for FM licence
applications—including the west midlands, the east midlands, the
east of England and the south-east—as one bloc, and to identify
which parts of that larger area have the greatest need for community
radio
licences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000606">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:47:54"></hs_TimeCode>
the argument against that option is that Ofcom does not have the
financial or organisational capacity to assess a much larger geographic
region, I would make a third suggestion—that Milton Keynes is
moved out of the south-east region, where there is already considerable
congestion on the airwaves, to the midlands and east of England bloc. I
wish I had an audiovisual display to show a map of the south-east of
England. Milton Keynes is right up in the top north-west corner of
the  
<?notus-xml column=600?>curious south-east region, which swoops right down past London to
include the Isle of Wight and round to Kent and the Isle of
Thanet.</hs_Para>

has always been incongruous that Milton Keynes is part of the
south-east when we naturally look to Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire
as our main economic partners. Indeed, such a change is happening in
other areas of public and commercial life. For the boundaries of the
local enterprise partnership, Milton Keynes is partners with
Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire and surrounding areas. Many of the
reconfigurations in the NHS have made Milton Keynes look north and
east, rather than to the rest of the south-east. I am sure that it
would be relatively simple to transfer Milton Keynes to the midlands
and east of England bloc from the south-east, where there are great
pressures on the existing
spectrum<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:49:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000608" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000608">Finally,
if that option is not practical and the primary obstacle is
Ofcom’s organisational and financial capacity to consider Milton
Keynes more quickly, MKFM has suggested that it would be willing to pay
a premium application fee, perhaps in the region of £10,000. If
it and other stations in a similar situation did that, it might allow
Ofcom to take on additional staff to assess the applications in a more
timely
fashion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:50:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000609" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000609">I
hope that the Minister will give those problems and possible solutions
serious consideration. MKFM has quickly established itself as a
cherished community radio station. It complements BBC Three Counties,
Heart and the national broadcasters. It is a huge asset in the Milton
Keynes area and I would be hugely disappointed if its ambition to
broadcast permanently on an FM frequency was further

Friend the Member for Milton Keynes South for bringing this important
issue to the attention of the House. He began by talking about his
radio habits and revealed a penchant for Radio 4 and Classic FM, which
I share. I am a strong supporter of Classic FM. I take a
busman’s holiday view that we spend so much time in this House
debating the news and politics that it is nice to switch off, so I have
taken to listening to Classic FM and the Chris Evans breakfast show on
Radio 2 instead of listening to Radio 5 Live and Radio 4, which is my
usual
habit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:52:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000612" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000612">My
hon. Friend brought to our attention the important radio station, MKFM.
I confess that I have not yet listened to it, but I have visited its
website. It certainly looks like an incredibly impressive operation.
Indeed, this debate is flagged up as the No. 1 news issue on
its  
<?notus-xml column=601?>website at the moment. I have no doubt that, after this debate, my hon.
Friend will be a frequent, if not more frequent, guest on that
important radio
station<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:52:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000613" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000613">My
remarks may appear to be somewhat facetious, but I completely echo what
my hon. Friend said: I, too, am a fan of radio. In this digital age,
when one’s attention is diverted to so many different ways of
accessing content and to so many new types of content, it is my belief,
and the evidence shows this, that the medium of radio is as popular as,
if not more popular than, it ever was. I am therefore a strong
supporter of the measures that we are undertaking to continue to
promote
radio<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000614" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000614">One
of those measures is to support digital radio. My hon. Friend was right
to recall the debate in this House at the end of last year. We have not
yet announced a date for switchover or even made an in-principle
decision on when we might switch over to digital radio. However, we do
not want to lose the momentum towards digital radio that has been built
up by putting in place the infrastructure, encouraging people to buy
digital radios and encouraging people to convert their cars to digital
radio, which is becoming ever easier and cheaper to do. That will help
a station such as MKFM, which is broadcasting on digital radio, as my
hon. Friend pointed out. Milton Keynes tends to be ahead of the trend
and its rate of digital radio ownership is ahead of the national
average, probably beaten only by places such as
London<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:54:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000615" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000615">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:54:38"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to stress that digital radio remains an increasingly
important part of the radio
mix<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-28T14:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Another
important element of the radio mix, which we could perhaps say is at
the other end of the spectrum, is community radio. The framework for
community radio was set up in 2004 by the last Government. In my view,
it has been an astounding success. Community radio is run by
not-for-profit organisations that provide a social gain to the
communities they serve. It provides original, distinctive
and—crucially—local output, and relies on a huge amount
of effort and support, with stations receiving an average of around 214
volunteering hours every week. They are supported by the Community
Media Association, which does a fantastic job of representing the
sector and providing information and advice to stations and prospective
start-ups. Community radio has shown that it can deliver wider social
objectives, connect communities together, and give a real focus for
local engagement. It does not surprise me that in a community the size
of Milton Keynes, there should be a great deal of pressure to see the
community radio station MKFM launch as soon as possible. The value of
the sector is not just in its listening share or reach, but in the
lives it touches and often changes for the
better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000616" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000616">The
recent connect:transmit project is a good example of how community
radio comes together to support skills and training for young people.
It was funded by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation and co-ordinated by Radio
Regen, a charity supporting the community radio sector. It worked with
four community radio stations: Shmu FM in Aberdeen, BCB in Bradford,
Future Radio in Norwich, and Preston
FM.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000617" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000617">I
hope that my hon. Friend and the rest of the House will agree that
community radio has grown and established itself as part of the
UK’s diverse and vibrant radio ecology. As has been mentioned, a
number of community 
<?notus-xml column=602?>radio stations are reporting problems and struggling to remain viable,
with some stations reporting a decline in income and difficulties in
accessing funding. That is supported by Ofcom’s market analysis,
which shows that community radio stations have consistently operated on
very small margins. For example, in each of the last four years, the
average expenditure of the sector has been greater than the average
income.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000618" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000618">Ofcom’s
communications market report of 2013 showed that the percentage share
of income generated by community radio stations from grants fell from
45% in 2008 to 29% in 2012. That figure is likely to fall still
further, although it is partly offset by a slight increase in the
overall value of on-air advertising and sponsorship revenue, which
increased in 2012 from 26% to 29%. It is important to make such points
because I want to bring the attention of the House to the consultation
that we launched a couple of weeks ago on 13 February. It is a
wide-ranging consultation on the funding rules that apply to community
radio, because we want to consider how we can relax some of the rules
and restrictions on how community radio is funded. It is a consultation
that the community radio community has long called for. We think that
restrictions are still needed to preserve the distinctive
characteristics of community radio and ensure that small commercial
radio stations are not adversely affected. The consultation will close
on  23 April, and will enable us to assess the extent to which
rules can be relaxed to give community radio more scope to raise
funding, and to help the sector’s long-term
sustainability.</hs_Para>

there are challenges to community radio, I am encouraged by high levels
of demand for community radio licences across many parts of the
country. I fully understand my hon. Friend’s desire for his
constituency radio station, MKFM, to establish itself as a local
community radio station. The regulatory framework was set out in the
Community Radio Order 2004, and lists the powers under which Ofcom can
license community radio stations. That gets to the nub of what my hon.
Friend wishes to discuss.</hs_Para>

implementation of licensing is the responsibility of Ofcom, and in
developing its approach to licensing and regulating the
sector—including the current licensing round, which is the
subject of concern to my hon. Friend and MKFM—Ofcom has
consulted a range of stakeholders, including the Community Media
Association. Ofcom has decided to invite applications for licences on a
region-by-region basis, to co-ordinate the approach in a fair and
consistent way, and to give prospective applicants time to develop
strong and sustainable proposals. Within that framework, the licensing
process is applicant-led, and the applicant identifies where they wish
to set up their station. Ofcom does not decide the locations or target
communities to be served by stations, but it does advise on areas where
there are already existing stations, or where sufficient frequencies
may not be
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000621" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000621">The
decisions are complicated and need to take account of the various
requirements in the legislation. Ofcom has to consider four things.
First, it has to assess the application and establish whether the
frequency is available. Secondly, it needs to look at the different
proposals, which may have different objectives, and there may 
be many proposals for particular areas which need to be co-ordinated.
Thirdly, it needs to assess the plans to see whether the proposed
service meets the characteristics 
<?notus-xml column=603?>set out by the legislation in terms of social gain and the likelihood
that the plans are likely to be viable. Finally, it needs to assess the
impact on local commercial radio and, if necessary place, restrictions
on the amount of commercial revenue that the community radio station
may
generate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000622">The
difficulty at the moment, which affects MKFM, is the high level of
demand and competing applications. This is frustrating for stations
that are on air already and want to acquire a community radio licence
to strengthen their community engagement and grow their listenership.
They want to move more quickly. The suggestion made by my hon. Friend
is that we should adopt a demand-led process which might lead to some
applicants in some areas getting on air sooner, but it would lead to a
piecemeal approach that would slow progress overall as decisions were
made in an unco-ordinated way.</hs_Para>

which Ofcom manages the process overall strikes the right balance
between the operational challenges of managing the complexities
associated with licensing and its stated aim to license a community
radio station for every community that wants one. In fact, since the
legislation was passed, 276 community radio licences have been
awarded.</hs_Para>

timetable was announced in April 2011 and invited applications on a
region-by-region basis, starting with Wales and the south-west, then
Northern Ireland in March 2012 and then four English regions, one every
six months. Licences for each region are then awarded in batches on a
rolling basis, allowing the complex spectrum planning and frequency
planning to be managed together. If the number of applications received
for any region is high, consideration of all applications can take
longer than anticipated, as was 
<?notus-xml column=604?>the case in autumn 2013, so that Ofcom had little choice but to revise
its timetable for inviting community radio applications in its current
round.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022871000625" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/debtext/140228-0002.htm#14022871000625">In
mid-October, for example, Ofcom received 38 applications
from locations in west and south Yorkshire, Humberside and the
north-west of England. That was far more than it had anticipated, and
therefore in fairness to all potential applicants from other regions,
Ofcom revised its timetable in order to give itself time to process
those applications before moving on to other regions. That is the cause
of the frustration that MKFM is experiencing. I do not want to dampen
its enthusiasm and I shall take on board some of the points that my
hon. Friend made. I am not ready to fast-track licences for people who
are prepared to pay more, because that would still involve a lack of
co-ordination. At the moment, the process is fair with a very low

sector on energy prices for households and industry. The 
<?notus-xml column=36?>communication charts rises in electricity and gas prices and costs and
the price differential between the EU and its competitors. It also
examines the potential risks to energy intensive industries. The
communication argues for actions to reduce energy costs including
completion of the internal market, action to improve competition in the

supplies.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022872000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/wmstext/140228m0001.htm#14022872000021">The
second debate will be on the Commission’s communication setting
out a climate and energy policy framework for 2030. The proposed
framework is based on an overarching binding domestic greenhouse gas
emissions reduction target for 2030 of 40% and an EU-level renewable
energy target of 27%. The renewable energy target would not include
binding national targets, in contrast to the 2020

this.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022872000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/wmstext/140228m0001.htm#14022872000025">The

2014 the Advertising Standards Authority/CAP announced new measures to
ensure that food advertising remains responsible. These include a
comprehensive literature review of the impact of digital and online
marketing of food and drink products to children. The Advertising
Standards Authority will also carry out a survey of food
advertisements, with a focus on online, to assess whether there are any
problem areas and will take action to bring advertising that breaks the

to appeal against district judge decisions in the family courts. Leave
to appeal being granted or refused is not recorded on the family courts

HMCTS could estimate these totals would be to manually check the case

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more

because they are particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold

there are no current plans to extend the coverage of winter fuel

heating costs whereas others, for example, will have to spend more on
food because of special dietary requirements, or face higher than

hepatitis C services were established by estimating the service costs
and drug costs of treating patients with hepatitis C at expert centres.
NHS England uses a number of processes to continue refining allocations

treatments, and to ensure that it makes the most efficient and
effective use of its budget, including the development of national
commissioning policies and advice from Clinical Reference Groups

supports the UK Government's objectives for a successful Middle East
Peace Process by helping to build Palestinian institutions and
promoting economic growth, so that any future state will be stable,
prosperous, well-run, and an effective partner for peace with Israel.
Aid to the Palestinian Authority is helping to build credible and
viable institutions as the basis of any future state. The Government
firmly supports the current efforts of US Secretary Kerry and welcomes
the leadership shown by Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas.
We continue to call on both parties to take the bold steps needed to
allow US efforts to succeed, with the ongoing support of EU and Arab
states, and the wider international
community.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="14022874002583" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/text/140228w0004.htm#14022874002583"><B><Member PimsId="4829" UID="14022874003096" xid="890" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/text/140228w0004.htm#14022874003096">Mrs

2013. Our financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority is provided
through the World Bank Palestinian Reform and Development Plan Trust
Fund, which carries out close monitoring of PA expenditure and only
transfers UK money to the PA during the year if the agreed reform plan
is on track. The PA also publishes information on its expenditure,

of fresh drinking water for Palestinians in Gaza. According to the UN,
over 90% of the water from the Gaza aquifer is unsafe for human
consumption without treatment, and the coastal aquifer is set to become
too polluted for use by 2016. Access to water is affected by a lack of
rainfall, inadequate infrastructure, movement and access restrictions,
and the inequitable distribution of water resources with
Israel.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14022874000175" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/text/140228w0004.htm#14022874000175">Uganda</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="14022874002589" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/text/140228w0004.htm#14022874002589"><B><Member PimsId="2052" UID="14022874003102" xid="443" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140228/text/140228w0004.htm#14022874003102">Mr
