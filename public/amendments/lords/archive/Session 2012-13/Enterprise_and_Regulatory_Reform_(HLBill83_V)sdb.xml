<IndentOne>(c) a recognised regulator must have the power to allow a complaint to be brought prior to commencing legal proceedings, without prejudice to any power of the court to order a stay of the regulator&#8217;s action if continuing it would endanger the civil action;</IndentOne>

<IndentOne>(d) the investigation process is simple and credible.</IndentOne>
<HeadingTwo>Breaches of Standards Code</HeadingTwo>
