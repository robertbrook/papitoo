            <B>43:</B> After Clause 8, insert the following new Clause&#8212;</quote>
         <quote>&#8220;Competition and diversity</quote>
         <IndentOne>The Secretary of State must bring before Parliament within 6 months of the passing of this Act proposals to increase competition and diversity in banking by imposing upon any bank in which Her Majesty&#8217;s Government is a majority shareholder a duty to apply the following principles&#8212;</IndentOne>
         <IndentOne>(a) the principle of regionality whereby each branch of the bank is permitted to take on new deposits, open new accounts and make loans to companies or individuals only when the registered addresses of these companies or individuals is within the defined geographical area of operation of that branch;</IndentOne>
         <IndentOne>(b) the network principle whereby regional groups of local branches are autonomous in terms of governance, publish separate reports and accounts, collaborate with other branches to share central services such as the provision of systems, marketing, specialist financial products, liquidity management and wholesale funding while also maintaining appropriate mutual guarantees and self-regulation within the group to ensure that failing local management and branches are dealt with within the group with no recourse to the taxpayer;</IndentOne>
         <IndentOne>(c) the stakeholder principle whereby the governance of regional groupings of local branches explicitly includes stakeholder representation, comprising local businesses, customers, suppliers and employer and elected employee representatives;</IndentOne>
         <IndentOne>(d) the social purpose principle whereby a broader social purpose is embodied either in the banking licence of the bank or other statute so that the directors do not have a duty to maximise profit, but to ensure the profitability and financially sustainability of their local operations in supporting the economy of their regions of operations and financial inclusion in those regions, and nothing in this social purpose principle requires making loans that could not reasonably be expected to be repaid.&#8221;</IndentOne>

         <IndentOne>(d) that the effect of any transfer in accordance with the scheme in relation to contracts of employment with the old company is not to terminate any of those contracts but is to be that periods of employment with that company are to count for all purposes as periods of employment with the new company;</IndentOne>
