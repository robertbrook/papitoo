            <BillMotionSubText>That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Offender Rehabilitation Bill [Lords] because the implementation of the proposals in the Bill depends on the Governmentâ€™s proposed restructuring of the Probation Service; believes that this proposed restructuring will see the abolition of local Probation Trusts, the fragmentation of supervision of offenders on the basis of their risk level and the commissioning of services direct from Whitehall; further believes that the Government has failed to provide any costings for their proposals; notes reports that suggest the Ministry of Justiceâ€™s own internal risk register warns that the Governmentâ€™s proposals could result in a high risk of an unacceptable drop in operational performance; and further declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that none of the Governmentâ€™s proposals has been piloted nor independently evaluated, potentially resulting in an unnecessary risk to the publicâ€™s safety.</BillMotionSubText>
