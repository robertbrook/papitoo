is too expensive or difficult, shoppers will drive to out-of-town
supermarkets or just shop online, undermining the vitality of town
centres and leading to “ghost town” high streets. The

more difficult. It also will forbid the use of TV cameras to police the

having a negative effect on the vitality of our high streets and towns.
The measures that we are considering are there to address the
importance of parking. My noble friend mentioned specifically the use
of CCTV cameras. I stress that we are considering the use of those
cameras in parking bays, and what is important is that they are
proportionate in their use.</hs_para>

particularly on the impact on small towns, which may not necessarily
have trains and buses bringing people into them. Where there are not
just large-scale out-of-town developments but also small-scale shopping
centres, where it is easy to park for nothing, the impact on the high
street is significant. In Mirfield, in the diocese from which I come,
free parking has had a 
<?notus-xml column=823?>very good impact. In Berwick-upon-Tweed, another town I know very well,
there is no free parking and that is seriously affecting local
businesses. Can we be assured that Her Majesty’s Government will

that schools should have a strategy for the advice and guidance they
provide to young people. The strategy should be embedded within a clear
framework linked to outcomes for pupils rather than an ad hoc set of
activities. It should reflect the school’s ethos and meet the
needs of all pupils. We will share case studies so that schools can
learn from the very best practice. The revised guidance will also set
out clearly what schools can do to ensure that pupils have information
about all the types of education and training they can pursue, and hear

apprenticeships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022551000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022551000025"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:54:40"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Bakewell" PimsId="5921" UID="14022551000083" xid="2131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022551000083">Baroness
Bakewell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there is an ongoing problem of
informing young people about apprenticeships. This is a long-running
story, found to be inadequate by the Ofsted report, which said that the
careers advice being given in schools is not addressing that. The
dilemma is that when a teacher on the staff of a school is also the
careers officer, their loyalty to the school inclines them to advise
children to stay on in the sixth form. What can the Government do to
generate a new national careers service energy, so that this particular
problem is more swiftly

Nash:</Member></B> I take the noble Baroness’s point, although I
think that more people staying on in school is hardly our biggest
problem in education. Ofsted is very focused on making sure that
guidance is given well. In relation to apprenticeships, we fund the
National Apprenticeship Service that funds the Education and Employers
Taskforce to deliver a programme of apprenticeship knowledge and
employability skills to 16 to 18 year-olds. More than 70 advisers from
the National Careers Service, the National Apprenticeship Service and
Jobcentre Plus were stationed in the Skills Show in November last year,
and the National Careers Service and the National Apprenticeship
Service ran a jobs bus road show. A wide range of marketing materials
and resources about apprenticeships are available on the National
Apprenticeship Service website and it has also developed a free mobile
app. So this is something we are very focused

long-term economic future depends on high-level technology skills, and
the Government are committed to strengthening the teaching of computing
and in particular computer science in schools. That is why the new
computing curriculum, which is to be taught from September this year,
will be mandatory at all key stages. It has a greater focus on how
computers work and on the basics of programming, as well as covering
digital literacy and the application of information technology. It
encourages pupils to design computer programmes to address real-world

Chambers of Commerce and the CBI have criticised the
Government’s hands-off approach to careers guidance. The CBI
said recently that careers advice is on life support now in many 
<?notus-xml column=826?>schools in England. Does the Minister accept that it was wrong to give
schools sole responsibility for careers advice but no money to deliver

aspirations for what we expect for young people, but the answer to her
question is a firm no. As noble Lords know, the fact that the country
is short of money is not this party’s fault. However, I also
think that the assumption that a face-to-face interview with a careers
adviser is the gold standard is a very outmoded model. As noble Lords
will see when we publish our guidance, I hope shortly, we have a very
strong emphasis on employer engagement, which we believe is the secret
to good careers advice. I give an example: Westminster Academy, which
has built up partnerships with more than 200 employers, has 73% FSM and
75% A* to C, including English and maths. I can think of no better
example or argument for employer engagement on the ground, giving

indeed the best way for local people to decide how best to meet their

publish and adopt their plans, because we recognise that this is a
complex process. We have trebled the number of local authorities with

land supply within their boundaries and neighbouring authorities are
ignoring their duty to co-operate on housing growth. The needs of
Stevenage and Oxford are just two examples. As the Minister is aware,
local authorities are required to provide evidence that they have
complied with the duty in their development plans if the plans are not
to be rejected by the examiner. How many local plans have, to date,

pointing out that the vast majority of medical research in this country
relies on fully anonymised data. It does not require
patient-identifiable data. An organisation making an application for

discussed this topic in Committee and also had a significant debate on
it at Second Reading, there will be no need to repeat many of the
concerns that were expressed at that stage. However, the amendment
approaches the matter from a different point of view. It was made clear
that there was an anxiety that changing the effect of the 1998 Act
through the miscellaneous provisions Bill could be seen as imposition
of the idea of official opposition status over the head of the Northern
Ireland Assembly. Under the amendment, the trigger for any action would
be a request from the Assembly

noble Baroness will be well aware of my anxiety and that of a number of
others that although of course the Assembly has powers to change its
Standing Orders which could give effect to opposition status, the
weakness in that argument is that what is given by the Assembly can be
taken away by the Assembly. The 
<?notus-xml column=834?>danger is that, if an Opposition are established, it is on a grace and
favour basis and will only have sufficient independence as long as that
is the will of the other parties in the

purpose in moving the amendment, and that of my noble friend Lord
Lexden, is to ensure that we move one step closer to
providing additional accountability, so that the Executive can be held
to account. Parties would have the option of achieving a status that
will give them some additional speaking rights and supply day debates
and provide for the very significant issue of the future chairmanship
and deputy chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee. In other
jurisdictions within the United Kingdom, those offices are held by
parties that are not in the Government, whereas under the current
arrangements in Belfast, they are occupied by parties that are in the
Government. So that issue is fairly

issue that has come to my attention is that some elements within Sinn
Fein feel that if opposition status is granted to parties in the
Northern Ireland Assembly, that might in some way encourage parties not
to share power with them. Parties are not going to decide not to share
power with Sinn Fein on the basis of whether or not they could have
opposition status, they are going to make that decision on a bigger
political picture, so that is an Aunt Sally of an argument. Nobody is
going to refuse to share power with Sinn Fein simply on the basis that
they could get opposition status, a couple of supply day debates and so
on. That argument is not
credible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:23:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000006">If
your Lordships think that there is no need for looking at opposition
status in the Bill, I draw your attention to the fact that last year,
an attempt was made to take away powers of one of the Northern Ireland
departments, the Department of the Environment. An eight-page amendment
was introduced at the very last minute which had the effect of removing
some powers from that department and moving it to another one. That was
done without any consultation through the committee and at the very
last minute, so therefore there was no opportunity to have proper
scrutiny of that
proposal<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:23:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000007">In
essence, that makes my case for me, because it is precisely to
counteract that risk that I believe that we require to provide
certainty and a guarantee that if the Assembly chooses to go down the
route of providing for an Official Opposition, which I hope it does,
that Opposition will be a proper, free-standing Opposition who will
have certainty that they cannot find themselves hobbled later should
they fall out of favour with the executive parties of the day. We must
remember that we cannot look at this simply in the context of the
current make-up of the Assembly. We are looking years ahead—that
make-up may change over time.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:24:49"></hs_TimeCode> is for those
reasons that I believe we need to go a bit further than the Minister
has indicated in the past. Will the Minister tell us if she agrees with
the proposition? I believe, reading her response at the previous
stage—in Committee—that she does, and that she believes
that there is this issue, raised by some people, that, in the absence
of a guarantee which is not confined to the Assembly, the opposition
status would be left in a fairly weak position.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=835?><hs_para UID="14022558000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000008">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>
have an open mind on the methods we might choose to
deal with this. This is one proposal. If we look at
the Northern Ireland Act, and Schedule 6 to that Act—which deals
with the question of Standing Orders—there are indicative
Standing Orders set out in relation to committees and other matters, so
we are not proposing anything wildly different. I also re-emphasise
that the trigger for this has to be the Assembly itself, so that we are
not forcing something on the Assembly that it does not want. At the end
of the day, we need to put in place a mechanism that ensures that, if
an Opposition are formed, they are free, independent and not subject to
pressure. I believe that that would be an extremely valuable element in
improving accountability. I support the mandatory coalition
arrangements—although one would like to see a day when that is
not necessary, it is necessary and will be for the foreseeable future;
I doubt very much that anyone in this House today will see the day when
it is not necessary. We are not getting into the argument about whether
we are trying to replicate the Westminster system—we are not.
That argument should be set to one side. However, that does not mean
that the system is not capable of being improved or evolving.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:27:38"></hs_TimeCode> draw the
attention of the House to some speakers at the previous stage who said,
“Oh well, we cannot impose things and we cannot
interfere”. Parliament has imposed and interfered, and in fact a
later amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, is a
classic example of both interference and imposition. This Parliament
has already interfered and imposed and it has done so with its eyes
wide open. Indeed, in a debate in this House in 2006, the implications
of pursuing the imposition were made clear—and that has proved
to be correct.</hs_para>

Lexden (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I supported my noble friend Lord
Empey’s amendment in Committee and I support the current version
of this valuable amendment with no less vigour. He has explained its
aims and objectives fully and I have only a little to add from my own
Conservative and Unionist perspective, which is identical to that of my
noble friend, who is the chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party. The not
unimportant constitutional issue which the amendment seeks to address
is simple and straightforward. The Northern Ireland Act 1998, which
created the devolved institutions through which the Province is largely
governed today, made no provision for the establishment of an Official
Opposition with the appropriate rights and privileges. My noble friend
has explained the reasons for that omission and this amendment would
fill that constitutional
lacuna<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:31:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend has emphasised, no element of dictation or compulsion. It
makes soundly based constitutional provision for the establishment of
an Official Opposition, while leaving the Northern Ireland Assembly
entirely free to judge when it would be appropriate to invoke this
valuable addition to the constitutional order under which it conducts
its affairs. In other words, by inserting provision for an Opposition
into the 1998 Act, this amendment would supply the one element which is
missing from Northern Ireland’s remarkable constitutional
dispensation that followed from the Good Friday agreement, and so
complete that dispensation. It therefore has great significance but it
would do something else of importance as well. It would signal
this Parliament’s support and encouragement for the evolution of
Northern Ireland’s devolved institutions in the direction that
public opinion in the Province increasingly favours: towards a state of
affairs in which the Government are challenged in detail, day by day,
by an Opposition who fulfil the great constitutional function

consider what beneficial effect an Official Opposition could have had

restrictions that limit so worryingly the operations of the new

Alderdice (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee I made it clear
that I was very supportive of the principle of establishing an
Opposition in the Northern Ireland Assembly. I remain of that view. In
fact, I think it could be a very helpful improvement and evolution of
the constitutional arrangements. It is clear that Standing Orders in
the Assembly can accommodate this. When the Assembly was first
established it had a very flimsy little pamphlet of Standing Orders. It
was very important that the Assembly on all sides agreed to a process
of negotiating and ultimately passing Standing Orders with
cross-community support in the Assembly. That meant that all Members of
the Assembly felt they were their Standing Orders. I would prefer to
try to find that way forward. I do not accept the proposition that the
noble Lord, Lord Empey, referred to about this being an imposition. I
agree with him that this is not about imposition; it is about
facilitation. The dilemma is, as he described, that it requires the
larger parties in the Assembly to buy into the proposition before his
amendment, even if passed, would come into operation. It is a bit of a
Catch-22 situation. To 
<?notus-xml column=838?>achieve the things he and the noble Lords, Lord Lexden and Lord Trimble,
want to achieve will require a process of negotiation between the party
or parties that wish to have the possibility of being an Official
Opposition and the current parties of government. Of course, these
things can change—they have changed since the agreement, with
the size of parties and their influence and so

I think there is considerable leverage. For example the Ulster Unionist
Party, which is no longer as substantial in this House as it once was,
has a substantial number of Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly
and indeed has ministerial positions. It would be possible to negotiate
with the two largest parties in the Assembly on the basis that, as
vacating ministerial presence on the Executive to take up opposition
status would be to the advantage of the other parties, appropriate
recognition as the Opposition would be sought in
return.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000020">This
leads me to two areas where I feel some dissatisfaction with the
specifics of this amendment. First, there is the suggestion that a
party with one Member could become the Official Opposition. I would
rather see a slightly higher bar than that in the Northern Ireland
Assembly. The idea that a single Member could form a party of their own
and have the status of Official Opposition seems unwise. There should
be some more substantial number; it is going to be a bit arbitrary
whatever it is, but one is both arbitrary and unwise. I can think of
many individual Members of the Assembly who might choose to adopt that
status and create merry hell for everyone, including themselves and the
Speaker. I would rather that there were more.</hs_para>

to that: the special position that is accorded in the chairmanship of
committees, as suggested in the amendment. Again, for a very small
party of one or two people to be able to corral those significant
positions seems unwise. However, I emphasise again that the principle
that is being supported by the noble Lords, Lord Empey and Lord Lexden,
and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, is one that anyone who wants
to see the evolution of the Assembly should espouse, and if there are
things that can be done by the Secretary of State and our own Minister
here or by others in your Lordships’ House to move that forward,
we should certainly do so. However, I remain to be persuaded that this
amendment is going to take us in quite the direction and for quite the
distance that its proposers might
hope.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000022"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McAvoy" PimsId="5756" UID="14022558000138" xid="2033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000138">Lord
McAvoy (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee there was a broad
consensus—that is the key word—that the creation of an
Opposition, or the allocation of opposition rights to parties in
Stormont, lay within the scope of the Assembly and could be achieved
through its Standing Orders. That consensus is again confirmed today.
The Assembly’s Standing Orders have the power to grant informal
recognition to non-executive parties in the Assembly on a proportional
basis. There was also unanimous agreement as to the value of opposition
and the additional effectiveness that an Opposition would bring to
scrutinising the Executive and holding it to account. In fact,
“consensus” appears to be the key word in this
discussion.</hs_para>

noble Lords raised concerns about the vulnerability of any arrangements
that were determined solely by Stormont. Concerns were also raised
about the efficacy of the Assembly’s committees, particularly
the chairmanship and deputy chairmanship of the Public Accounts
Committee. The current amendment represents an understandable attempt
to overcome those anxieties. By placing the creation of Standing Orders
that grant opposition status within the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and
by making it impossible for the Assembly to revoke official opposition
status, the independence of an Opposition would appear to be
guaranteed. Through this amendment, any Opposition would not be
dependent on the continued good will of the Assembly for their status
and associated rights. Bearing in mind the word of the noble Lord, Lord
Alderdice—“evolution”, which is particularly
relevant—that might not be welcomed.</hs_para>

have a strong Opposition embedded within it. It did not have the
institutions of an Opposition, and the positions to which the noble

Lord, Lord McAvoy, suggested, through the internal standing-order
processes of the Assembly—the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice,

Kilclooney (CB):</Member></B> The Northern Ireland Assembly is losing
credibility across Northern Ireland and is passing very little
legislation. I am very worried that the turnout at the next election
will be poor. The Minister says—and the spokesman for the
Opposition said the same—that the initiative must come from the
Northern Ireland Assembly itself, but if all five main political
parties are now in the Government, what incentive is there for any of

Randerson:</Member></B> The noble Lord makes a very important point.
However, because there may not immediately be an obvious incentive to
do so, that does not necessarily mean that in other circumstances one
or more of those parties might not find it appropriate to go into
opposition. In the history of party politics in general, from time to
time a party believes that the time has come to renew itself, and the
party also might believe that the time has come for it to take a
stronger role of scrutiny. It is important that we do not regard the
current situation in Northern Ireland in terms of the balance of
political parties as one that will necessarily exist in decades to
come. There have been remarkable changes in Northern Ireland among the
political parties since the establishment of devolution, so we should
not think that the current situation will necessarily always
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:53:05"></hs_TimeCode> as it
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000036">I return
to the point I was making. Noble Lords will be aware that the Assembly
can in effect facilitate an Opposition at present through its Standing
Orders, as has been referred to here this afternoon. However, as I said
earlier, I recognise the concerns that those Standing Orders could be
overturned at the behest of the larger parties in the Assembly. In
response to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Empey, the
Government understand the desirability of sufficient protection being
afforded to an Opposition against such a threat if it is to be truly
effective in holding the Executive to account. It is important that the
Opposition are enabled to do their work without feeling that their
position is under threat. However, of course it is also possible to
protect an Opposition
internally<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:54:20"></hs_TimeCode>,
through Standing
Orders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000037">However,
as the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, highlighted in Committee and again this
afternoon, this is about the Assembly’s internal procedures. I
disagree with the noble Lords, Lord Empey and Lord Lexden. It would not
be appropriate for the Secretary of State to have authority over the
Assembly’s internal affairs, as the amendment suggests. In the
view of this Government, it is not appropriate for the Secretary of
State to intervene internally in the processes of the
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:55:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:56:11"></hs_TimeCode> also believe
that it would be inappropriate to 
<?notus-xml column=842?>impose a requirement for the Assembly to make particular provision in
this field. Indeed, we ought to show great
circumspection, given that there has been no opportunity for
consultation on these matters with the Northern Ireland Assembly in
recent months. However, we will reflect further on the issue in the
light of today’s debate. I make no promises of particular
action, but we commit to considering whether there is more we can do
within the constraints of the Government’s view that we should
not intervene directly within the
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:56:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
Above<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:56:27"></hs_TimeCode> all, I
hope that the parties in Belfast are listening and will think carefully
about amending Assembly arrangements in the light of what has been said
today. With that in mind, I hope that the noble Lord, when he comes to
reply, will feel able to withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:56:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000038">Perhaps
I might add a word about another issue, since otherwise we will not
have an opportunity to consider it today. In Committee, concerns were
expressed about the current provision in Clause 6 to make the reduction
in the size of the Assembly a reserved matter. I would like to respond
in more detail to some of the concerns debated in Committee. The
current provision would enable the Assembly to legislate, with the
Secretary of State’s consent, to reduce the number of Members
returned to it for each Westminster constituency. The noble Lords, Lord
Alderdice, Lord Empey and Lord Bew, expressed reservations about the
current provision in that it did not provide sufficient protection,
notably for smaller parties in the Assembly. In their view, the
Secretary of State’s ability to withhold consent from such an
arrangement was not a sufficient safeguard.</hs_para>

There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:58:32"></hs_TimeCode> is a
significant body of opinion that favours some reduction in the
Assembly’s size, but it is certainly not our intention that it
should become a radically smaller institution. When it was established,
it was the intention that it should be a widely inclusive body, and
that remains an essential element of the Northern Ireland settlement.
Accordingly, we propose to bring forward an amendment at Third Reading
that would limit any reduction in the Assembly’s size to five
Members per constituency. The amendment would make clear that such a
reduction would require cross-community support in the

is to allow the Assembly to evolve. I take the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Alderdice, that there is a Catch-22 situation. If you want
the Assembly to have the trigger mechanism to seek an opposition
status, to some extent you are giving it a veto. Equally, the only
alternative to a veto is an imposition, but it has already been said
around the House that that is not where we would seek to go.</hs_para>

credibility is being lost. Sometimes things need to be refreshed and
people need to see change and delivery. It is important that we do not
confuse the facts. For instance, my noble friend Lord Lexden and I have
brought forward this proposal but that does not mean that the
party that I represent necessarily wishes to seek a status for itself
now. It may very well be that other considerations, such as the
stability of the institution, have to be taken into account. However,

get the impression that they do not fully understand its implications.

that the noble Baroness sent to us and to the fact that in Committee
many people praised the Civil Service for its work in very difficult
times over a prolonged period. Many civil servants conducted almost
political negotiations on behalf of Ministers, in some cases at great
risk to their personal safety. We owe them a debt of gratitude in that
regard. The point was made that the situation in the 2010 Act gave the
Whitehall Civil Service Commission one status, whereas the Civil
Service Commission in Northern Ireland has a different one. The

Bew (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment. The shadow of
history lies over it. When the Northern Ireland Civil Service was
established in 1921-22, something like 60 appointments were made
without any normal procedures of recruitment being applied. Over a
period of time a struggle to achieve a professional Civil Service
began. The time between 1925 and 1944 when Sir Wilfrid Spender was head
of the Civil Service was 
<?notus-xml column=845?>key. In the memoirs of a Catholic civil servant, Patrick Shea, who
reached the top of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, one
can see the degree to which great efforts were made
to institutionalise procedures that reflected what Sir Wilfrid thought
were the best procedures in Whitehall.</hs_para>

why, when direct rule came, Ministers of all parties—I do not
just mean Conservative, Labour or Liberal Democrat Ministers who had
dealings with the Northern Ireland Civil Service, but Ministers who
leant to one particular side or the other in Northern
Ireland—always found that the Northern Ireland Civil Service
delivered excellent and objective advice. If one looks at the
non-controversial nature of north-south relations, which is of
particular importance at the moment, it is clear that the big political
decisions in such a context were made by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble,
who is in his place today.</hs_para>

that the work done by the Northern Ireland Civil Service in looking at
areas of viable co-operation between north and south is a very
important reason why the settlement is so stable. As the noble Lord,
Lord Empey, has said, we owe a debt of gratitude to the Northern
Ireland Civil Service. As I have argued, that integrity and
professionalism has been hard won. The pressures of localism do not go
away: it is not 1921 anymore. At this symbolic moment, it seems to me
that noble Lords who supported this amendment want to say that a
stronger message is desirable in terms of defining the principle of
merit and of fair and open competition. That essentially is the idea
behind this amendment: that that signal should be sent in a firm
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000054"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:09:38"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Alderdice" PimsId="3622" UID="14022558000146" xid="1044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000146">Lord
Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, whatever reservations I might have
had with regard to the previous amendment I have none at all about
putting my name to this one as it is very important. There was some
talk in the debate on the previous amendment about the imposition of
the will of the Westminster Parliament or Westminster Government on
Northern Ireland. In a sense, this amendment and the next one refer to
two clauses where it is almost as though the Westminster Parliament and
Government are intentionally withdrawing their involvement and moving
from excepted to reserved matters that were rather carefully put in the
excepted category. Why? Many of us were conscious of the fact that over
a substantial time in the historical period referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Bew, the United Kingdom Parliament and Government were less
involved in that part of the United Kingdom than might have been
advisable, and things went
awry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000055">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:11:03"></hs_TimeCode>
does not seem to me that we have learnt from that. Indeed, some
indications over the past two or three years are that people on this
side of the water, relieved to some extent that Northern Ireland is
less in the headlines than it was for 20 or 30 years, are just hoping
that everything will go on all right. The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney,
has rung a warning bell that maybe things need attention, and I think
he is right on that score. I have heard no demand in Northern Ireland
for the issues referred to in this amendment or the next to be changed,
so I am a little puzzled why these propositions have come forward in
the first place. If they do proceed, they must be addressed

First, while I accord entirely with the positive
remarks of the noble Lords, Lord Empey and Lord
Bew, about the Northern Ireland Civil Service, and from my positive
experience in most circumstances over some years, nevertheless,
particularly as I was trying to get the Assembly up and running, it
became apparent that many of the more senior civil servants were
operating off a kind of Civil Service rulebook from 20 or 30 years
before. They really had not kept up with the kind of developments of
Civil Service culture on this side of the water. There was nothing
malign about it but it seemed that things took rather a long time to
get across the Irish Sea in terms of cultural change. So, one of my
concerns is that if we simply offload and do not put appropriate rules
in place, those cultural changes that take place on this side of the

when appointing senior civil servants it is suggested that the Civil
Service as a whole, and the basis on which it recruits, is entirely a
devolved matter. That is clearly legally true. However, I ask my noble
friend to consider—she may not be able to respond
immediately—whether, if it became apparent that the merit
principle did not apply and proper recruitment was not happening in
Northern Ireland, would that not be a matter of concern to this
Parliament? If it became apparent that there was discrimination,
inappropriate appointments were being made or that the merit principle
was not the key principle, is it seriously being suggested that this
Parliament would have no locus, interest or legitimate concern, and
that the Secretary of State who was responsible for negotiating the
resources that those civil servants would spend, and who might have a
legitimate concern for the propriety of appointments, could say nothing
about it? I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:14:10"></hs_TimeCode> am
not entirely persuaded that that argument stands up. I do not

done? Since 
<?notus-xml column=847?>the only further legislative move that is necessary

Lester of Herne Hill (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I was not intending
to take part in the discussion of this part of the Bill, but I would be
grateful if my noble friend the Minister could clarify whether the
existing legal regime in Northern Ireland forbids any form of
discrimination within or by the Civil Service. It was my understanding
that that was the position under the Northern Ireland Act as it stands.
I know that in Northern Ireland there is some backwardness in amending
equality law. It still has not, as we have done, produced a single
Equality Act. That is most regrettable. It is true that it was Labour
that first sought to initiate that reform. But in terms of the Civil
Service and public administration, I understood that not only in common
law but under the Northern Ireland Act any form of arbitrary
discrimination, direct or indirect, would  be unlawful. I would
be very grateful if that can be
clarified<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:18:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000063"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Smith of Basildon" PimsId="5786" UID="14022558000149" xid="2058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000149">Baroness
Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I suspect that the
noble Baroness has a sense from the tone of this debate, as in

issue. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, made the point that we have
devolution, not disengagement, and there is a responsibility here for
your Lordships’

noble Lords, Lord Alderdice and Lord Bew, made the point about the
differences—not just cultural but practical—between the
Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Westminster Civil Service. As a
Northern Ireland Minister, I was struck by the far higher profile that
senior civil servants have in Northern Ireland than they do here in GB.
This is partly because, particularly when the Assembly has been
suspended or there have been different governance arrangements, it has
often been a civil servant who has undertaken the role that Ministers
have here in defending or promoting policies and engaging with the
public. So the difference is cultural and
practical.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000065">The
timing of the Minister’s letter on this issue to noble Lords,

the reason why there was a debate around impartiality was that we were
discussing the role of the Northern Ireland Civil Service Commission,
which is not an excepted matter. It was the role of the commission that
brought about that debate. I think that people fully understand that
the Northern Ireland Civil Service is devolved, but it is the role of
the commission and its responsibility in ensuring the independence and
impartiality of the Civil Service.</hs_parafo>

amendment and the whole tone of the debate is that, when the Northern

statutory understanding that it retains its remit for ensuring
impartiality in appointments to the Northern Ireland Civil Service. I
do not think that there was any misunderstanding in the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:20:40"></hs_TimeCode> in your
Lordships’ House about what was transferred or excepted, but the
reassurance was required, which was not really explicit enough in the

exactly what that amendment would say. If the earliest time we see that

disappointed that we do not have that government amendment before us

clearly the debate produced a satisfactory response to what I had said.
I was therefore picking up those issues which had been raised in
amendments by noble Lords or which had been raised with me directly in
that noble Lords had told me that they intended to table amendments on

the previous debate in Committee, to the issue of the Civil Service as
a whole. That is, however, a devolved issue, and therefore it is

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> I am extremely grateful to my noble
friend for her reassurance. I want to make it clear that my
understanding, as a matter of law, is that if the commission were not
to recruit on merit, on the basis of fair and open competition, that
would already be unlawful both by statute and common law. The House may
need that reassurance in considering whether the proposal now being
made, for a report in the future, would be sufficient safeguard against
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:34:57"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
Minister finds it more convenient to confirm that in writing, I would
be grateful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:35:06"></hs_TimeCode> for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000085"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Randerson" PimsId="5929" UID="14022558000155" xid="2139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000155">Baroness
Randerson:</Member></B> As an issue of principle, my understanding is
that that is the situation. However, in order that noble Lords might
understand it in more detail, I will ensure that a letter is sent to my
noble friend and a copy placed in the Library in order that we can make
the current situation clear. As I listened to this debate and read the
<I>Hansard</I> report of our previous one, it became clear that this is
a complex issue in which we are, in practice, moving between the
appointment of the Civil Service Commissioners on a fair, equal and
open basis and the standards by which we would expect the Civil Service
in Northern Ireland to operate. Some of these issues are devolved but
it is important to be clear about which safeguards are already in
place, at which level, and which points are devolved. I give way to the
noble
Baroness<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:36:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000086"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Smith of Basildon" PimsId="5786" UID="14022558000156" xid="2058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000156">Baroness
Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Baroness.
She is trying to be very clear and I wish I could be equally clear at
this point. The noble Baroness used two phrases that give me concern.
At some points she talked about the independence of appointments to the
Northern Ireland Civil Service Commission but in her letter, and at
other times, she referred to the independence and impartiality of
appointments to the Northern Ireland Civil Service for which the
commission is, at some levels, responsible. That is where there is some
confusion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:37:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000087">We
are just a few days away from Third Reading and I would be very
concerned if an amendment were tabled quite late in the day and the
only discussion we had was on the Floor of your Lordships’
House. Would it be possible for the Minister, before tabling the
government amendment at Third Reading, to discuss it with noble Lords
who have raised concerns to 
<?notus-xml column=852?>ensure that they are content with its wording and feel that it does what
they are asking for it to do? The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, is quite
right. We are very late in the day to be at this stage with the matter
not resolved. It would be very helpful if the Minister could agree to
circulate the amendment and discuss it with noble Lords prior

Randerson:</Member></B> One our problems is that the Bill refers to the
appointment of Civil Service Commissioners but the amendment goes
beyond that because, as has been pointed out, this is a miscellaneous
provisions Bill and things are put into it which add to its scope. In
attempting to respond to the debate, we have all been discussing the
qualities of the Civil Service in Northern
Ireland—its free and open appointment and independence. We have
therefore been ranging well beyond the point in the Bill. I am
absolutely happy to organise a meeting with noble Lords who are
concerned about this issue. It is essential to have a full discussion
of any proposed amendment and ensure, as far as possible, that noble
Lords are satisfied with the direction of the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:39:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has pointed out, there is an issue with timing. We have Third Reading
next week so it is essential that we move on under a realistic
timetable. The Government are absolutely committed to having public
consultation before making fundamental changes to the appointment of
the Civil Service Commissioners. We are not considering devolution of
anything without wide public consultation and the agreement of the
Assembly. We have a relatively limited period of time in which to
produce an amendment that works within those
parameters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:40:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022558000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Alderdice" PimsId="3622" UID="14022558000158" xid="1044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022558000158">Lord
Alderdice:</Member></B> I hesitate to intervene, but will my noble
friend clarify something else? She talked about the importance of
public consultation. I do not ask her to clarify this now, but perhaps
she could do so in writing before the Bill’s next stage. The
noble Baroness on the Opposition Front Bench said that culturally and
socially there is a difference in the roles of the heads of the Civil
Service departments in Northern Ireland. It is my recollection that
there is a legal and constitutional difference from this part of the
world as well. I recollect that the heads of Northern Ireland
government departments are the civil servants, not the Ministers, which
is a different position from that in the rest of the United Kingdom. I
am not certain that all noble Lords are aware of the fact that it is a
quite different position. Therefore, sensitivities that some of us have
on these matters are all the more acute. I see my noble friend Lord
Trimble nodding his head, and that ought to be confirmation sufficient
for me, but I ask the Minister to confirm between now and the next
stage precisely what is the position and, in particular, the status of
heads of department as civil
servants<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:42:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/5EF0757B2DC6E81BF7E1C18255CE1EBAA6DBF705" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 February 2014">Tuesday,

general point, which is that the Civil Service in Northern Ireland has
a different status from that in the rest of the country. The situation
changed in 2010, when additional safeguards were introduced for the
rest of the

way in which I can deal with the detailed approach for which my noble

I would write to the noble Lord, Lord Lester, because it is very much
in the same field and at the same level of detail. Then we can have the
precise legal and historical background to the different situation that
exists for the Civil Service in Northern Ireland. My noble friend makes
an important point that we are looking historically at a different

draw your Lordships’ attention to my proposal of an amendment

our approach flags up the importance that your Lordships clearly attach
to this very important question. Requiring a report will feed back into
the consultation process that we have committed to undertake on the
question of whether the responsibility should be devolved and in which
circumstances. I hope that your Lordships will agree that such an
amendment goes much further than the current clause. We will of course
return to the detail of these amendments. It is obvious that we are
going to have ongoing discussion on this and we will return to it at
Third Reading. I hope that this will provide the noble Lord with the

said, a number of issues were deliberately left as excepted issues

other point to bear in mind about the Civil Service in Northern
Ireland is that the statutory role, function and
power lies with the department, not the Minister. There is a complete
difference. If the Minister is not there for whatever reason, the
department can continue to apply policy that has already been decided.
The law states that the Minister directs and controls the department,
but in the absence of the Minister, the department itself has the power
to continue implementing policy. That is a very distinct
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:48:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on whether the noble Lord was present at a discussion I am going to

which are not relevant to this point, I had resigned and I was
proposing that my other Ministers would also resign. There was a
discussion of senior officials about what we do in this situation. I
cherish the comment made by someone who I will not identify, who said,
“We must be very careful because we don’t want people to
find out that we can take decisions without

Empey:</Member></B> The noble Lord is perfectly correct. I recall being
at a number of meetings where that issue was discussed. The law states
that the Minister directs and controls the department when the Minister
is there, but the power is vested in the department. That is why this
is such a sensitive issue. We are in the House of Lords but the
department Permanent Secretaries were known as the six barons in the
direct rule years, because it was to them that people turned for
resources and other things. There is a very distinct difference, and
that is why this is such a sensitive issue. As I have said, the Civil
Service Commissioners themselves clearly have anxieties. The Assembly
has not asked for this but the Government, for their own reasons, have
decided to bring it forward. If they were prepared to drop it, I am
quite sure that Members here would be more than content. However, in
view of what the Minister has said and in view of her letter, and the
fact that she intends to hold further consultations, I
believe it appropriate that I now beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment follows on in a sense
from many of the principles of the previous amendment, but there are
also some significant differences. The question of human rights and how
to maintain them has been a long-standing interest and concern of mine.
My first formal involvement in the issue occurred in my late teens and
early 20s when I was a youth representative in the human rights
commission of the Irish churches. However, I have never been a human
rights fundamentalist. I remember one of the senior clergy in that
commission describing the question of human rights in a way that I have
always found helpful. He said that “human rights” is an
important and helpful disturbing notion. In other words, it is
something which should always make us ask certain kinds of questions,
but on its own it does not determine all human behaviour—in
particular, the balance of human rights and human
responsibilities.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022574000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022574000002">As I say, human rights
has always been a matter of concern to me. When I got involved with
Liberal International, which is the worldwide organisation of liberal
political parties, I found that its only standing
committee—apart from the bureau, executive and
congress—is the one on human rights. I got involved with that
committee and became its chairman, and I was the chairman for some
time. As I tried to help that organisation move forward, I thought that
it would be a good idea to consult an old friend and colleague from
Ireland, Mary Robinson, who at that point was the High Commissioner for
Human Rights at the United Nations. When I went to discuss this in her
office in Geneva she said, “If you’ve got an issue and
you have a campaign, and if you are successful in your aims, you will
have achieved success in one campaign; but if you can put in place a
structure or an organisation, or an institution which has longevity and
good people in it, then you will address not just one issue but one
issue after another”. She encouraged me to encourage my
colleagues in different parts of the world to set up parliamentary
human rights committees, ombudsmen and, importantly, independent human
rights commissions and institutions, and I spent quite a number of
years trying to do that.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022574000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0001.htm#14022574000003">However, it is not just
about human rights commissions but about independent human rights
commissions. In particular, these commissions need to have an
independence from the Executive in those countries. It is enough that
they frequently find themselves dependent on the Executive for funding;
it is even worse if they are wholly dependent for their nomination and
appointment on the Executive. One of my concerns about this proposal to
open up devolution of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission,
with appointments made by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister,
is that it would undermine this question of independence. I am puzzled
about it because the other area of devolution that we are conscious of
is not just Wales—with respect to my noble friend on the Front
Bench—but also Scotland. What is the situation in Scotland? The
Human Rights Commission there is responsible to the Scottish
Parliament, not to the Scottish Government or Executive. I was
completely unsurprised to find that when the Northern Ireland Human

that, if and when the Government move forward with this
proposal—and perhaps my noble friend can even give me some
encouragement that at Third Reading there might be an amendment that
will address this question—the Northern Ireland Assembly is the
key body to which the Human Rights Commission is accountable, and the
Assembly and not just the Executive should have a say in the
appointment of Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission members and
chair. In practice, it may well be the Office of the First
Minister and Deputy First Minister that makes nominations. In political
terms, it is hugely important that the members are accountable to the
Assembly, perhaps with a vote for their appointment and the tabling of
an annual report to it.</hs_para>

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the object of my
noble friend’s amendment and I want to explain why. I have
practical experience in Northern Ireland. Between 1975 and 1977 I had
the privilege of being the special adviser to what was then called the
Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland. At
that stage the commission was examining the highly controversial
question of whether the European human rights convention should be
given direct effect in UK law or in Northern Ireland law. The Northern
Ireland Office, like others within that Government, was strongly
opposed to the idea of incorporation at that time. I regret that there
was undoubted interference behind the scenes with the commission by the
Northern Ireland Office. A member of the Executive was present
throughout and reported back to them. At one stage there was an attempt
to remove me because they saw the way that the body was going, and when
we produced the report in November 1977 three members of the commission
who had been—in my view—on the right side were removed
summarily in a way that I thought was quite
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:57:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend about the great importance of the independence of the commission
from the Executive, and I wish that this was not a devolved function at
all. I think that the commission would be better protected if it was
not being devolved. However, given that it is to be devolved, and in
accordance with 
<?notus-xml column=857?>the Paris principles and the Belgrade principles, it
is vitally important that it is seen to be independent and properly
buttressed. In supporting the amendment, I do not know whether the
particular solution would be the right one because I can
envisage a situation in which the Assembly might be guilty of improper
interference. However, I am certain that the independence of this body
is vital. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has been in frequent
touch with the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland and we have

discussion of human rights has played an important part in the
establishment of devolved structures within Northern Ireland. Today the
Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission continues to play a key role
in maintaining these institutions. Throughout the Assembly’s
legislative process, the Human Rights Commission can intervene at any
point to prevent the governing parties from creating legislation that
does not conform to proper international standards of human rights.

his concerns in relation to the independence of the Northern Ireland

institutions to determine 
<?notus-xml column=860?>the structures and lines of accountability they wanted in operation.
However, it seems obvious that if there are already models in operation
which seem to work well they could provide a suitable starting point
when these issues are considered in detail. In Scotland, for example,
the devolution is to the Scottish Parliament, which has proved to be a

it comes to the House, it is a question of voting yea or nay, and the
House, quite properly, is very reserved about using that power.

part of the country it has very particular important resonances. Any
sense of disengagement or diminution of importance of such an issue by
making it subject to the whims and wishes of the Executive would be a

the issues that it seeks to address and because of the urgent need to
make progress with regard to it in Northern Ireland. My interest in
Northern Ireland is of very long standing, stemming from the days when

January, a new Defamation Act came into effect in England and Wales. By
common consent, it will confer great benefits. Those benefits were
three years in the making, they have the full support of all three main
political parties, they were subject to careful scrutiny by a Joint
Committee of both Houses and a full public consultation took place
across the whole United Kingdom. The new, widely welcomed libel law has
perhaps been more carefully thought through than any other piece of
legislation in recent years, and your Lordships will immediately think
of many other pieces of legislation that could usefully have been

is practically universal agreement that the new law strikes the right

this immensely important area of our law, which directly affects so
many people and so many publications, Northern Ireland has been split
from England and Wales. The union of our country has been weakened. A
common jurisdiction has been divided into two—not after careful

Executive do not even seem to have held a collective discussion on the

Northern Ireland Executive’s inaction is fraught with risk and
peril for the community whom the Executive exist to serve. More than
6,000 people work in publishing and the broadcast media in this part of
our country. Their jobs are now at risk. The costly hazards of the old
law could drive out the media companies which provide those jobs. New
investment by international companies at the cutting edge of the
digital revolution—so badly needed to bring down unemployment
and enlarge the Province’s shrunken private sector—will
be seriously imperilled. The impact on ordinary people using the
internet could be severe. The new defences to an action enshrined in
the new law will not be available to our fellow countrymen and women in
the Province. They could find themselves facing huge bills,
long-running court cases and financial ruin for what they believe to be
a piece of harmless content on the

too, the position of those who might have to use the law to protect
their reputation. Fortunately, it is rare that people have to take out
injunctions on grounds of a potential libel to protect their
reputation, but it does happen and it can often mean the difference
between protecting and destroying someone’s life. A man or a
woman in Northern Ireland faced with such a prospect would, in order to
make an injunction work, now have to take one out in four jurisdictions
under very different laws: one in Northern Ireland under the
out-of-date common law; one covering England and Wales with a modern
regime; one covering Scotland; and potentially one covering the
Republic of Ireland, where the law is different again. Failure to do so
would mean that the injunction is not worth the expensive paper on
which it is written. Such a prospect, and the huge costs involved,
would be beyond the ability of most people other than the super-rich.
Therefore the action—or rather, inaction—of the Northern
Ireland Executive is, in effect, not only exposing ordinary people to
great risk but removing the ability of ordinary people to use the law
to protect themselves.</hs_para>

old libel law that the Northern Ireland Executive has retained without
explanation can have literally fatal consequences. Last July a senior

told<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:25:34"></hs_TimeCode> the

the Northern Ireland Executive ignore such powerful evidence of the
need for change. All they have been prepared to do is to seek a review
by the Northern Ireland Law Commission, but all the relevant
information is in the public domain already. A review could take a very
long time. The Executive should back the Private Member’s Bill
introduced at Stormont by the Ulster Unionist leader, Mr Mike Nesbitt,
to replace the discredited old law with the new one. That they have so
far failed to do. Freedom of speech, human rights and the integrity of
the law itself: those three fundamental elements of our democracy and

Pannick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I have added my name to this
amendment. I agree entirely with everything that has been said by the
noble Lords, Lord Lexden and Lord Lester of Herne Hill. There may, of
course, be some justification for the reluctance of Northern Ireland
politicians to bring the law of libel into the 21st century; there may
possibly be something unique about free speech and reputation in
Northern Ireland that demands the retention of laws that purport to
address communications but were developed before the internet, blogs
and tweets and, in many cases, before the invention of radio and
television—but I doubt it. No credible explanation has been
provided as to why Northern Ireland law should remain in the dark ages.
I very much doubt whether the Minister will be able to offer any
substantive reason why changes in the law thought necessary across the
House in relation to England and Wales are not equally necessary in
Northern Ireland.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:42:09"></hs_TimeCode> those

have been involved in this issue throughout the process, since it first
became apparent that there was a real problem in the debate that my
noble friend led on this last summer, at the launch of the Private
Member’s Bill by Mike Nesbitt in Belfast in September and in
Committee on this Bill. Throughout that time, some powerful arguments
have been put forward in favour of change, both here in Parliament and
by civil society organisations in Northern Ireland, the media and
academia among them. There have been strong arguments about the impact
on jobs, to which my noble friend referred and about the impact on
ordinary people who, in the phraseology of the mortgage adverts, could
find their home at risk for something that they have simply written on
Twitter or Facebook. There is the damage that could be done to the
creative economy in Northern Ireland and to academic freedoms in higher
education as well as the real dangers of media
plurality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022562000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022562000063">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:44:46"></hs_TimeCode>
have heard many other arguments advanced today by my noble friend Lord
Lester about the difficulties that the judiciary will face, and my
noble friend Lord Lexden made reference to the difficulties that
litigants will face, and those seeking to protect their reputation. So
there have been many powerful arguments that in my view, given the
gravity of the situation, should be met with equally strong ones as to
why the new Defamation Act should not apply in Northern Ireland,

have had is a deafening silence: silence from the Northern Ireland
Executive and silence from the political establishment in Westminster,
which I fear simply wants to shy away from the issue on the basis, as
the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, says, that this is a devolved matter. In
Committee, my noble friend the Minister majored on this point,
comparing the situation in Northern Ireland with that in Scotland,
missing the fundamental point that there is a different libel law in
Scotland. That has nothing to do with devolution, but is to do with
development of the common law that dates back many centuries. False
comparisons such as that will not do. Deafening silences will not do,

Ireland Act, one of the excepted matters—those issues of extreme
importance to the United Kingdom—is the constitution. This issue
is at heart a constitutional matter because it impacts on the

fundamental constitutional right—on media plurality and on the

ordinary people and is clinging to an oppressive, outdated regime. It

is too important for the Government and, with respect, the Labour Party
simply to say it is a devolved matter. If we maintain that approach,

implement the Act is having a deleterious effect on free speech in
Northern Ireland. Even before the Defamation Act 2013 was implemented
in England and Wales, Northern Ireland was particularly blighted as a
place where free speech could flourish. The conservative nature of the
libel judiciary in Northern Ireland means that a judge has to decide
that a jury would be perverse to decide a libel case in favour of one
party or the other. This sets the bar very high for the prompt
resolution of disputes and allows a plaintiff to say that matters must
go before a jury. As a result, trials are lengthy and expensive,
whereas, in England and Wales, the judge can, at an early stage,
determine the questions of fact about whether a statement is defamatory
on a simple balance of probabilities test, which considerably shortens

Scotland, the language is different. As noble Lords will know, the

is well established by convention that it is not open for Westminster
to enter into legislation relating to devolved matters unless there is
a Sewel convention which permits that. It is arranged with the Scottish
Parliament and a Motion is passed through the Scottish Parliament that

absolutely no comment on the nature of defamation law in Northern
Ireland; that is not the issue. The question is whether it is really
properly open to this House to engage with the matter, given the nature
of the devolution arrangement which both Houses have approved and which
is in legislation. As was suggested, there are other mechanisms for
bringing about reform of the law. It may be extremely frustrating that
it would take so long, but the Law Commissions exist to take these

Bew:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to support a central point made by
the noble Lords, Lord Lester and Lord Black, concerning the way in
which the current arrangements contain the possibility of great
unfairness and difficulty for the Northern Ireland judiciary. I am a
supporter of the Defamation Act 2013 and, as noble Lords have said, I
served on the Select Committee of both Houses. Put aside for a minute
the wisdom or otherwise of that Act—and I do believe it is a
wise Act—the problem for the Northern Ireland judiciary is that
it is now stuck with the interpretation of an antiquated law, while the
rest of the United Kingdom, in particular the media, will be operating
fundamentally according to a rhythm set by the Defamation
Act 2013.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022574000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000040">I want to make a
further point concerning the issue of forum shopping, or, as it applies
in the Defamation Act, libel tourism. The Northern Ireland judiciary in
recent cases—I am thinking particularly of the ruling by Mr
Justice Deeny in the Sean Quinn case on 10 January
2012—has clearly set itself against what we might call forum
shopping. Mr Justice Deeny argued that that key, very important
bankruptcy case was not suitable for Belfast on the grounds that Mr
Sean Quinn had had his being and his residence in the Republic of
Ireland for the previous 32 years. That is a clear indication of the
broad thinking of the Northern Ireland judiciary on this question of
forum shopping. In the case of the libel law, it is the issue we used
to know as libel tourism, which the Act is designed to deal with. So we
know to some degree where the thinking of the Northern Ireland
judiciary is on this question.</hs_para>

European law in general that forum shopping is not something to be
encouraged, and yet Northern Ireland is stuck with
legislation—our old libel law—which actually encourages
forum shopping. I am just trying to bring home to the House that the
point made by the noble Lords, Lord Lester and Lord Black, is actually
a profound one. The judiciary of Northern Ireland is being placed in an
extremely difficult position by the current arrangements. I understand
the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Browne. I have already been
approached by the Law Commission and I assure him that I will give as
full evidence as I possibly can to
it.</hs_para>

King of Bridgwater (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I hesitate to
intervene in something on which such distinguished legal brains have
been brought to bear but, briefly, as a layman in these matters, I am
very impressed by the arguments made by the noble Lord, Lord Lexden,
and the power of the argument about the desirability of uniformity in
the application of defamation laws. The noble Lord, Lord Browne, said
that the advantage of devolution is that we can all make different
laws. However, as a good unionist he will know that it is very
desirable that as a union we stick together as 
<?notus-xml column=875?>closely as we can and do not make a principle of establishing every
different law that we can between the different parts of the United
Kingdom.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022574000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000043">As a
loyal member of the United Kingdom, I think it is desirable that the
Executive of Northern Ireland should look at these matters as it seems
that they are likely on some occasions to significantly disadvantage
some of their own supporters, who might find themselves caught up in
some very unfortunate implications. Although there is the devolved
power, that power should be exercised also with respect to the position
of other parts of the United Kingdom, which may find from the
illustrations given by the noble Lords, Lord Black and Lord Bew, that
these are difficult matters.</hs_para>

from the noble Lord, Lord Lester, as he and I have a bit of
history as well in some areas, as anybody will know who remembers the
broadcasting ban or the amazing events when the chief constable decided
to deprive female constables of the right to carry arms. The noble
Lord, Lord Lester, was active during my time in that area.</hs_para>

I am not quite clear from the exchanges that have taken place whether
this is just genuine inertia or whether there is a fundamental
objection within the Executive to doing this, thinking it totally
undesirable in Northern Ireland, and exactly what the background to
this is. However, I am prepared to accept that it is the determination
of the Executive to address this, although they are moving very slowly.
That is the most preferable way to go in terms of what the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Carswell, said, and not to get caught by being
unnecessarily accused of trying to undermine the devolution proposal.
The message should go out very clearly from this House that we think
this is highly desirable and almost essential to do. We look to the
Executive to do it as speedily as they can and bring this matter into
line, without imposing it in the amendment as
proposed.</hs_para>

Trimble:</Member></B> My Lords, the great advantage of this
debate is that it has enabled a wide range of people across the House
to express their views on the desirability of extending the modern
defamation law to Northern Ireland. I very much hope that the Northern
Ireland Executive will pay attention to the views that have been
expressed here. There has been no argument presented in favour of
retaining the old, outdated laws. I have not heard any and, from what
has been said, I gather that nothing has been said by the Northern
Ireland Executive to explain what is going on. The noble Lord, Lord
Browne, referred to the decision inviting the Northern Ireland Law
Commission to look at the matter. I hope that will happen quickly and
that it indicates that action is being taken, rather than something
being done just to fend off criticism. I hope that something happens
there.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022574000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000047">I must
also attach significant weight to the hesitation and reservations that
have been mentioned. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, referred to
what might happen in Scotland if this was to happen. That brought back
to mind what happened in Northern Ireland in, I think, 1923,
when on a certain measure London was indicating that it was likely to
override the decisions 
<?notus-xml column=876?>being taken by the then Northern Ireland Ministers.
I think it was suggested that they might seek to withhold Royal Assent
from legislation that was going through Stormont, and the then Northern
Ireland Prime Minister made a very robust response to that. It was of
such a nature that the proposal disappeared and there was then no
attempt to interfere with the exercise of devolved powers.</hs_para>

comes to mind in dealing with the question of the power of this
Parliament to legislate on devolved matters, whether for Wales,
Northern Ireland or Scotland, is that that power did exist with regard
to the old Stormont under the Government of Ireland Act. I remember an
article—do not ask me for chapter and verse on
this—written maybe in the late 1950s or early 1960s by Francis
Newark, professor of law at Queen’s University, in which he
referred to this power to legislate, which was an expression of the
sovereignty of this Parliament, as being a provision to be brought out
only in an emergency.</hs_para>

our Troubles and I rather suspect that looking at these provisions now
one would see them as being applicable not just in an emergency but in
other circumstances as well. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell,
was quite right to point out that this is something that needs
consideration. It is my impression that this amendment has been put
down in order to produce this debate in the hope that what is said will
have an effect. However, the message should be taken back to the
Northern Ireland Executive that if they are not going to act on this in
a responsible way that maintains a broad measure of parity on
matters—because the matters stretch across the whole of the
country there is a need for parity—they are exposing themselves
to the prospect of something happening.</hs_para>

the provision that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, referred to under
Section 26 whereby the Secretary of State can require things to be done
in order to secure adherence to the conventions. I urge the Minister to

quite strong feeling on this matter in this House and that she should

as leverage.</hs_para>

easy solutions. Obviously, the Executive can act at a far greater pace
than they are at the moment. However, there has been a change in the
past few months with the change in Finance Ministers at Stormont. Mr
Hamilton’s predecessor was very dismissive of any actions being
taken in this matter; Mr Hamilton has asked the Law Commission to
intervene. The Private Member’s Bill that Mr Nesbitt has before
him has had his consultation and he has undertaken to share that
consultation with the Law Commission. I believe he met it last week and
reassured it that that would still be the case.</hs_para>

there has been a change in the pace at which this consultation is
going. Originally we thought it would be brief and to the point because
this issue has been consulted on time after time. However, I am now
hearing stories that there is going to be a scoping study and then
there will be a consultation by the Law Commission on top of the
consultation that has already taken place in the Private
Member’s Bill, on top of the consultation on the 2013 Bill. By
my very rudimentary calculations, that would take the issue outside of
the current Assembly’s mandate, which ends in 2016. What could
be an easy solution could in fact simply kick the can down the

is no question that those of us who have had the privilege of being in
Stormont know that the issues raised by the noble and learned Lords,

this itself. However, the noble Lord, Lord Lexden, and his colleagues
point to the wider obligations of the United Kingdom Government and the
issue of free speech and human rights. Of course, human rights have an
international obligation, which is excluded from the devolution

winding-up statements both the Government and the Opposition will
encourage an early resolution to this, rather than simply going on and

this debate, but when I heard the speech of the noble Lord, Lord
Browne, and the reservations of the noble and learned Lords, Lord
Carswell and Lord Hope of Craighead, I felt that it was important to
address the question of devolution and what the devolution doctrine
means. It does not seem to be admissible of an entirely legal
constitutional interpretation. It does not seem to be a matter of
saying, “We’re devolved; we don’t have to give any
kind of explanation to anyone for what we do. We can simply make
arbitrary decisions”. It was not ever intended for that purpose.
It was intended in general terms, and in particular in 
<?notus-xml column=878?>Northern Ireland, to ensure that decisions were made on a
cross-community basis that ensured that the governance of Northern
Ireland took into account the particular circumstances of Northern
Ireland and its particular needs—domestically, within the United
Kingdom, in relation to the Republic of Ireland and in relation to its
relatively remote status. There are many areas where devolved
government appropriately makes different decisions because, in terms of
education, healthcare, transport or agriculture, the situation is
different economically, practically, culturally, socially or
whatever.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022574000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000059">In
certain circumstances, the notions adumbrated by the noble and learned
Lords, Lord Carswell and Lord Hope, are completely correct, and their
cautions in those circumstances would be well taken. The purpose of
devolution is to enable that kind of differentiation. However, no
reason has been given by the Northern Ireland Executive for this delay
and for holding back. The noble Lord, Lord Browne, very appropriately
supported his party in its decision on this matter, but even he did not
give any good reasons why he should not fall in with the operation of
the new Defamation Act in the rest of the United Kingdom. Nor, as far
as I am aware, has there been any public debate at home in Northern
Ireland, any indication that an agreement has been reached or any
reasons adduced why we should not move forward—on the contrary,
there has simply been an arbitrary decision that we are not going to go
ahead on this. Then—and the noble Lord, Lord Browne, presented
this in a very positive way—we will have this local
consultation. That is fine if it is to ensure that there is real local
difference, but it is not fine if the consultation kicks the issue into
the long grass, and there is a suspicion that that is what it is all
about.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022574000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000060">On top
of this, there are those circumstances where one can appropriately seal
off Northern Ireland, as it were, to deal with particular issues.
Animal health might be one. However, this issue cannot be dealt with in
an isolated fashion. The whole point is that publication, whether
digitally or in hard copy, cannot be isolated within Northern Ireland,
and it puts everyone at risk if one tries to do that
inappropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022574000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000061">I
therefore want to emphasise that, although I appreciate the reasonable
cautions, it does not seem to me that devolution is meant to enable the
local devolved Executive to make arbitrary decisions without
explanation or clarity, or decisions that are simply inappropriate to
the circumstances. Then the question comes of how we deal with this. Do
we deal with it by simply slamming something through this evening in
your Lordships’ House and leaving somebody else to pick up the
pieces—political or legal? I think not, but my noble friend Lord
Trimble has pointed in the right direction. That is to say, whatever
the limited remaining powers and opportunities of the Secretary of
State for Northern Ireland, one of the opportunities she has is to take
the messages from this Palace to the Stormont Administration and say to
them, “Do you realise how strongly people in the rest of the
United Kingdom feel about this? They are not terribly accepting of the
notion that you are going to take a whole lot of time to deal with
this. If you want to take a little time to tweak it or for your own
particular reasons, that may 
<?notus-xml column=879?>well be acceptable”. However, I would be assured and reassured by
the Minister, not if she were to say that she was going to accept
this—because I am sure that she is not going to be in a position
to do that—but if she were able to say to us that the Secretary
of State, her right honourable friend, will take seriously what has
been said in your Lordships’ House tonight, convey that to the
Northern Ireland Executive at the most senior levels, and ensure that
the matter is taken seriously and
expeditiously<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:26:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:26:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

McAvoy:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a wide-ranging debate with
speeches of quality. It further justifies the existence of this place,
where such a measured debate can be held. The noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:26:30"></hs_TimeCode> Lexden,
cited journalists as one of the main reasons why he was bringing this
forward. I could think of many other occupations that have inspired
more sympathy and understanding than journalists, but I take the point
that he made<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:26:53"></hs_TimeCode>. On
a totally irrelevant point—and it is a good job that there is
not a Lord Speaker to rule me out of order—I noticed that the
noble Lord, Lord Lexden, invariably sits in a seat below the coat of
arms of a former stadholder of Holland, better known as William III. I
am sure it is entirely coincidental, but it many ways it is quite
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:27:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

lengthy discussion we have had on this issue and I am sure I will be
shot down in flames with my intervention, but there we are. I will
repeat the point I made in Committee—that the extension of the
Defamation Act is a devolved matter. I know that the noble Lord, Lord
Alderdice, made a powerful point about the nature and state of
devolution as a principle, and it is a principle. Nevertheless, I place
on record immediately that the Labour Opposition favour the
introduction of the Act as quickly as possible and will seek assurances
from the Minister as to how she intends to pursue that
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:28:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022574000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000064">It
is clear that the extension of the Defamation Act 2013 to Northern
Ireland stands firmly in the competence of the Stormont Assembly. It is
through the Assembly’s passing of a legislative consent Motion,
not an Act of Parliament, that the Defamation Act 2013 will come into
force in Northern Ireland. The noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill,
said, if I am picking him up right—and, as a former forklift
truck driver in a factory, I hesitate to cross legal swords with
him—that devolution was a flawed principle. As a lay person, I
do not understand the concept of attacking it on that basis. A free
Parliament passed that law; a free Parliament passed devolution and a
free Parliament has a right to make mistakes and will make mistakes, as
the noble Lord, Lord King, knows well. The principle of devolution was
passed by a free Parliament, and we in the Opposition recognise that
and are very reluctant to get involved in laying down the law to a
devolved
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, quite rightly mentioned
the reaction in Scotland if London—in parentheses,
England—tried to “dictate” to the Scottish
Parliament on a devolved issue. We can have legal debates and highly
principled debates here but, if we do not understand the nature of the
political impact of the things that we try to do, that would be a
flawed
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:30:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:32:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

again clearly that we would push to see the Defamation Act 2013
extended to Northern Ireland. Those wishing to see the extension of the
Act should be heartened and encouraged by the level of debate here
because, quite rightly, no one has attacked the principle of the
Defamation Act being applied to Northern Ireland. There will always be
different laws in different parts of the United Kingdom, which is
surely its strength, and devolution is part of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:30:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022574000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000066">Certainly
the Executive who or Assembly that completely ignored the reasoned,
well made points made here in favour of pursuing this would be very
foolish. It is absolutely right that the noble Lord, Lord Browne of
Belmont, reminded us of devolution. It was useful to have that
reminder, because it shows that local reaction to dictation from London
is seen as dictation from
England<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:31:19"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Carswell, also indicated the need for
caution in going about these things. It is very important that that was
local opinion being brought to bear on this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:31:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022574000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000067">Reference
has been made, as it should be, to Mr Mike Nesbitt’s
Private Member’s Bill. There are accusations that the
consultation is being deliberately delayed. The message should go out
from here: “We want to see you get on with it”.
The consultation garnered over 200 responses—a large
number—of which around 90% were positive. It was also mentioned
that the current Northern Ireland Finance Minister, Mr Simon Hamilton,
has also asked the Northern Ireland Law Commission to examine the
issues surrounding defamation law within Northern Ireland. While some
have expressed concerns over the timetabling, surely that shows that
clear and active consideration is now being given to the extension of
the 2013
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:32:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022574000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000068">Several
noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Bew, gave illustrations of
why the introduction of the law in Northern Ireland would be good. The
noble Lord, Lord Empey, confirmed that as well. If we have an
influence—and I believe we do—it is that your
Lordships’ House is a House of Lords that tries to influence
opinion within the United Kingdom. The Assembly that and Executive who
ignored that would be a very brave one, because discussion here
does reflect public opinion in Northern Ireland. That also
builds on the reference that the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, made to
growing dissatisfaction and disillusionment with the Assembly. The
message is clear: listen to the people and act in their
interests<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:33:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/67FBF186A0660CA468FAF7D71C36137EA2A1B63E" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 February 2014">Tuesday,

Randerson:</Member></B> My Lords, I know that the concerns expressed so
eloquently by my noble friends Lord Lester and Lord Lexden are shared
widely across the House. That has been obvious from the debate today.
There can be no doubt, either in Westminster or in Stormont, about the
strength of concern felt by many noble Lords about the failure so far
to reform the law on
defamation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

individuals have also highlighted concerns about the possible effects
of there being differences in the law between Northern Ireland and
England and Wales. For example, the noble Lord, Lord Bew, referred to
the problems for the judiciary in trying to deal with an out-of-date
law and the noble 
<?notus-xml column=881?>Lord, Lord Black, and other noble Lords referred to the impact on the
media. As we have heard, there has been an active campaign in Northern
Ireland involving civil society organisations, academics, the media and
some political parties.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:34:41"></hs_TimeCode> is not quite
true, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, implied, that nothing has
happened since the Defamation Act was passed here. Things have moved on
in Northern Ireland. There have been responses; they just have not been
very fast or gone very far. It is not true to say that nothing has
happened, because the campaign has certainly had an impact. The noble
Lord, Lord Browne, outlined that there is action now in the Assembly,
both by Mike Nesbitt and with reference to the Law Commission. Some
scepticism has been expressed about whether this will lead to a result
or whether it is just a delaying tactic by the Executive. I will not
speculate on that, but I put it to noble Lords that the Law Commission
is a well-respected, expert institution and if there were any intention
to use the commission to avoid the issue, it seems to me that that
would be likely to backfire. We have also heard about the consultation
and the Private Member’s Bill brought forward by the leader of
the Ulster Unionist Party, Mike Nesbitt. Undoubtedly his consultation
produced some valuable responses and information. These are real
changes and developments that have happened in Northern Ireland since
the Defamation Act was passed
here<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:36:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

previous occasions, the Government believe that the Defamation Act
makes some very important improvements to the law that was previously
in place. It introduces a tougher serious harm test to discourage
trivial claims and a single publication rule so that a publisher cannot
be repeatedly sued about the same material. It addresses libel tourism
and prevents claims being brought in the English courts where the
parties have little connection to this country. It provides simpler and
clearer defences to those accused of defamation—for example, the
creation of new statutory defences of honest opinion and truth and a
new statutory defence for publications on matters of public interest.
The Act also takes specific action to help encourage robust scientific
and academic
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:37:40"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
important that those improvements and advantages are emphasised time
and again as that is the way in which the Executive in Northern Ireland

adopt the Defamation Act for
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:38:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022574000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022574000072">The
noble Lord, Lord Lexden, asked some specific questions. It seems a very
long time ago now but it is important that I respond to them. In
response to his first question on whether the Government will secure a
public explanation from the Executive of their inaction, I repeat that
this is a devolved issue and it is important that we respect that
devolution. However, that does not mean that the UK Government have not
asked the question and would not appreciate an

Lords that the civil law of defamation is of course a devolved matter,
and under the Sewel convention decisions on whether legislation in
transferred areas should apply to Northern Ireland usually fall to the
devolved Administration. A number of noble Lords have set out why they

I urge them to consider the wider ramifications of doing so for our
relations with all the devolved legislatures in the United Kingdom. I
welcome the words of the noble and learned Lords, Lord Carswell and
Lord Hope, in this regard. It is important that we respect devolution.
It is not just in respect of Scotland that we should be wary of
breaching the Sewel convention; I believe that it would be

Lord Lester has eloquently explained the weaknesses of our non-federal
system of devolution, but I urge noble Lords who are of the mind that
we should breach the Sewel convention to look at this from the

to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Black, who asserted that this
was a constitutional issue and hence not devolved. I fear that the
problem cannot be defined out of existence in this way: the issue is
clearly a devolved one, as part of the civil law. The fact that it
raises significant rights issues does not change that. We recognise the
concerns involved, but we cannot abandon the principle of devolution

concerned. I will return to that in my response. I say also to the
noble Lord, Lord Black, that the Data Protection Act is a reserved
matter and not devolved, so the Assembly can only legislate with our
consent. We carefully consider the content of Assembly Bills in the
reserved field.</hs_para>

Lester raised issues connected with human rights, namely the power in
Section 26 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. I urge noble Lords not to
assume that the previous law breached the European Convention on Human
Rights. It might not have been good law, but it did not necessarily
fail on the human rights test. I believe that the new Act will be very
beneficial; but that does not mean that the previous legal framework
necessarily was in breach of international standards on freedom of
expression. Even if that were the case, the Secretary of State does not
have any general power in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to make the
Assembly or the Executive do something on human rights grounds. Under
Section 26(2), she may order a Northern Ireland Minister to do
something to implement international obligations. However, if noble
Lords refer to Section 98 of the same Act they will see that
“international obligations” means,</hs_para>

points made in the debate. As we have heard this evening, there is
considerable activity in Stormont and some reason to be optimistic
about the chances of legislative change. To the noble Lord, Lord King,
I say that the issue we face is to decide at the start what is to be
devolved and then make sure we adhere to that decision; otherwise, we
are picking and choosing and chopping and changing. It may or may not
be appropriate to have devolved the issue of defamation, but it is
devolved and we need to observe that now. The reason why I say that it
might or might not be appropriate is that, as the noble Lord, Lord
Alderdice, has pointed out, we cannot seal Northern Ireland off on this
issue. When one analyses the devolution settlements, it is often the
case that aspects have been devolved which clearly involve an
interaction with neighbouring countries. However, once it has been
decided, we have to observe

frustrating, as the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, said. The noble
Lord, Lord Alderdice, noted earlier this afternoon that social change
comes slowly in Northern Ireland. It is important to bear in mind that
although change sometimes comes slowly, it does come in the end.
Devolution means that there are different laws in different parts of
the country. We must respect that, but that does not mean that we are
not entitled to make our views known. I believe that the Government
have made their views very clear on this issue. Noble Lords have
certainly made their views known today, and I hope that they have been

Lord McAvoy, that it is purely a matter of coincidence that I so

key thing for noble Lords to bear in mind about the provisions in the
Good Friday agreement is that there was a provision for the joint
election of First Minister and Deputy First Minister, which means that
a ticket had to be formed. There had to be an agreement on who would
stand. A six-week period for this to happen was provided, but because
it was a joint ticket and there were six weeks in which to do it, there
was the opportunity for the largest party on the nationalist side and
the largest party on the unionist side to interact; they had to come to
an agreement. There were opportunities for views to be expressed about
who might be the
nominees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022582000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022582000007">In
2006 we had provisions that swept that away and provided for a
mechanistic provision whereby the various provisions rather obscurely
expressed in the legislation would apply, and it would be possible to

week was provided for it. It was to go through automatically. I will

look at the future and pick up the very important point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, that because of the way in which the
Administration has carried on there is widespread dissatisfaction and
disillusionment, and, in my interpretation of what he said, that is
likely to have an impact when we next have an Assembly election.
Participation rates in Assembly elections have been dropping. They will
continue to drop. The drop will be felt most among people who feel
dissatisfied about inaction. There are those who are feeling sore
because they believed in the Democratic Unionist Party when it attacked
the agreement and who then felt disgruntled after it decided that it
was going to implement the Belfast agreement with merely cosmetic
changes, as well as the significant change in identifying the First

Sinn Fein becomes the largest party. The DUP will do what it has done
before, running a campaign that says, “Vote for us, or else you
will get a Sinn Fein First Minister”. It has done that several

days, with no opportunity for people to stop and think or consider

sit in. A lot of people take it very badly that a deal that was
done—a referendum that was passed—was swept aside in some

Some of us learnt about it when we saw the draft of the 2006 St Andrews

of devolution, it rings a bit hollow for some of us who have been

to Tony Blair to get the thing changed; it was afraid that, if it put
forward a particular candidate, that person would be negotiated out. It
wanted certainty that whoever it was would go in. That coincided with
the political changes that meant that, on the unionist side at that

I do not want to dwell on the past. A number of points have been raised
today about the future and possible destabilising trends—some of
which might or might not eventuate—and it is important that we
do not sleepwalk into this possible crisis with the Executive and the
institutions. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, asked a profound
question, and one way of considering the implications of the question
is that some of the parties, at least, to the current arrangements may
no longer have precisely the same investment in those arrangements that
they once had. If possible, there should be a dialogue or discussion in
the Assembly with a view always to maintaining the stability of
Northern Ireland, because there is a possibility, for the reasons
mentioned by the noble Lords, Lord Kilclooney and Lord Trimble, that we
are sleepwalking into a crisis with these institutions. The noble Lord,
Lord Browne, is right: these institutions have delivered a form of
stability for some years now, but that does not mean that they will
continue to do so. I would like reassurance that the Government are

sleepwalking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022582000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022582000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Maginnis of Drumglass" PimsId="1643" UID="14022582000070" xid="1652" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022582000070">Lord

apologise for intervening at this late stage and for not having been

detailed to find out some information about a serious event that took
place in 2006. I have only just received the information that the
person who was suspected of the Regent’s Park bombing many years
ago was arrested by the Metropolitan Police some time past and was able
to pull out of his pocket a letter dated 2006 which said that he would
no longer be deemed a terrorist. Over the past few months, a court
case, held virtually in secret, has revealed that 187 terrorists were
given that letter in 2006, saying that, although they were terrorists,
they would no longer be deemed to be so. How can we vote with any
assuredness on this Bill when we discover belatedly that, subsequent to
the St Andrews agreement, this sort of behind-backs, underhand deal was
carried out by the Government at that

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, this debate has been
interesting, as was the one in Committee, although that was without the
wisdom of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble; I say his name carefully. We
have benefited enormously from the experience of noble Lords here this
evening: this is the value of debates in your Lordships’ House

ensure that governance in Northern Ireland is based on a strong
cross-community partnership. I readily accept that there is no system
for electing the First and Deputy First Ministers that we all would
consider perfect. Indeed, the current system may not be perfect. Let us
not forget where Northern Ireland had been during the four and a half
years leading up to 2006. It was a major step forward to have the
institutions up and running again after being 
<?notus-xml column=891?>suspended for that time. That was the purpose of the
St Andrews agreement, the ongoing discussions which came from it and
the legislation subsequently passed by your Lordships’ House and
the other place. For three and a half of those four and a half years I
was a Minister in Northern Ireland, and it was a difficult, tense time,
as noble Lords here tonight will know better than I. When I flew out to
Belfast on my first day, I was told I should expect to be a Minister
for about six months. When I left three and a half years later, the
Assembly was still not restored. It was a very serious and difficult
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022582000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022582000030">Since
the St Andrews agreement changed the arrangements, we have had the
longest period of stable government in Northern Ireland in a
generation. That is not to be underestimated or dismissed lightly. Many
positives proceeded from that agreement. I understand why this
amendment has been brought forward and the reasons for it, but it takes
apart one part of the agreement that was agreed in your
Lordships’ House and the other place through legislation. We
have heard very eloquently from the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, why the
popular 1998 agreement for electing First Ministers and Deputy First
Ministers required the direct involvement of the Assembly.
He and others welcomed that very clear demonstration of cross-community
support. If we were to return to the pre-St Andrews system at this
stage, it would have to be done by cross- community consensus and
agreement, and I really do not think that we have achieved that at
present. I understand the reason for tabling the amendment, but at the
moment we do not have the agreement and cross-community support
necessary to achieve it. We have to understand the reasons why that
came about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022582000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022582000031">In
this debate and others that we have had today, wider issues have been
raised by several noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Bew and
Lord Trimble, about the disengagement of local people in Northern
Ireland. We have talked about it in terms of the Assembly, but there is
also the wider political context. That is not peculiar to Northern
Ireland, but I understand the concerns about it relating to Northern
Ireland. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Bew, referred to it as a
destabilising trend. All sides of your Lordships’ House want
confidence in the system and the Assembly. We want the stability of the
Assembly to be entrenched and enhanced. That will not be done just by
the institutions or the apparatus of democracy; it is far deeper than
that. Perhaps there may be an opportunity for further discussion in
your Lordships’ House—I do not think that tonight is the
time—to address those issues to bring the entrenched stability

was enacted through the legislation which followed the St Andrews

note the statement of the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of

require cross-community support. She is right. That is how the
agreement was made. The agreement was made based on a broad
support —a “sufficient
consensus” as we called it—and the majority of unionists
and the majority of nationalists supported it in the talks. If you are
going to make a change to it—although no express provision has
been made as to how changes should take place—then the noble

I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T19:29:44"></hs_TimeCode> was finding it
somewhat difficult to follow what the Minister was saying at some
points, but I think it is absolutely clear that the change to the
identification of First and Deputy First Ministers was not actually in
what is called the St Andrews agreement. It came into the legislation
to implement it, but it only popped up at the last minute without any
coherent explanation of where it came from, and with no indication that
there was the sort of cross-community support that ought to have been
sought for it. People say going back would be a bad thing to do. The
Minister says that going back would have limited support in Northern
Ireland. The original agreement had a referendum, and it was supported
by an overwhelming majority; that referendum is ignored. It has been
said many times in this debate that we should not upset the devolution
settlement. The devolution settlement was upset, peremptorily. That is
undeniable. Consequently this is something to which we will return,
until we get things sorted out on this. We have at present a bad system
which may have bad consequences; I hear what the Minister says about
not sleepwalking and I hope that that is the case. We shall see. Let us
make sure that we do what we can to ensure that there is no
sleepwalking. I think I can guarantee the Minister and the Northern
Ireland office that we will return to this aspect of this issue, to try
and ensure that people are on top of this. We have a rotten system
which may turn round to bite us. This is not the time to press the
matter further. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

this opportunity of introducing the report of the commission, which I
was honoured to be asked to chair, on the future of advice and legal
support on social welfare law in England and Wales. I am grateful to
all those who have put their names down to speak—it is quality
more than quantity tonight. I am particularly honoured that the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough should have chosen to make
his maiden speech in this debate and I am sure that we are all looking
forward to what he has to say with eager anticipation. I am also
looking forward to hearing what the Minister has to say with eager
anticipation. I must place on record my appreciation of the
contribution of my fellow commissioners and our hard-working secretary
and researcher, Richard Gutch and Sara Ogilvie, for this was truly a
team effort and we had a brilliant team.</hs_para>

Government’s austerity measures, there have been significant
reductions, estimated by the Government to save £89 million a
year, in the scope of legal aid for issues of social welfare law. These
are for things such as benefit, debts, employment, immigration,
education and many aspects of housing. This is compounded by reductions
in local government funding for advice and legal support, which are
likely to amount to at least a further £40 million by 2015. Some
local authorities are cutting virtually all not-for-profit provision in
response to the cuts in funding from central government approaching 40%
by 2016.</hs_para>

retrenching on a significant scale, yet the demand for advice and legal
support has never been greater and can only grow further as the
Government’s welfare reforms are rolled out. I could tell your
Lordships harrowing tales of the serious consequences for the advice
sector, and therefore for individuals needing support, of the almost
complete removal from scope of welfare benefits advice. However, partly
because of time and the need for brutal summary, I prefer to
concentrate in a more dispassionate way on what we are suggesting to
address the problem. I do not think that anyone doubts that the
austerity measures, however necessary, have left us with a real
problem.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022584000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000004">We
were under pressure to recommend simple reinstatement of the cuts from
two quarters: from lawyers, of course, who thought that our
recommendations focused too much on the front end of the legal journey
and insufficiently recognised the importance of legal interventions for
resolving social welfare problems; and from those who resist any change
in patterns of funding for public services, such as the introduction of
the market. However, in a situation where we have to accept that there
will be less money for legal help and representation, we were anxious
to develop a fresh approach which, through measures to reduce the need
for advice and legal support in the first place—developing more
cost-effective approaches to service provision and drawing on a wider
range of funding sources than hitherto—ensured that people could
still meet a lot of their needs through a greater emphasis on
information and advice, while ensuring that there is at least some
money available for legal help and representation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022584000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000005">Rather than
recommending simple reinstatement, we preferred to think in terms of a
continuum of provision including public legal education, informal 
<?notus-xml column=895?>and formal information and general advice—often provided by local
authorities—specialist advice, legal help and legal
representation. We took the view that it was important to tackle the
whole of this continuum in an integrated fashion and that legal aid
should be seen as just one part of it, not in isolation as a
stand-alone funding mechanism. We do not underestimate the importance
of legal interventions for solving people’s problems. Sometimes
it takes a lawyer to bring a recalcitrant defendant to the table.
However, with cuts of the order of £100 million a year in legal
aid, it seemed clear to us that the advice end of the spectrum was
going to need to take more of the strain. The more we can do at the
beginning of the process, we reckoned, the less we may need to do at
the end. However, we are absolutely clear that there needs to be
provision for legal help and representation at the legal end of the
spectrum<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T19:34:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sector is not beyond improvement. There was a general perception that
it is too fragmented and could benefit from rationalisation from closer
working together and a greater spirit of collaboration. We would also
like to see the national umbrella bodies, such as Citizens Advice and
AdviceUK, working more closely together and sharing their resources and
experience more widely. AdviceUK told us about a system in Portsmouth
based on what it calls “systems thinking”. It moved from
a system that involved waiting for two hours, seeing a volunteer for 20
minutes then making an appointment to see a
specialist—altogether potentially involving 13 steps before
seeing an adviser who would help you—to a system that dispensed
with triage or rationing, put specialist staff in the front line, with
expertise in one area but able to pull in others as necessary rather
than simply referring on, enabling you to see someone within 20
minutes. It has shown that approaches such as this can achieve savings
of at least 30% and sometimes, as in its work in Nottingham, as much as
95%. Although it may seem like a Rolls-Royce service it can end up
costing less in the long
run<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T19:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recommendations but the six most important are: first, that public
legal education should be given higher priority, both in school
alongside financial literacy and in education for life, so that people
know their rights and where to go for help. Secondly, though there are
certainly factors making for increased demand in the welfare reforms
and other austerity measures, we are convinced there are also ways of
reducing the need for advice and legal support in the first place. For
example, the DWP could be incentivised to get more decisions right
first time by being required to pay costs on upheld appeals. Thirdly,
we suggest ways in which courts and tribunals could be made to work
more efficiently. Fourthly, the next UK and Welsh Governments should
develop national strategies for advice and legal support, preferably
with all-party support and there should be a Minister with
responsibility for advice and legal support within the MoJ with a
cross-departmental brief for leading the development of the strategy.
Fifthly, local authorities or groups of local authorities should
coproduce or commission local advice and legal support plans with the
local not-for-profit sector and commercial advice agencies. Sixthly, we
estimate that a further £100 million 
<?notus-xml column=896?>a year is required to ensure a basic level of provision of information,
advice and legal support on social welfare law.</hs_para>

are calling on the next UK Government to provide half of this by
establishing a 10-year—to enable long-term
planning—national advice and legal support fund for England and
Wales of £50 million a year to be administered by the Big
Lottery Fund. We aim to spread the load so that no part of government
is asked to bear too great a burden. We therefore propose that the fund
should be financed by the MoJ, the Cabinet Office and the DWP, as the
main creator of the need for advice and legal support. Some 90% of the
fund should be used to fund local provision in line with local plans,
with 10% for national initiatives. The Big Lottery Fund should allocate
the 90% share of the national fund to local authority areas, based on
indicators of need using joint strategic needs assessments and health
and well-being
strategies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T19:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>. We

to be targeted at those most in need. In addition to the current range

were not arguing for a simple restoration of the cuts, that does not
mean that we would not like to see any of them reversed. We would like
to see funding reinstated for housing cases, for instance, so that
people can get help before they reach crisis point and face imminent
eviction. The scheme for the funding of exceptional cases under Section
10 of the LASPO Act needs to be reviewed, because as things stand it is
just not working. This was intended to act as a safety net for funding
cases that would now be out of scope of legal aid but where either
human rights or EU law required the provision of legal aid. During the
passage of the LASPO Act, it was estimated that there would be between
5,000 and 7,000 of these cases a year, but a Parliamentary Answer on 11
February this year stated that the total number of applications so far
was only 1,030, of which only 31 had been granted.</hs_para>

strategy is to suggest ways of reducing preventable demand, simplifying
the system and enabling it to work better, putting more weight on the
advice end of the spectrum and suggesting ways in which it could work
more efficiently. We believe that by investing in a wider range of
information and advice, with some legal help and representation, many
of the undesirable consequences of the LASPO Act can be avoided and we
will actually end up saving money. I hope very much that the Minister
will find not only that there are things in our report with which he
can agree but that it makes a useful contribution to the stabilisation
and rehabilitation of our system of advice and legal support on social
welfare

some good news because for years now the position has looked bleak and
depressing, getting worse month after month. The truth is that social
welfare law has been decimated over the past four years. That is
because the Government seem to have decided as a matter of policy that
access to legal advice for some people—often the poor, often the
disabled, often the acutely vulnerable—in order to deal with
those areas of law that affect everyday life, such as housing, debt,
welfare benefits, employment and immigration, is not even a necessity,
let alone a priority. This government policy is seen most obviously in
LASPO itself and its implementation since 1 April last year.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Low, and his commissioners have been ingenious in
their recommendations in seeking out funding streams from a number of
sources. I fully support the concept outlined in the report that there
should be a national strategy for advice and legal support in England,
and hope that the current Welsh Labour Government will develop a
similar strategy in Wales, although their general lack of vision does
not make me too
optimistic.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14022584000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000027">Noble
Lords will also recall that we on these Benches warned the Government

that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14022584000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000057">“the
present proposals risk creating advice and representation deserts where
no appropriate legal advice or representation is available. This the
Government have recognised, but the proposals also risk creating
specialism deserts. The danger of advice deserts could be addressed by
increasing the number of providers in more sparsely populated areas.
The specialism issue is more difficult”.—[<I>Official

that context I will draw your Lordships’ attention to Wales. I
am impressed that a member of the commission was Mr Bob Chapman, a
member of the committee of the Administrative Justice and Tribunals
Council in Wales and chair of the trustee board of the Swansea Neath
Port Talbot Citizens Advice Bureau. It is clear from reading the report
that Welsh issues have not been
overlooked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000029">The
report points out that the Independent Advice Providers Forum has
collected evidence that £4.1 million-worth of cuts in Wales
kicked in from April 2013, £2.4 million of which were
from the loss of legal aid contracts, and the rest from reductions in
Welsh government, local authority, European and other funding from
corporate and charitable sources. In its place the Advice Services
Transition Fund intends to put just over £1 million back into
advice services in Wales. I fear that even that dire conclusion may be
too
optimistic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000030">On
this very day, Powys County Council is meeting to consider its budget.
It will be considering the recommendation of its cabinet to cut funding
to citizens advice bureaux throughout the county. At first the cabinet
said that it would be cut entirely, but last week it compromised. The
proposal that is being debated today is to cut funding for the CAB by
half in the current year and reduce it to zero in the following year.
The chairman of the trustees of the Powys CAB, Chris Mann, says of
this:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14022584000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000054">“Without
core funding from the County Council, Powys CAB will lose all other
sources of grants. These pay specialist and professional advisers on
debt, welfare benefits, employment and housing and allow our volunteers
to assist clients on a range of pressing social
issues”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14022584000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000050">The
other sources of grants to which Mr Mann refers are contracts worth
some £336,000 for the provision of essential services to the
residents of Powys. Without 
<?notus-xml column=900?>core funding from the council, the highly skilled paid staff will lose
their jobs, and the volunteers, who are so vital to the CAB, will be
unable to
continue.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14022584000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000031">The
recent history is that in 2013 Powys CAB dealt with 21,000 advice
issues, assisted more than 6,000 clients and secured
£2.2 million in welfare benefit income for its clients. As Mr
Mann points out, this money does not disappear into the air but is
spent locally and supports the local community. It is true that the
council has a small welfare rights unit but it cannot possibly cope
with the work level if the CAB has to close. This is a large area of
Wales, where poverty and rural deprivation are endemic. It is precisely
the sort of area of desert that we foresaw when we were discussing the
LASPO Bill. That is only one example, but it is significant in this
context that, according to the CAB, £71 million—43.8% of
its funding as a whole in 2012-13—came from local government. In
the current year, it expects the percentage to increase to 46.2% from
local government, as funding from legal aid drops from £21
million to just £6.5 million. This is a tragedy that is going
to happen in vast areas of the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000032">Perhaps
the most impressive aspect of the commission’s report is that it
does not seek to wind the clock back to the pre-LASPO position but
recognises realities. Suggested funders include the Money Advice
Service, the Department for Work and Pensions, the NHS, local
government, trusts and foundations, as well as the legal profession
through pro bono and dormant funds. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Bach, that all political parties, in fashioning their manifestos for a
future Parliament, should take all the commission’s
recommendations on
board.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000033">Finally,
I very much look forward to the contribution of the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough. He spent eight years as Archdeacon
of Chester, so I can greet him almost as a neighbour, even though he
was on the wrong side of the border. I also welcome him as a graduate
of Peterhouse in Cambridge to join our hardcore Petrean group in the
House of Lords, with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick,
and others. I am sure that he will add lustre to our
deliberations.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14022584000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000061">7.57

Woolf (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Low,
for arranging this debate and I join in the chorus of congratulations
to the noble Lord and his fellow commissioners on their excellent
report. I am not surprised that the report should be
excellent; I use that word in referring to it because, having
regard to the commission’s membership, about which comment has
already been made, I expected no
less.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000035">The
person whom I wish to single out is Amanda Finlay. Not only was she
vice-chairman of the commission, she was a most valued member of the
team which worked on my report on access to justice in 1998. I hope
your Lordships will forgive me if I make a comment or two about the
relevance of my report in the context of the report by the noble Lord,
Lord Low, because there are similarities. His report covers some of the
same ground, although my report was primarily concerned with the
procedures in courts that were making it difficult for the majority of
litigants to 
<?notus-xml column=901?>obtain the access to justice to which they were
entitled if they were going to be engaged in litigation. The Low
commission’s concerns, as we have heard, were much wider. It was
concerned with courts and tribunals, but I think that was a minority
part of its
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000036">The
Low commission’s main concern, as we have heard from the noble
Lord, Lord Low, is the stressed position of those who need assistance
in obtaining the help that they are entitled to under the welfare
provisions of the law. As we have heard, it is a section of the
community in the greatest need of help, and the state is under a
fundamental and basic obligation to ensure that, so far as possible,
its needs are met. As we have heard, the people in this group have been
doubly disadvantaged: first, because of the pressures that have made
them resort to the state to provide them with the means of meeting
their basic needs; and, secondly, because their ability to receive the
assistance that is necessary to ensure that they obtain the benefits to
which they are entitled in law has been substantially reduced because
of the cuts in legal aid and the reduction in funding that has occurred
due to the need for austerity.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Bach, that when one looks at the contents of the
report as a whole, although it reveals an extremely worrying situation,
there are signs of good news. Those signs confirm what I believe to be
the case—that if we take a broad, holistic view of the
situation, there are ways in which the effect of the deficit in
assistance, which is inevitable in view of the cuts that have been
made, can be mitigated by appropriate action. The noble Lord, Lord Low,
has referred to the type of action that is required. Of course, we have
heard the clamour in the media over food banks. That has vividly
demonstrated that the conferring of rights on members of the public is
of little value if those rights are not complied with in a way that
enables them to receive the benefits to which the law entitles
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022584000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000038">I hope
that I can claim that, to an extent, the problems in the courts to
which I have referred were mitigated by the steps taken in consequence
of my report. They included a change in culture on the part of the
judiciary and the legal profession over the past few years, which has
meant that the needs of the less fortunate members of the community are
taken care of in a way that was not always so obvious in the past.

that the Low commission’s report gives the Government an
opportunity to secure a substantial improvement in the situation
regarding welfare benefits. Even in these days of austerity, they
should be able to take advantage of that opportunity in a way that will
benefit the section of the public to which I have been referring. If
that is to be done, it is essential that we take advantage of all the
new methods of communication that now exist. Those methods enable an
amazing amount of information to be provided, which could be very
helpful to those who seek the benefits to which they are
entitled.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022584000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000040">In
different areas of the country there have been experiments that have
demonstrated beyond doubt what can be achieved. They are set out in the
Low commission’s report and are prominent in the 100
recommendations the commission makes. The core of the majority of those
recommendations is that they 
<?notus-xml column=902?>are designed to meet the need for advice. I have no doubt that the
national advice helpline that the commission recommends would be of
value, as is the kiosk that exists in Cambridge, which was used by
65,000 people in 12 months. Those sorts of initiatives have got to be
extended. I hope that, in setting out these various trials, the report
will help the Government with what surely must be the objective of any
Government—namely, to do what they can to ease the problems of
those members of the community most in need of assistance.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022584000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000041">The commission also
stresses the importance of education. Increasing the use of education
will not change the situation overnight, but in the long term that must
be very important as well. I suggest that the position is extremely
urgent; no delay should be allowed to occur. The report deserves, and
should receive, an immediate and strong endorsement by those in charge
today. The present Government cannot hide behind the fact that there is
going to be an election in a few months’ time. Action can start
to be taken now and plans can be made. That applies to the Opposition
as well as to the Government. I look forward to the responses from both
the opposition spokesman and the Minister to what we are hearing this
evening. Like other noble Lords, I, too, very much look forward to the
maiden speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Peterborough.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/960392F0803801E282B48A092E5A7C2B7A684575" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 February 2014">Tuesday,

suppose it to be inevitable that cuts in government spending, however
necessary they may be, will always hit the poorest most. It is
therefore all the more important to give attention to ways of helping
the most vulnerable to claim and receive the support to which they are

that: I welcome it most warmly and hope that Her Majesty’s

too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000044">Three
particular themes of the report resonate with me. The vision of equal
access to justice, with the recommendation of a national strategy for
advice and legal support agreed by all parties, is most welcome and
would make a real difference. The vision of holistic systems thinking,
with its direct addressing of poor and disconnected services, such as
those described in the Nottingham study, makes complete sense. The
emphasis on local provision, including from the voluntary sector, but
requiring better training and co-ordination, is absolutely right. Those
three themes, if implemented, would lead to better governance, fairer
access and a less divided
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000045">I

described in the Low commission’s

am privileged to be a trustee of the Farming Community Network,
formerly the Farm Crisis Network, and am well aware of how difficult it
is for some struggling farmers to access advice through the statutory
channels. Our towns in the diocese I serve, including Corby, Kettering,
Northampton, Wellingborough and the City of Peterborough, have their
fair share of poor, white, excluded communities, many of whose
inhabitants would benefit from supportive advice and advocacy. I spend
time visiting our prisons, and am excited by the activities of
charities which help prisoners to find housing or work when they are
released. However, I am only too conscious that for many their
functional illiteracy and innumeracy, and their all too common
psychiatric disorders and behavioural problems, place them at a huge
disadvantage in trying to become contributing members of society. I
also visit and take an interest in psychiatric hospitals where I meet
both in-patients and out-patients who need help and advice to cope with
the pressures of life. At Peterborough Cathedral we have regular
meetings for Armed Forces veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress
disorder; again good people do their best to support them, but the
necessary legal and other professional advice seems to be in short
supply. All these people and groups need to know that they are valued,
that society cares for them and wants to help them and that our
affluent country has time and resources for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022584000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022584000047">I notice
that one of the bodies listed as having made a submission to the Low
commission is the Peterborough citizens advice bureau. My chaplain is a
trustee of that charity, and I follow its important work with some
interest. Thanks to the collaborative partnership-working instigated by
Peterborough City Council its funding has not been as badly affected in
recent years as some other CABs. However, I notice the very significant
increase in the number of cases it has had to deal with. Unique client
numbers have risen from 7,190 in the year ending March 2012 to 8,744
for the first nine months of the current year, with an estimate of
12,000 for the full year. If this is typical of other CABs across the

Lord, Lord Freud, explaining to me during the Welfare Reform Bill that
the new system around universal credit would be simpler, but it is by
no means simple. While I have been disappointed that in this area there
has been a continued failure to conduct a cumulative impact assessment,
I understand why there has not been one. It would have made
uncomfortable reading about how some of the most vulnerable people in

the consequences of LASPO on disabled people, which has been raised
with me by Unity Law, is that it has shifted the costs of civil
litigation in

with recoverable insurance premiums for claimants as a result. Because
Equality Act cases do not include a claim for personal injury, but
rather compensation for injury to feelings, and a request for
reasonable adjustments, these cases are not cost-shifted and the
insurance premium is needed to protect disabled people against the
costs of

lawyers, and not for the first time do I regret studying only politics

vast majority have been from disabled people asking for help in

on the curriculum right away, along with good sports

perhaps still need to do more to ensure that disabled people have

for the report of my noble friend Lord Low, I express deep admiration

and encouraged. The element of despair comes from the appreciation that
the report brings of the state in which we now find ourselves. Step by
step, we have got into a position of real difficulty, in which so many
gaps exist right across the system where legal advice and support are
not available. It would be wrong to say that we have sleepwalked into
this problem, because so many people have been advising Governments,
particularly this one, time and again, that cutting back so much on

me give one particular example based on my own experience in dealing
with students in two of the Scottish universities. I know that the

not all that different; the problems are very similar. One 
<?notus-xml column=907?>thing that has been growing, both in Scottish universities and certainly
in the universities in England and Wales as well, is an appreciation by
students of the gaps that emerge and the part that they can play in
filling them by providing legal advice where it is needed. There are
two particular projects that I know about, one of which was started in
2003 by the University of Strathclyde Law Clinic, which is the largest
of these institutions in Scotland, with 195 student advisers, and more
recently the Aberdeen Law Project, which started in 2009 and has much
the same ambitions, conducting much the same kind of
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T20:24:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022589000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022589000017">These
projects are guided by lawyers within the academic community. They are
also funded, to a very substantial degree, by law firms. It is a pro
bono exercise. DLA Piper provides funds for the Strathclyde clinic;
Pinsent Masons provides funds for the Aberdeen Law Project. This is
greatly welcome, for, while the universities themselves would like to
provide financial support, it is very difficult for them to do that,
given the pressures on their own
funding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T20:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government can encourage these projects, one of which was
demonstrated by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland of
Asthal, when she was in government. She encouraged and participated in
an annual awards scheme to student organisations of this kind. It so
happened that Strathclyde won the competition in one of the years I was
chancellor. She was there, she encouraged what they were doing, and she
gave the feeling that the Government were behind what was being done by
these student bodies. That is valuable encouragement. It helps those
who are thinking of providing funding to feel they are doing something
which is in the broad public interest as well as in the interest of the
students

other aspect of the problem is the work done by the courts. The noble
and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, made major strides in simplifying the way
in which the courts go about their work. One point, which I
particularly emphasise, is the way in which he educated us all in the
need for case management, a phrase that I did not encounter in the
early days but is now on everybody’s lips, and it works all the
way down through the system. It is a means of simplifying issues,
working with the litigants in person to be sure that as little time as

is the emphasis in paragraph 5.27 on the need for independent advice. I
thought that was a valuable point, partly because I have been serving
on a Select Committee on personal service companies, a rather
complicated tax matter. Part of the evidence that we have been hearing
comes from people who have been trying to use an advice system that the
HMRC provides for people who think they are in difficulties. The HMRC
says that the advice system is completely independent and that nothing
will be communicated to the tax inspectors. People do not believe it,
and it is underused. There is, therefore, something to be said for the
point drawn attention to in that paragraph—for the Government
appreciating that there are independent advisers who need to be
supported, as well as government-based advice systems.</hs_para>

can be brought to bear to encourage people to seek advice. Younger
people than I have apps attached to their iPhones which have access to

discovering its wonders. Surely there are things the Government could
do to increase the accessibility of advice—of knowledge of how
systems should be made to work in people’s interests and of the
complex system of social benefits. There are avenues to which this

legal aid to assist them. They face the kind of everyday legal problems
which loss of a job, disability or other crises can throw at them.
Examples given in the report include a young couple who were unable to

started suffering from severe anxiety and depression and is in danger

the Government’s latest equality impact assessment, published
after the changes to legal aid were introduced last year, a disturbing
picture is painted of how these changes will impact on people who are
protected by equalities legislation. Around 19% of the general
population can be classified as disabled, but 54% of the people who
sought advice under the legal aid scheme for benefit problems were
classed as disabled. All but a small number of benefit appeal cases
were cut from the scope of legal aid. This will mean many of thousands
of disabled people going without the legal help they
need<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T20:31:41"></hs_TimeCode>. In housing

Organisations opposed to the changes in legal aid, such as the housing
charity Shelter, point out that higher numbers of women seek housing
advice as they are often left on their own to provide for children or
have been forced to move from the family home because of
violence or other abuse. Disabled people are also much more 
<?notus-xml column=909?>likely to face problems with disrepair due to poor housing
conditions. Disrepair cases are often small in value and therefore not
suitable for no-win no-fee arrangements. However, if they go

Asian and minority ethnic communities are more likely to face all of

When people get into difficulty in their daily lives, they need to be

this excellent report. Everyone, regardless of their sex, ethnic 
<?notus-xml column=910?>background or disability should have the right to equality
before the law. There are some excellent suggestions in this report
which will certainly help, but I am deeply concerned that the reduction
in the availability of legal aid, as well as other advice services, is
putting the fundamental principle of a democratic society at

course, that LASPO has reduced the scope for legal aid, it is not a new
problem that there is a gap between what legal aid will support and the
needs of those who have claims or grievances. One has to draw the line
somewhere and there will always be deserving cases that cannot attract
funding. The reality, as we all know, is that there is a finite fund of
money available. The report identifies a number of ways in which this
problem might be addressed, including recommendations for further
government funding. The Minister will, no doubt, tell us what
government support there might be for the Low funding proposals,
including the Government’s view on taxing pay-day lenders.
However, at a time when the Government are still looking to cut
expenditure, I am not optimistic that further funding will be
available. I would therefore like to propose that much more might be
done by the private sector on a voluntary basis.</hs_para>

The truth is that so much of what we do with the best intentions ends
up unimplemented, misunderstood or not understood at all.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T20:42:31"></hs_TimeCode> provision of
education in schools is declining and not improving. Citizenship
education is not part of the inspected curriculum. It is part of the
curriculum overall but it is not inspected by Ofsted. Citizenship does
not have to be taught at all by academies and free
schools—roughly half of schools. The number of teachers training
to teach citizenship is declining rapidly, as is the number of pupils
taking citizenship. That is down to 2% for GCSE citizenship and only 8%
for the half GCSE. The situation could not be
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022589000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022589000047">Section

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join previous speakers in
congratulating the right reverend Prelate on a notable maiden speech
and in expressing profound gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Low, and
his colleagues, for their comprehensive and lucid analysis of the
problems of accessing advice and legal support in this critical area of
social welfare law, and for the constructive proposals contained in the
report.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022589000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022589000050">The
landscape the report describes is changing as a result of changes in
the financial and, I would argue, political climate. Where once a
thriving network of advice services, citizens advice bureaux, law
centres, voluntary organisations and professionals was able to support
people in times of great difficulty, we are now seeing virtual advice
deserts—to use the phrase deployed by the noble Lord, Lord
Thomas—within which an occasional oasis can be found, struggling
with soaring demand and diminishing resources. As the report
demonstrates, and as we have heard today, a number of law centres have
closed, with more to come, while the survivors operate with reduced
staffing. CABs, serving more than 2 million clients nationally, face
shrinking budgets, while the impact of reductions in legal aid and
advice increases pressure on them.</hs_para>

Lordships’ House have a long and active relationship with the
voluntary sector, especially the advice sector. As a solicitor, I
undertook legal aid work. I did pro bono advice sessions with the
Newcastle CAB. I helped found the Wallsend CAB in 1973. I initiated the
Newcastle Welfare Rights Service as chairman of social services in
1974, and as council leader supported the creation of the Newcastle Law
Centre in 1978. The situation of that law centre, the only one between
Kirklees and the Scottish border, is dire. From a staff of 14, with
five qualified lawyers, it is now down to one solicitor and one
adviser, with three staff. It does not undertake legal aid
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022589000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022589000052">The
Newcastle CAB faces similar difficulties. It no longer has any legal
aid funding. Its brilliant chief executive, Shona Alexander, has set
out in the starkest terms the current position that she, her staff and
volunteers, and, most importantly, her clients, now face. Staffing has
fallen from 26 to 19, none legally qualified, and 11 of them on
contracts expiring in March next year. Funding for a debt adviser by a
local charity is ceasing and a full-time adviser and part-time
administrator will be made redundant. The bureau’s 
<?notus-xml column=913?>opening hours have been reduced and demand is such that the bureau
closes its doors after half an hour because it cannot accommodate in
its waiting room the many people who wish to attend drop-in sessions.
The average time taken to advise each client has increased by 50% or
more because of the triple whammy of legal aid disappearing, welfare
changes and cuts in public services. There is now no funding for
interpreters or medical reports, and recently there has been difficulty
with deaf clients, with interpreters charging the bureau £70 for
an interview. Shona Alexander

if all this were not enough, there is the difficulty, mentioned in the
report, of clients obtaining telephone advice from government

Shona Alexander refers to two areas of high demand: welfare rights and

the city’s service is fully stretched, the CAB caters for

specialist worker is fully booked dealing with complex cases and

of this catalogue of difficulty is unique to Newcastle, as the report

constructive proposals in the report. Like others, I was particularly
attracted to the idea of public legal education that the commission
seeks to promote. Will the Government revive the programme initiated by
the previous Government, which, as my noble friend Lord Bach reminded
us, they abandoned some four years ago? Will they review urgently the
areas of welfare law now excluded from legal aid, particularly those
highlighted by the commission in its report—again, this was
stressed by the noble Lord, Lord Low, tonight—in relation to
housing disrepair, harassment and eviction and disbursements for
benefits advice? Will they fund the advice required for applications
for exceptional funding and revisit the imposition of fees for
employment tribunal applications? For that matter, will they disavow
any intention of charging claimants fees to access decision-making and

hope that the Government will endorse the suggestion of local and
national advice plans, adopt the proposals to ensure quality of

relatively modest demands for additional resources but I am slightly
apprehensive about the call for local government to fund an extra
£50 million. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, pointed out,
councils already contribute 46% of the funding to CABs—some
£73 million nationally. Many, including most of the areas where
demand for advice and assistance in welfare matters is most acute, are
facing unprecedented cuts in funding for mainline services, including
statutory services. Requiring additional expenditure would constitute a
“new burden”, which, under the Government’s own
new burdens doctrine, should be funded by government and not by further
cuts to existing
provision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022589000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0002.htm#14022589000058">However,
I have a suggestion to make. Many people, alas, have suffered terribly
from the recent floods. I hope that that damage will be made good by
insurance; according to the industry, the cost will apparently be some
billions of pounds. Most of us pay insurance premiums. Funding the
commission’s proposals in this report would represent a mere
fraction of the cost of repairing that flood damage. Could we not, as a
society, treat the emergency situations that so often overwhelm our
vulnerable fellow citizens—including many disabled people, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, pointed out—in the realm
of social welfare law as something that we could collectively insure
via a modest hypothecated surcharge on our insurance
premiums? I invite the Government to consider and cost that

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Faulks)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by congratulating the noble Lord,
Lord Low, on securing this debate and restating my belief, and the
Government’s belief, in publicly funded legal services as an
integral part of the justice system. All speakers
have made valuable contributions 
<?notus-xml column=915?>to this debate but I am sure that noble Lords will forgive me if I
single out the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Peterborough for
his excellent maiden speech. It is clear from his description of the
wide variety of people and situations which he encounters in his
diocese that he will be able to bring many valuable insights into our
debates. I am very glad to welcome him.</hs_para>

Government’s continued commitment to the justice system, any
discussion on legal aid funding must focus on the spending that
taxpayers fund and must recognise the financial realities we continue
to face. As noble Lords are aware, legal aid was introduced more than
60 years ago. It has expanded very considerably in scope to become,
arguably, something it was never intended to be. The Government were,
until recently, spending scarce resources—in effect rather
encouraging people to take their problems straight to court rather than
trying to achieve successful and often enduring resolution of disputes
in different ways.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022589000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0003.htm#14022589000062">The Government were
forced therefore to take a fresh look and did not embark on the reform
programme lightly. However, the fiscal challenge and the spending
review settlement required all departments to look critically at where
they were spending money, the effectiveness of those interventions and
whether they could continue to be justified. A conscious decision was
taken, following the public consultation that led to the LASPO Act,
that spending the limited taxpayer funding available to the Ministry of
Justice on social welfare law matters, when the majority of problems in
this area did not require legal expertise to resolve, could not be
justified. This and other difficult choices were scrutinised, amended
and debated by Parliament after a thorough and wide-ranging public
consultation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022589000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0003.htm#14022589000063">People do not always
need lawyers in cases involving divorce, employment, education disputes
and debt problems, and courts should be a last resort rather than a
first one. These are the types of problems that can and should be
resolved before tribunals or similar bodies, which are designed to be
accessed by unrepresented individuals. However, with the introduction
of the LASPO Act—and this is often forgotten—we
safeguarded legal aid to ensure that it was targeted to those who
needed it most, for the most serious cases, in which legal advice or
representation is justified.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022589000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0003.htm#14022589000064">We estimate that
following the introduction of LASPO around £50 million will
still be available in legal aid for social welfare law, which will fund
community care and other high-priority debt and housing cases. For
those who need or choose to go to court, but who fall outside the scope
of the legal aid scheme, there are other resources available in other
forms. There are a diverse range of services available that recognise
and match the differing needs of individuals, helping them to navigate
the system and resolve their problems. I accept that the challenge is
to ensure that relevant services continue to be available in a
sustainable way. We have seen industries innovate and modernise to
address changing needs and environments. It is essential that the
advice sector does so too. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, spoke
of the increased use of technology. There is also the support for legal
initiatives. My noble friend Lord Gold referred to pro bono
contributions from young solicitors.</hs_para>

the Government have recognised the various pressures that the
not-for-profit advice sector would face, as different funding sources
were affected as a range of organisations reviewed their funding
positions in the light of the changing fiscal environment. That is why
the Cabinet Office led a review looking at the long-term sustainability
of the not-for-profit advice sector. The Advice Services Review report,
published in October 2012, acknowledged that the Government have a role
in supporting the sector to adapt to the new funding realities but also
made it clear that advice providers would need to take the initiative
and change the way they work, adopting often a more collaborative
approach with partner organisations across the sector to ensure the
long-term sustainability of
supply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022589000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0003.htm#14022589000066">In
fact, the Government did not wait for the outcome of that report. Since
2010 the Government have provided significant additional support over
and above their usual funding to a range of front-line advice
organisations such as Shelter, CABs and law centres that provide direct
advice to clients on matters such as social welfare law, to help them
adapt and make the transition to the new funding climate. This includes
providing half of the £68-million advice services transition
fund, launched in November 2012 and administered by the Big Lottery
Fund, which was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Low. This fund has
provided a total of 228 grants of between £50,000 and
£350,000, which are specifically available during 2013-15 to
help the sector to address immediate need and help to strengthen
organisations for the demands that lie
ahead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022589000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0003.htm#14022589000067">The
Ministry of Justice itself has worked collaboratively with relevant
partners in the sector to ensure that clients continue to be supported
even after the introduction of LASPO. In the lead-up to the
introduction of LASPO, the MoJ developed a targeted communication
strategy to raise awareness of legal aid changes and, in particular, to
signpost clients not eligible for legal aid to relevant alternative
sources.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022589000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-0003.htm#14022589000068">My
officials also worked closely with other government departments, legal
aid providers, advice organisations and relevant third-sector partner
organisations to raise awareness and enable them to provide effective
information about legal aid changes themselves and details about
alternative sources. As part of this, we developed and introduced a new
and simple online service. Those words are easy to utter but, having
actually tried out this service, I can confirm that it is genuinely
simple and can be accessed by those who are not sophisticated in these
matters. It is considerably simpler than, perhaps, buying an air ticket
from a budget supplier. People can check whether they might be eligible
for legal aid. Where they might not be, this service will
signpost them to alternative sources. To date, over 194,000 clients
have used the site to look for assistance, and we continue to work with
legal aid providers and advice organisations on improving
awareness.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/583A00BB36F09D9E538C8F12B452CA78981AA7AA" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 February 2014">Tuesday,

report itself, provided by the noble Lord, Lord Low, and his committee.
I have read it with great interest. There are a number of important
factors about it. I particularly applaud that it does not simply seek
the reinstatement of the status quo ante but rather explores a range of
different possibilities. It will be a considerable source of assistance
to all the parties as they prepare for the election. The colleague 
<?notus-xml column=917?>of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, Andy Slaughter, has said that he will

the report does not duck the fact that there are fiscal challenges
facing this Government, which necessarily means that fewer resources
are available and that hard decisions will have to be made about how
they are spent. I also welcome the recognition that the advice and

time—a point made in the report and by the noble Baroness, Lady

the report. I can confirm that the Ministry of Justice works closely
with other government departments to improve decision-making. We are
also considering the recommendations referring to the way in which Her

tribunals that describes how we are working to improve the system in

exceptional funding scheme and said that the Government were not, in
fact, providing exceptional funding in the way that it was envisaged. I
endeavoured to answer questions on that when they were raised in a
Parliamentary Question recently. The position is that we think it is
working; no doubt the forms might be improved, but we have to provide
funding where there is a potential breach under the European convention

should also make a point about procedure. Rather lazily, we have not
crafted wickedly clever amendments with which to do our probing but are

that will arise from that. I have given her some briefing but I
entirely understand that on some of the questions, which came up just
as I made the final run-through, line by line, she may have to write to
me. In this important area, it really is better to have accurate and
considered responses, rather than hastily cobbled together ones, not
that I suggest that the Ministry of Defence would have hastily cobbled
together answers anyway. That is quite a useful procedure but if we are

which it suggests should be

ratification by a Select Committee takes place, it should have to

not raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe. Should the Single
Source Regulations Office be the sponsoring department? Should the
sponsoring department be the MoD? What about the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills? I have raised this matter with the
Minister on other occasions, not only in this context. Here we have a
department, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, whose
raison d’être is to sell and encourage business and
industry, but the brief of the Ministry of Defence is also to engage in
contracts, selling and so on. Indeed, that ministry sells overseas and
I often wonder why we do not look holistically at how we deal with
selling this country’s products. I wonder why, in the context of
this amendment, the sponsor of the SSRO should be only the Secretary of
State for Defence. Why should it not also or instead be the Secretary
of State for Business, Innovation and

absolutely confident that it provided the right answer. The point I
made was that the SSRO has an interest in value for money, but so has
the Treasury throughout government. I asked to what extent the SSRO
stands free of, or is supervised by, the Treasury. For the record, it
would be helpful to have that point covered once again. If I remember

13 brings into effect Schedule 4, which establishes the governance
structure of the SSRO. In this we have closely followed guidance
published by the Cabinet Office on executive non-departmental public
bodies and have considered existing governance arrangements for similar
bodies, such as Monitor. So we have not started with a blank piece of
paper and, as the Committee will see, with the following key
characteristics of the SSRO, the structure we have created is in common
with other similar public bodies. It has a separate chair and chief
executive and a board which has a majority of non-executive directors,
which is aligned with best practice in the Financial Reporting
Council’s <I>UK Corporate Governance Code</I> and Cabinet Office
guidelines. Non-executive members of the SSRO should be appointed for a
period of between three and six years to assure a staggered process of
appointments to the key positions. There will be a process that allows
the Secretary of State to remove or suspend a member from office on the
grounds of failure to carry out his or her duties, incapacity, such as
ill health, or misconduct, which rightly follows Cabinet Office
guidance on the creation of public bodies. The SSRO will have the
ability to appoint its own employees, which is consistent with
<I>Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments</I>, produced by the Cabinet
Office; and, in accordance with the Cabinet Office’s guidance on
good corporate governance in executive NDPBs, the SSRO’s
committee structure will be the body that makes key binding
determinations, including where there is an appeal from one of the
parties to a qualifying defence contract. We have listened to industry
requests in this area, and have agreed that committees can contain
members who are not employees or members of the
SSRO.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000024">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>

funded by the MoD and industry, but we have agreed with industry that
the MoD will pick up its costs over the first three years, as it is
established and until we determine its precise annual running costs.
The SSRO will be allowed to borrow money only on a temporary basis up
to an overdraft limit set by the Secretary of State. There may be
occasions where the SSRO has a higher number of adjudications or
determinations that it is administering, where it may require
additional resources to meet its objectives in a timely
fashion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000026">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:57:12"></hs_TimeCode>

18G and 18H revolve around a concern, primarily expressed by industry,
but also by the noble Lord, about the independence and impartiality of
the SSRO. I assure noble Lords that we are committed to ensuring that
the SSRO will be both independent and impartial. The credibility of the
new single-source framework rests upon this. For example, the SSRO can
act as an independent adjudicator in the event of disputes between
parties and it is the appeal body to which industry can refer if we
apply a civil penalty to it. Perhaps even more significantly, it
annually recommends the profit rate and recommends changes to the
framework as part of the quinquennial review process. It is the
guardian of the new framework and its impartiality is at the core of
the dual aims under Clause 13 of ensuring a fair and reasonable price
for contractors and value for money for the Government.</hs_para>

the SSRO was perceived as being partial, this would create great
difficulties. If the perception was that it was too biased towards the
Government, shareholders could decide that the defence sector was no
longer worth investing in and our suppliers could be driven to leave
it. If the perception was the other way—as too biased towards
our suppliers—we would seek to change the framework entirely or
we would exempt our contracts from it and thus lose the protections we
are establishing in this Bill. Neither of these outcomes serves either
the MoD or our single-source suppliers. It is the need for independence
and impartiality that has led to our desire to set up the SSRO in the
first place. The current framework requires consensus to 
<?notus-xml column=332?>change. This has meant that for 45 years, any change that one side has
felt puts them at a disadvantage has been blocked. This is the
principal reason why the old system has remained frozen in time for so
long. Consensus will not serve us. The alternative, a statutory
framework determined entirely by the MoD, would always be resisted by
industry. There would be a risk that over time the framework would
become steadily more one-sided and that industry would be driven out of
the sector, so this option is also not desirable. What we need is an
independent body, namely the Single Source Regulations

representatives have looked at some of the provisions of the Bill,
which have given them some concerns that the SSRO will not be
independent. Specifically, they have pointed to the fact that the chair
and other non-executive members are appointed by the Secretary of
State. They consider that this gives the Secretary of State
considerable leverage over the SSRO. There are reasons for this
process, and they do not stem from a desire to exert influence over the
SSRO. We looked at the different models for arm’s-length bodies.
We wanted to give the SSRO as much freedom as possible, including the
ability to recruit its own staff. We did not want the SSRO to be a
servant or an agent of the Crown and thus subservient to Ministers.
These requirements have led to it being designated a non-departmental
public body.</hs_para>

this case, the SSRO will be replacing an existing NDPB, the Review
Board for Government Contracts, which through no fault of its own has
not had the power to amend the current framework. However, noble Lords
will be aware that there is substantial guidance around
non-departmental public bodies. For example, they must be sponsored by
a department which, given the functions of the SSRO, in this case is
the MoD, and the Secretary of State of that department must appoint the
chair and non-executives of the body. I think that that answers the
question put by my noble friend Lord Palmer. The independence of the

be an independent SSRO board. I do not think adding the need for the
appointment of the chair and other non-executive members to be ratified

additional step. The process of pre-appointment approval by Select
Committee was introduced in 2007, and there has been discussion between
the Government and the House of Commons Liaison Committee over which

this points to the considerable efforts we have made to ensure that the
SSRO will be independent. The fact that the Secretary of State appoints
the chair is not what will determine the independence and impartiality
of the SSRO. It is its statutory aims, namely to balance the interests
of value for money and a fair and reasonable price. It is the
recruitment process of the chair and board, which I have just explained
in some detail. It is the nature of its functions, which are set out in
the Bill, and it is its freedom to determine its own processes and
recruit its own staff. Finally, it is the checks and balances that the
SSRO, like all public bodies, is subject to—for example, the
Competition and Markets Authority and the National Audit Office. It is
the fact that the SSRO’s chief executive officer will be an
accounting officer, and that its chair can be brought before a
parliamentary committee at any
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000038">Amendment
18H, the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:07:38"></hs_TimeCode> second
in this group, also revolves around the independence and impartiality
of the SSRO. Paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 to the Bill 
<?notus-xml column=334?>requires the SSRO to appoint a committee for the purpose of making any
opinion or determination in response to a referral, and that such a
committee must consist of three people, at least one of whom must not
be a member or employee of the SSRO. Determinations are to be made on a
majority basis, and this amendment would require that a majority of the
committee must not be members or employees of the SSRO. In effect, this
amendment would increase the number of committee members who must be
external to the SSRO from at least one to at least two out of
three.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000039">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:08:24"></hs_TimeCode>
note that the current drafting does not prevent a majority, or indeed
all, of the members of the committee being external to the SSRO should
that be appropriate, for example to assist with capacity or specific
additional expertise. Since no amendment is necessary to allow a
majority of the committee to be appointed externally to the SSRO, I
assume that the intent of this amendment stems from an underlying
concern that the SSRO itself will not be an impartial body. I will
return to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000040">Matters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:08:56"></hs_TimeCode>
that may be referred to the SSRO are almost all of a technical nature.
The SSRO, as guardian of the framework, will hold an expert
understanding of the issues that are brought to it, and an appreciation
of the broader context of the framework within which the referral sits.
It will be bound by its statutory aim of ensuring a fair and reasonable
price and value for money. For these reasons, we consider the SSRO to
be best placed to make these technical determinations. Indeed, it is
one of the primary functions the SSRO is being created to
fulfil.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000041">Industry
has, throughout our engagement with it over the past two years,
continued to express its concern over independence and impartiality. I
have addressed much of our response to this concern in my comments on
the previous amendment, and while we understand the concern, we do not
share it. The existing requirement that at least one member of the
committee be external to the SSRO was specifically introduced in
response to industry’s concern over the impartiality of the
determination committees. For the many reasons already discussed, we
believe that the SSRO will be independent and impartial. In the
unlikely event that a committee displays partiality, the independent
member of the committee may raise a red card. In the extreme, they
could remove themselves from the committee, making it no longer
quorate. We consider that this is sufficient to address that concern.
Beyond addressing the perceived impartiality of the SSRO, we consider
that requiring a majority of the committee to be external to the SSRO
will be to the detriment of the efficiency and effectiveness of the
SSRO’s function to provide expert determinations, without any
change to the committee’s
impartiality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000042">Requiring
another member to be external to the SSRO will increase the cost of the
committee as such external members would be expected to be more
expensive than members or staff of the SSRO. It may reduce the
experience and understanding of the technical framework under Part 2
that will be available in the committee’s deliberations. It is
likely to impact on the effective governance of these committees as the
pool of suitably experienced and qualified experts with an
understanding of this technical framework is expected to be relatively
small, so there may be delays in establishing committees 
<?notus-xml column=335?>and in their deliberations owing to the external commitments of members.
Finally, all members of the committee, whether internal or external,
will still be appointed by the SSRO chair. Unless we make the
assumption that members and employees of the SSRO, who are subject to
its dual statutory aims, are somehow less impartial than external
appointees, there is no benefit to increasing the number of external
appointments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000043">For

impartial. If a new system is perceived as too biased towards the

functions being assumed by the SSRO are of most pressing interest to
the MoD rather than any department. They are specialised in nature and
require technical understanding of the specific nature of single-source
procurement as undertaken by the MoD. No other government department
has used the Yellow Book arrangements for many years, and therefore at

circumstances in which, frankly, this whole part of the Bill is

been made. I should like the Minister to set out the circumstances in
which subsection (7) would be used. I have asked the question privately

other area that came to light only when I delved into this with more
care is the fascinating area of critical industrial capability. I am
not sure whether that is the favourite way of referring to the concept
these days, but I am sure that my meaning will emerge. Critical
industrial capability is a concept whereby the taxpayer shovels out an
awful lot of money to various contractors, a substantial part of which
goes to BAE Systems, in order to keep workers on the books who are not
doing work so that they are available to do work later. I am not even
saying that that is wrong. I can see precisely why it makes sense. A
more holistic view of the problem might be to schedule one’s
procurement in a smoother way so that they are working continuously,
but, conceptually, I can see why the former concept is necessary.
However, it is important to realise just how substantial this is. We
had a recent Statement on aircraft carriers. I read what the Minister
said but the BAE Systems press release is in some ways even more
interesting in that it is quite revealing. It

amendments relate to the Secretary of State’s power to exempt
contracts from the new framework, provided for by Clause 14(7).
Amendment 18J has no impact in its own right other than to add scope
for a limitation to the Secretary of State’s exemption power.
That limitation is provided by Amendment 18K. Subsection (7) gives the
Secretary of State the power to exempt individual contracts that would
otherwise be subject to the new regime. While it is not possible to
foresee all future circumstances, this power is considered necessary
for a number of reasons.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022577000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000059">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:27:56"></hs_TimeCode>
considering the limitation introduced by Amendment 18K, it might be
helpful to noble Lords if I outline and give examples of the key
circumstances in which we expect this power to be
used<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:28:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The first
circumstance is where there is no market failure. The framework
addresses the situation where a contract 
<?notus-xml column=339?>price is not subject to the competitive pressures of the market. If
those pressures are evident in the contract price, the framework is not
required. An example is the purchase of additional items that are
readily available in the civil market, such as computers. To ensure
compatibility with our existing infrastructure, we might want to use a
particular manufacturer, so the procurement would be a single-source
procurement. However, the item might have a price that has been
established in a competitive market. In such cases, there would be no
requirement for standardised reporting and open book rights to ensure
value for money, because it would be self-evident from the marketplace.
Applying the framework in such a case would not represent value for
money, as the additional costs of making the contract a regulated
contract would not be outweighed by the benefits of
transparency.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14022577000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000260">4.30

circumstance is national security. The Bill provides for some
categories of contract to be excluded from the framework automatically,
and Clause 14(2)(c) provides for these categories to be
specified in the single-source contract regulations. The draft
regulations identify a few such categories, one of which is when a
contract is for the purposes of intelligence activities. We intend that
these exclusions will apply only if the whole contract is covered by
one or other of the excluded categories. So in the case where a
significant part, but not all, of the contract is for intelligence
activities, the contract would not be excluded from the framework
automatically. Since transparency is a significant part of the
framework, this is unlikely to be appropriate, so the whole contract
may require exemption by the Secretary of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000061">The
third circumstance concerns our relations with other nations.
Transparency is one of the key elements of the new framework, and some
of the standard reports would give us sight of a supplier’s
plans for the key industrial sites sustained by MoD’s
single-source procurement. We require that information so that we can
monitor planned investment or disinvestment activity and compare it
with our forecast capability requirements. However, that could result
in a supplier having to reveal the forecast throughput assumptions of
facilities that are predominantly used by a foreign Government, which
could expose that country’s defence planning assumptions to our
gaze. Needless to say, that is likely to be treated with considerable
reluctance by the foreign
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000062">In
such a circumstance, we might expect a contractor to use the provision
of Clause 27, identifying a “relevant restriction” over
such information. However, this possibility applies only after the
contract has been entered into, so the contractor and foreign
Government may not be willing to rely on this provision. We would
therefore first consider using the lesser exemption provided by Clause
25(8), which provides specific exemption from such reports while
leaving in place the pricing and contract-specific reporting
provisions. Despite all this, a complete exemption using the power
under Clause 14(7) may still be required should the other measures not
be sufficient to satisfy the concerns of a foreign
Government.</hs_para>

exempt individual contracts, the MoD could find itself in the
uncomfortable position of having to choose between not being able to
procure certain equipment or applying the framework in circumstances
that do not provide value for money, risk the security of sensitive
contracts or risk trying to force a supplier to provide information
against the wishes of another Government. These situations are expected
to be rare, but this is an essential power for the effective operation
of the
framework.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000064">To
summarise, we expect the Secretary of State to use his exemption power
only in exceptional cases. The new framework will help us to get value
for money, so we have no desire to limit its application, except where
there is no market failure to correct, or it would be
impractical.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000065">To
return to the amendments, we do not see a need for additional and
specific parliamentary scrutiny over the use of this power. It will be
subject to normal processes, as with other powers granted to a
Secretary of State, and his decision to apply the exemption will
ultimately be subject to judicial review. Where we are using the
exemption for national security reasons, or where we judge that it
would be potentially damaging to foreign relations if we did not exempt
a contract, there may also be reasons why we do not wish to have a
public and high-profile debate on the matter. I hope this explains our
position, and I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000066">Clause
25 is about reports. The new supplier reports defined in it are a
fundamental component of the new framework, and a very significant
amount of the benefits case for these changes rests on the use that
will be made of the reported information and the analysis that will be
derived from it. This clause is therefore vital to the overall function
of the new framework.</hs_para>

provide the MoD with much greater transparency over the assumptions
suppliers have made in proposing the cost-recovery rates that form such
a vital component of the price in large single-source contracts. This
transparency will allow us to understand much better the effectiveness
of those agreed rates as a mechanism used to recover suppliers’
allowable overhead costs, estimated in total to be £2 billion
pounds each year. Analysis of new standard-format cost data will
enhance our ability to benchmark the business units we do business
with, and better challenge costs we are asked to pay for in an
objective and analytical way, backed by evidence. The requirement for
all companies to provide information in a standardised way will enhance
the MoD’s ability to compare and contrast costs and recovery
rates though time, between business units and suppliers, and also
against externally published data for both the defence
sector and the wider industrial
landscape.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000068">Finally, the new
reporting requirements will promote and inform very senior dialogue
between industry and government around better alignment of
long-term supply and demand, attempting to ensure that the MoD
contributes only towards the maintenance of industry capacity it
reasonably expects to need in the future. Most of the information in
these reports will be available to commercial teams

when fully implemented and matured, the new reports will make a
substantial contribution to making the MoD a more intelligent and
informed customer. Over time, the information provided by the new
supplier reporting requirements will make a very real end-to-end
contribution to the process of agreeing, using and validating cost
recovery rates and, in turn, where appropriate and justified, this will
lead to lower contract prices. This clause, which enables the creation
of these critical reports, will significantly improve the understanding

Jolly:</Member></B> The framework provides for a range of reports to be
specified in the single-source contract regulations upon both specific
contract costs and upon supplier costs that relate to wider
capabilities and capacity. It is estimated that around a third of the
costs of single-source contracts relates to so-called overheads. These
account for some £2 billion a year of expenditure under
single-source contracts. These costs do not relate to any one
individual contract but, it is said, represent the costs of providing
particular industrial capabilities and capacity. Not all of the costs
of this capacity will be reflected in the costs recovered through
single-source contracts. Some may be recovered through MoD contracts
won competitively, or through non-MoD customers. However, in some
sectors where single-source activity is particularly concentrated,
these costs may represent the majority, if not all, of the costs of
capacity<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:39:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

six reports relating specifically to these costs. These include reports
on the estimated costs that are used to price contracts, the
assumptions that underpin those estimates and the actual costs that are
subsequently incurred. The requirement for suppliers to keep relevant
records in relation to costs and the MoD right to examine those records
also apply equally to these overhead costs, as they do to any other
allowable costs. In addition to these transparency rights, 
<?notus-xml column=342?>the pricing principles set out in relation to allowable costs also apply
to these overhead costs. Such costs must be appropriate in nature and

transparency provided by these reports, the access to records

our key suppliers. This report will supply senior individuals in the

one area still concerns me. The sort of deals that I described from the

in seeing how you would fit them, in future, into Part 2, which is full

there is a framework.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:42:06"></hs_TimeCode> am happy for
the Minister to write to me rather than give me an answer now, but one
of the questions is whether she envisages that such deals will be
fitted into Part 2 or whether it will be necessary to use Clause 14(7)
or some other exception—as the Minister has pointed out, there
are other exceptions in that clause<I>.</I> Does the Minister envisage
there needing to be an exception for those sort of deals or is it
envisaged that future deals of this nature will be somehow compatible
with Part 2 in ways that, at the moment, I am incapable of
understanding? I would be very grateful for a response to that detailed
question, although I would not encourage her to give me one now. With

approving or signing a contract, a board of directors will require
certainty of income against which it can assess its cost estimates and
associated risks. It contends that the sense of uncertainty over price
may have unintended consequences for shareholder value, group decisions
on where to invest, and the perception in the wider marketplace that
the UK remains a good place to invest in and do business. It believes
that the parties should have a limited time period in which to
challenge the adjustments made in steps 2, 3 or 6 to reduce

Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, we are considering in this group of
amendments three related changes to the power under Clause 18 for a
referral to be made to the SSRO for a determination to adjust the price
of a contract. On a minor drafting point, the proposed amendments
address only the SSRO’s adjustment of the profit element of the
price and, indeed, to only three of the six steps that set contract
profit rate. However, I shall assume in my response that the intent of
the amendments is also to limit the ability of the SSRO to adjust the
cost element of the price as outlined in Clause 20 rather than the
profit element
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:46:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

these amendments is, I believe, that this price determination
introduces an unacceptable degree of uncertainty to the price of a
contract, and so they seek to restrict the scope of the determination
in three ways: by restricting the grounds on which a referral may be
made, as set out in Amendment 18L; by restricting the period in which a
referral may be made, as set out in Amendment 18M; and finally by
restricting the determination that the SSRO may make. We do not
consider that any of these restrictions are 
<?notus-xml column=344?>necessary or desirable, and placing such restrictions on the
determination will significantly weaken compliance with the pricing
rules of the new framework. I think it will be helpful if I outline the
purpose and scope of the SSRO’s price determinations before we
consider the individual
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:47:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

framework is essentially a deal between suppliers and the Government.
Suppliers get a fair and reasonable price and we get the protections we
need to ensure value for money. This is a good deal for both parties.
We have a duty to ensure taxpayer value for money and an efficient and
thriving defence sector that gets a fair price, which is good for
defence as a whole. It means that our Armed Forces get the equipment
and support they need and the wider economy benefits from an efficient
defence sector that can drive innovation and exports. Determining a
fair price is thus a key component of Part 2, and Clauses 15 to
21 set out how this is to be done. They set out, for
example, that the price must be determined on the basis of allowable
costs—costs that are reasonable, appropriate and relate to the
contract. They also set out that on top of these costs, the supplier is
entitled to a fair and reasonable profit rate. Following these pricing
rules will result in a price that is fair and reasonable. The rules on
profit ensure that suppliers are adequately compensated for their
expertise, and the rules on costs ensure that taxpayers do not pay more
than they should. There would be no point in having these rules if they
were not enforceable. Indeed, it would undermine the deal that is
central to the framework.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022577000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000085">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:48:51"></hs_TimeCode>
is the situation we have at the moment. Even though the current Review
Board for Government Contracts annually recommends a profit rate, there
is no obligation to use it, and it is being used less and less on our
larger contracts. It may be asked why we need price enforcement
provisions at all. Why would anyone sign a contract with a price that
is not fair and reasonable? The answer stems from the market failures
inherent in single-source procurement. This form of procurement is used
when there is no alternative supplier. It means that we cannot walk
away from the supplier without also walking away from the essential
military capability that that supplier provides. This is not a strong
negotiating position, as our suppliers are only too aware. In addition,
we are sometimes under time pressures, so that any delay to signing the
contract puts lives at risk. This compounds the problem, and partly
explains why we may not always get the best deal.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022577000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000086">Another<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:50:51"></hs_TimeCode>
reason why we might sign a contract with a price that is not fair and
reasonable stems from the fact that in single-source procurement there
is only one supplier pricing the work. The knowledge that there is no
one who can put forward a cheaper, more competitive price puts a
supplier in a highly unusual and privileged position. Instead of a
healthy market incentive to price keenly, our single-source suppliers
are under a direct financial incentive to do just the opposite, and the
current framework encourages this. This is not to say that our
suppliers always, or even routinely, do this. However, it cannot be
denied that an 
<?notus-xml column=345?>environment where suppliers are rewarded for inflating their price is
hardly conducive to getting value for money.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022577000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000087">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:50:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:54:20"></hs_TimeCode>
MoD, of course, has a duty to challenge a supplier’s price
estimates. As a brief aside, I will note that this price challenge has
not been a level playing field historically. Suppliers’
commercial staff, for whom financial incentives are paramount,
typically outnumber our commercial staff, and they employ specialist
consultants to help them—which, under the current system, they
can often charge back to us.
Returning<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:50:57"></hs_TimeCode> to the
market failures of single-source procurement, a substantial difficulty
in challenging suppliers’ costs is that they always know more
about them than we do. Clearly we need to see their cost assumptions
before we agree a price. This is what we should get under the current
system, although it is not legally binding. Under the current system we
can also challenge their price up to two years after the contract has
ended, if we can prove that they did not show their assumptions to
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000088">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:51:23"></hs_TimeCode>
brings me to Amendment 18L. This seeks to introduce a single and
specific ground for a price referral to the SSRO—namely, that
the SSRO can amend the price only if the initial pricing assumptions
were not shown to the MoD. However, seeing suppliers’ price
assumptions is not sufficient. Suppliers are in a strong position and
can present a convincing case—for example, by showing that their
costs forecasts are aligned to historic expectations even if these
represent poor value. It requires specialist knowledge and experience
to challenge this. It is not enough for a supplier to show us their
assumptions, and to put all of the duty on to the MoD to check that
each and every one is reasonable, as with the current approach. This
encourages a supplier to add extras to their price and hope that the
MoD does not find them all. This is an appalling pricing incentive, far
removed from a healthy market, and we must address it if we want to get
value for money. Again, I do not say that this always happens but I am
sure that it is not conducive to getting value for
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000089">We want
suppliers to be encouraged to use good quality pricing assumptions in
the first place; assumptions that are fit for purpose. If the cost is
worth hundreds of millions of pounds, then they should do a certain
amount of due diligence to support this estimate. If they do not, they
should be at risk of a future price change when it transpires that
outturn costs bear little resemblance to the original estimates.
Equally, and just as importantly, I accept that the MoD has a duty to
check these estimates. If we fail in our duty, any SSRO-determined
price change will take this into account.</hs_para>

to give the SSRO, in its role as an independent expert of single-source

price of the single-source contract must be adjusted. It will make this
assessment if it considers, for example, that a contractor’s
assumptions were misleading or not fit for purpose at the time of
pricing; in other words, that they were not fair and

SSRO will not penalise either party for getting an assumption
wrong—no one can be expected to know the future—but if it
considers that a party provided misleading assumptions or withheld
crucial information known to that party at the time, such as, for a
supplier, known efficiency measures, then the SSRO can adjust the
price. If the SSRO considers that the MoD should have asked more
questions, it will also take this into account in its determination.
Industry has raised concerns that this adds uncertainty into
single-source procurement. My challenge back is that it is an
uncertainty that can easily be mitigated. If you follow the pricing
rules and keep an audit trail of your assumptions, then any uncertainty
will be
minimal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000093">Amendment
18L would reduce the grounds for referral to the SSRO. A referral could
be made only if inaccurate or incomplete information had been provided
by either party to the contract. If information was provided but was
misleading or not fit for purpose, this amendment would prevent the
SSRO reviewing and, potentially, adjusting the price of a contract.
Similarly, if the adjustments had been determined without regard to the
statutory guidance or there was an error of calculation, there would
also be no ability to refer the matter. This amendment puts all the
duty back on to the MoD to ensure that all the details of a price are
fair and reasonable; all the supplier has to do is show its assumptions
to us. It takes away from the supplier the duty to do its own due
diligence and ensure its estimates are reasonable. This amendment is
not an equitable arrangement, particularly given that suppliers have
greater knowledge about their costs, and it frustrates our intent to
put a proxy for market pressures back on to our single-source
suppliers. I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw
Amendment
18L.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000094">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:59:33"></hs_TimeCode>
provided<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:56:30"></hs_TimeCode> a great
deal of background for the first amendment, I will be brief with the
next two amendments in this group. Amendment 18M seeks to restrict the
ability of either party to a contract to make a referral to the SSRO
for a determination. This amendment would limit the period in which
such a referral could be made to the first six months after the price
of a contract has been determined. As I discussed earlier, there are a
number of reasons why an SSRO price determination might be appropriate:
whether information was withheld from one party at the time of pricing,
whether due regard was given to statutory guidance, whether the
detailed calculations were performed correctly, or any other reason why
the pricing assumptions may not have been fit for purpose. In all these
scenarios, information will continue to emerge throughout the course of
the contract. For example, the supply chain employed may be
significantly different from that  
<?notus-xml column=347?>assumed at the time of pricing, and this may be a prompt to investigate
whether information was appropriately shared or whether the pricing
assumptions were fit for purpose. If a contract is for the design,
manufacture and initial in-service support of equipment, this kind of
information may not become apparent until several years into the
contract. To restrict the period for this determination to six months
is to restrict the ability to consider information that later comes to
light, conduct investigations and assess whether an adjustment might be
appropriate. We consider this an artificial and unnecessary restriction
upon the SSRO’s aim of ensuring that the contract price is fair
and reasonable and that good value for money is obtained. As before,
any uncertainty can easily be mitigated by a contractor following the
pricing rules and keeping an audit trail of its
assumptions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000095">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:58:28"></hs_TimeCode>
however recognise that it is appropriate clearly to specify the periods
in which opinions and determinations, including this determination
under Clause 18, may be made. It was for this reason that we introduced
in the House of Commons what is now Clause 41. This provides that the
single-source contract regulations may specify time periods for all
referrals to the SSRO, and the draft regulations do just that. The
draft regulations are the subject of the ongoing consultation with
industry, so we do not consider it necessary to single this one
referral out to specify a period in the Bill rather than in the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14022577000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000262">5

18N is the final amendment in this group. Unlike the previous two
amendments, which would restrict the basis upon which a referral to the
SSRO may be made, this amendment seeks to limit the determination that
the SSRO is able to make by introducing the requirement for a price
adjustment to be material. In most circumstances, the requirement for
materiality is implicit in the overall process for this referral and
determination. In order to arrive at a price adjustment, parties must
first have recognised an issue, failed to reach agreement through
discussion and negotiation, referred the matter to the SSRO, and the
SSRO must consider that an adjustment is appropriate. The SSRO is not
under a duty to make an adjustment in response to a referral. It may do
so if it considers that the existing price is not appropriate. We would
not expect to arrive at a referral to the SSRO over an immaterial
matter, and would not generally expect the SSRO to determine a price
adjustment if it were
immaterial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000097">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:00:20"></hs_TimeCode>,
while in most cases any adjustment would be naturally expected to be
material, there is also the important matter of compliance with the
regime. Part 2 introduces a civil penalty compliance
process, which deals with contraventions relating to the duties of a
contractor once they have entered into a qualifying defence
contract—duties such as keeping records and providing reports.
That process does not directly address the pricing of a contract. That

report of the noble Lord, Lord Currie, points out, we have over the
years had a lot of debate, effort and negotiation into the contract
profit rate which, typically, is 10%—pedantically, it is
9%—of the total price; and too little, one might argue with the
benefit of hindsight, into the issue of allowable costs, which

(2) attempts to define allowable costs. It is important to emphasise
that these are the big bucks. This is where the big money is in the
contract. This is 90% or more of the total price. The guidance we get
from the primary legislation is that they must be appropriate,
attributable to the contract and reasonable in the circumstances. Much
as I praise this part of the Bill—and I do as it is a really
good attempt to address this extremely difficult issue—I cannot
but be amused by these three descriptors of one of the most important
elements. I remember that when I was privileged to be in the noble
Baroness’s position, whenever an official used the word
“appropriate” in my response, it meant we did not have an
argument, so I dismiss subsection (2)(a) as pretty well
irrelevant. I do not have a lot of time for paragraph (b) either,
because if it is not “attributable to the contract”, who
would in all conscience try to argue that it should be there? We are
left with “reasonable”. Much as I applaud the concept of
being reasonable, it is not a very full description. Therefore,
inevitably, and quite properly—I am not unhappy about
this—it will have to be left to the SSRO to develop guidance
about it. However, surely this is so important that it should not be
merely guidance but should be in regulations. Regulations of this
importance should be exposed to public gaze and debate and should be
accountable to Parliament through the affirmative procedure. I beg

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am worried about
these words. I shall not repeat what the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe,
has said. It is really a question about what are allowable costs. As
anybody in business knows, allowable costs can be described in so many
ways. For instance, Starbucks does not pay any tax in this country
because it charges its royalties from overseas against its costs in
this country. Would that on a contract for a submarine be
allowable costs? If the contractor is producing, let us say, one
submarine, can it therefore charge all of its chairman’s,
managing director’s and executive board’s salaries
against the cost of that one submarine? If it is also producing a group
of battleships or carriers, those executive costs, for example, would
be spread over all the costs of all those items of equipment.</hs_para>

the Minister spoke about an audit trail. The noble Lord, Lord
Tunnicliffe, used the word “reasonable” and all the other
adjectives. A contractor who wished to drive a coach and horses through
this could do so by manipulating what could be administrative costs. It
is very easy to say that if the mythical submarine requires a widget,
that widget is applicable to that submarine. You can see that, but when
you are dealing with, let us say, the premises for the submarine, if it
is one submarine, is the contractor allowed to charge the whole of the
premises costs against the cost of that submarine? If it was also
building an aircraft carrier, it could charge some of that premises
costs against it. I invite the Minister to come back, perhaps on
Report, with some better reassurance about how allowable costs will be
allocated and particularly about how to spread large costs if only one
item of equipment is produced by that
contractor.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/4000434378C642236CE9FC4553025C3E2E122291" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 February 2014">Tuesday,

Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 18P would have the effect of
directing the Secretary of State for Defence to provide Parliament
annually with a determination of the contract profit rate and,
specifically, the process that is to be used to determine the profit
rate. Before considering the amendment, it will be worth while
outlining the existing process that the Bill provides
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000109">Under
Clause 17, the contract profit rate is to be determined through six
steps. Three of those steps will be determined with reference to rates
that are to be calculated annually: step 1, the baseline profit rate;
step 4, the SSRO funding adjustment; and step 6, the adjustment for
capital employed by the contractor. Two of these steps are not new;
steps 1 and 6 have their equivalents under the existing regime. The
rates to be used in determining these three steps must themselves be
determined annually as they will reflect the most recent accounts of
companies and the SSRO in relation to the SSRO funding
adjustment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000110">The
process for determining these rates is provided for by Clause 19 and
has several stages. First, the Secretary of State will issue statutory
guidance containing the principles that should be used in determining
the rates. Secondly, the SSRO must recommend rates, having regard to
the Secretary of State’s guidance, by 31 January each year.
Thirdly, upon receiving the SSRO’s recommendations, the
Secretary of State must then determine and publish in the <I>London
Gazette</I><I> </I>no later than 15 March each year the rates to be
used. In publishing the rates to be used, the Secretary of State must
also publish the reasons for any differences from the SSRO’s
recommendations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000111">I
appreciate that at first sight this may appear to be an unnecessarily
complicated process, but it has been carefully considered to fulfil a
number of requirements: first, for the Secretary of State to be able to
set out clear guidance on the principles that should be used in
determining the rates; secondly, and crucially, for the SSRO as the
independent and impartial body to be free to recommend rates in
accordance with its statutory aim to set a framework that delivers a
fair and reasonable price. While the SSRO must have regard to the
principles established by the Secretary of State, it should also be
free to consider any other matters that it considers relevant to the
setting of the rates. It must be able to recommend the rates that it
considers will provide a fair and reasonable return to contractors and
value for money to the Government, even if that means not following the
principles set out by the Secretary of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000112">The
amendment would require that the powers conferred by Clause 19 should
be contained in regulations made by statutory instrument and therefore
be subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny as the 
<?notus-xml column=351?>other regulations. While I appreciate that Parliament should exercise an
appropriate level of oversight in these matters, I do not think that
this proposal is proper in this instance. First, I note that this would
form a potentially unhelpful precedent across government, since, as far
as I am aware, none of the other regulatory bodies—such as for
the railways or water—are subject to this degree of
parliamentary scrutiny, even though they deal with issues of great
national significance. Secondly, the Secretary of State for Defence is
already subject to parliamentary oversight for his powers over the
defence budget and is therefore accountable to Parliament for how he
discharges these powers. The amendment would add an unhelpful degree of
additional and overlapping scrutiny for this specific area of his
responsibility.</hs_para>

clearly a very technical and complex issue and there is a risk that
making this area subject to parliamentary debate would lead to the
politicisation of profit rates which ought to be set through impartial
and expert judgment. There would be scope for Parliament to be
subjected to lobbying by the various interest groups, a factor that
could result in pressure to set the rates either too high or too
low<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:16:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14022577000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000263">5.15

should point out that the Bill already makes provision for the SSRO to
make an annual recommendation to the Secretary of State for the profit
rate. The SSRO, as the independent body, is the appropriate body to
provide the necessary expert oversight of the Secretary of
State’s determination of the profit rates. The Secretary of
State will have to publish in the <I>London Gazette</I> the rates to be
used and must publish the reasons for any difference from the SSRO
recommendations. This therefore provides an appropriate level of
oversight and transparency.</hs_para>

similar to Amendment 18P in that it seeks to set out matters in
regulations rather than in statutory guidance, in this case relating to
allowable costs. Clause 20 deals with allowable costs under the new
framework. Those costs will account typically for some £5.5
billion pounds per annum of government expenditure, or 90% of the total
cost of single-source procurement, so the rules around determining the
allowable costs are important.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022577000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000116">There are three
principles contained in the Bill for determining whether a cost is an
allowable cost, and each of these must be met in order for a cost to be
allowable. First, a cost must be appropriate. This relates to the type
of cost, such as whether it is for labour or materials, insurance or
pensions costs, or rationalisation and redundancy costs. Some types of
cost are always appropriate, such as direct labour, and some never. For
example, suppliers should never be able to pass on the costs of their
charitable donations to the taxpayer. Secondly, a cost must be
reasonable. This relates to the quantum of the cost, and a cost may be
reasonable if it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a
prudent person in the conduct of competitive business. Finally, a cost
must be attributable to the contract. This may sound obvious, but
without this principle a cost incurred by a supplier could be both
appropriate and reasonable, yet be either wholly 
<?notus-xml column=352?>or partially related to work other than that under the qualifying
contract. The amendment seeks to ensure that the single-source contract
regulations will provide the detailed guidance to support these three
principles, rather than the SSRO issuing statutory guidance as
currently provided
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000117">As noble
Lords are aware, the single-source contract regulations made by the
Secretary of State will contain the further detail essential to the
operation of the new framework. The Bill also provides for a range of
statutory guidance, some to be issued by the Secretary of State, but
most to be issued by the SSRO. Like the regulations, the statutory
guidance has legal power. However, unlike the regulations, parties
subject to Part 2 can deviate from statutory guidance if they have
reasonable grounds to do so. Parties must have regard to the statutory
guidance. For matters where it is difficult to set out rules that will
cater for every possible set of circumstances, statutory guidance
provides a means of setting rules that provide for the majority of
cases but allow the flexibility to deal with unforeseen circumstances
or grey areas. As we developed the framework, we considered whether
guidance would be better put into the legally binding single-source
contract regulations or whether to use statutory guidance with the
greater flexibility that that provides. If statutory guidance is to be
used, there is then a secondary question of who should issue that
guidance—the Secretary of State or the Single Source Regulations
Office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000118">For
allowable costs, we judge that the best approach is to use statutory
guidance, and that it should be issued by the SSRO. Using statutory
guidance rather than regulations is a matter of practicality, and
requiring the SSRO rather than the Secretary of State to issue that
guidance is a matter of principle. If we were to specify binding rules
for determining allowable costs in regulations, those regulations would
need to be very detailed and extensive, catering for every possible
scenario that may occur. Such regulations would probably run into many
hundreds of pages, perhaps thousands, and it would require an army of
people to monitor, police and review them. Noble Lords might be
interested to know that this is currently the situation in the United
States, where the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations are more than
3,000 pages long and more than 1,000 accountants are employed to ensure
that they are complied with. This may be a suitable approach given the
scale of US defence spending, but we do not consider this approach
necessary for the scale of our defence
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000119">The
alternative is to use statutory guidance. As it is possible for a
person subject to the statutory guidance to deviate from it if they
have sound reason to do so, the guidance can focus upon principles and
the rules appropriate for the vast majority of cases. Where there are
specific circumstances which reasonably justify an alternative
approach, that approach may be taken while still being compliant with
the law, although the person must be prepared to justify the approach
they have taken. Given the broad nature of activity that will be
covered under qualifying contracts—everything from research and
development to test facilities, the design and manufacture of complex
equipment and the provision of support services—the range of
potential costs and accounting issues are innumerable.</hs_para>

therefore consider statutory guidance to be a far more appropriate
mechanism than regulations for dealing with this important, yet
complex, area. It can be responsive, for example, to changes in
international accounting standards, and flexible to deal with specific
accounting complexities. It would not be appropriate to commit the
department to using extensive and valuable resources to maintain a
complex set of regulations. I hope noble Lords will accept that is a
sensible
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000121">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>

summary, I believe that our approach, which is to set out in the Bill

further recommendation noted that Clauses 14(1) and 28(1) could
potentially be interpreted as providing for the SSCRs to make general
provision, which the committee considered would be too wide and
imprecise a power to delegate. We agree that such a power would indeed
be inappropriate, but it is the department’s view, based on
legal advice, that these subsections are introductory in nature, and
must be read in the context of the whole of Part 2, which contains a
series of detailed and specific powers, and the usual power to make
supplementary or incidental provision which is included in Clause
42(2). It should not be necessary to rely on these general clauses to
make provision that is not otherwise permitted by the other powers in
Part 2. I hope it is clear from the draft regulations placed in the
Lords Library that we have not done
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000126">The final

23A provides for the specification of which regulations should be
subject to the affirmative process. This has a similar effect to
government Amendment 23, which also provides a mechanism for specifying
regulations to be made subject to the affirmative process. We therefore
agree with the intent of the amendment, but it is not required if
government Amendment 23 is accepted. Amendments 23D and 23E provide for
regulations under Clause 19, covering rates relevant to determining the
contract profit rate, and Clause 20, covering allowable costs to be
subject to the affirmative procedure. The current Bill does not provide
for regulations under either of these clauses, so the amendments rely
upon earlier Amendment 18P for rates relevant to the contract profit
rate and Amendment 18Q for allowable costs. The Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee did not recommend that guidance on
allowable costs should be in regulations. It recommended in paragraph
12 of its report that the rates relevant to the contract profit rate
should be in regulations, as we have already discussed under Amendment
18P. However, the committee did not recommend that the regulations
should be subject to the affirmative procedure. As discussed earlier
under Amendments 18P and 18Q, we do not believe that either of these
matters should be in regulations, so clearly we do not agree that they
need to be subject to the affirmative procedure. However, I will
briefly consider each amendment in
turn<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:26:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to allowable costs. The guidance on allowable costs may need to change
on a regular basis, for example, in response to changes in
international financial reporting standards. If it was set out in
regulations this guidance would be long and technical, and any changes
are likely to reflect relatively minor changes in accounting practices.
We do not consider that such matters justify the affirmative procedure.
Amendment 23E relates to rates relevant to the contract profit rate.
Even if in regulations, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee did not recommend that these should be subject to the
affirmative procedure. The annual setting of the profit rate has
similarities with the determinations made by price regulators, such as
those in water, energy and rail. In all these cases, the regulators
have considerably more power than the Secretary of State or the Single
Source Regulations Office in that they set the overall revenue of the
regulated industry, not just the profit rate, which typically accounts
for only 10% of the price. However their determinations are not subject
to direct parliamentary approval.</hs_para>

regulators through Select Committees and the Comptroller and
Auditor-General, which is also the case for the SSRO. Parliament has
already delegated to the Secretary of State overall responsibility for
providing strategic direction on acquisition and allocating resources
appropriately. The setting of rates relevant to the contract profit
rate to apply to single-source contracts falls within this remit.
Placing the provisions of Clause 19 in regulations following the
negative 
<?notus-xml column=355?>procedure would already provide a far greater degree of parliamentary
approval than that applied to other similar regulatory powers. To apply
the affirmative procedure to these matters would, in the
department’s view, be further out of proportion to the nature of
the power. We do not consider that these regulations should be subject
to the affirmative procedure. I hope this explains our position, and I

further points to make. My noble friend Lord Roper asked whether
allowable costs could be addressed in future drafts of the regulations.
There is no provision in the Bill for this as it is going to be dealt
with in statutory guidance, as set out in Clause 21. It
would require an amendment. My noble friend Lord Palmer asked how
overhead costs such as directors’ salaries, facilities and so on
are spread or allocated to contracts. These are addressed through a
process known as cost recovery rates. These are allowable costs which
are subject to a requirement to follow the three tests under Clause 20
and are the subject of the reports provided for in Clause 25. These
give all the powers and transparency necessary to ensure that overhead
costs are fair and reasonable, and that we do not pay more than we
should for
them.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/8C146F80C618FD26E32F6BE0A530140E3CFF135F" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 25 February 2014">Tuesday,

Tunnicliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have
taken part in this debate. I congratulate the Minister on her spirited
defence. Unfortunately, it failed. Our concern about the processes is
real, and our overwhelming concern is the billions of pounds that are
tied up in allowable costs. As we will go on to discuss, the various
forms of contract are an important chunk of the real profits of the
company. At the end of the day, this is a negotiating game. It is a
matter of how much you can legitimately build into your allowable
costs, with a profit rate on top of that. Allowable costs are at the
centre of what defence contracts cost and what the taxpayer must pay. I
do not feel that the Minister, despite her spirited defence, has
addressed our concerns—not only my concerns, but those of other
Members of the Committee—on allowable costs. I fear that we will
be tempted to return to this on Report. As I believe this to be an
apolitical issue, I encourage the Minister to ponder today’s
debate and to see what she can add to it. We would all enjoy receiving
a letter from her that would provide nuance to the Government’s
position and I encourage her to do that. It is a matter of real concern
to the Committee. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the

emphasise that our opposition to Clause 21 standing part of the Bill is

concept in this clause, of a final price adjustment, comes out of the
report by the noble Lord, Lord Currie. It addresses the key issue of
profit that arises from the outturn. In my view, it is conceptually
very sound. It is utterly meaningless without the regulations so I
thank the officials and the Minister for sharing the regulations with
me. After considerable effort, I think that I understood the early part
of the regulations, particularly in relation to Clause 21(2), and they
seem very sensible. They have a clawback of excessive profit of up to
75% and they support the supplier in a position of excessive loss at
50%, on the simplistic assumption that the profit rate is 10% of the
allowable costs. There is quite a broad band, between 96% and 110%,
where all variation falls to the supplier’s bottom line, which
is a very strong incentive for the supplier to become more efficient
and make more profit. I am not against suppliers increasing profit if
that is achieved through efficiency. I am entirely in favour of it in
this new open book, multi-reporting regime whereby the MoD can share in
that experience through the reporting regime, understand it and help
future suppliers understand how they can deliver at lower costs and
more efficiently. It is a good
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:35:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:39:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000134">Essentially,

basis of the Bill is that contractors should get a fair return on
single-source work, and even better returns if they can drive cost
efficiencies which deliver long-term benefits to the MoD. However, they
should not be entitled to super-profits just because, despite best
intentions and efforts, both parties happened to get the pricing wrong.
Likewise, in the same circumstances, suppliers should not be expected
to suffer losses. This clause offers protection to both parties. The
clause enables a final price adjustment on completion of a contract if
the actual costs of the contract turn out to be markedly different from
those agreed at the time of pricing. The mechanism will be applied to
all qualifying defence contracts priced at the outset on the basis of a
firm or fixed price.</hs_para>

Reading in the House of Commons, statements were made to the effect
that provisions such as this are undesirable because an agreed contract
price should be an agreed contract price and that clauses like this
remove pricing certainty and dampen supplier incentivisation. There is
some truth in the observation, but I believe the clause strikes a good
and proper balance between incentivising suppliers and protecting the
public purse in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Currie, recommended
it should. It should also be noted that on a number of occasions in the
past when suppliers incurred very substantial losses, such as on the
Nimrod programme, they have come back to us for more money. Since we
need the capability they provide, it is not in our interest to let a
supplier go bankrupt by holding it rigidly to its contract
price.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000141">I
must also tell the Committee that this clause does not introduce a new
idea into single-source contracting. Provisions for a final price
adjustment have been in place since 1968 under the existing Yellow Book
arrangements, and a mechanism very like Clause 21 has been in place
since 2004. It is in many of our single-source contracts and has
already been successfully used to recover excess profits from our
suppliers on some contracts. However, because the existing mechanism is
contractual and needs to be negotiated, sometimes suppliers refuse to
agree to its terms. This happened 
<?notus-xml column=358?>on a recent large maritime maintenance contract where commercial
officers had to give it up in exchange for another provision we
desired. That is why we want to legislate to provide this protection.
If Clause 21 falls, a significant protection for both parties falls
with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000142">Clause 21
also states that any adjustments to the final price will be determined
by the Secretary of State and the contractor. However, if an agreement
cannot be reached on whether an adjustment is required or on the amount
of that adjustment, the clause enables either of the parties to refer
the matter to the SSRO for a binding determination. The clause will be
used for particular types of contracts—firm and fixed-price
contracts, which account for 60% of our single source
contracts—and the SSCRs will set out the minimum value for
applying these provisions.</hs_para>

gives the Secretary of State a power, on a case-by-case basis, to
exempt a QDC from any final price adjustment as long as the value of
that QDC is within the range to be specified in the SSCRs, which is
expected to be between £5 million and £50
million. When deciding whether to make such an exemption, the Secretary
of State must have regard to any matters which will be specified in the
regulations. The clause is an important element in protecting both
parties in defence contracts: the Government against suppliers’
excessive profits and industry from substantial losses, which
ultimately would not be in the MoD’s interest. It is therefore
crucial that it remains in the Bill.</hs_para>

procedure by which those regulations will be made. We have
previously discussed this in relation to Clauses 19 and 20
and Amendments 23A, 23C and 23D. Amendment 23C would provide
for regulations under Clause 21 to be subject to the affirmative

currently subject to the negative procedure. The final price adjustment
is expected to apply to around half of qualifying defence
contracts—those which are firm or fixed price—and will
have effect only when the costs incurred under these contracts are
significantly different from those estimated at the time of pricing.
The mechanism provided for by the draft regulations under Clause 21 is
a relaxation of an existing mechanism that has been in place since 2004
and follows one of the recommendations by the noble Lord, Lord Currie.
The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee did not recommend

Tunnicliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 18R, 18S and
18T are prompted by industry, which seeks to argue that there should be
a mutuality in obligation and a test of materiality. The industry
argues that there should be a mutual obligation on the primary
contractor and the Secretary of State to notify the other of events,
circumstances and information that are likely to have an effect on, or
relevance to, a contract. The MoD will have information that is likely
to have an effect in relation to a qualifying defence contract, whether
that affects its price or performance. The MoD should have a duty to
disclose relevant information to the contractor, which must be
reflected in the Bill. I understand that this duty was confirmed by the
Government in Committee in the House of Commons but I would value
further
affirmation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T17:47:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000147">As
a result of the broad scope of events and circumstances that are likely
to have an effect on, or relevance to, a contract covered by Clause
26(1), it is realistic that the contractor or the Secretary of State
should be required to notify only when they believe there is a likely
effect or relevance. Without this restriction, the obligation to notify
is extremely broad. Further, it is argued that it is not necessary to
refer to the effect on costs per se; the important aspect is whether
there is an effect on price, such that Clause 26(3)(a) is unnecessary.

Jolly:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the flaws in the current Yellow
Book framework is that it provides little transparency once on
contract. A key objective of the new framework is that the MoD should
be able to monitor the health of single-source contracts on an ongoing
basis, receiving timely information so that it can take fast and
effective action. This is very important. There have been too many
examples in the past when the MoD has discovered cost or time overruns
on single-source contracts far too late for remedial action to be
taken. Receiving information throughout the course of a contract will
give the MoD the opportunity to work with contractors to take early
action to avoid or minimise the impact of issues as they arise. This
clause is one of several that provide this transparency.</hs_para>

supplier will always know more than the MoD about the issues affecting
their delivery of a particular contract. Some of our suppliers share
information on an open basis, alerting us as issues arise so that
decisions can be taken on a joint understanding of the best information
available at the time, but not all of our suppliers do
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000150">The
standardised reports that will be required under Clause 24 will provide
periodic snapshots of contract performance. However, for contracts
below £50 million in value, a report may be received annually or
still less frequently, and even for our largest contracts a
standardised report is only required quarterly. These periods are
appropriate for standardised reporting, but three months can be a long
time in managing a contract, especially complex contracts worth many
millions, or billions, of
pounds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000151">Clause
26 therefore supplements the regular contract reporting, placing a duty
on contractors to let the MoD know, in a timely fashion, of matters
material to the contract. Putting the onus on the contractor in this
way means that the new framework can be “lighter touch”
than it would otherwise be if the only means by which alarm bells could
be sounded on a project was through periodic reporting and the
MoD’s monitoring
powers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000152">Amendment
18R would make the Secretary of State subject to the same duty,
providing notifications to the contractor. Clause 26 will place a duty
upon a contractor to notify the Secretary of State when the contractor
becomes aware of the occurrence, or likely occurrence, of
“events”, “circumstances”, or
“information” that are likely to have a material effect
on a qualifying defence contract. Applying this same duty would require
the Secretary of State to notify the contractor of events,
circumstances or information that are likely to have a material effect
on the contractor’s costs—the subject of amendment
18T—the contract price, or the contractor’s
performance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000153">Let
me first be clear that this does not concern changes to our contractual
requirements. If the requirements of the MoD change, and this affects
an existing contract, then we require a contract amendment to reflect
those new requirements. This should be quite separate to the delivery
of requirements already contracted for; if we wish to amend the
contracted requirement, we will tell the contractor and begin the
commercial process of amending the contract, and this is not a matter
that requires legislation. The contractor is not forced to make the
amendment, and they will charge us for any additional costs that might
arise, or amend performance requirements if this is relevant. Until we
seek a contract amendment, a contractor should be concerned with
managing the existing
contract.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000154">For
contracts which we are not in the process of amending, this duty would
require the Secretary of State to assess the impact of events,
circumstances and information across the department upon each
contractor’s contracts. This is quite different from the duty
placed upon a contractor when they are managing a contract in the
normal course of business. It would require the Secretary of State to
assess what might, or might not, affect a contractor’s cost or
performance, to look beyond the contract and assess whether a
contractor’s 
<?notus-xml column=361?>activities are likely to be affected. This duty would be impossible for
any Government to
discharge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000155">We
agree that when a contract is being priced, the duty to share
information should be reciprocal. Both parties should share their
assumptions to ensure that the price agreed for the contract is both
fair and reasonable and value for money. However, once a contract has
been entered into, it is the contractor who must manage the delivery of
the contract, and who is responsible for the performance of its
business and costs. It is not the responsibility of the Government to
second guess what is likely to have an impact upon how a contractor
achieves their contracted requirements. We do not accept that Clause 26
represents an equal duty when placed upon the Secretary of State
compared to a contractor. It would be inappropriate to place this duty
on the Government and impossible for a Government to fulfil.</hs_para>

effect of this amendment would be to add a third test: that an effect
must be likely, material, and believed to exist. We do not think that
an effect could be considered both likely and material and yet at the
same time not be believed to exist. To put it another way, if it were
not believed to exist, how could it also be considered likely to have a
material effect? Without embarking on a debate on the nature of belief,
it is not clear what this third test
adds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000159">Where
there is a disagreement between a contractor and the Secretary of State
over whether a contractor should have provided a notification under
this duty, the Secretary of State may issue a compliance or penalty
notice. Ultimately, it will be for the SSRO to determine whether a
notification should have been provided and, in doing so, it will
consider the two conditions of “likely” and
“material”. We consider that the two conditions already
required for there to be a duty to notify are sufficient and that the
third test of belief proposed by this amendment is
unnecessary.</hs_para>

18T, Clause 26 provides for three matters that are the subject of the
duty to notify; these are listed in subsection (3). They are the costs
under the contract, the total price payable under the contract, and the
contractor’s performance of material obligations under the
contract. This amendment seeks to remove the first of these
matters—the costs of the contractor under the contract. The
effect of this amendment requires some explanation as there is some
overlap between the first two matters—the cost and the price
payable under the contract. For cost-plus 
<?notus-xml column=362?>and target-cost contracts, the costs incurred under the contract will
directly affect the price payable under the contract, so
there is a limited difference between the two matters for these
contracts, which represent just under half of the single-source
landscape. The rest are firm or fixed-price contracts under which the
contractor’s costs may vary while the price payable may not. So
it is firm and fixed-price contracts that would primarily be affected
by this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000161">The
reason that we wish to be notified in relation to both costs and price
under the contract is the same as the overall requirement for Clause
26—to ensure that the MoD receives timely warning of matters
affecting contracts. If the costs of a firm or fixed-price contract are
likely to materially change, this is still important management
information for the MoD. It may indicate a significant risk to the
project or signal future performance issues. Just because it may not
affect the price payable does not mean that this is not important
information. For example, a contractor could manage a contract for a
year in between standardised reports being provided to the MoD. In that
year, a significant risk could be recognised and material costs could
be incurred in trying to manage the risk in the expectation that
performance under the contract will not be affected. However, despite
the additional costs incurred, it finally becomes apparent that
performance is likely to be affected after all, at which point a
notification would be
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000162">It
is a characteristic of single-source procurement that there is only one
supplier that can provide the capability we require. If the contract
fails we lose the capability we need. This has led suppliers in the
past to seek price increases even though we have agreed a fixed price.
Where the cost increases are very large, this puts the MoD in a
difficult position. Seeking to keep to the fixed price can lead a
supplier into great financial difficulty, putting not only that
contract but others with that supplier at risk. If the supplier fails,
then we lose the capability we need. This is a real risk that has
arisen in the past, and thus we need the same transparency over the
costs of fixed-price contracts as we do for other contract types. We do
not see a benefit to applying a different notification requirement to
firm and fixed-price contracts, so that for these contracts
notification is only required once performance is likely to be
affected, while for other contracts notification would be required at
the point that costs, and therefore price, are likely to be affected.
This is not the early warning that this provision is intended to
provide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000163">For

20 follows on from Amendment 19. Clause 33(6) currently provides for

reference to the value of contracts. As a result of Amendment 19, the
maximum penalty values will now be included in the SSCRs, while Clause
42(2) already provides for the SSCRs to make different provision for
different purposes, which is a standard provision for regulations.
Therefore the part of the current subsection (6) providing
for different provision for different purposes is no longer required.
This amendment replaces the current subsection (6) to provide only that
different provision for the maximum penalty amounts may be made by
reference to the value of
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000171">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>
21 deletes Clause 33(7), which dealt with the parliamentary process for
the penalty regulations. It is no longer required because the
provisions for maximum penalty amounts will now be in the SSCRs rather
than in a separate statutory instrument. So this will now be covered by

22 simplifies Clause 39, which provides for the review of Part 2 and
the regulations made under it by the SSRO and the Secretary of State.
As there will now be only one statutory instrument, the SSCRs, Clause
39(1) can be simplified to refer only to the review of the SSCRs,
rather than the more general “regulations under this

begin with, it removes the current Clause 42(4), which provides that
the SSCRs should be subject to the negative procedure, and replaces it
by a provision reflecting those recommendations on the parliamentary
process for the SSCRs: first, that they should be affirmative the first
time that they are made; secondly, that any changes to the regulations
related to Clause 14 should always be affirmative, as this
governs which contracts will be subject to Part 2 and thus sets the
scope of Part 2; and thirdly, that the affirmative procedure will also
apply for any changes to regulations made under Clause 33, which
relates to maximum penalty amounts and was previously to be contained
in the penalty regulations. These were always to be subject to the
affirmative procedure, so there is no change to the procedure as a
result of this amendment. Finally, the SSCRs will follow the negative
procedure for all cases other than those just

amendments to these various clauses. They are a very full response to
the report of our Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of
last December, which was responded to by the noble Lord, Lord Astor, in
his letter to the committee published earlier this year. It seems that
in these amendments the Government have taken fully the points that
were 
<?notus-xml column=365?>made by the report. We are very well served by that committee, which
ensures that there is the technical scrutiny to ensure that
parliamentary control is maintained when there are questions of
delegated powers. I feel that the Government have responded fully to
the proposals of the committee. I am not sure whether it has yet had a
chance to respond to the letter of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, or if
there are any further points that we may need to come back to on
Report, but I understand that it is generally satisfied with these
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000176"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T18:09:21"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tunnicliffe" PimsId="4351" UID="14022577000303" xid="1843" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000303">Lord

may be about to contradict myself when speaking to Amendments 22A and
23B. Amendment 22A is prompted by the industry, which has argued that
the regulations arising as a result of the review should be made and
updated in an open and transparent manner. It argues that an
industry-wide consultation should be undertaken, the Secretary of State
should have regard to that consultation and the regulations should be
laid before Parliament. Amendment 23B argues essentially that the
penalties regulations should be passed by the affirmative procedure on
every occasion. These are penalties which could have dramatic

amendments. Amendment 22A would place a statutory duty on the SSRO when
performing its review of the single-source framework to consult with
industry and to publish the results of the consultation exercise. As
noble Lords will be aware, many aspects of the single-source framework
under Part 2 will lie in regulations rather than in primary
legislation, and many of the clauses in this part give the Secretary of
State the power to make those regulations. This is to allow the
regulations to be periodically updated to take into account changes in
procurement approaches, the defence sector and what is being procured,
without the need for primary legislation. I reassure noble Lords that
we are aware that the new single-source framework represents an
important change to single-source procurement. We have been consulting
closely with the industry throughout the development of Part
2, including the Bill and the detail of the regulations.</hs_para>

October 2011, the noble Lord, Lord Currie, published his report and we
subsequently ran a full public consultation which completed in January
2012. In April of that year we started a defence suppliers’
forum subgroup with our top 10 single-source suppliers. These included
BAE Systems, Finmeccanica, Rolls-Royce, Babcock, Thales, MBDA, QinetiQ
and others. Over the past two years we have met with them more than a
dozen times to share our proposed approach and understand their
concerns. Beneath this forum we also established a number of technical
working groups on specific matters such as confidentiality, the SSRO
and risk, and most recently on the regulations themselves. In January
alone this year we spent four full days discussing the draft
regulations line by line with industry, and we expect further such
discussions before the summer. This is a substantial level of
consultation, more than is typical for new government policy, and it
has resulted in our making some important changes to our framework,
such as introducing the new criminal offence to protect industry
information.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022577000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000182">It
is certainly not in our interests to create an unworkable framework.
For one thing, we pay for any additional overheads our suppliers will
incur, which will be incorporated into their single-source prices,
provided that they are reasonable. We also need the capability they
provide and have no desire to make it hard to do business with the MoD.
Indeed, it is out of a desire to ensure that the framework is as
practical as possible that we have consulted with industry to the
extent that we have. Industry cannot claim that it has not been
consulted prior to the first regulations being
made.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14022577000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-gc0001.htm#14022577000267">6.15

to the amendment, we also want the new framework to be kept up to date.
We do not want to end up again in the situation in which we find
ourselves now: namely, with a framework that is 45 years old, clearly
out of date and not fit for purpose. That is why we have introduced a
statutory duty for the SSRO to keep the framework under review at all

out in Clause

recommendations, the SSRO will follow a rigorous process. First, it

publish these. It will then conduct a full public consultation,

Committee agrees with me that the SSRO will be following an open and
comprehensive consultation process in recommending changes to the
regulations. I am aware that this is not written out in the Bill.
However, this is a detailed procedural matter, so it is not necessary
so to do. However, I assure the Committee that there is no intent to
lay down regulations without consulting industry beforehand. I am
confident that the SSRO will take its role very seriously, and consult
with all appropriate parties. We did not feel it was necessary to put a
statutory duty on them to consult with industry, any more than we did
to require them to consult with the MoD. I hope I have reassured noble

therefore agree with the intent of this clause, but it is not now

€2,000 to €10,000; a cap on court fees to 10% of the
value of the claim; a broadening of what constitutes a cross-border

The Northern Ireland Office had sought confirmation before sending the

PSNI that they had been. As has been made clear by the legal
proceedings relating to Mr Downey, an administrative scheme to deal
with so-called “on the runs” was in operation from around
September 2000. It was devised by the previous government. The details
were not fully set out to Parliament, though the scheme was referred to
in July 2002 in the answer to a parliamentary question given by the

Reid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022573000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225-wms0001.htm#14022573000053">Following
the failure of the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill in 2005-06, the
administrative scheme became the only mechanism for dealing with OTRs.
Under the scheme inquiries from individuals wishing to establish if
they were wanted for arrest over suspected terrorist activities were
communicated, by Sinn Fein, through the Northern Ireland Office, to the
Attorney-General, who then referred them to the prosecuting authorities
and the police. The Government communicated back the response to Sinn
Fein via a letter from the Northern Ireland

information available to the police and prosecuting authorities at the

They were also advised that should new information or evidence of
wrongdoing come to light at any point in the future, then they would be
subjected to normal

current government looked again at the scheme and decided that any

otherwise unsure whether they remained wanted for arrest. In the light
of the recent court judgment, my department is working with the police
and prosecuting authorities to check whether anyone sent a similar
letter is wanted for an offence committed before the date of the
letter. As policing and justice have been devolved issues in Northern
Ireland since 2010, any further requests for the scheme, or

Probation Service and Community Rehabilitation Companies. Probation
staff were consulted on this document prior to its publication, and the
document has been ratified by the National Negotiating Council and the
Standing Committee for Chief Officer Grades and endorsed by the
Ministry of Justice and National Offender Management Service. The
National Agreement offers a very good deal to existing staff,
demonstrating our commitment to fairness and providing certain
guarantees to staff at the point of transfer. Staffs have been assigned
to the new organisations by automatic assignment where a role remains
substantially unchanged at the point of transfer. Where an existing
role spreads across functions transferring to both of the new
organisations, i.e. the National Probation Service (NPS) and a
Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC), staff in those roles were
invited to express an interest in working for either the NPS or CRC.
All staff have now been assigned to posts in the new structure. They
are able to appeal against the decision in line with the criteria set
out in the National
Agreement.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14022579000432" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140225w0001.htm#14022579000432">NHS:
