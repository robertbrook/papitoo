I have sought, where I can do so, to put in place ameliorating

the average cost to both parties is £500; if they go to law the

going to law takes 435 days. The Government are committed to ensuring

We have gone to the Court of Appeal to ensure we can continue to give
whole-life tariffs in this country. My view is that this should always
be a matter for Parliament, but as he knows, while we have good
collaborative relationships across the coalition and while we agree on
many things, there are some things we do not agree on, and this is one
of them, so I am afraid that wholesale change to our relationship with

that the Court is interpreting the convention as an unfettered
jurisprudence that allows it to move into areas never envisaged by the
people who wrote the convention. My clear view is that the Court is
moving into areas that are matters for national Parliaments and which
do not belong within the remit of an international court. It is a

and honest about that—but we will leave it to the electorate in

in the incident. I also spoke to a prisoner who, although not involved,
was there at the time. I saw some of the CCTV coverage, too, so I am
very clear about how serious the incident was, but to describe it as a
full-scale riot is in my view inaccurate. Twenty prisoners were
involved in the incident, out of a total of 1,600. The wing is now back

prisons—in the public or private sector, as I said—have
difficulties of this nature in the first two years of operation. That

discussed the points he makes in the debate last Monday and I am happy
to repeat what I said to him then, which is that the Government are
considering carefully all that was said in the course of the debate and
whether the sentencing is right for such offences. As he knows, we have
particular sympathy for his points about those who cause death while
disqualified.</hs_Para>

House will recall that on 13 January concerns were raised regarding two
documents released to the public in the National Archives. The
documents relate to the painful events that followed the occupation of
the temple site by Sikh dissidents in December 1983, which led to a
six-month stand-off with the Indian authorities. In June 1984, a
three-day military operation by Indian forces known as Operation Blue
Star took place. Official Indian Government figures estimate that 575
people died. Other reports suggest that as many as 3,000 were killed,
including pilgrims caught in the
crossfire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000009">That
loss of life was an utter tragedy. Understandably, members of the Sikh
community around the world still feel the pain and suffering caused by
those events. Given that, we fully understand the concerns raised by
the two documents. They indicate that in February 1984, in the early
stages of the crisis, the then British Government sent a military
officer to give advice to the Indian Government on their contingency
planning. Many in this House and across the whole country rightly
wished to know what connection, if any, there had been between that
giving of advice and the tragic events at Amritsar over three months
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000010">Within
hours of the documents coming to light, the Prime Minister instructed
the Cabinet Secretary to carry out an urgent investigation in four
critical areas: why advice was provided to the Indian authorities; what
the nature of that advice was; what impact it had on Operation Blue
Star; and whether Parliament was misled. The Cabinet Secretary was not
asked to investigate Operation Blue Star itself, or the actions of the
Indian Government, or other events relating to the Sikh community in
India. Although he has investigated those specific matters, I can make
it clear that during his investigation no circumstantial evidence has
been offered, or has surfaced, of UK involvement in any subsequent
military operations in the
Punjab.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000011">The
investigation has been rigorous and thorough. The Cabinet Secretary and
officials have met Sikh organisations to ensure that their concerns
informed the investigation. They have spoken with individuals
associated with the two documents, although some officials are now
deceased. They have examined <I>Hansard</I> records from 1984 to the
present day. They have carried out an extensive and thorough search of
the files held by all relevant Departments and agencies from December
1983 to June 1984. Their search through some 200 files and over 23,000
documents found a very limited number of documents relating to
Operation Blue
Star.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000012">The
report notes that some military files covering various operations were
destroyed in November 2009, as part of a routine process undertaken by
the Ministry of Defence at the 25-year review point. They included one
file on the provision of military advice to the Indian authorities on
their contingency plans for Sri Harmandir Sahib. However, copies of at
least some of the documents 
<?notus-xml column=140?>in the destroyed files were also in other departmental files. Taken
together, those files provide a consistent picture of what
happened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000013">The
Cabinet Secretary’s investigation is now complete. Copies of the
report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and it is now
being published on the Government website. The report includes the
publication of the relevant sections of five extra documents that shed
light on the period but would not normally have been published. We have
taken that step because the whole investigation has been based on a
commitment to the maximum possible transparency. We want to be as open
as possible with the British public, in so far as that does not
undermine the principle, upheld by successive British Governments, of
not revealing any information relating to intelligence or special
forces.</hs_Para>

findings of the report are as follows. First, on why the UK provided
advice to the Indian Government, the Cabinet Secretary has established
that in early February 1984 the then Government received an urgent
request to provide operational advice on Indian contingency plans for
action to regain control of the temple complex. The British high
commission in India recommended that the Government respond positively
to the request for bilateral assistance from a country with which we
had an important relationship. That advice was accepted by the then
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000015">Secondly,
the Cabinet Secretary then examined the nature of the advice that was
provided to India following that decision. He has established that a
single British military adviser travelled to India between 8 and
17 February 1984 to advise the Indian intelligence services
and special group on contingency plans that they were drawing up for
operations against armed dissidents in the temple complex, including
ground reconnaissance of the site. The adviser’s assessment made
it clear that a military operation should be put into effect only as a
last resort when all attempts at negotiation had failed. It recommended
including in any operation an element of surprise and the use of
helicopter-borne forces in the interests of reducing casualties and
bringing about a swift
resolution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000016">This
giving of military advice was not repeated. The documents show that the
decision to provide advice was based on an explicit recommendation to
Ministers that the Government should not contemplate assistance beyond
the visit of the military adviser, and this was reflected in his
instructions. The Cabinet Secretary found no evidence in the files or
from discussions with officials involved that any other form of UK
military assistance, such as equipment or training, was given to the
Indian authorities. The Cabinet Secretary’s report therefore
concludes that the nature of the UK’s assistance was purely
advisory, limited, and provided to the Indian Government at an early
stage in their
planning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000017">Thirdly,
the report examines what actual impact UK advice had on the Indian
operation, which took place between 5 and 7 June 1984, over three
months later. The report establishes that during that time the planning
by the Indian authorities had changed significantly. The number of
dissident forces was considerably larger by that time, and the
fortifications inside the site were more extensive. The documents also
record information provided by the Indian intelligence co-ordinator
stating that after the UK military adviser’s visit in February,
the Indian army took over lead responsibility for the operation, 
<?notus-xml column=141?>and the main concept behind the operation changed. The Cabinet
Secretary’s report includes an analysis by current military
staff of the extent to which the actual operation in June 1984 differed
from the approach recommended in February by the UK military adviser.
Operation Blue Star was a ground assault without the element of
surprise and without a helicopter-borne element. The Cabinet
Secretary’s report therefore concludes that the UK military
officer’s advice had limited impact on Operation Blue
Star.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000018">This
is consistent with the public statement on 15 January 2014
by the operation commander, Lieutenant-General Brar, who said
that</hs_Para>

is also consistent with an exchange of letters between Mrs Gandhi and
Mrs Thatcher on 14 and 29 June 1984 discussing the operation, which
made no reference to any UK assistance. The parts of the letter
relevant to Operation Blue Star are published with the Cabinet
Secretary’s report
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000020">The
Cabinet Secretary has also examined two other concerns raised in this
House and by the Sikh community—namely, that Parliament may have
been misled or that the decision to provide advice may have been linked
to UK commercial interests. The report finds no evidence to
substantiate either of these allegations. The investigation did not
find any evidence in the files or from officials of the provision of UK
military advice being linked to potential defence or helicopter sales,
or to any other policy or commercial issue. There is no evidence that
the UK, at any level, attempted to use the fact that military advice
had been given on request to advance any commercial objective. The only
UK request of the Indian Government made following the visit was for
prior warning of any actual operation so that UK authorities could make
appropriate security arrangements in London. In the event, the UK
received no warning from the Indian authorities before the operation
was
launched.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000021">The
Cabinet Secretary also concludes that there is no evidence of
Parliament being misled. There is no record of a specific question to
Ministers about practical UK support for Operation Blue Star, and he
concludes that the one instance of a written question to Ministers
related to discussions with the Indian Government on behalf of the Sikh
community after the
operation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000022">In
sum, the Cabinet Secretary’s report finds that the nature of the
UK’s assistance was purely advisory, limited and provided to the
Indian Government at an early stage; that it had limited impact on the
tragic events that unfolded at the temple three months later; that
there was no link between the provision of that advice and defence
sales; and that there is no record of the Government receiving advance
notice of the
operation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000023">None
the less, we are keen to discuss concerns raised by the Sikh community.
The Minister responsible for relations with India, the Minister of
State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member
for East Devon (Mr Swire), and my noble Friend Baroness Warsi, the
Minister for faiths and communities, will discuss them with Sikh
organisations when they meet them later today. This reflects the
strong, positive relationship the Government have—and all
British 
<?notus-xml column=142?>Governments have had—with the British Sikh community, which plays
such a positive role in so many areas of our national
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000024">We
are also determined to look at the wider issues raised by these events
with regard to the management and release of information held by
Government. Under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010,
the 30-year rule has been superseded by a 20-year rule, so that from
2022 all annual releases will be after 20 years. However, it
is not clear at the moment that this change is being approached in a
uniform fashion by all Departments. The Prime Minister has therefore
decided to commission a review to establish the position across
Government on the annual release of papers and the ability and
readiness of Departments to meet the requirements of moving from a 30
to 20-year rule, including the processes for withholding information.
This review will be carried out by the Prime Minister’s
independent adviser on ministerial standards, Sir Alex
Allan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000025">Nothing
can undo the loss of life and suffering caused by the tragic events at
Sri Harmandir Sahib. It is quite right that the concerns that were
raised about UK involvement have been investigated. It is a strength of
our democracy that we are always prepared to take an unflinching look
at the past. I hope, however, that this investigation and the open
manner in which it has been conducted will provide reassurance to the
Sikh community, this House and the public and, in that spirit, I

regret that the Government have so far refused to accept our call that
all relevant documentation relating to the incident that can be should
now be made public. I welcome the publication of five further documents
as part of today’s report, but, given that the report itself
cites “officials interviewed” over the course of this
investigation, will the Foreign Secretary now commit to publishing a
list of those officials, and will he confirm whether any surviving
Ministers who served at the time were interviewed as part of the

made

on the terms of this investigation led by the Cabinet Secretary, I
welcome the fact that, following representations by the Sikh community,
the Cabinet Secretary published a letter detailing the scope of the
inquiry. Will the Foreign Secretary explain, however, why there was a
more than three-week delay in publishing those terms of reference? Will
he further explain whether the terms of the inquiry changed over the

terms of reference, as published in a letter from the Cabinet Secretary
on 1 February, did not include specific reference to the time period
covered by the investigation, yet the final report sets out a time
frame of December 1983 to June 1984. Will the Foreign Secretary explain
why that time frame was not made public at an earlier

in this House is aware of the continuing pain felt by the Sikh
community around the world at the events of 1984—not just at the
storming of the Golden Temple in Amritsar and the deaths and
destruction that followed, but at the anti-Sikh violence that followed
the assassination of Prime Minister Gandhi, and the emergency period

there are of course differences within the Sikh community on the issue
of a separate Sikh state, there is unanimity in their horror at those
events. For British Sikhs over recent weeks, there has been the
additional burden of worry that their own Government may have been

responsibility—indeed, a duty—to address those very
widespread concerns and fears. If they can provide answers to all those

endeavour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000044"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="14020474000872" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000872">Mr
Hague:</Member></B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his
questions. He is right to draw attention to the efforts of several of
our colleagues, on these and other issues, always to find out the truth
about events in the past as well as in our own times. My hon. Friend
the Member for Wolverhampton South West (Paul Uppal) is another
example.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000045">The
right hon. Gentleman is quite right to refer to the anxiety about these
events that many people have expressed during recent weeks. That is why
we should do everything we possibly can to set out the truth of the
matter, in so far as that can be discovered from documents and from
discussions with officials. Taking what I said earlier as a whole, I
think that the story is a reassuring one for the House, the public and
the Sikh
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000046">The
right hon. Gentleman asked certain specific questions about the
process. He asked whether we would publish a list of officials. No, I
do not think that that would be appropriate. It is important to protect
the anonymity of some of the officials and military personnel involved.
He asked whether Ministers have been spoken to. Yes, the Cabinet
Secretary’s investigation included discussions with the senior
Ministers of the time. He asked whether the terms of the inquiry
changed. No, they did not change, except that the Cabinet
Secretary’s work was expanded to cover some additional concerns
that were raised during the past few weeks—we may come to some
of them later during questions—but the terms of the inquiry
remained the
same.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000047">There
is no mystery about the dates. At the beginning, the Prime Minister
asked the Cabinet Secretary to investigate the specific
events—whether there had been UK involvement in the specific
events leading up to and during Operation Blue Star in June
1984—and the time frame was therefore from the start of what
happened at the location in question in December 1983 to the Indian
operation in June 1984. As the right hon. Gentleman will have gathered
from my statement, the Cabinet Secretary was able to go beyond that to
say that in the 23,000 documents he has seen no circumstantial evidence

<?notus-xml column=145?>of British involvement in any subsequent military operation in the
Punjab. One of the questions raised is whether there could have been
British military involvement in subsequent Operations Black Thunder I
and II. From everything that the Cabinet Secretary has seen, having
examined hundreds of files—200 files—the answer to that
is
no.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000048">The
relevant documents—those that can be published while, as I have
said, upholding the publication principles that all British Government
have always observed—that relate specifically to Operation Blue
Star have been published. There will of course be publication over the
coming years of many more documents concerning British relations with
India at the time. I certainly do not want to suggest that no more
documents will be published that can shed light on relations between
Britain and India through the 1980s. As I understand it, the 30-year
rule—it will become the 20-year rule—is implemented on
the basis of 30 years from files coming to an end, but such files
contain documents from earlier years. Therefore, other documents will
of course be published about this period. However, the relevant files
have all been searched, and these are the documents that shed light on
Blue
Star.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000049">The
right hon. Gentleman asked about the quick analysis by the military. I
do not think that the word “quick” should be used in a
pejorative sense. The report has been quite quick, given that concerns
arose only a few weeks ago, and military experts have provided an
analysis, but it is clear even to a layman that the military operation
mounted was very different from any that was discussed in the
documents. As I mentioned earlier, it was entirely different: it did
not have the element of surprise; there were no helicopter-borne
forces; and it was conducted by the Indian army, not by the
paramilitary forces present when the UK military adviser was there in
February. Even to the non-expert on such matters, the military
operation mounted in June was clearly fundamentally different from any
discussed in February
1984.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000050">Overall,

degree—of transparency, and is a thorough and good job by the

20-year rule, is implemented. Those are fair questions that can be

released and, as in this case, what is destroyed. We can all question
that particular judgment in retrospect. The review that has been

great sadness to the Sikh community in Scotland, across the UK and

our society, and the very least that it deserves from this process is
closure. It will never overcome the sadness or get those lives back.
Sadly, I do not think that today’s report gives it the closure

the Punjab. That goes beyond June 1984. It is also clear in the letter

still were at that time. My father and grandfather were both born in
India, and I knew Indira Gandhi very well. I visited her a fortnight
before she was assassinated at her home, after the Golden Temple
disaster, and asked her whether she was wise to be surrounded by the
Sikh bodyguard, who looked magnificent in their uniforms. She said that
they were absolutely loyal to her, that some of them had served her
father, and that if she were to get rid of them it would be regarded
throughout India as an insult to the other Sikhs. There was nothing

investigation is not by Ministers but has been presented by the Cabinet
Secretary to the Prime Minister, and we should have confidence in that.
It has involved going through a huge number of documents, and the
publication of additional documents that would not normally be
released, and those things should be helpful in providing the necessary
assurances to people. On top of that, as I announced in my statement,
there will be a review of how we release documents, to ensure that all
Departments are living up to their responsibilities and doing so in a
uniform way, and that includes looking at the processes for withholding
information. I hope that all that, and the fact that we are moving from
a 30-year rule to a 20-year rule, will fortify or produce some public
confidence in the transparency of the processes.</hs_Para>

understand that there will be calls in the community for an apology or

thorough piece of work by the Cabinet Secretary. It is important for us
to support all processes of reconciliation, and to do so through the
dialogue with the Sikh community which I am sure the Government will
continue, as, I hope, will all political parties in this country. When
it comes to judging these past events for ourselves, if I or any of us
thought that this country had at any time materially contributed to
unnecessary loss of life, it would be something that we should say was
a mistake, for which the country should apologise. That case cannot be

discussing can cause worry, speculation and suspicion, and we must be
as transparent as possible about such things. The hon. Gentleman asks
about a further report, but it is important to remember that we can
only investigate and inquire into what we or our predecessors were
responsible for. The Cabinet Secretary’s report makes clear that
there is no evidence in the documents of any subsequent British
military involvement in any military operations in the Punjab. There
are many other wider issues and controversies that understandably cause
people great distress to this day, but they are predominantly matters
under Indian sovereignty, and part of the Indian people’s
responsibility for their own affairs. There is a limit to how much the

Secretary will be aware that Coventry has a relatively large and very
successful Sikh community. He will also probably know that for the past
30 years, since the incident happened, I have been lobbied in this
House repeatedly by the Sikh community. We had hoped that his statement
today would bring closure, but I fear it will not. One of the problems
is the military files that have been destroyed and much of what I have
received from the Sikh community recently has been on that point. His
statement today said that that “included one file on the
provision of military advice to the Indian authorities on their
contingency plans”. Only some of those other destroyed military
documents have been found in other files—only some. Can he
reassure the House that the bulk of the destroyed files did not relate
to the critical period of February and June, and then immediately after
June?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000110"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Hague" PimsId="3707" UID="14020474000923" xid="245" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000923">Mr
Hague:</Member></B> As set out in my statement, there was the
destruction by the Ministry of Defence of one file in 2009, but it has
turned out that some of the documents that would have been in it are in
other files around the rest of Government. The reassuring thing, I
think, is that all of the documents show a consistent picture. There is
not, in the Cabinet Secretary’s analysis of these documents,
something that remains unexplained. It is a consistent picture: of the
one visit in February 1984 by one military adviser; of no decision by
the British Government to give any further assistance beyond that,
either in nature or in time; and of the actual operation in June 1984
being very different from the advice given by that one UK military
adviser. All the documents are consistent with that in every Department
across the whole of Government in all 200 files. So, when we think
about it in that way, it is a consistent picture and it should be
reassuring.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000111"><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Phillips" PimsId="5622" UID="14020474000924" xid="1141" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000924"><B>Stephen
Phillips</B> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con):</Member> May I commend
my right hon. Friend on a very frank statement? I am afraid that I must
press him on one point. During the statement, he said that “the
adviser’s assessment made it clear that a military operation
should be put into effect only as a last resort when all attempts at
negotiation had failed.” It is therefore clear that there was an
assessment in February 1984 of the potential military operation. One
thing that causes such hurt to the Sikh community across the world was
the use of artillery, both at one of the holiest sites in Sikhism and
in the wider region. Will my right hon. Friend assure the House that no
British adviser, either this one or anyone else, ever gave advice that
artillery should be used, and that, insofar as any advice was given, it
was that a military solution was not the right way
forward?</hs_Para>

advice was that military solutions—I think British military
advisers would give this advice anywhere in the world—are only
for when all negotiations have failed. It also referred specifically to
the importance of speed and surprise, and to the use of
helicopter-borne troops to achieve that and minimise casualties. That
would not be consistent with the use of artillery, with all the
consequent collateral damage and destruction caused by the use of heavy
weapons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000113"><Member ContinuationText="Mike Gapes" PimsId="3370" UID="14020474000926" xid="219" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0001.htm#14020474000926"><B>Mike

Jallianwala Bagh and signed a message of condolence relating to an
atrocity carried out by the British military in 1919. Would it not be
appropriate for us to say something about apologising for the fact that
there was minor, limited complicity in giving military advice to the

the right thing in making that statement on other tragic events near
Amritsar decades before and in expressing this country’s regret
for that. That was absolutely the right thing and I think across the
whole House we support that. He did that because of Britain’s
responsibility for those events. Apologies go with responsibility and
imply a responsibility. As I said earlier, if any of us thought that
any British assistance had contributed to unnecessary loss of life and
to suffering in this case, or in any other case, we would all want to
say that that was a mistake and for the country to make an apology. But
that is not what is established by the Cabinet Secretary’s
report. The picture is very different from that, and we all have to

for Parliament to read; it is a report for the public to read. It is
published on the Government’s website and it is easy for Members
of Parliament to make copies available. People will be able to make
judgments for themselves on its transparency and on how much
reassurance to take from it. I hope they will be reassured that in this
country we do look into such documents and respond to demands for
investigations. We asked the highest ranking civil servant in the
country to lead those investigations. We ensured that officials from 30
years ago were interviewed and that tens of thousands of documents were
examined. 
<?notus-xml column=156?>There are not many countries in the world that have that level of

of Defence files were destroyed. This issue is not new and concerns
have been expressed ever since 1984. Therefore, what was going through
the minds of people in the MOD when they destroyed those files? Only
some of them have been discovered in parallel files kept in other
Departments. Why, at no stage in 1984, did any Minister feel fit to
tell the House of Commons that a British military adviser had been sent

because I do not think it is possible to read it and conclude that a
cover-up has taken place. It is the very opposite of that: the most
senior civil servant in the country has considered the matter in a
dispassionate and non-partisan way; he has been as open as possible
with documents; and he has shown that all the evidence and documents
paint a consistent picture. In those circumstances, it is not possible
to justify additional inquiries piled on top of inquiries. People might
be interested in other, related issues beyond the scope of the
investigation—it is wholly legitimate for them to pursue
them—but on the nature of British involvement in the events
leading up to June 1984, I think the Cabinet Secretary’s report

to put it this way. If any of us, in any part of the House, thought
that Britain had contributed to serious or unnecessary loss of life
elsewhere in the world, it would be right to acknowledge a mistake and
to say that the country apologises for that, but when the country
clearly does not have responsibility for it, that is a different
context. We have to go on the facts, and I think the facts are clear.
Of course, the hon. Gentleman is really asking us to judge to a finer

economically to this country and in two world wars—at the very
least we owe those in that community an inquiry. This investigation is
a step in the right direction, but we should have an inquiry. More
importantly, will the Foreign Secretary say what the Cabinet knew? Did
the Cabinet take the decision to send the adviser? Who consulted the

Hague:</Member></B> Thankfully there are no parallel situations that we
are dealing with in the world today. We do receive requests—now,
in the 21st century—for military advice or co-operation. As I
mentioned earlier, in responding to those we are extremely conscious of
all considerations of human rights and avoiding loss of life. These are
paramount factors in how the British Government, as we practise our
policies today, evaluate requests for assistance from other countries,
whether through their militaries or any other agencies. These policies
have taken shape over the years, and it is very hard to speculate about
exactly what considerations were in the minds of Ministers 30 years
ago.</hs_Para>

the question of 30 years ago, all we can do is be as open and
transparent as possible and let people evaluate the facts for
themselves. It would not be unusual or unknown, as I said, for foreign
Governments to ask for military advice. What is clear from this case is
that the military advice that was given was designed to minimise
casualties and to stress that military action should take place only if
all negotiations had
failed.</hs_Para>

am grateful for the opportunity to present this ten-minute rule Bill,
Madam Deputy Speaker. You will be aware of how high a profile flooding
has in the news at the moment. Sadly for many residents in Sherwood,
this is not a recent problem, but something they have lived with for a
very long time. Many of the villages of Nottinghamshire are built
around settlements dating back to Saxon times located next to a small
stream as a source of fresh water. They have evolved and grown for
hundreds of years. For many of them, the discovery of coal meant their
growth was quite rapid in the 20th
century.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000146">Sadly,
the drainage systems of those villages have not grown at the same rate,
and further developments upstream have added to the problem of
drainage. Those villages are today faced with sewage systems that are
already under enormous pressure and have a high risk of flooding during
periods of prolonged or heavy rainfall. That is because there are often
no top water drainage systems in place, and run-off from roofs,
driveways and highways is left to flood the highway or enter the
village stream or, even worse, is directed into the foul water system.
My Bill, should it be successful, seeks to prevent any further pressure
on these already over-stretched drainage
systems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000147">Currently,
water companies are placed under an obligation to connect any new
development to an existing sewage system, even if this system has
flooded in the recent past. It is the water company and its customers
who bear the costs of any improvements required, not the developer, who
may be building a large number of houses further upstream. My Bill
would do two things in those circumstances. First, it would ensure that
the developer was obliged to pay for any proportionate improvement
required in the foul water system. Secondly, my Bill would ensure that
any top water must be dealt with via a purpose-built top water system
and not increase water flows downstream during high rainfall
events.</hs_Para>

also apply where a new road development was taking place. Any new
highway being built would have to include its own surface water
drainage system that did not add increased volumes of water during high
rainfall events. Such action would be entirely achievable with the use
of balancing ponds, and would not dramatically increase costs, as the
new systems would be put in while the diggers were on the ground. There
are a number of instances in which that has already been done, but,
sadly, it does not appear to be happening in a number of instances in
Sherwood.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000149">Nottinghamshire
county council is currently planning the development of the Hucknall
inner relief road. I shall not be discussing the merits of that today,
but the proposed route runs though an area of Hucknall around 
<?notus-xml column=162?>Thoresby Dale, where there is already extensive flooding, and the
current plans do nothing to improve the plight of residents in the
area. The solution seems quite simple to me. The
council is about to spend more than £15 million on
the road; laying a purpose-built top-water drainage system below the
road, while the diggers are there in any event, would involve very
little additional cost, and would be of massive benefit to people in
the
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000150">My
second example relates to the village of Farnsfield, whose predicament,
sadly, is not unusual. The village has suffered a number of
flash-flooding events over the past five years, which have usually
culminated in an overflow of the foul water systems which has left
several householders with raw sewage in their gardens, garages and
homes. Newark and Sherwood district council is currently considering a
substantial development on the edge of the village, upstream of the
flooding properties, and that can only make the problem worse unless
substantial mitigation measures are introduced. My Bill would ensure
that the developer was legally obliged to do that, and would hold the
highway authority responsible for ensuring that it was done during the
planning process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000014">The
Bill is not retrospective, so it will not solve the existing problems,
but it will help to prevent them from being made worse in future. While
I am realistic about its chances of success, I nevertheless hope that
the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,
my hon. Friend the Member for Camborne and Redruth (George
Eustice)—who is present—has listened to my comments.
There may still be a further opportunity to amend the Water Bill, which

defines what amounts to a “miscarriage of justice” for
the purposes of compensation under section 133 of the Criminal Justice
Act 1988. There has been much debate about the clause, both here and in
the House of Lords, and I am indebted to all who have contributed to
examining this important issue. The Government have taken account of

debates that have taken place in Committee here as well as in the House

to note that Members of both Houses and members of the Joint Committee
on Human Rights agreed with us that that the current definition set out

we needed to legislate for a clear definition of a miscarriage of
justice given the ongoing uncertainty and reinterpretation of
definitions by the courts, and that our aim was not to seek to restrict
compensation, but to provide clarity. The question that remains before

indeed a complex issue. When a case is properly brought to
court—that is, when there is evidence of a crime on which it is
right to ask a jury to adjudicate—there is no miscarriage of
justice when the result of the trial is an acquittal, or even in very
many of the cases in which a guilty verdict is later quashed as unsafe.
The Government believe that a miscarriage of justice arises only when
there is in existence a fact which entirely exonerates the accused: in
other words, a fact which makes it unquestionable that the accused did
not commit the crime. In such cases, it is only the ignorance of this
fact that allowed the accused to be convicted in the first place. What
we are seeking to define is something far more than merely a failure in
the investigative or trial processes. We are seeking to define a clear
miscarriage of justice which is—and, in our view, can only
be—the wrongful conviction of the innocent.</hs_Para>

create an unambiguous statutory description of such a situation for the
purposes of compensation. The fact that the definition inserted in the
Bill by Lords amendment 112 is open to various interpretations is
obvious from the significant number of judicial review cases awaiting
consideration by the administrative court—13 at
present—in which the aim is to challenge the Secretary of
State’s application of the Supreme Court’s judgment in
the case of Adams. That number excludes the three cases that are
awaiting judgment from the challenge to the divisional court’s
decision in respect of R <I>v. </I>Abdulla Ahmed Ali and others, which
was heard by the Court of Appeal last December. A test similar to the
“Adams test”—the definition that is at the heart
of all these cases—is the test that is now being proposed in
Lords amendment
112.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000168">It
is vitally important for us to ensure that the definition that is
introduced into statute for the first time is “fit for
purpose”. It must be clear and robust enough to avoid the need
for further judicial interpretation, and, as far as possible, to limit
the scope for argument about what will amount to a miscarriage of
justice. The amendment that we propose would leave applicants in no
doubt: if the new fact that led to their conviction being quashed
showed that they did not commit the offence—for example, if it
were shown that they had been somewhere else at the time, if someone
else was proved to be the perpetrator, or if the courts acknowledged
that no offence had in fact been committed—they would have
suffered a miscarriage of justice, and would be likely to be
compensated.</hs_Para>

Returning to the amendment, these matters must be dealt with on a
proper evidential basis. It has never been the remit of a court or
Minister to pronounce on innocence. The issue is dealing with the
question of whether an offence has been committed. That is what any
jury or tribunal considers on the basis of the evidence. It is
therefore important to look at the test for 
<?notus-xml column=167?>compensation on an evidential basis, which plainly is whether an offence
has been committed. If we get into the territory of pronouncing on

carefully considered. As Lord Phillips said in that debate, the primary
objective of section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which this
clause would amend, is to provide redress to an applicant who has been
convicted when he or she was in fact innocent. He also considered that
its second and subsidiary objective was to ensure that an applicant
whose conviction had been quashed but who had in fact committed the
offence charged should not be compensated. Our proposed test goes a
long way towards achieving both of those objectives. We consider that,
while the definition of a miscarriage of justice for which we are

range of circumstances in which compensation should rightly be paid to
help people who need to rebuild their lives after suffering great

it would leave applicants less clear about what to do. This would
result in a large number of cases backing up in the courts waiting for
judges to interpret what Parliament meant by the legislation, just as
there are at the moment. The purpose of my proposal today is twofold:
first, to meet the reasonable objections that have been raised about
the original Government proposal; secondly, to provide greater clarity
so that the House can speak with as clear a voice as possible in these
difficult areas and not leave the field open to judicial

Dromey</B> (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):</Member> Justice demands that
those who are guilty of serious offences should be held to account and
brought before the courts, especially in the case of heinous offences
such as the murder of a child or a terrorist outrage of the kind that
the city I am proud to represent suffered in 1974, with the appalling
Birmingham pub bombings by the Provisional IRA, in which 21 innocent
civilians were murdered. The victims of such crimes deserve no less
than having the perpetrators brought to justice. Justice also demands
that the innocent should not be found guilty, however. When serious
miscarriages of justice occur, it is right that the innocent have
access to justice and are able to be compensated for them.</hs_Para>

is extorted as a consequence of outrageous and unacceptable pressure in

Guildford Four, I will never forget when they walked to freedom and
Gerry Conlon stood on the steps of the Old Bailey and said that his dad

were right in principle to include in the Bill a statutory definition

lead to the Secretary of State passing judgment on whether or not a

area of the law, while adhering to the age-old principle for which I
have argued so strongly. When the Court of Appeal has quashed a

is worth stressing again that the amendment from the other place is not
about giving people more compensation automatically or making it easier
for people to get off on technicalities and then to claim compensation
in all circumstances; it is about serious and rare cases in which it is
entirely appropriate that the victims should receive compensation. As
our amendment makes clear, asking people to prove their innocence
beyond reasonable doubt is an affront to our system of law, and denying
compensation to those who have been wrongly convicted is an affront to
a decent society. Many Members of this House, including my hon. Friend
the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and the hon.
Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan), have campaigned for many years on
miscarriages of justice.</hs_Para>

fact is that our legal system is not perfect, and cases do go wrong. It
is a tribute to our legal system that miscarriages of justice are rare,

at the start of my contribution, miscarriages of justice lead to ruined
lives. Families are destroyed. People leave while their partners sit
wrongly behind bars. Jobs and homes are lost and people’s
reputations are left in tatters. The mental despair and anguish are
never fully resolved, which is why victims of miscarriages of justice
need real help on their release. People’s lives can never go
back to how they were. That is where we, as a decent society, have to
make amends, and that is what our amendment does.</hs_Para>

I urge all Members of this House to support a rigorous and fair justice
system that sticks up for its founding principle of people being
innocent until proved guilty; that rejects the notion of “beyond

where a serious miscarriage of justice has happened, innocent people
receive fair compensation for all they have suffered; and that reflects
rulings already set out in the Supreme Court and the European Court of

hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey) has
explained the implications of the proposal with regard to the
Birmingham Six and Guildford Four. Let me put the situation in context
following my involvement in the case of the Guildford Four. A number of
people are locked up for many years. When they come out, they have
nothing—no accommodation and no employment. The financial
compensation they receive is relatively minimal compared with the
suffering that they have gone through, and it is desperately needed to
ensure that they have a chance of some form of normal life in the
future.</hs_Para>

of the Guildford Four—it was the same in the case of the
Birmingham Six—we found that not just the prisoners but whole
families were devastated. There have been suicides in the family of
Paul Hill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North (Jeremy
Corbyn) knows, the lives of Errol and Theresa Smalley have been
permanently damaged. The whole family network has been damaged as a
result of that case. Gerry Conlon admitted it when he came out of
prison. He was addicted to drugs, because that was the only way he
could cope. The state pays compensation to try to do whatever it can to
remedy the injustice that took place.</hs_Para>

the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six went to court and were
quashed because the forensic evidence demonstrated that confessions
were made under duress and that documents were tampered with. When they
left court, it was on the basis that the system had failed in due
process to prove that they had committed the crimes for which they were
brought to court. We then went through a negotiation process, which was
quite bizarre; I did not realise that, under the existing compensation
arrangements, their compensation would be reduced to pay for
accommodation charges while they were in prison. It was a real struggle
to get that compensation. The Minister says that this is not the case,
but under the proposed system, if a case is quashed on the basis of
that type of evidence, the defendants will have to go to another level
of proof to get any compensation. They will have to demonstrate not
that the process was faulty in the first place and that they should
never have been caught, but that they did not commit the crime, which
is having to prove innocence. That is almost impossible, for any of us.
Trying to prove that negative is contrary to everything in English law,
and practically impossible to do.</hs_Para>

Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti) raised the case of

court awarding compensation to take into account whether the person
contributed towards their plight. That has an effect on compensation
levels or even whether compensation is awarded at all. By seeking to
arrive at some definition in legislation, we are digging ourselves into
a very complicated and costly hole, and that cost will be on the
individuals who are desperately trying to ensure that they get some
compensation for the ill that they have experienced as a result of the
state’s failure to live up to a proper process. Additionally, it
will be extremely costly for the state. As a result of the weakness in
the definition proposed by the Government, we will see case after case
being dragged through the English courts and then the European courts.

the process that is under way at the moment risks making a laughing

compensation arrangements at the moment are not absolutely perfect, but
at least we have managed to secure some compensation for those cases
that have been quashed as a result of the state’s failure, and

processes were not adhered to and it will be another case that is
eventually quashed. I hope that the Criminal Cases Review Commission
will posthumously provide some proof that she should never have been
taken through the courts, but again, the case has been dragged out over
years, demonstrating how difficult it is, even when trying to prove the
failure of due process, to secure not just a decision but any
compensation. The new process will make it even harder to get
compensation, drag the decision-making processes out for even longer

unfair.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000248">I

Durkan:</Member></B> I rise to support Lords amendment 112 and oppose
the Government’s amendment in lieu. The Minister told us that
the Government were moving to allay the concerns raised by the use of
the word “innocence” and its abuse in the Bill as
originally drafted. Of course, many of us argued that the wording used
in the original Bill changed all the normal presumptions about
innocence under the rule of law and that it was tilting things to say
that because someone had not proved their innocence they could remain
guilty, even though they had been released on a quashed conviction. We
were concerned not just about the word “innocence” but
about the fact that the burden of proof would be reloaded for cases
subject to review on the basis of new evidence that could lead to a
quashed conviction. We were concerned that the question of compensation
would be tested by altering the burden of proof so that new evidence
had to prove someone’s innocence. The onus was being put on that
person and their legal team to show the strength of the
evidence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000250">The
Government’s response to the Lords’ fairly reasonable and
measured amendment is to say that they have solved the problem of
innocence by using the term “did not commit” about the
offence. The Minister was asked again and again to tell us the
difference. A brand of soup—I cannot remember which—used
to be advertised by the slogan, “The difference is in the
thickness.” We are being told that there is a big difference and
the Minister is emphasising its importance, but he cannot explain,
specify, spell out or measure in any way the difference between whether
someone can show that the evidence proves that they are innocent of an
offence or whether they can show that it proves that they did not
commit the offence. Even some of the interventions from the Government
Back Benches seemed to rest more on whether there was evidence that an
offence had been committed than on whether there was evidence that the
person had actually committed the
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000251">There
are cases, of course, in which we know that gross and horrible offences
have been committed, but that is very different from saying that that
proves that a person who was charged and convicted of that offence has
committed it. At other times, offences that might or might not have
been committed are subject to questions and conjecture. We might
consider our experiences in this House, as we might be thrown into the
spotlight of public judgment about whether or not we did something. If
we consider “did not commit” and “innocent”
in that context, we might start to tease out some of the
differences.</hs_Para>

were arrested on the basis of some allegation, the fact that we were
not charged and nothing more happened would show that we were innocent,
but would other people necessarily say that it proved that no offence
had been committed and nothing had happened? Things might be different;
there can be a difference between “innocent” and
“did not commit”. As the hon. Member for Hayes and
Harlington (John McDonnell) said, it is hard to prove a negative. We
know from recent events of major publicity and political import in
which allegations were made that someone had spoken to and treated
police officers in a particular way, leading to consequences and all
sorts of sweeping media and public judgments—although thankfully
not court judgments—that that person was put in the position of
having to prove a negative. They were asked to prove that they did not
say what they were meant to have said and that they did not behave in

think not only about the hard and serious cases when we consider
miscarriages of justice in this jurisdiction; some of the questions

Lords amendment is designed, I believe, to meet the problem that the
Government were seeking to address in the Bill. The Government said
that they did not want to create a situation whereby the quashing of a
conviction led either to the automatic fact of compensation or to the
automatic assumption or expectation of compensation. They felt that
some other test or qualification was needed. That was what the
Government decided; it might not have been the starting point for some
of us who have campaigned on miscarriages of justice cases such as
those of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. Long after the
latter conviction was overturned, I worked with Gerry Conlon and his
mother to try to ensure that there was an apology that fully vindicated
them and voiced their innocence, because many people in the system and
the media were still trying to hide behind the pretence that it was a
technical quashing of the conviction but that the conviction itself was
due and proper. For them, the issue is not compensation but the
absolute assertion of innocence. That was why offence was taken at the
use and abuse of the term “innocence” in the original
Bill, but that was not the only issue. The burden of proof was altered
and an attempt was made to allow in the system for someone who had been
convicted and imprisoned for a long period not to be entitled to
compensation, because they could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that
they did not commit the offence or their
innocence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000255">Lord
Pannick’s amendment accepts the Government's premise that there
needs to be a definition and bases that definition on many issues that
have been tested in other cases, including, as we have heard from the
Minister, the Adams case. Based on the working and practical use of the
law, the Lords amendment is wise and considered in its suggestion that
a new or newly discovered fact should show conclusively that the
evidence against the person at trial is so undermined that no
conviction could possibly be based on it. That is not a hard test, as 
<?notus-xml column=177?>it does not open up things to conjecture. It basically allows courts to
do what many appeal courts and more senior courts often have to do in
considering the material evidence that would have been in front of a
lower court and to make a judgment on that basis.</hs_Para>

amendment would simply allow someone, after their conviction has been
quashed, to pursue compensation on the basis that the quality of the
new evidence shows that there would not have been a conviction in the
first place. By refusing that, the Government are basically seeking to
return to a situation in which the courts, the police and the
prosecution service could be seen as part of a nexus of pursuing and
achieving a miscarriage of justice. The beauty of the Lords amendment
is that it would clearly take the lower court out of the frame, because
it states that had the lower court known about such evidence, it would
never have achieved the
conviction.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14020474000867" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000867">3

we have not heard in the Government’s case today, or indeed at
other times, is exactly what the state’s case would be in
relation to some of those compensation cases. Will the prosecutor and
the police basically say, “No, we are contesting this, because
the quality of the evidence we had was good enough and would have been
worthy”? That would create, to use Lord Denning’s
terrible phrase, an “appalling vista.” We might end up
with the law, as it is stated here, meaning that the state authorities
will still use the new wording offered by the Government to make that
suggestion and to implicate the courts in that case as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000258">As
we know, the courts have been able to make wise and sensitive judgments
based on the balance of the material available—the material that
was available historically and that is available currently. Lord
Pannick’s amendment would allow the courts to continue to behave
in that measured and responsive way and to take full account of the
fact that a conviction has been quashed, but the issue of compensation
does not flow automatically from that; it relates to testing whether or
not the evidence, had it been available the first time, would have
undermined the original conviction. That seems reasonable to me,
because it rests on what would have been reasonable for a court to
decide, and on the judicial system having confidence in its norms,
practices, assumptions and presumptions. It would not rely on anybody
else having to discharge an inordinate burden of proof of their
innocence—of whether they had committed an offence, if it was
known to have been committed, or of whether they committed an offence
that might not be known and not even fully proven, because whether or
not it was committed and who was involved in the conspiracy could be a
matter of
conjecture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000259">I
would also like to point out that victims of miscarriages of justice
have not only been offended and insulted by the way the Government
brought forward their original clause and their clumsy amendment in

compensation alone. Indeed, I am very conscious that, along with Gerry
Conlon and other victims of miscarriages of justice, and along with the
hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington and others, we worked with the
Ministry of Justice in the previous Parliament to try to provide some
other remedies and support for victims of miscarriages 
<?notus-xml column=178?>of justice. As the Minister said, people who have been wrongly convicted
face enormous challenges in putting their lives back
together.</hs_Para>

those victims of miscarriages of justice are not given the sort of
psychological support and remedial therapy that the Government rightly
make available to released hostages, for example; to those who have had
dire experiences while serving abroad in the military or potentially in
custody; or to those who have been held hostage in civilian situations
or as volunteers overseas. In those cases, highly specialised support
and treatment is made available, yet the traumas and the adjustments
that they have to try to make are very similar to those of victims of
deep miscarriages of justice and a harrowing time in prison, perhaps
because of the nature of the offence for which they were charged and
the nature of the treatment they received, and not just from prison
authorities, but from the prison
population.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020474000261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020474000261">I
ask the Minister, in moving beyond the immediate detail of the Bill, as
well as in considering compensation, which I believe the Government are
misaddressing  in their amendment in lieu to the reasonable
Lords amendment, to look to the other issues, because if he is saying
that compensation should not be the only answer and the only thing we
are thinking about, what other answer are the Government providing,
because they have failed to move forward on the measures examined by
the previous Government?</hs_Para>

hard to take seriously anything he said today, because he still cannot
explain the difference, and exactly the import of that difference,
between what he is offering in his original clause and the amendment in
lieu. The reality is that the only real difference—the valid and
important difference—is that which is contained in the Lords
amendment. That is why the House should agree to Lords amendment
112.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_04_PT_1/80700615A0FA7DDB64A13EA77F567EF4BAB708F9" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 February 2014">Tuesday

Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) referred to the
long-term damage done to individuals, and indeed to their families, by
such miscarriages of justice. In the case of the Cardiff Three, damage
was clearly done not only to those individuals and their families, but
to an entire community. I believe that what happened was a public harm,
because it damaged relations between community groups in Cardiff. We

case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020475000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020475000003">The

have placed a heavier burden of proof on the individual, as he or she
would have been forced to prove their innocence of a crime years or
even decades after it took place. The Lords instead passed their
amendment 112, which means that a person could be awarded compensation,
provided that the evidence now used  
<?notus-xml column=179?>against them could not possibly result in a conviction at trial. That
means that the evidence against a person is so undermined that no

the Government now intend to disagree with the Lords and, in effect,
reiterate their original intention by saying that the evidence would
need to prove that the defendant “did not commit” the
offence. We have already heard the debates about the semantic
difference between “did not commit” and
“innocent”—I was imagining lawyers dancing on the
head of a pin. That would once again place the burden of proof on the
defendant. It asks the defendant to do something that is virtually
impossible: to prove a negative—that they did not do a certain
thing—years after the trial has taken
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020475000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020475000006">The

put it to the Minister that that is surely about as good as we are
going to get as an effective definition in taking things forward. If we
have to take the route of proving that an offence was not committed,
then I see all kinds of injustices occurring further down the line. A
point was made about Barry George. We all agree that the murder of Jill
Dando was disgusting, appalling and revolting, and obviously the person
who did it should suffer the consequences of committing it. Barry
George was imprisoned and later released. Therefore, the court had
decided that he did not commit the offence. Has he now to prove his
innocence even though he has been released by a court? That case is
very well known, and I suspect that very many others do not get that
degree of publicity. Miscarriages of justice happen all the
time.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who has
had to leave to chair a Public and Commercial Services Union group
meeting but will return, I was very involved in the Birmingham and
Guildford cases. Indeed, Paul Hill, who was the first person ever
arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974, was a constituent
of mine. I went through the whole business of the campaign, and
eventually those people were released and compensation was paid.
However, I have to say two things about the compensation. First, there
seemed to be a calculation based on the expected income of those people
throughout their lives, yet at the time of their arrest, the Guildford
Four were not particularly well paid, working as part-time building
workers in some cases, and one would not have said that their economic
prospects were particularly good. But who knows what would have
happened to their economic prospects had that terrible miscarriage of
justice not
happened?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020475000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020475000015">Secondly,
one area of compensation was not effectively taken into account. This
was not just about the emotional cost to the wider families—my
hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington is correct that there
have been some awful traumas in the families of the Guildford Four, the
Birmingham Six and many others—but the financial cost. In
mounting a campaign to try to gain the release of a convicted prisoner,
particularly when they have been convicted of very serious offences, it
is difficult to gain public support and even more difficult to find
anybody to help finance it, so in many cases the families paid out a
great deal of money themselves.</hs_Para>

forward that was taken on the release of the Birmingham and Guildford
people was the establishment of the Criminal Cases Review Commission,
from which we took very interesting evidence last week in the Justice
Committee. There are a number of cases that it does not review because
it does not think there is enough evidence to do so. When people come
back and demand a re-examination, in some cases the CCRC will then
review. In the very large number of cases where it does review, it
sends those cases back to the Court of Appeal and subsequently the
individual is released. On that basis, compensation should be
automatic—a given. If 
<?notus-xml column=181?>someone has been convicted, the case has been reviewed by the Court of
Appeal, and they have been released, obviously the Court of Appeal must
have had some very good grounds for releasing them. I do not see why
they should then have to go through another hoop of trying to get
compensation by proving that they did not commit an offence that they
have been released for not committing. We are getting into a big
problem in this regard.</hs_Para>

realise that the Minister is unlikely to change his mind at this stage,
but if we as a House do the right thing and accept the Lords amendment,
that would be good. If we reject it, I hope that the Lords will return
to it and insist on it, because it protects some of the very good
advances that we have made in dealing with miscarriages of justice. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)
pointed out, the judicial system is not perfect. No legal system is
perfect. The jury system is as good as we will get, but it is not
perfect. Juries can make mistakes or misread evidence; all kinds of
things go wrong. Highly trained legal minds can misread evidence and
get things wrong. These things happen. Therefore, there must be the
failsafe of an appeals system. There can be gross miscarriages of
justice, as we well know. There has to be a further safeguard, and that
is where the review system and the Court of Appeal come in.</hs_Para>

this back to first principles, the domestic courts have always made it
clear that compensation should be paid when the new facts that form the
basis on which a person’s conviction was quashed clearly show
that the applicant did not commit the offence. However, the courts have
never been able to define without ambiguity a stable and robust test.
Given the courts’ difficulty in this area, we decided to create
a clear and definitive statutory test, the requirement for which is
supported by Parliament and others, including the Joint Committee on
Human Right, although I appreciate not by the hon. Member for Hayes and

the test, we have sought to provide an amendment that recognises that
compensation should be paid only to those who genuinely warrant it.
What we require to achieve that is for the new fact to demonstrate that
the applicant did not commit the crime—I addressed the various
situations in which that could be shown—and that this should be
evident from the reasons outlined in the Court of Appeal’s
judgment that led to the quashing of an applicant’s conviction.
The applicant does not have to prove their innocence—in other
words, the reversal of the burden of proof, which Members have
mentioned. That is simply not the case. The reasons why the applicant
could not have committed the crime will be evident from what is
outlined in a successful appeal.</hs_Para>

6 of the Bill, and I will deal briefly with each one in turn. Members
will, I am sure, have watched with interest the proceedings in the
House of Lords on the test for issuing an injunction in part 1 of the
Bill. Because of the clear vote in the Lords, where there seems to be a
majority, and in the light of that debate, the Government has accepted
that the test for an injunction should be amended. Lords amendments 1
and 5 will provide for a two-tier test, and the nuisance or annoyance
test will continue to be used to deal with housing-related antisocial
behaviour. In all other circumstances, the test of harassment, alarm or
distress will apply.</hs_Para>

Government believes that the fears raised in the Lords and by campaign
groups were unfounded, and our view is shared by the Law Society and
housing providers who have been using the nuisance or annoyance test
responsibly and proportionately for more than a decade. The suggestion
was made that we somehow wanted to curtail the activities of carol
singers. It is slightly difficult to believe that any Government would
want to do that, and that we would mis-write legislation to enable that
to occur. We are then expected to believe that a local council or
police officer would want to use the legislation to ban carol singers.
We are then expected to believe that any court in the land would deem
it proportionate, just and convenient to ban carol singers. Of course,
by the time a court had so decided, several weeks on, the carol singers
would have left the place where they were singing and it would not be
possible to capture them. I think that that example shows some of the
exaggeration and scaremongering that have occurred on this proposal.
The Lords have spoken, however, and we have listened carefully. It is a
democratic Parliament and we have therefore accepted, largely, the

beliefs. Lords amendments 2 and 19 respond to concerns by the Joint
Committee on Human Rights relating to the provision in clauses 1 and 21
that require a court to avoid, so far as practicable, imposing
prohibitions or requirements in an injunction or a criminal behaviour
order that would conflict with a respondent’s religious beliefs.
The amendments remove this wording, as the right to hold a religious
belief is absolute. It was simply the manifestation of a
person’s religious beliefs that we intended the provision to
capture, but a court would be obliged to consider this in any case to
comply with its obligations under the Human Rights Act. That being the
case, the neatest solution is simply to remove the provision. That is
what has happened, and I hope that that deals with the hon.

clause 12 meant that the injunction could be used to exclude a

to others. However, in the Lords, concerns were expressed, by my
Liberal Democrat colleague Baroness Hamwee, on whether it would ever be
appropriate to exclude under-18s from their own home on the grounds of
antisocial behaviour. Lords amendment 10 limits the exclusion
provisions to injunctions where the respondent is over 18. Where it is
in the best interests of the child to

Lords amendments, particularly on the threshold for injunctions to
prevent nuisance and annoyance, improve the Bill, taking the threshold
from “nuisance and annoyance” to “harassment,
alarm or distress”, but overall we feel that the Bill still
weakens the powers against antisocial behaviour, which is of growing
concern to people. It is a badly worded Bill thrown together on the
usual principle of, “We must do something. This is something.
Therefore, we must do it”, which the Government seem to operate

the Lords amendments on forced marriage originally moved on Report by
my noble Friend Baroness Thornton and later taken up by the Government,
who tabled similar amendments ensuring that where a person lacks
capacity an offence would be committed where conduct was carried out
for the purpose of forcing someone into a marriage. It is arguable, I
agree, that this is the case under present law, but the amendment makes
it clear. It is sensible because it ensures that where a person is
incapable of understanding the implications of their decision, the new
offence can be committed even without violence, threats or coercion.
This will also apply in Scotland.</hs_Para>

vulnerable who lack capacity, will

Government’s firearms amendments seem fairly minor: one closes
the loophole around antique firearms, which seems perfectly sensible,
while the other relates to suspended sentences. Currently, a three-year
jail term bans someone from owning a firearm for life and a three-month
sentence leads to a five-year ban. The amendment treats a three-month
suspended sentence in the same way, which we welcome, although it does
not go far enough. When someone has a conviction, the police have
grounds for refusing an application. The problem comes when there is no
conviction but the police have evidence of violent behaviour
in the past. That was why we wanted an amendment to provide that where
the police found credible evidence of domestic violence, or drug or
alcohol abuse, a firearms licence could be refused. No sensible gun
owner has anything to fear from such a provision.</hs_Para>

evidence of domestic violence or drug or alcohol abuse, and that
refusal could be challenged in court. As a first premise, we should be
clear that we should not put guns in the hands of people with such a

Oxford and other towns in this country how horrific some of this

exploitation. It was, in my view, impossible for the proprietors of

the Minister responds to the debate, will he clarify one point in
particular? For a closure order there has to be reasonable suspicion
that a criminal offence has occurred. This could be a sexual offence
against a child, but the obvious thing that we are likely to be dealing
with in such situations is grooming, and the offence of grooming is
quite a hard one to establish. That is why there are few convictions
for it. The adult has to have met and communicated with the child
twice, and the adult must then meet the child and, at that time, the
offender must have the intention of committing a relevant sexual
offence.</hs_Para>

Julian Huppert</B> (Cambridge) (LD):</Member> There is a huge range of
issues to cover in this group of amendments. I will not even try to
touch on them all, but will talk about a few that I am particularly
concerned about and have raised on a number of occasions.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000016">This Bill
started with pre-legislative scrutiny. It is telling, to me at least,
that quite a number of the amendments made in the other place were
originally recommended during pre-legislative scrutiny. Perhaps if the
Government looked at pre-legislative scrutiny earlier, we might get
there somewhat faster. With that in mind, I particularly welcome the
changes to the injunction to 
<?notus-xml column=196?>prevent nuisance and annoyance, or IPNA—the issue that has
received perhaps the most attention—in Lords amendments 1 to 5.
This is a welcome change, and I pay great tribute to my hon. Friend the
Minister for his work in getting us to this place.</hs_Para>

pre-legislative scrutiny, the Home Affairs Select Committee said there
was a risk that the provisions could be interpreted as being too broad.
The Minister has quite rightly described why some of the stories that
were going round—for example, about how carol singing would be
prevented—were simply not true but were good debating points. We
made it clear that we had real concerns with the provisions as they
stood. I am pleased that, as a result of the changes in the other
place, we now have something that is much more proportionate. We have
moved away from causing nuisance and annoyance in the general sense to
something more serious. That is definitely right, because all of us are
quite capable, I am sure, of causing nuisance or annoyance to people on
various occasions.</hs_Para>

Huppert:</Member></B> I was somewhat surprised by the original
amendment passed in the other place, which was backed by many,
including Labour peers, because it wrote into law discrimination that I
would not be happy with. We have rules about behaviour that is
unfair—behaviour that is too harsh—but I was really
surprised to see an amendment that said there should be one set of
rules for people in social housing and a completely different set of
rules for people in private housing. If someone’s behaviour is
causing problems that are sufficiently serious to be dealt with under
the Bill, the form of tenure should not matter. I was very disappointed
by that amendment and very pleased that the Government corrected it.
What we now have corrects that problem and I am happy to support it,
because I would not have been able to support the previous version from
the Lords.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jack Dromey" PimsId="5693" UID="14020495000443" xid="1005" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000443">Jack
Dromey:</Member></B> Just for the record, the proposal for a
tenure-neutral approach in fact came from Labour Lords.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Huppert" PimsId="5589" UID="14020495000444" xid="1023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000444">Dr
Huppert:</Member></B> I do not have the list of exactly who proposed
what. The Government amendment we have is neutral; the one that Labour
peers supported in the other place was not tenure-neutral. I hope the
hon. Gentleman agrees that that was a flaw in it, although the other
principle was there.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000025">I welcome the
change, although I remain surprised by the position of the Opposition,
who felt that the version that left this place was both too draconian
and too liberal. I am glad that their position has moved in a more
liberal direction. The new approach is far better than the failed
system of ASBOs, which many young people collected as a badge of
honour. A huge number 
<?notus-xml column=197?>of people broke them; they simply did not work. I think that this
non-criminalising approach will work much
better.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000026">Let me turn
now to some of the other issues. Lords amendment 10 is important and
concerns the principle that we should not be using these rules to throw
children out of their own homes. The Lords pushed for that, and it is a
shame that we did not manage to get it fixed in this place. The
importance of care for the under-18s should have been emphasised more
strongly during the Bill’s earlier stages, and I am glad that it
has been emphasised more strongly now. This is another of the issues
that were dealt with by the Home Affairs Committee. I am also pleased
that Lords amendment 11 proposes the removal of clause 13, because it
discriminated on the basis of tenure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000027">Lords
amendments 23 and 24 deal with the rights of free expression and free
assembly. The Home Affairs Committee recommended that we should ensure
that dispersal powers were not used in a way that could damage those
rights. Before my hon. Friend became a Minister in this Department, the
Government moved some of the way towards this, and I am glad that he
has now been able to persuade them to move the whole way, so that we
can protect all forms of free expression and free
assembly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000028">Lords
amendments 59 to 64 deal with cases of riot. Riot is of course very
serious, and we have already seen what it can lead to in this country.
As a result of what happened, the Prime Minister said that he wanted
stronger powers to deal with the families of people who were rioting.
Many of us felt that, although we could understand the tensions that
existed at the time, his suggestion went too far. It did not seem
appropriate to throw everyone out of a house because a 16-year-old
child had committed a minor offence where a riot was happening. I do
not in any sense condone either the riot or the behaviour, but throwing
an entire family out of their home seems to be a disproportionate
response. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Minister for his work in
this regard, which has led to the proposal that an automatic eviction
should take place only if the offence is committed by an adult, and
only if it is a serious, indictable offence. A trivial offence that
happened to be committed near a riot would not lead to such an
eviction; nor would an offence committed by a
child.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000029">Finally,
let me raise two issues that we had very little time to discuss during
our initial debates in this House, and that were not particular topics
of interest at that stage. The first involves surveillance and the
Terrorism Act 2000. Lords amendment 102 and related amendments deal
with the powers of the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to deal with
complaints about the surveillance commissioners and their decisions.
The IPT does not necessarily work as well as it needs to, and it is not
as transparent and open as it needs to be, but I am glad that we are
taking a step towards more transparency. Surveillance oversight is an
extremely important subject, and the Bill does not finish what we need
to do about it. There is much more to be done, but although the
amendments represent just a tiny piece of the jigsaw, I welcome
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000030">Lords
amendment 100 and related amendments deal with schedule 8, which amends
schedules 7 and 8 to the Terrorism Act. Schedule 7 became very topical
at the time of the detention of David Miranda. I am pleased that, after
a great deal of argument in this House, we 
<?notus-xml column=198?>have managed to get some changes made in the House of Lords. People must
be questioned within an hour of detention, reviews must take place
within two hours of that, and people’s right to consult a
solicitor is made clear. That fundamental right was omitted by the
Terrorism Act when it was passed by the last Government. There is much
more to be done about that as well, but I am very pleased with all the
amendments. I commend the Minister and his team for their work, and
look forward to our passing the amendments
promptly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000031"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Field" PimsId="3229" UID="14020495000445" xid="198" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000445">Mark
Field:</Member></B> I agree with the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr
Huppert) that it is a shame that the Government did not take more
account of the pre-legislative scrutiny, relying instead on the other
place. I accept that all too often, whichever Government are in play,
the electoral arithmetic ensures that legislation is rushed through and
guillotined here in the House of Commons, and some sensible suggestions
are then made in the House of Lords, many of which—as in this
instance—we end up not seeking to oppose. Given the relative
paucity of legislation in the House of Commons over the next
15 months, I hope that we will pay the House a little more
respect, and ensure that whatever Bills come before us during the fifth
year of this five-year Parliament are given proper
scrutiny.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000032">I
support what the Government are doing in Lords amendments 40, 41 and 44
to 47, which relate to public bodies that can issue a public spaces
protection order. That has particular resonance in my constituency, and
I am glad that a number of friends—in the broadest
sense—of the City of London corporation in another place were
able to make some important changes. Numerous other bodies which
operate open spaces under local Acts—such as the Wimbledon and
Putney commons conservators, to name but two of them—will also
benefit from what the Government are doing. The proposed new clause
would enable bodies other than local authorities administering open
spaces under byelaws to use public spaces protection orders. I believe
this is particularly relevant to trustees or local conservators who
operate under byelaws inferred by private Acts of Parliament, many of
which go back not just many decades but some centuries. I hope the
Minister agrees with that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000033">The
City of London corporation operates some of the most important open
spaces in London and the south-east, including Epping forest and
Hampstead heath. There are also important local authority parks. In
Newham there is West Ham park and there is Queen’s park in the
London borough of Brent. It was often under private Acts of Parliament,
frequently through bequests of what were the curtilage of large mansion
houses, that these local parks and amenities were founded, often back
in the 18th and 19th
centuries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000034">Conservators
have exactly the same issues as local authorities in terms of the
public open spaces they administer, so it is sensible to include these
places in order not to have duplication but to ensure there is not an
opportunity for some of these powers to slip through the net.
Conservators are not required to use the orders, and they can keep to
the local byelaws if they so wish. If they do make an order, however,
and the local authority for the area makes its own, the local
authority’s order will take precedence. That is right.</hs_Para>

are sensibly drafted. The powers of the City of London corporation
would not in any way 
<?notus-xml column=199?>usurp those of the relevant local authority, but this does provide a
belt-and-braces approach to ensure there is a proper focus on public
order within those important open
spaces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000036">I

House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000037"><Member ContinuationText="Richard Drax" PimsId="5691" UID="14020495000446" xid="1219" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000446"><B>Richard
Drax</B> (South Dorset) (Con):</Member> I will not detain the House for
long. I want to touch briefly on the dangerous dogs element of the
Bill. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee of which I
am a member published its report on dog control
and welfare on 6 February 2013. In that report we
recommended that all dog-related issues should be consolidated in a
comprehensive Bill. This would pull together the fragmented legislation
referring to dog control and welfare and allow us to amend the
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 where necessary.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000038">Such
consolidation is essential because there are yawning gaps in our
legislation. Voluntary compliance with guidelines on responsible
ownership has proved to be limited and slow, but that is not surprising
as there are 8 million dogs in this country—a huge number. The
vast majority are well cared-for, kept and controlled, but there are
exceptions. Dangerous dogs have killed seven people, five of them
children, since 2007. In my own constituency a small child had her eye
savaged by a West Highland terrier, but more about that later because
there are certain circumstances there which I want the Minister to
cover when he responds to the debate. Dangerous dogs have attacked
specially trained dogs for the blind, causing untold grief and
difficulties—and let us not forget the postmen and postwomen who
all too often are assaulted by animals as they deliver our
mail.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000039">Irresponsible
dog breeders, driven only by greed, run puppy farms where a single
bitch can legally produce up to five litters a year. That is not good
for the welfare of the bitch or her litter. Subsequent failure to
socialise these puppies properly has the potential to create more badly
behaved and dangerous
dogs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000040">Under
the law as it stands, it has proved impossible to prosecute the owners
of vicious dogs if the attack takes place on private property. In such
cases it has also frequently proved difficult to prove ownership. The
proposals in this Bill include many of the Committee’s
recommendations on dog control and welfare, such as compulsory
micro-chipping by 2016, stricter oversight of puppy farms, and
extending dangerous dogs legislation to private property in clauses 98
and 99, and I wholly endorse them. The tougher sentences in the two
amendments in question for those whose dogs attack, injure or kill
people or guide dogs for the blind are also necessary and
proportionate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0002.htm#14020495000041">I have just
one concern, which I ask the House to consider. If we legislate to
allow enforcement agents on to private property to handle or destroy a
dangerous dog after an attack, we are impinging on important rights to
privacy in our own homes. While I—and, I am sure, the other
members of the EFRA Committee—fully endorse the amendments to
the current legislation, any new legislation must be careful to protect
those rights.</hs_Para>

give an example from my constituency, and I hope that the Minister will
listen to it, because I would be interested to hear his response. A
couple and their 
<?notus-xml column=200?>four-year-old daughter were invited to a party next door. It was a dog
party, and there were several dogs—and several
people—there. In the resulting mêlée of people
wandering around and having tea, the couple lost sight of their
daughter. Suddenly, they heard the most appalling noise. There had been
some form of communication with a dog by the girl, but we do not know
whether she had poked it in the eye or put her hand in its mouth.
Whatever she had done, the dog—a West Highland terrier, which
had done no harm at all up till then—responded by leaping up and
latching on to the left side of her face. It would not let go, and
caused horrific damage to her
eye.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000043">I
ask the Minister’s guidance on this point. I assume that, under
the proposed new law, the lady who owned the dog would face a criminal
prosecution. If that is the case, the change in the law will provide a
salutary warning to dog owners who keep their dog in their home, as
many millions of people do. When the law is passed, they will have to
be very careful what they do with their dog when inviting people into
their house. I suspect that not many people have even considered the
matter up to now. I have two dogs, and I do not think about whether
they are going to attack anyone who comes into my house. From now on,
however, I am going to have to think carefully. If a child comes into
my house, I am going to have to think about whether my dogs could
assault that child.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000044">Obviously, it
goes without saying that a dog owner must take responsibility for their
dog, but I raise this question because I wonder whether the process of
the law has been thought through by everyone outside this place. Can
the Minister confirm that, if the new law had applied at the time of
that incident, the lady in question would not have faced five years in
jail, and that the judge would have considered all the facts of the
case and perhaps recommended that the dog be put down, with the lady
facing no further consequences? Will the Minister also tell us how and
when the enforcers would go into the owner’s house in such a
case? If a complaint was made, would they go in on the same night to
remove the dog, informing the owner that it could either be put down or
returned, depending on the result of the ensuing investigation? I ask
the Minister to clarify those points if he can.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000045">I assume that
if the dog owner were someone with a bad reputation—let us be
blunt: if they were well known to the police for breeding properly
vicious dogs, rather than West Highland terriers, for ill-gotten
gains—the enforcer would simply go into the house and take the
appropriate action. That is exactly as it should be. Such a case would
be very different from the one that I have described, in which a
perfectly innocent lady was going about her business when an appalling
accident happened. Yes, that accident could have been avoided if the
dog had been locked up, and that is the point that I would like to have
clarified. I welcome the Lords amendments to allow people who have dogs
on private property to be reached by the law. That is incredibly
important, but I would be most grateful if the Minister could comment
on the example that I have
raised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000046"><B><Member ContinuationText="Richard Fuller" PimsId="5734" UID="14020495000447" xid="1004" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000447">Richard

it was for them to prosecute under the existing legislation, and Lords

Baker:</Member></B> With the leave of the House, Mr Deputy
Speaker, I will respond to some of the points that have been raised in
a very wide-ranging debate. As you will appreciate, we are considering
a huge range of disparate measures, so I will do my best to make sense
of them. I welcome the Opposition spokesperson’s general
support, even if, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (Dr
Huppert) says, we are not clear whether they are accusing us of being
too draconian or too weak in our response to antisocial behaviour. As
they are accusing us of both, perhaps we have got it about
right.</hs_Para>

the Opposition are wedded to the ASBO, but the simple fact is that,
although it may have been useful on occasions, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) has
said—I am not saying it has not—it has generally been a
failure. In 2012, the 1,329 ASBOs issued represented a decrease of 68%
since 2005. Up to the end of 2012, 
<?notus-xml column=202?>58% of ASBOs were breached at least once and 43%
were breached more than once. Where ASBOs were breached, they were
breached five times on average, and the breach rate for under-18s was
69%. Defending a continuation of that arrangement is not a sensible
approach for anyone in this House who is as sensible and concerned as
everybody should be, and is, about tackling antisocial
behaviour.</hs_Para>

Baker:</Member></B> I am happy to keep anything like that under review.
Everyone in this House shares a dislike of and distaste for the
reprehensible child exploitation activities that some people engage in.
Of course there are other evidential trails that the police can use.
Grooming often takes place online, and so sometimes evidence can be
accrued and then added to the use of a hotel, which then gives the
police reasonable grounds for taking action. Of course we will keep
matters under review, because we want to ensure that we eliminate all
such cases as far as it is possible to do so. We share that objective
across the

wish to commend the work on dangerous dogs done by Members in this
House, including my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Richard
Fuller). The Bill will put us in a better position when it comes to
dangerous dogs. The Government made a commitment to consult on
increasing the penalties for an offence under section 3 of the
Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. That is the aggravated offence of owning or
being in charge of a dog that is dangerously out of
control—where a dog kills or injures a person or an assistance
dog. That was prompted by an amendment tabled by my hon. Friend, and I
am grateful to him for raising that important issue.</hs_Para>

consultation, Lords amendment 69 increases the penalties from the
current maximum of two years' imprisonment. Where a dog is dangerously
out of control and that results in the death of a person, the maximum
penalty will increase to 14 years’ imprisonment. Where a person
is injured, the maximum penalty will be five years, and where an
assistance dog is injured or killed, it will be three years’
imprisonment. That is a sensible way
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000060">My
hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax) asked about a
specific situation in which a person is invited into someone’s
home, and what that might mean if an offence is committed. It might be
decided that an offence had been committed under those circumstances if
the police and then the Crown Prosecution Service conclude that there
is sufficient evidence and that a prosecution is in the public
interest. That is not to say that such a prosecution would always take
place. I suspect that it would be a matter of the CPS concluding that
the dog was dangerously out of control and that there were other
aggravating factors of that nature. It would not automatically follow
that if there were an attack, there would be a
prosecution.</hs_Para>

there? If the case does not go to court, who has the power to decide on

or pursued, there is no case to answer. However, I imagine that
responsible owners would want to take into account the activity that
has taken place or the attack on the individual that has occurred. Of
course it is always open to people to take civil action if they believe
that that is the appropriate course of action. If I find out any

ownership and guidance, particularly in relation to domestic violence.
I assure her that we take both issues extremely seriously. Indeed I am
spending a great deal of time on those two issues in my ministerial
role. I want to make it plain that the law sets out that the police
must consider whether a firearms or shotgun applicant can possess a gun
without danger to public safety or the peace. The detailed criteria are
set out in the firearms guidance, which can be amended when we believe
it to be necessary. On 31 July last year, we took action to strengthen
the guidance for the police on domestic violence specifically, and
published new, more detailed guidance. For the avoidance of doubt, if
there is an expectation or an understanding that someone has been
involved in domestic violence, I would expect in most if not all
circumstances the police to refuse to issue a licence to that
particular
individual.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000064"><B><Member ContinuationText="Helen Jones" PimsId="1207" UID="14020495000453" xid="316" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000453">Helen

processes to be followed, it might not be necessary to create a law to

amendments also clarify that a detained person is entitled to consult a
solicitor in person, where it is practicable to do so, without
prejudice to the purpose of the examination. Other amendments respond
to a commitment given in Committee in the Lords to consider building on
one of the key changes we are already making in the Bill: namely, the
introduction of statutory provision for the review of detention under
schedule 7 to the 2000 Act. On reflection, we agree that the maximum
periods between reviews should be specified in primary legislation,
rather than in a code of practice. The amendments provide for a first
review of detention by a review officer no later than one hour after
the start of detention, and for subsequent reviews at intervals of no
more than two

ought also to refer to marital coercion. I will deal briefly with a
final substantive amendment, Lords amendment 113, tabled by Lord
Pannick, which would abolish the defence of marital coercion. It is
currently a defence for all criminal offences, other than treason and
murder, for a wife to show that she committed the offence in the
presence of, and under the coercion of, her husband. The defence is an
historical one and reflects the particular dynamics of marriage at the
time when it was introduced, which was by section 47 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1925, which in turn abolished the previously existing
presumption that a wife who committed any offence, except treason or
murder, in the presence of her husband did so under his coercion and
should 
<?notus-xml column=206?>therefore be acquitted. For those historical reasons, the defence
applies only for the benefit of a woman married to a man. I am happy to
say that time has moved on, as indeed will I in a moment. That
one-sided defence is now clearly an anachronism, and we accordingly
agree that it can be consigned to history. Lords amendment 113 achieves
just
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000081">These

occasions about people going on to the cheapest tariff. The reality is
that many people are adversely affected by prices. If they are off the
gas grid, for instance, they will never get the best deal offered by
energy companies because they cannot have the dual fuel discount.
Equally, there are people on fixed charges and various other things

associated with customers not paying their gas and electricity bills by
direct debit have largely been ignored, even though it can end up
costing consumers significantly more. Unlike the hon. Member for Ynys
Môn, who has known about the problem for some time, I first
became aware of it only a few weeks ago. A pensioner in my constituency
told me that she had received a letter from Co-operative Energy saying
that because she was not paying her bills by direct debit, she would be
charged £63 a year extra. I could not believe it—I
wondered how on earth such a thing could happen, given that she had
gone to the post office religiously to pay on time. I thought,
“That is a lot of money”, so on the Monday, I rang up
Co-operative Energy and spoke to the general manager, who was very
pleasant. He said, “Actually, ours is one of the lowest”.

charged their consumers the same whether or not they paid by direct

into account those who struggle to get access to proper banking
facilities. Some 1.9 million households in the UK do not have a current
account and there is no facility for them to have an overdraft. Half a
million of those households do not even have access to a basic bank
account that can accept direct payments. Such people are incredibly

they are being penalised for that and are often those who can afford it

of the energy companies justify these fees? First, they claim,
amazingly, that the fees they charge are proportionate. Under
Ofgem’s licensing conditions to energy companies, they are
required to ensure that what they charge is reflective of cost. As I
have said, I have no problem with a small administrative charge to
reflect the extra cost companies face in processing a cheque, but many
companies offer a paperless discount of approximately £6 per
annum, implying that the cost of letters is £6. Keep Me Posted,
after discussions with mailshot companies, has revealed that the cost
of printing letters, staff cost, postage and printing is 19p per item.
I 
<?notus-xml column=216?>would therefore question how some companies have concluded that sending
out letters can cost up to £15, and whether that is truly
proportionate. It is also worth noting that some companies, such as
Good Energy and Green Energy UK, do not charge their customers anything
different based on their preferred type of payment, believing that
customers should not be penalised for how they choose to
pay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000171">Secondly,
the companies argue that they should charge more owing to the cost of
providing credit to customers. Of course, I understand that when one
pays for something retrospectively there is an extra cost, but, as I
have said, it is also worth pointing out that some companies that
charge retrospectively do not charge anywhere near as much as the big
utility companies. BT is not my favourite company. Nevertheless, it
bills customers retrospectively for the calls they make, yet charges
just £2 a month to customers who do not pay by direct debit.
There is no extra charge for any customers who are on a low income and
therefore qualify for the BT basic service. I praise BT for making a
commercial decision not to rip off their customers and to charge just
£2 a month. I believe that companies should be able to meet some
of these extra costs themselves. Because of the nature of direct debit
payments, customers often pay too
much.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000172"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kate Hoey" PimsId="983" UID="14020495000506" xid="280" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000506">Kate

claim is that the cost differential—coming on to the point made
by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)—is due
to the discount that companies offer customers who pay by direct debit.
Indeed, many energy companies I spoke to told me that what they
actually offered was a discount to encourage customers to use direct
debit. However, if companies are using discounts to attract customers,
it seems possible that they are using non-direct debit paying customers
to subsidise these accounts—the point I made earlier.
Differences in price should therefore be called a premium, rather than
a discount, which can be misleading. Calling a difference of
£390 a discount is like calling a mortuary a negative patients

claim is that the cost is reflective of the fact that those who do not
pay by direct debit are more of a risk for non-payment. I have seen the
cost breakdown 
<?notus-xml column=217?>of some companies that shows how much this adds on to the extra charge.
Roughly, it makes up about half. Returning to some of the people I
quoted at the beginning of this speech, all of them said that they pay
on time without fail. Why should they pay more because of other
people’s
mistakes?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000177">The
fifth claim—I am nearing the end of my remarks—is that
introducing a cap on what companies can charge consumers would result
in everyone’s prices going up. That should not be the case, and
the suggestion that it would push up prices is symptomatic of an energy
market that is not as competitive as it should be. Energy companies
should be fighting to keep these charges as low as possible to hold on
to as many customers as they can. It tends to be the smaller companies
that charge the least or do not differentiate between payment types. I
am pleased that the Government are encouraging new entrants to the
market, but in the short term I believe that a moderate cap on fees
charged is the answer.</hs_Para>

conclusion, I am not against energy companies. I believe in business,
but I believe in fair business, not the juggernaut of the big
corporation. That is why I urge the Government, first, properly to
investigate these charges and reassure customers that their bills are
proportionate and that they are not being hoodwinked. Any companies
whose charges are not found to be proportionate should be subject to a
fine or windfall tax, with all the money being passed back to the
consumer. Secondly, there should be fundamental reform of the system.

paying a lot more for our energy. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned,
energy prices have increased eight times faster than earnings since
2010. It affects us all but impacts on lower-income households far
more, not just because they have less to spend generally, meaning that
any rise in the price of everyday goods and services hits them harder,
but because they pay more than better-off households for their heating
and 
<?notus-xml column=218?>power—many poorer households pay for their light and heating
using prepayment meters. That is the area on which I want to
concentrate.</hs_Para>

prepayment meters have more expensive tariffs than direct debit
customers. Citizens Advice calculates that meters add £100 a
year to the average bill, which is a lot of money for someone on a low
income already stretched by the rising prices of other household
essentials. It is no wonder, then, that StepChange debt charity has
recorded a 129% rise, between 2010 and 2013, in the number of clients
in electricity arrears and a 114% rise in gas
arrears.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000187">We
can all understand why energy companies want customers to pay their
bills by direct debit—it is easier for them and
cheaper—and many of us do pay that way, but 45% of households do
not, according to Which?. In fact, more than 7 million people in the UK
pay for their gas and electricity by prepayment meter, and that figure
has been rising in recent years. It is not right that less well-off
families are being penalised for using this payment method. There are
many reasons households choose not to pay by direct debit: they might
not have a bank account; they might be wary of falling into arrears;
they might have been put on a meter by the energy company for past
arrears; or they might simply have inherited the meter from a past
tenant in their flat or
house.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000188"><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Twigg" PimsId="4367" UID="14020495000514" xid="610" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000514"><B>Stephen
Twigg</B> (Liverpool, West Derby) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> My hon. Friend
is making a powerful case about prepayment meters. I have been
contacted by a constituent who wants to get off her prepayment meter.
She has just been made redundant and is facing a big cost of living
crisis in her own life, but to come off the meter will cost her
£195, because Scottish Power charges £45 for a home visit
by an inspector and then expects her to come up with a further
£150 for a credit check. She will get that back if she passes,
but she is still expected to find £195 just to come off the
prepayment meter, which she wants to do to reduce her energy costs. Is
that not another example of how these charges are a penalty on the
poorest?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000189"><B><Member ContinuationText="Yvonne Fovargue" PimsId="5720" UID="14020495000515" xid="1122" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000515">Yvonne
Fovargue:</Member></B> I quite agree with my hon. Friend. Indeed, I was
coming to that very point. The company I spoke to charges £50
for removal, or a deposit, and as my hon. Friend says, a credit check
is payable by the person who wants to change their meter.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000190">The other
issue is that many people on prepayment meters are not aware of the
tariff they are on, particularly if they moved into the accommodation
with the meter already in place. In a recent survey by
Stratford-upon-Avon citizens advice bureau, only 7% of gas users
surveyed and 12% of electricity users knew the name of their supplier
and the tariff they were on. This state of affairs is not helped by the
fact that prepayment users receive only an annual statement. They do
not receive quarterly statements. They receive an annual statement,
which makes it impossible for them to monitor their expenditure, their
deductions and their energy use on a regular basis. Crucially, many do
not know that in addition to the energy cost, they are having a daily
standing charge deducted from what they pay. Many people believe that
all the money they put in goes to fuel, but if they try to economise in
the warmer weather by not topping up their card, they easily build up
arrears of the standing charge, and that plays havoc with the household
budget.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=219?><hs_Para UID="14020495000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000191">The situation
is made worse by emergency credit, which is often accessed by pressing
the special button on the meter. In the Stratford-upon-Avon survey
67% of people used emergency credit in colder weather, but
most did not realise that the deduction for the standing charges and
arrears cease when they go on emergency credit, and are then taken off
when they next top up. I have seen people at the citizens advice bureau
who have topped up £10 but have had almost £5 of that go
on their standing charge. That plays havoc with the household bills. If
the money cannot be found, the prepayment user is left without light,
heating or cooking facilities. In the Stratford-upon-Avon survey 30% of
the clients who answered the survey had a long-term limiting health
condition. These are the people we are leaving without heat, light or
cooking
facilities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000192">Prepayment
meters are often presented as an effective budgeting tool for
low-income households, and—this sounds quite
benign—people self-disconnect. But they do not self-disconnect:
they simply do not have the money to top up or they cannot get to the
shop to do it. The reality is that the meters themselves are
contributing to the increased debt problem. The highest fuel poverty
rate by payment method is among households that pay for their fuel
using a prepayment
meter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000193">Energy
companies need to stop discriminating against prepayment meter users
and accept that there are good reasons why people are reluctant or
unable to pay by direct debit. They need to ensure that prepayment
meter customers have access to and knowledge of the various tariffs on
offer, and that they get the best energy deals. There is a lot of talk
about consumer choice, but for many on prepayment meters there is often
no choice, unless the choice is between eating or heating. The energy
companies need to respect their prepayment clients—they are
customers, after all—and ensure that they have real control over
their expenditure and energy
use.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14020495000420" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000420">5.27

Swales</B> (Redcar) (LD):</Member> I add my congratulations to the hon.
Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon), who has led the charge, and to all
the other Members who supported his motion today. The debate has
already shown that there is no monopoly of concern in one part of the
House—we are all concerned about this. I heard the calls for
extra analysis of the issue, but there is no doubt that we are talking
about an issue that largely affects the poorer part of the community.

on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000195">I
worked in the electricity industry way back in the 1970s. I was
probably around at the start of the discount for direct debit schemes.
We always used to do our marketing campaigns in the spring. Why?
Because that allowed us to pile up credit through the summer, which
helped to finance the business. There is no doubt that companies are
doing that. We always used to aim to hit the exact average over the 12
months, but some companies seem to be looking to build up credit over
the 12-month period by assuming extra usage. That practice ought to be
stopped. Back in those days we used to give people an incentive of
£2 or £3 a quarter for paying by direct debit. I am
staggered by the size of the so-called incentive 
<?notus-xml column=220?>that is around now. It seems to be way out of line with any measure of
actual costs. Of course, we have additional things now, such as
discounts for online bills, which can add up to a fair amount, so there
are many ways in which those without direct debit facilities or the
internet are being penalised.</hs_Para>

want to follow on from the previous speaker, the hon. Member for
Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue), who made a good speech about prepayment
meters. Rather like the hon. Member for Harlow, I had this issue
brought to my attention just a couple of weeks ago. I was aware there
was an issue, but I did not know how big it was until a constituent of
mine called Frank Harrison claimed he was spending an extra
25% by having a prepayment meter. I found that staggering,
but sure enough, when I did a bit of digging, I found that that was
roughly the figure. I heard the figure of £100 from
Citizens Advice. However, I have checked the three biggest comparison
websites, which estimate the difference at between £160 and
£300 extra for having a prepayment meter, and we are talking
about people who largely cannot afford any extra.</hs_Para>

the history. As an accounting trainee, I remember going round with a
meter collector with gigantic bags of silver coins, which he had to
keep shipping to a bank. The costs of prepayment meters used to be
serious when somebody had to be sent round collecting money frequently.
However, we do not have that now; we have pre-payment cards. The risks
of default are minimal. Prepayment meters also used to be a big target
for theft, but not any more, and the energy companies are getting their
money in advance, so the excuse that the costs of prepayment meters are
much higher starts to fall away, given that people have to pay for the
energy before they use it. Therefore, by definition the bad debts will
be nil.</hs_Para>

Members in calling for transparency. It is inexcusable that these
companies appear to be able to differentiate however they like,
whenever they like and to any degree they like. The concept of a cap,
which we heard about from the hon. Member for Harlow, is an extremely
good start, but I would like to go further. Through policies such as
the energy company obligation, the Government already require energy
companies to do things—in that case to do with
insulation—for the poorer sections of the community. Given the
cost of energy, it is high time that companies were required to do
more—to get involved not just in insulation, but in levelling
the playing field between different methods of payment, particularly
when it comes to prepayment meters, and to bring down the direct debit
difference, if it is to exist, to a very low level. I would favour the
Government saying, “Along with the ECO, we expect you to provide
the lowest cost tariffs, whatever the method of
payment.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000199"><Member ContinuationText="Jake Berry" PimsId="5576" UID="14020495000517" xid="1147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000517"><B>Jake

draw attention to the issue, I organised a gas and electricity advice
day in my constituency. It was attended by representatives of the big
six, Co-operative Energy—which was very new at that
point—debt advice agencies, the Royal British Legion, and other
bodies that do good work out there to help people. It was also attended
by representatives of uSwitch, because I thought that my constituents
were, in the main, not people who would know how to go about switching.
I thought that it would be anathema to them. After all, few of us who
get up and go to work each day want to spend hours trying to decide on
an alternative energy supplier. uSwitch was inundated on the day.
People—they were mainly elderly, and mainly members of
particular ethnic minorities—brought their bills, and cautiously
went to talk to the uSwitch representatives. I observed that no one
trusted their suppliers to stick to a better deal if they managed to
secure one, or felt confident that the wool would not be pulled over
their eyes.</hs_Para>

question and answer sessions on a rolling basis with Audrey Gallacher,

430 people were there that day. Some said, “We know that we are
paying more because we do not 
<?notus-xml column=222?>pay by direct debit, but we do not trust our supplier. We do not want it
to have access to our bank account. We would be in economic meltdown if
the supplier took large sums from us, so we do not want it to have
access to our account. We also know that although we will be racking up
credit, because that is the sort of people we are, the supplier will
still increase our direct debit.” Others asked, “How do I
know that I am not being wrongly charged? How can I understand my gas
bill? Do I need to be an advanced scientist to understand what the unit
price is, and how the supplier charges me?” That question arose
time after time, and it made me more aware of how people felt. Members
of the Caribbean community in my constituency, in particular, did not
want to be involved with direct
debit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000207">Gas

debt among those who come to my surgeries. I encountered an amazing

elderly mother, who has had a stroke, and has four adult children. She
won the jackpot when she was given a social tenancy of a four-bedroom
house. All her dreams were realised: she was out of the insecurity of
the private rented sector. Her only problem was that her supplier,
British Gas, then attempted to take £835 from her account to
meet her gas bill. I do not know about other Members, but I could not
sustain a direct debit of £835. Certainly Mrs Boakye, as a
nurse, could not do so. Her account was put in a spin, and all her
direct debit payments began to be missed. It took some time for British
Gas to agree that it had made a mistake.</hs_Para>

today’s debate and the motion, which focuses on direct debit
payments for electricity bills, we must also take into consideration
the current economic situation faced by consumers. People are already
paying excessive energy bills. Nearly all the major UK operators
increased the cost of annual bills by about 10% last year, while Power
NI delivered a staggering 17.8% increase in Northern Ireland. Although
the recent jobs and GDP figures for Northern Ireland give some cause
for hope, the truth is that this limited recovery is not being felt by
families who are faced with higher energy bills, rising petrol costs
and real-terms pay cuts. In this economy, every pound matters and that
is why today’s debate is so
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000211">It
is understandable if a company wants to give a discount to customers
for paying by direct debit, and that is an entirely valid pricing
structure, provided that it reflects the genuine saving to the company
of the payment option. However, what is not acceptable is the vast
price differential which seems to be prevalent in the
current market between customers paying by direct 
<?notus-xml column=223?>debit and those not paying by direct debit. It would seem that those not
paying by direct debit are actually paying a penalty to subsidise other
customers’ lower bills. That is clearly
unacceptable.</hs_Para>

plain and simple matter of consumer choice. There are over 1 million
people in society who do not hold current accounts and who therefore do
not have the option of paying by direct debit. Moreover, 45% of all
bill payers, including many of those with bank accounts, do not pay
using direct debit for a variety of valid reasons. Such people, who are
often vulnerable or elderly, should not face a penalty for that. Sadly,
the people facing penalties, which can amount to hundreds of pounds a
year, are often also those most likely to be facing fuel poverty or for
whom such an amount of money would make the biggest
difference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000213"><Member ContinuationText="Jesse Norman" PimsId="5615" UID="14020495000523" xid="1081" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000523"><B>Jesse

to which disadvantaged people are being put by these meters and other

our constituents have suffered from rocketing energy prices over the
last few years. Hard as that is for everyone, it is harder still for
those who are unable to access the special deals that are offered by
just about all the energy companies. In passing, however, I note that
it is not all plain sailing for those who sign up to pay by direct
debit, which can involve either a quarterly bill payment or paying a
set amount per month. Those who take the quarterly bill payment option
do not necessarily have any control over the amount being taken from
their bank account, especially if they are out a lot and regularly have
estimated bills. That can be a real problem. For those who opt to pay a
set amount per month by direct debit, the company will regularly try to
increase the amount they pay, whether or not the current amount covers
their bills. Any attempt to retrieve an overpayment can result in a
long tussle. At any given time, the energy companies are sitting on
substantial sums that have been overpaid by customers. These are
estimated to be about £2 billion, earning the companies
£36 million a year in interest. It is hardly surprising that
they keep trying to up the level of people’s direct
debits.</hs_Para>

not helped by the fact that energy companies are often not transparent
about the charges that will actually be applied. The hon. Member for
Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue) mentioned the fact that many people on
prepayment meters did not know what tariff they were on. In recent
price rises we were told the average, but that hides a multitude of
sins. A constituent, a low energy user, contacted me yesterday
regarding the charges levied on his flat. He told me that the unit
charge had risen from 7.242p to 10.89p—a rise of some 50%. That
is
outrageous.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000228">The
crux of the debate is not so much energy prices as social exclusion.
Gratifying as it is to give the big six energy companies a well
deserved kick, we also need to examine the actions taken by many of our
major financial institutions and how they work against people accessing
cheaper energy deals. The Minister may be able to do something about
energy companies and Ofgem, but we need a cross-governmental effort to
look also at how people access finance and bank accounts. The major
energy companies all offer better deals if people can pay for their
energy by direct debit; Citizens Advice reckons that the average saving
is £100 on that paid by people who pay by other methods,
although it can be as high as £140. That is great for people who
are able to pay by direct debit, but many of those most in need of
cheaper energy are the very people unable to pay by direct debit. There
can be many reasons for that. Banking exclusion is one such reason,
because about 1 million people do not have a bank account. We have all
seen in recent years the flight of the banks from rural areas and areas
of deprivation, and just the other week many branch closures were
announced.</hs_Para>

directly address the point made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh East
(Sheila Gilmore). Anyone who cares to look at banking comparison sites
such as MoneySuperMarket.com or money.co.uk will find that data on best
buy basic bank accounts show that some managed accounts with niche
suppliers, which are supposedly specifically designed to help people
with poor credit histories budget, have substantial monthly fees of
about £12 to £14; those come up first if people google
“basic bank accounts”. By contrast, some of us still, at
least for the moment, enjoy free banking, as well as being able to get
direct debit payments on our energy. It is also illuminating to look at
the discussion forums on some of these sites and at the threads on
basic bank accounts. It is apparent that the big banks, some of which
still offer basic bank accounts without a fee, try to place people who
inquire about basic bank accounts on their basic current accounts,
which allow the very overdrafts that many of those seeking basic bank
accounts seek to avoid. Such accounts can also sometimes come with
swingeing penalties should the limit be exceeded.</hs_Para>

people may find that the payment card for their basic bank account
works only in certain automated teller machines. That makes things
difficult, particularly in rural areas, where there may be only one
ATM; if it does not happen to be the right one, people cannot access
their money. Many people who have had difficulties with banks in the
past are also wary of opening basic bank accounts with the same banking
group, as they have real concerns that the money that goes into them
might be swiped by the banks to clear pre-existing debts. All of that
works against taking advantage of direct debit deals.</hs_Para>

is even worse for people who are on prepayment meters. As I have said
before, this is one of the rare examples where people are actually
penalised for paying in cash up front. Not only can they not access
special deals, but the tariff is often higher. Many people who rent
privately have no option, as private landlords have often installed
prepayment meters. Worse still, when meters are calibrated to recover
existing debt, much of the money is taken before energy is
provided.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000237">Those

people, the advice from successive Governments to switch suppliers or
to pay by direct debit simply does not work. I accept that there are
additional costs in different types of payments, but the huge disparity

action on the matter and a fairer and transparent charging system. The
motion calls for a cap on charges, which is very reasonable. I
appreciate that the problem is not all down to the Department of Energy

congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)
on securing this important debate. I intend to keep my comments brief,
as other Members have covered some of the subjects in 
<?notus-xml column=227?>such depth. However, there is an issue that I wish to raise, pertaining
as it does to the south-east. We have just heard from the hon. Member
for Angus (Mr Weir) that people in the south-east are more likely to
pay their bills by direct debit. However, even in Hampshire, which is a
relatively well-developed county, there is a significant problem with
broadband access in rural areas, making it hard for people to manage
either their banking or energy payments online. As we have heard, it is
those who can manage an online account who often get the most
preferential rates for their energy
bills.</hs_Para>

too much of a generalisation to say that it is the elderly who are
least likely to use the internet to manage their energy bill. There are
many silver surfers in my constituency who are happy to use the
internet to manage their energy bills and their banking, but they
cannot manage them in areas where the broadband speeds are simply not
adequate to do so. I speak from some experience; I can manage my own
energy account online, but that is because I have relatively rapid
broadband speeds at home and can upload the regular requirements of the
meter readings that have to be taken. There are plenty of people in my
constituency who are still on dial-up, and simply could not dream of
uploading anything to the internet via those means. It is important
that those who cannot manage their energy bills online should not be
discriminated against.</hs_Para>

briefly to comment on the issue of refunds. We have repeatedly heard
from Members about how their constituents have seen their accounts
getting into very high rates of credit. Of course, if someone knows
that their account is in credit, it should not be particularly
complicated to make contact with the energy company and ask for a
refund. However, in the case of direct debits, we can all cite examples
of how they are increased year after year. Consumers can find
themselves paying more and more without ever being in a position to
compare the bill, how much they are paying and how much is in their
account. They are often confused by the sheet on the back of their
bill, which does not make things
transparent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000241">In

Wilson</B> (East Antrim) (DUP):</Member> I congratulate the hon. Member
for Harlow (Robert Halfon) on securing this debate through the
Backbench Business Committee and on the work that he has done on this
issue. When we consider the impact of rising energy bills on people
across the United Kingdom, every aspect of those increases should be
closely
examined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000243">Northern
Ireland has one of the highest levels of energy bills, and we have
certainly had the highest increases in recent years. That is the result
of a range of issues, including the green energy policies of central
Government that add £100 a year to energy bills. On top of that,
perverse incentives lead to direct debit increases for
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000244">That
all hits Northern Ireland in a number of ways. First, we have the
lowest percentage of people in the United Kingdom paying by direct
debit—38% as opposed 
<?notus-xml column=228?>to 55% across the rest of the UK. There are many reasons for that,
including a more conservative approach to such things. Fewer people
have access to bank accounts and the remoteness of many rural areas
means many people cannot pay online. In my constituency, a huge
programme is trying to connect people to broadband because of the low
level of coverage for thousands of households. Those in remote areas,
especially those in the Antrim plateau, do not even have broadband as
an option. As a result, 42% of people in Northern Ireland live in fuel
poverty. That is exacerbated by perverse incentives that affect how
energy bills are
structured.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000245"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Swales" PimsId="5649" UID="14020495000534" xid="1133" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000534">Ian
Swales:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is talking about perverse

Wilson:</Member></B> They do. The hon. Gentleman makes a very important
point, and in most cases those people have the greatest ability to pay
for electricity. In Northern Ireland, for example, those who cannot pay
by direct debit or online will pay £55 more a year for their
energy bill. That is about half the increase they pay as a result of
the green subsidies consumers must pay to the energy
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000247"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="14020495000536" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000536">Bob
Stewart:</Member></B> It seems to me that, from the point of view of an
energy company, if people can be put on to direct debit payments, all
too often those who can afford it will not challenge their
bill—they will just say that it is done and dusted. That is a
big advantage for the energy
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000248"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sammy Wilson" PimsId="4642" UID="14020495000537" xid="915" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000537">Sammy
Wilson:</Member></B> It is a huge incentive. The figure has already
been quoted. People do not query their direct debits and as a result
huge surpluses worth £2 billion across the United Kingdom have
built up, meaning that people are in effect lending the energy
companies money for nothing and those companies reap the interest.
Meanwhile, those who cannot afford to or choose for whatever reason not
to pay by direct debit must pay
extra.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000249">The
companies’ defence is that they have additional costs in dealing
with people who do not pay by direct debit. I approached Power NI about
that and it identified two additional costs. First, if people pay by
cheque, the company pays additional transaction costs. Secondly, if
people pay by cheque, even if they pay on time—I did not
understand this—the company says that that affects its cash
flow. But as long as people pay promptly, whether by direct debit at
the end of the month or by cheque at the end of the month, the
company’s cash flow is not affected. I do not know what
transaction costs the power companies are paying if they have to charge
6% to 8% more when a member of the public pays by cash or cheque. They
are certainly not the kinds of transaction costs one would expect in
those
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000250">What
action can be taken? First—a number of Members have mentioned
this—the power companies must be more transparent. They cannot
simply throw the matter aside and glibly say, “We charge people
who do not pay by direct debit extra because we have increased
costs.” 
<?notus-xml column=229?>Those costs must be quantified. As I have said, I do not accept that the
costs are 6% to 8% higher just because someone chooses to pay at a post
office or by sending the power company a
cheque.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000251">Secondly,
I believe that there is a role for the regulator, whether Ofgem or, in
Northern Ireland, the Utility Regulator. The regulator should be on the
side of the consumer. In fact, that is one of its objectives and part
of its remit. However, when I contacted the Utility Regulator about the
cost disparity, I received a letter that might as well have been
written by the power company. Indeed, the power company probably would
have given a better explanation, rather than the few lines I received
from the Utility Regulator. There was no challenge function, no
querying of the differences in costs, and no seeking of additional
information. It simply stated the differences, which I already knew,
and the reasons for them, but there was no indication of whether that
would be
challenged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000252">I
also believe that there is a role for the Government in this, whether
through the Consumer Rights Bill, which is currently going through the
House; by encouraging the regulator to act by digging more deeply into
the reasons given by the power companies; or indeed, as has been
suggested, by finding find ways of increasing competition, which of
course would give consumers more options.</hs_Para>

striking that some of the smaller companies, which are hungry for
customers, do not face those additional costs. In fact, some of them do
not impose additional charges at all. That is why I cannot believe that
there are such huge cost differences for the larger power companies.
Perhaps that is the good impact of competition. Why do some companies
find that there are huge costs resulting from people paying in a
particular way and other companies do not? Or is it that the smaller
companies are hungry for customers and wish to compete? If that is the
case, I think there is a lesson for the Government: the more
competition we have in the power industry, the more chance we have of
addressing these
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000254">I

elderly people in my constituency are suffering from the cold. The
problem is exacerbated by two issues: fairness, which is the point of
this debate, and transparency. On fairness, as many Members have said,
it is extremely unfair that those who have the ability or 
<?notus-xml column=230?>capability to pay by direct debit should be favoured in one way or
another over those who may not have that ability or capability and pay
by more traditional means by simply getting their bill, writing a
cheque, and putting it in the post. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Beckenham (Bob Stewart) said, someone who pays their bills on time in
that way should be rewarded in the same way as any other person who
pays their bills on
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000257">The
point about transparency is more subtle. When people, particularly the
elderly, look at their paperwork, the writing is almost microscopic
when it comes to the detail of the terms of reference and, more
importantly, the penalties. Moreover, the language used is extremely
complicated, often involving jargon. It would be good if a working
group, perhaps through the regulator or even internally in this House,
could address the simple issue of trying to use simple language to
communicate with consumers. Many consumers get baffled by the language
used about the terms they are being told they must sign up to. If they
understood the language, perhaps they would not suffer so many
penalties.</hs_Para>

household supplied by the company paid an extra £90 per year.
There was a lot of disquiet across the whole of Northern Ireland about
that increase. While it might be an inconvenience to many people, and
to many others it might mean the sacrifice of a luxury to cover the
difference, for some of the elderly in my constituency it will mean
that they have to make the choice between a bit of heat or something to

people died because of their exposure to the winter weather. All of
them were aged over 65, so we clearly need to address that age
category. It is clear that older people are being hit hardest by the
rising cost of energy and their reduced incomes. The energy providers
must ensure that the elderly are on the cheapest tariffs possible. That

British Gas, E.ON, EDF, npower, Scottish Power and SSE have enjoyed a
£3.3 billion surge in profits, while households have been hit by
a 29% rise in bills. My goodness, how obscene it is that on one side
they are raking it in, and on the other side they are losing out. The

many people whose pay has been frozen and for many of those in small
businesses whose hours have been cut to allow the owner to stay open,
such a situation is a gross injustice. A profit must be made—let
me make it quite clear that we are not against profit—but there
comes a stage at which we must ask whether enough is enough. Profits
from the groups that provide energy to 98% of homes rose from
£2.15 billion in 2009 to £2.22 billion in 2010,

did the right thing by the most vulnerable—the
elderly—and used some of their profit margins to provide
affordable heating or, at the very least, not to penalise those people
who use cash and cheques and do not feel comfortable paying by direct

colleagues on tabling the motion. It has support from all parts of the

issue of people who do not pay by direct debit sometimes having to pay
substantially more is one example of how low energy users—mostly
people who are poor and vulnerable, but not always, because people
sometimes choose a lifestyle involving low energy use or are fortunate
enough not to use a lot of energy—by and large end up paying
more than high energy users. That starts from tariffs: we all know
that, with some exceptions, tariffs for people who consume more energy
are cheaper, while those who use less have higher
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000278">The
extra cost for those not paying by direct debit is such an example, and
hon. Members have spoken at length about the issues that that raises.
Like them, I certainly find it hard to believe that in the vast
majority of cases the extra charge levelled on those not paying by
direct debit accurately reflects the extra costs to the companies. I
rather doubt that it does, but there might be a case if the direct
debit discount was a fair reflection of the extra cost that would
otherwise fall on companies from people not paying by direct debit.
However, the amount and variety of charges indicate that they are
certainly more than can in any sense be
justified.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000279">As
hon. Members have mentioned, it is wonderful for suppliers to get
people on to direct debits because, as we all know, the likelihood that
they will move or even think about switching is much less than that of
those who are forced into thinking about how much they pay every
quarter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000280">Colleagues
have commented on prepayment meters. The hon. Member for Redcar (Ian
Swales), who is not in his place, pointed out that we are not talking
about the past situation in which, given the way cash was kept and all
the rest of it, prepayment meters involved a major operation. It is now
in no sense justifiable for prepayment meter customers to have to pay
so much more than other customers, as we all know they
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000281">I
want to mention the higher standing charges that have come about as a
result of the Government’s policies on simplifying tariffs. The
hon. Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark), who is not in his place, said
that the Government have started the process of addressing the issue by
simplifying tariffs, but the fact is that Ofgem’s recommendation
that companies should effectively have higher standing charges is a
result of its attempt to put into practice the Prime Minister’s
hastily thought-out policies. In the vast majority of cases, the
standing charge is higher than it used to be and the price per unit of
energy is lower. I am sure that all Members have had cases of customers
who are on low incomes and are low energy users experiencing massive
increases in their energy bills. Ofgem says that companies can offer
zero standing charges if they want to, but not many have 
<?notus-xml column=234?>done so. There is clearly something very wrong with the way that the
market is operating and in how the market changes have
operated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000282">This
issue does not affect just people on low incomes. I saw one example of
somebody who spent quite a bit of money on introducing renewable energy
and energy efficiency measures. They reduced their energy usage
drastically, only to find that their energy bill went up by almost 600%
because such a heavy standing charge was levied on a daily basis. That
is another example of how those who are low energy users for various
reasons suffer because of the way in which the system
operates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000283">Many
of the issues that Members have raised today are not new. The hon.
Member for Harlow has performed a valuable service to the House by
highlighting the surcharge for non-direct debit payers. However, many
of the issues that have been raised today have been brought to the
attention of the Government and the regulators time and again. I have
raised the issue of standing charges for months. There has been some
movement, but not a great
deal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000284">In
the past few weeks, the Government have seen motions passed in
Back-Bench business debates, but have then ignored them. Given that
today’s motion has support from across the House, I hope that
the Government will give a positive indication of the action that they
will take on the issues that have been raised. Over the past few winter
months, some of the lowest earners and some of the most vulnerable
people in our country have yet again suffered because of the bias
against them in the energy pricing system. We want to see action for
those people and, at the very least, we want to see action before next

since my right hon. Friends the Members for Doncaster North (Edward
Miliband) and for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) made their announcements
on energy at the Labour party conference last year, the way in which
the market works or, more accurately, does not work has rightly come
under greater scrutiny. Today’s debate is another symptom of
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000287">This
debate has highlighted one of the essential facts about the energy
market: we have not one energy market, but two, with companies
targeting the lowest prices at a small section of the market, while
charging everyone else whatever they think they can get away with. That
is evident when one looks at the difference in prices between customers
who pay by direct debit and those who pay by other means. It is also
evident when one compares the prices that are paid by loyal customers,
by which I mean customers who have never switched, which is the
majority of people, with the prices paid by those who have switched.
Tariffs should be cost-reflective: any difference for a different type
of customer, payment or account—for example, dual fuel versus
single fuel—must 
<?notus-xml column=235?>reflect only the costs that are associated with serving those customers
and must be justified by the savings that suppliers
enjoy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000288">Ofgem
is responsible for ensuring that that happens. Following its energy
supply probe in 2008, it introduced new rules that were designed
specifically to prevent such anti-competitive behaviour. There will of
course be marginal differences in costs between different payment
methods and it is reasonable that there should be a small discount for
customers who use cheaper payment methods, such as direct debit.
However, what we are seeing is not a small difference but, in some
cases, discounts of as much as £100—far and away above
what could be reasonably justified. Ofgem has the power to act, but it
does not. The Government should be intervening, but they are
not.</hs_Para>

for those on direct debit are not free. They must be paid for by
someone. They are therefore being subsidised by those not paying by
direct debit. In effect, energy companies are overcharging loyal and,

access to bank accounts, to pay for deep discounts for the active
segment of the
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000290"><B><Member ContinuationText="Robert Halfon" PimsId="5571" UID="14020495000548" xid="1075" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000548">Robert

rules on tariffs being cost-reflective are clear, and Ofgem has the
power to intervene and stop loyal customers being ripped off, so why

right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley has repeatedly raised the
question of Ofgem’s inaction, yet the Secretary of State has
strongly disagreed with her when she has said that Ofgem is not using
its powers. Will the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for
Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker), enlighten the House on whether he
is one of the Ministers cited in <I>The Independent </I>last week who
have told Ofgem that it is in the last chance saloon and must take
immediate action to improve competition? Given that the Secretary of

say gently to the hon. Member for Harlow, who presented his case with
conviction today, that capping the level of discount available to
customers who pay by direct debit is probably not the answer on its
own. In all likelihood, companies would just reduce the discount, and
customers paying by standard credit or prepayment meter would carry on
paying exactly as much as they are now. In fact, he alluded to that
point when he called for fundamental reform, which is what we
propose.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000294">The
practice of overcharging people who do not pay by direct debit, in
order to target the lowest prices at the most active end of the market,
is part of a broader problem in the energy market. In a vibrant and
competitive market, suppliers would compete to give their customers the
best deals and the best customer service would reward loyal customers.
In our broken energy market, the big companies are overcharging and
punishing their most loyal customers. That is why we need

we have set out will reintroduce competition, restore transparency and
create a tough new energy watchdog that will actually stand up for
consumers. We will inject competition by separating energy generation
from supply and requiring all energy companies to trade their energy in

outlined, the Secretary of State may be intensely relaxed about
Ofgem’s performance, but the Opposition are not. We will create
a tough new regulator with new powers and new leadership, to stand up
for consumers. It will have the power to force energy companies to cut
their prices when there is evidence that reductions in wholesale costs

Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Gregory
Barker):</Member></B> This has been an excellent debate and there have
been thoughtful speeches from Members across the House. I pay tribute
to my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) for bringing
this matter before the House and for framing this very real question in
his powerful introduction to the debate. I also pay tribute to my hon.
Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) who will
speak after me. She has joined my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow to
bring into close focus an issue that rightly warrants the scrutiny of
Members across the House.</hs_Para>

clear: the coalition Government are doing more than any Government
before them to help hard-pressed consumers with the cost of energy
bills, and we are fairly, squarely and rightly on the side of British
consumers. My hon. Friend has raised legitimate questions about the way
that consumers pay for energy by different methods, and the Government
want to address that. We 
<?notus-xml column=237?>share the concern that my hon. Friend has put into sharp relief, but it
is not a new issue. I am glad to use this debate to tell the House that
Ofgem will be looking into the issue as part of the new competition
test announced by the Prime Minister, to ensure that energy companies
are living up to their obligations and licence requirements, and that
the interests of the British consumer are at the heart of the modern
energy market.</hs_Para>

McCrea:</Member></B> During the Minister’s remarks, can we get
away from having those on the Front Benches make a political broadcast,
and deal with the cross-party motion before the House? Will the
Minister tell the House—I certainly did not hear this from the
Opposition Front Bench—what is happening to the concerns that we
as elected representatives have on behalf of our constituents, and
which are summarised in the motion?</hs_Para>

Barker:</Member></B> I certainly intend to do that, but I think the
hon. Gentleman is being a little unfair. I have already mentioned the
most important point of the speech, which is that we have asked Ofgem
to consider the matter raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Harlow
and for Chatham and Aylesford, and Members across the House, as part of
the new competition test that was brought forward by the Prime Minister
towards the end of last year. That will have real teeth and will report
within a matter of months, if not weeks. We expect that in the near
future, and Ofgem will be tasked to do it.</hs_Para>

Robin Walker</B> (Worcester) (Con):</Member> I am grateful to my hon.
Friend the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) for securing this debate.
I agree with the Minister that it is welcome that Ofgem will look into
this matter and at competition, but Government policy is clearly to
encourage switching. Will he address the point raised by the hon.
Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg) about energy companies
charging people who want to move from a prepayment meter to a more
ordinary tariff, and the outrageous variation in costs that can
involve? One of my constituents was quoted between zero and £200
to have a prepayment meter removed. Does that not show that the system
is not functioning properly as a competitive market, which is something
Ofgem ought to
investigate?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000305"><B><Member ContinuationText="Gregory Barker" PimsId="3881" UID="14020495000554" xid="27" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000554">Gregory
Barker:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right and it is to his credit
that he raises an issue that invariably afflicts the poorest and most
vulnerable customers. In most cases, however, those on a prepayment
meter can switch to a supplier that will not charge them for coming off
it. Even if they are on a prepayment meter, they can still switch
supplier.</hs_Para>

important that we do not become carried away with the idea that the
only response to getting a better deal for consumers is for Government
to intervene with a one-size-fits-all solution. We saw what the result
of over-regulation was under 13 years of Labour. Ham-fisted
over-regulation does not actually benefit the consumer—it
created the big six. We saw real choice for the consumer collapse under
the previous Government through ham-fisted inappropriate regulation.
The real interests of consumers will be served by a renaissance in
competition. Relighting the fires of competition under this market will
create real competition between energy companies.</hs_Para>

tell the House that since the coalition came to power we have seen
movement back the other way, correcting the downward slide towards an
oligopoly that we saw under the previous Labour Government. We are
seeing new entrants to the market and unprecedented switching. In the
last two months of 2013, an unprecedented number of customers switched
their suppliers, hitting the companies that penalise customers where it
hurts. People voted with their wallets and moved to get a better deal.
This Government stand for empowered consumers—not just a lucky
few, but everyone. We do not want a return to a nationalised industry;
we want fair regulation for a fair energy
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000308"><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Flint" PimsId="3261" UID="14020495000555" xid="203" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000555"><B>Caroline
Flint</B> (Don Valley) (Lab):</Member> There were plenty of examples in
the debate that made it clear that regulations are not being followed
on prepayment meters, and that Ofgem is not even using the powers it
has. Rather than kicking everything off to the competition review, the
Minister should ask Ofgem why on earth it is not enforcing the powers
it has. It should stop letting this
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000309"><B><Member ContinuationText="Gregory Barker" PimsId="3881" UID="14020495000556" xid="27" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000556">Gregory
Barker:</Member></B> The right hon. Lady suggests that the competition
test, which is new, will be a distant solution and that action is
needed in the meantime. The competition test is alive now and we expect
the first results shortly. This is not something we are kicking into
the long grass; this is live. She raises a legitimate point on
prepayment meters, as other Members have from across the House. Do not
misconstrue me: this is a serious point and she is right to raise it.
The Government take it very seriously.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020495000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000310">We also take
seriously the crux of today’s debate: are customers who elect to
pay by cash or cheque, by standard payment through the post or at the
post office, being unfairly penalised for doing so? That is not the
same as saying that everybody should pay the same. I am afraid that
there may be a genuine difference of opinion on that point. It is not
our view that all customers should pay the same. There
should be healthy competition, but—and it is a very important
but—the differential between paying by direct debit and paying
by cash or cheque should be cost-reflective and cost-reflective only.
That is a key element of the licence condition under which energy
suppliers operate. It is vital that Ofgem looks at that forensically
and in detail, and answers to Ministers who have asked whether that is
really
happening.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000311"><B><Member ContinuationText="Albert Owen" PimsId="2226" UID="14020495000557" xid="461" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000557">Albert

Friend the Member for Harlow drilled to the centre of the issue when he
raised the fact that Spark Energy is charging a premium of
£300-plus. That is staggering. Scottish Power, one of the big
six created by the Labour party, is offering a premium—or a
discount, depending on which way we look at it—of £99.
The right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) asked why we were
not doing anything. We are doing something: there is already a specific
ongoing investigation into Scottish Power. This is not just about
Scottish Power, however: for npower, that figure is £95. As
part of the competition test, we have asked Ofgem to look at
all the energy suppliers to ensure genuine cost 
<?notus-xml column=239?>reflection. We want to know why these costs are so much more than those
charged by other utilities providers, such as water and telephone
companies.</hs_Para>

Barker:</Member></B> Absolutely, and of course we look at the criteria.
I have listened carefully today and in our discussions with my hon.

cursory comparison, but to establish forensically whether these charges
are genuinely cost-reflective.</hs_Para>

answer?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000317"><B><Member ContinuationText="Gregory Barker" PimsId="3881" UID="14020495000562" xid="27" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0003.htm#14020495000562">Gregory

new phenomenon, however. The Labour party had 13 years to crack it, but
it took no action. Moreover, the Leader of the Opposition spent two
years as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, so the
question is not “Why has it taken since 2011?”, but
“Why did Labour do nothing, between 1997 and 2010, when it had
the time, the power, the majority and the authority?” What did
Labour do? Zero, zip, nothing. So before they ask, in high dudgeon, why
we are not acting faster, would they please explain why they did
nothing to help consumers for 13 years? When we get a credible answer,
we will give their criticisms more credit.</hs_Para>

to go off on a completely partisan rant, however, because some good
questions have been raised, and I do not want to diminish their
seriousness. We take the issue of prepayment meters and standard

Owen:</Member></B> Did I understand the Minister correctly? On cost
reflection, he said that Ofgem still had the power to intervene over
the licence. I understood that in 2012 it gave up that power and
introduced the retail market review. Is he now saying that Ofgem can
still exercise that power? If so, why does he not tell it to do so?
Then this debate would be null and void.</hs_Para>

not listening. We have spoken to Ofgem, and it has confirmed publicly
what we have discussed privately—that this will form a key part
of the competition assessment. That is a new development, and a sign
that the Government take this seriously and are on the side of
consumers. We will not wait 13 years to do something about
it.</hs_Para>

not always get a fantastic deal. We know that many people do not
realise they are inadvertently building up stores of credit with the
energy companies, as has been highlighted by Members on both sides of
the House, including the hon. Member for Sunderland Central (Julie

give consumers a much better deal. That is just one of the measures we

debate, I thought it would be a great privilege. Now as I stand here,
with my intelligent and beautiful Whip—my hon. Friend the Member
for Guildford (Anne Milton)—sitting on the Front Bench with her
pen poised, I am beginning to wonder whether this will determine
whether I shall be a Minister in the future. The Minister was kind
enough to offer me some advice, which was: “You’ll do a
good job, but please try not to do a great job.” I shall
therefore do my best to satisfy both the Whip and the Minister, but
also to reflect the important aspects raised in this afternoon’s

Backbench Business Committee for allowing this important debate and
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow on securing it. He is
a tireless campaigner who always puts his case so expertly, as he has

important to note that until the shadow Minister’s speech and
the Minister’s speech, there was a great deal of consensus

spoke did so with passion. The hon. Member for Ynys Môn (Albert
Owen) did a great job of standing in at the start. He spoke on energy
prices in general and praised the work of the Select Committee on
Energy and Climate Change. Like him, I was reluctant to switch to
direct debit initially, preferring, like millions of other people
across the country, to have control over when I pay my bills, based on
the energy I use. That was reflected in many contributions this

issues. Her emphasis today on prepayment meters demonstrated
characteristic concern for our poorest in society. I listened carefully
to what she had to say. The hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales) spoke
of one of his constituents and raised similar concerns about prepayment
meters. The Minister heard those concerns loud and clear, as I am sure
did those listening to the debate. I hope that the energy companies

ward, and on 11 December 2011 the staff were made anxious by his
behaviour. They called the police and the police restrained him, and he
died under police restraint. The inquest into that death is due on 1
April—two and a half years later—yet his family still do
not know if they are going to have legal aid for representation at that
inquest and they are thus made more anxious still. Their dad was in

objections to my arguments. There are few in the House who know the
pressures on the legal aid budget as well as I do. As Chief Secretary
to the Treasury, I too had to negotiate reductions to that fund.
However, if we cannot fund an inquest into a death of which the state
appears to be culpable, we have got it wrong. Our article 2 obligations
demand a thorough investigation of state action and culpability in
cases such as these. Like me, the Minister knows that, following the
case of Main in 2007, a wider public interest test must be satisfied if
legal aid is to be awarded. A death in state custody, especially when
Crown servants have been found negligent, must surely satisfy that
test. We in this House agreed to that principle when we passed the
Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Section 51 of that Act extended the
principle of public funding for advocacy at inquests such as
these.</hs_Para>

not choose to be in this position; the Coroners Act 1988 demands an
inquest. We in this House are the people who insist on the position my
constituents are now in, and we do so for a very good reason: we want
to know what happened. Our predecessors in this Parliament felt so
strongly about the unchecked actions of an arbitrary state that they
deposed the monarch and fought a war to insist on the liberty of the
individual and a measure of their protection—we want to know
what happened.</hs_Para>

Byrne:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Some will
say, “We should not get too worked up about this. The inquest
process is inquisitorial not adversarial. It is just a gentle canter
around the facts.” But when we are dealing with death in
custody, it is different. How can we tell? It is because the public
servants represented at the inquests will not just have one lawyer;
they will have teams of lawyers, paid for by the taxpayer, on their
side. We have to ask ourselves: how can we allow such a profound
inequality of arms in the inquest room? How can we pretend to ourselves
that that is evenly remotely equal, fair or right? There is no growing
evidence, not just in my home city of Birmingham, but across the
country, that wrongful legal aid decisions are being made in cases such
as this. Many in this House will have seen the tragic case confronting
Alex Kelly’s family, which was highlighted in <I>The
Observer</I> on Sunday, and INQUEST, an organisation I wish to praise
to high heaven, has brought to me a number of other cases where bad
decisions are being made in our name.</hs_Para>

time remaining to me, I want to put five questions to the Minister. I
appreciate that he will not be able to answer all of them tonight, so I
hope that he will follow up in writing and that the House will be able
to return to this subject, perhaps in the light of the report by my
right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) later in
the year. First, will the Minister meet me to discuss the legal aid
decision in my constituent’s case? The case clearly meets the
threshold of having “wider public interest'” set out in
section 2.4 of the Legal Services Commission’s funding code
criteria, which refers to the “potential” of the

Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which will extend advocacy support to
those who died

best of my knowledge, the Minister was not in the House to vote on the

the Minister confirm that it is ministerial policy, and not simply
administrative discretion, to seek a contribution from the family in
inquests where a death in state custody has occurred? Fourthly, will
the Minister tonight agree to a review of the way families are offered
support and funding for inquest costs, not least because there is now
evidence that the process is out of control, with the most invasive
questions being asked of families in order for them to prove they do
not have the resources to help contest these cases? Finally, will the
Minister tell us how many families have been asked to make a

my constituent what she wanted from tonight’s debate, her answer
was as generous as she is compassionate. “Hopefully,” she
said, “we can change this for other people so that they will not
have to suffer what we have suffered.” When all is said and
done, the question at the heart of this debate is simple. It is the
story of a mother’s loss, a mother’s love and a
mother’s search for justice. Will we, in this House, stand on a
mother’s side, or will we stand against her? When we begin work
in this House each day, we pray for strength and wisdom to make the
right decisions. I hope that we can now call on that strength and
wisdom and make the right decisions in the case of my constituent and
her lost

the means test is applied to inquest cases. Legal aid for the
representation of bereaved families at inquests is means-tested, like
nearly every other element of the civil legal aid scheme. It is
important that we focus our limited resources on those who need them
the most, and the means test is an important and long-standing part of

is discretion to waive the financial eligibility limits for inquests
if, in all the circumstances, it would not be reasonable to expect the

Whether that is reasonable will depend in particular on the history of

institutions, the applicant’s assessed disposable income and

costs of providing representation. Contributions from the applicant can

thoughtful manner. He has given us a number of helpful words about the
broad principles of the means-testing regime, but I hope he will not
elide over the point that when we passed the 2009 Act we decided to
include section 51, which accepted that there were wider public
interests at play in inquests that delved into deaths in state custody

this debate has focused on legal aid, the coronial system and the
police, there is, of course, a broader issue at stake. Let me be clear
that the Government take deaths in custody extremely seriously. Deaths
in custody are among the most scrutinised of all incidents. All deaths
in custody are subject to a number of investigations, including, in the
case of police custody, an independent investigation by the Independent
Police Complaints Commission. Of course, an inquest is also held. Those
investigations will usually involve the participation of the bereaved
family.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020495000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/debtext/140204-0004.htm#14020495000399">I
should like to acknowledge the ongoing work of the ministerial council
on deaths in custody, which incorporates senior decision makers,
experts and practitioners in the field. This allows for an extended,
cross-sector approach to deaths in custody and is designed to ensure
better learning and sharing of information. The council works to ensure
that lessons learned in any area of state custody are disseminated
across the police, prisons, approved premises, immigration, detention,
and secure hospitals. The council commenced operation in 2009 
<?notus-xml column=251?>and is jointly funded by the Ministry of Justice, the Department of
Health and the Home Office. The House will want to know that funding
has been extended until March 2015.</hs_Para>

separate planning system for Gypsies and Travellers has been developed
in this country since part II of the Caravan Sites Act 1968 was
enacted. That part was repealed by the Criminal Justice and Public
Order Act 1994, but the Human Rights Act 1998 and section
225 of the Housing Act 2004 recreated a parallel planning system for
Gypsies and Travellers. I have no doubt that that was done with the
best of intentions, but it is no longer appropriate for the settled or
Traveller communities. Many local councillors share that
view.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000013">We
know from the 2011 census that 76%—more than three
quarters—of Gypsies and Travellers live in houses, bungalows or
flats, while only 24%—less than a quarter—live in
caravans or mobile homes. Thus, the existing separate planning law for
Gypsies and Travellers applies only to less than a quarter of their
population in the United Kingdom. I cannot think of any other group in
the UK, whether vulnerable or not, that we seek to ghettoise in such a
way. We must look at whether such separation in the planning system has
worked for the benefit of Gypsies and Travellers; I think that the
evidence suggests that it has
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000014">At
47%, Gypsies and Travellers have the lowest level of work of any
ethnicity. The comparable figure for the English and Welsh population
is 63%. Of Gypsy and Traveller adults, 60% have no qualifications,
whereas the corresponding figure for the rest of the nation is 23%. A
compassionate case can be made for integrating Gypsies and Travellers
into one assessment of housing need in every local authority. If it is
necessary to provide places to park for travelling caravans and some
fields for grazing horses belonging to Gypsies and Travellers to bring
about one cohesive planning system for the whole population, I believe
that that should be done.</hs_Para>

villages in my constituency, such as Billington, Stanbridge, Tilsworth,

of Travellers and Gypsies being sited in their communities to comply

current requirement to accommodate a growth in the Gypsy and Traveller
household net formation of 3% every year is causing massive problems.
Although I would like to scrap the whole system, it is imperative that
while it continues a more accurate figure is used, which I believe
would be nearer 1.5%. I also believe that the Pat Niner review that
called for a 3% figure was based on the arrival of large numbers of
Travellers from Ireland after the Irish Government changed the law. The
Irish Planning and Development Act 2000 made development without
planning permission a criminal
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000028">After
that, in 2002, Irish law changed again to make trespass a criminal

moment.</hs_Para>

January on the green belt; that is another reason why I believe that
nothing less than primary legislation will do. I do not believe the
current situation is tenable, because central Government are forcing
local authorities to take many extremely unpalatable decisions that are
causing a great deal of anxiety and anger in rural and urban
communities. As I said, that does not aid community cohesion. I believe
strongly that we are all equal under the law. That is an important
principle, but many of my constituents in the settled community do not
believe that equality under the law exists at the moment and feel
highly discriminated
against.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000034">The

“Travelling people” covers groups found across the
country, in Scotland, Ireland and England, and across Europe. All
regard travelling as an important aspect of their ethnic and cultural
identity. This debate is not concerned with certain other groups such
as, for example fairground travellers—show people—or new
age travellers, although obviously some of the issues that we will
mention, such as the education of children, affect all sorts of
travelling
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000041">In
my own area of the country, Scotland, references to the presence of
Travellers can be found as early as the 12th century. There is a number
of theories about the origin of Travellers: some people argue that
Travellers can trace their roots to a Celtic or perhaps pre-Celtic
population; others suggest that they may descend from Roman slaves
brought over to Britain, although on the evidence that can be
identified, that sounds improbable. The most recent estimate is that
there are more than 1,500 Travellers in Scotland at any one time, but
the  true figure is unknown. The Scottish figure excludes
thousands of Travellers living in housing for some or  all of
the year, and many people are afraid to identify themselves
as Travellers because they fear discrimination. Travellers themselves
estimate that there are more than 15,000 Travellers in
Scotland at any one
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000042">We
recognise that Travellers engage in a wide variety of employment,
including the world of entertainment. Famous people connected with
Travellers include Charlie Chaplin, Rita Hayworth, Bob Hoskins and
Shayne Ward—it is even claimed that former US President Bill
Clinton is descended from the Scottish Gypsy kings and
queens—but as we know, it is not just famous Travellers who
attract press coverage. Travellers are no longer a forgotten minority:
both the local and the national media regularly cover stories relating
to Traveller issues. Unfortunately, it usually results in the majority
of people, who may never have met a Traveller, holding firm and often
negative opinions about them. Although we should be concerned that
press coverage is often unbalanced, we should also accept that
Travellers are as diverse as any other group and recognise that, as in
any other ethnic group, a small minority of individuals do engage in
unlawful behaviour. In short, we should not be so gullible as to accept
that they are all just misunderstood and hard-done-by
angels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000043">For
decades, Travellers’ accommodation needs have featured low on
the priority list, and they have largely been the subject of heated
debate. It would seem that in  
<?notus-xml column=6?>council chambers up and down the country, there are few subjects more
hotly contested the provision of Traveller sites. Travellers require a
range of accommodation provision, encompassing sites, housing and
roadside camps, in order to meet their individual needs and
circumstances. For many Travellers, travelling is not so much a
lifestyle choice as a strong part of their cultural heritage.
Traditionally, many Travellers had a wintering place and then travelled
throughout the rest of the year, and some follow a similar pattern
today, living in one place during the winter so that, for example,
their children can go to school, and travelling during the
summer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000044">The
first council-owned site in Scotland was established only in 1978, in
Argyll and Bute. During the 1980s and early 1990s, local authorities
made use of a Scottish Office grant scheme to build sites, but some
sites have since fallen into disrepair and others have closed. Existing
council site provision in Scotland does not meet demand or the needs of
Travellers, but many communities are still averse to supporting local
Traveller sites—all agree that there should be sites, but not
near them. In my constituency, we find that although we need to provide
a campsite, local people object if it is to be situated near them. They
all want an official campsite, but not beside them.</hs_Para>

council set aside monies to establish a site, but communities disputed
both the site position and whether it was the best use of money in
these austere times. That is understandable, but money will still have
to be spent to clean up unofficial sites used by Travelling people,
such as roadside camps. In recent
years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T09:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>, councils
have blocked off many of the traditional roadside stopping places used
by Travellers; as a result, Travellers have been compelled to camp in
places that are closer to the settled population, which has often
become a source of
tension<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T09:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
the inadequate provision of council-owned sites and the difficulties in
getting planning permission for private sites, roadside camping can be
the only option for some families. As I say, roadside camping is often
blamed for causing mess, which can incur rather hefty clean-up
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T09:59:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000046">What
of the UK-wide situation in sectors that affect Travellers, such as
health and education? Many health services continue to exclude
Travellers. Some GP surgeries refuse to register Travellers as
patients, and doctors are reluctant to visit Traveller sites.
Consequently, Travellers sometimes have no alternative but to seek care
through accident and emergency clinics. Moreover, living conditions
have a direct impact on health—more than 50% of Travellers have
spent at least part of their life without access to running water.
Travellers have one of the highest maternal death rates in the UK, and
a study in Scotland estimated that the average life expectancy of
Travellers could be as low as 55 years.</hs_Para>

to meet the educational needs and concerns of Travellers are patchy.
Some Traveller children are unable to attend school because they are
concerned about their safety—in a recent survey, three quarters
of young Travellers interviewed said they have been picked on or
bullied, and some parents have even been advised by teachers to tell
their children not to let the other pupils know that they are indeed
Travellers.

will finish my remarks by highlighting that very point. It cannot
remain the position that people say, “Yes, we recognise the need
for sites, but not here.” Travellers will continue to visit
areas of the country regardless of whether facilities are made
available for them, which will result calls for Travellers to be moved
on from unofficial stopping sites as soon as possible. However, to
remove them from unofficial sites, councils up and down the country
will have to identify official sites and agree their use with the
communities that they serve. Otherwise, they will forever pick up the
cleaning-up costs.</hs_Para>

my short speech, I wish to raise an issue that is causing many of my
constituents deep concern: the siting of Gypsy and Traveller
encampments by local authorities. My local authority, York city
council, is in the early stages of developing its local plan, and in
its first set of draft proposals, which were consulted on last summer,
63 Gypsy and Traveller pitches were suggested. Of those 63 pitches, 41
have been proposed in what I would class as inappropriate countryside
locations in small rural communities in my constituency. A further 21
travelling show people pitches have been proposed, again in rural
locations on the edge of village
settlements<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T10:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000054">All
the Gypsy, Traveller and show people pitches allocated to proposed
sites are on York’s established green belt. The council has
promised that the remaining 22 Gypsy and Traveller pitches are to be
allocated to “suitable” sites as they emerge during the
next 10 years, but the council’s blatant disregard for the green
belt gives one little faith about what they class as
“suitable” 
<?notus-xml column=8?>sites<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T10:04:48"></hs_TimeCode>. Sadly,
when identifying sites the council has actively pursued a “green
belt first” policy, rather than the “brownfield
first” policy that is explicit in the national planning policy
framework. I shall be grateful if the Minister clarifies or reiterates
today what I believe to be the current position: that local authorities
should pursue a “brownfield first” policy when allocating
Gypsy and Traveller sites, and that they should consider publicly owned
land before privately owned
sites.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T10:05:17"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

in York the council appears to have used the willingness of the
landowner as the only criterion for designating sites, much to the
detriment of my constituents and the affected communities. Countless
constituents have contacted me to express their deep concern about the
ability of landowners to use the  local planning process to
coerce—some might even say
“blackmail”—communities into accepting
inappropriate housing developments by threatening to put the land
forward for Gypsy and Traveller
sites<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T10:06:02"></hs_TimeCode>. As people

will also touch on the question of unmet need for Traveller pitches.
There seems to be some confusion among certain local
authorities—I am sorry to say that mine falls into that
category—about whether unmet need constitutes the
“special circumstances” required to place new Traveller
sites on the green belt, even when no other option is available. Will
the Minister clarify that situation for me? I would also be grateful to
learn whether he feels that the “five-year supply” rule
on new pitches should apply to Gypsies and Travellers, who are nomadic
in their living requirements and whose accommodation needs are likely

council is proposing to 
<?notus-xml column=9?>provide for well above the “appropriate level of supply”
required. The council based much of its background research on the 2008
North Yorkshire accommodation assessment. The report identifies that
York has a shortfall of 36 pitches, which the council astutely picked
up on in its own assessment, but that 2008 document also states that
the number of households moving off sites and into bricks and mortar
housing has vastly outstripped the projected need from concealed Gypsy
and Traveller households. It concluded that the trend in York was of
declining need, with the total number of additional pitches required
between 2008 and 2015 having gone into negative figures, standing at
minus-17—an important fact that was strangely absent from the
council’s own assessment. Under huge protest, the council is now
revisiting its assessment
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000061">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T10:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>

That is clearly the nub of how local authorities have assessed needs. I

speak from my experience of my local authority and constituency. There

see few, if any, illegal encampments in the city of York. There are
illegal encampments in neighbouring local authority areas, but none

would be sensible—this also applies to the point that I have
just picked up on—of the Government to do more to encourage
neighbouring local authorities to work together to carry out accurate
assessments of Gypsy and Traveller needs, to ensure they are
appropriately accommodated and that the responsibility for doing so is
apportioned fairly. York, for example, is behind many other
neighbouring local authorities in the local plan-making process. That
has served to highlight the disparity between the needs assessments,
with the council committing itself to far more pitches than any of its
neighbours. I fear that that is because it is including the unmet need
of surrounding local authorities in its own
assessment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T10:12:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000065">I

recently had a meeting with the Minister and other representatives from
Dorset, and I will repeat what we discussed for the record. I thank him
for meeting us. We have a particular problem in that we have one Dorset
constabulary that covers Dorset, Bournemouth and Poole, but Bournemouth
and Poole are unitary authorities. Under the Criminal Justice and
Public Order Act 1994, the police cannot move a Traveller group over a
unitary authority boundary, which puts pressure on both Bournemouth and
Poole to find provision. Because we have very tightly drawn boroughs,
and because we have greenbelt and heath land, it is terribly difficult
to identify sites within the conurbation that are not next to settled
communities. That causes a lot of difficulty and trouble, and it would
be much easier if the issue were managed over in Dorset, Bournemouth
and Poole, with all three combining to do their best to manage the
problem in the

authority has always tried to be as good as possible by knocking on the

pay their council tax—get very frustrated that there seems to be
a special status. Sometimes, neither the police nor the local authority

the moment, Poole is trying to identify a temporary site, and it has
considered some 90 sites. Poole is thinking of putting in for planning
permission on a site at Marshes End in Creekmoor, which is causing a
lot of controversy and trouble. Marshes End may not even be the best
site because it is near a fast road, is next to a fire station and has
few facilities. Leaving that aside, because the planning process will
sort out whether it is the most appropriate site, the real frustration
is that it is expensive. Poole is not a highly funded authority, and
people, again, get frustrated that resources have to be put in to deal
with what they consider to be a difficult
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020778000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020778000002">Generally,

problem is that illegal encampments seem to have no consideration for
the communities in which they park themselves. As hon. Members have
said, there is a perception among our constituents that there is one
law for Travellers and illegal encampments and another law for
law-abiding citizens, who would have to fund the clearing up if they
undertook such activity. My concern is that our police, and certainly
Sussex police, seem to be engendered with a feeling of political
correctness, such that when one challenges the legitimacy of people
calling themselves Travellers, or the legitimacy of what they are
doing, one is put in the frame by the police. That is just not fair,
and it creates great resentment among constituents who have to pay to
clean up the mess.</hs_Para>

in my constituency has got better, and that is largely because of our
new police commissioner, Katy Bourne, who has made illegal encampments
one of her priorities. She has made the police take the problem much
more seriously. Adur and Worthing councils have certainly improved
their responses enormously and there has been a much better team effort
in dealing with the problem. Rather than the police telling us what
they cannot do, the police and crime commissioner has compelled them to
issue rather more section 61 and section 62 notices, which have moved
many of these illegal encampments swiftly on. Those notices work. In
one case last summer, 50 caravans turned up on an open public area
where a church festival was being held. Within an hour they had been
moved on. They went to a football pitch, and within 24 hours they had
been moved on from there, because the police were prepared to use
section 61 and section 62

Bedfordshire and for Poole 
<?notus-xml column=15?>(Mr Syms) that we need to reform the Housing Act 2004.
Everyone should be treated the same in housing assessment, and we
overestimate the real need. A recent census found that more than two
thirds of Travellers have brick and mortar homes in other parts of the
country. We must look at the vulnerability of these communities to very
poor education, qualification, health and employment outcomes, and a
long-term policy that addresses that is needed. Just treating them
differently in the planning system is not the solution.</hs_Para>

achieved. I can never understand why, when an illegal encampment
starts, the police allow further caravans and vehicles to enter the
site. During the day, people will often leave the caravans in their
four-wheel drive cars to do business of various sorts, and I do not
understand why they are allowed back on to an illegal encampment in the
evening. Why are we not using more disruption techniques and saying,
“If you are going to leave the site—as we hope you will
if it is an illegal encampment—you can only go with your
caravan, and you certainly cannot come back in again in the

bunding on one site, which had been put in specifically to stop illegal
encampments, was removed by a bulldozer. Why do we not use CCTV more,
once an illegal encampment has been set up, to see what further
offences might be committed? Why do we not better check the number
plates of these vehicles to see where they are registered, and whether

special provisions for Gypsies and Travellers in the planning system so
that everyone is on exactly the same level playing field when they make
a planning application. Why should there be any special provisions for

hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire did, but it is important to say
where we are. As the Library briefing note outlines, the Labour
Government pressured councils to make adequate provision for Gypsies
and Travellers, partly through the Housing Act 2004 and partly through
regional spatial strategies and local plans. That required local
authorities, when reviewing housing needs in their area, to examine
specifically the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers residing
in or resorting to their district. That was important because of the
need to identify permanent and temporary sites.</hs_Para>

policy guidance circular 1/2006 put an obligation on local authorities

Housing Corporation for funds to develop sites; and
for the Secretary of State to intervene, when necessary, to ensure that
land is identified. The consensus seemed to be that that was making
councils and communities find suitable land and that there were
increasing

thousands of, paid for with taxpayers’ money back then. The
figure was restated in the Department for Communities and Local

interest in school choice is a long-standing one. On my bookshelf at
home are pamphlets and books dating back to the ’80s and
’90s about the links between diversity, choice and standards. I
helped to draft our education policy for the 2005 election, which had
as one of its key tenets parents’ right to choose a school for
their child. However, my interest is not purely political; it is
personal, too—predating my interest in politics. My parents did
not choose the nearest school to our home for me or my sisters. They
chose state Catholic primary and secondary schools for us, which
required a bus or car journey to get there. My nieces and nephew go to
the same schools in Durham today.</hs_Para>

am proud of the Government’s work to expand the diversity of
schools through the academy and free school programme, thereby creating
choice for
parents<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:00:44"></hs_TimeCode>, but two
things have been clear to me throughout. Choice is a reality only when
there is diversity and capacity. It is real only when there are
different types of school for parents to choose between; and there must
be enough capacity in the system to enable parents to get their child
into the school of their choice.</hs_Para>

want to highlight two barriers to choice: one that limits diversity and
one that limits capacity. I am committed, as a matter of my political
beliefs, to school choice, and I find it hard when a policy of the
Government whom I support effectively prevents the next generation of
Catholics from attending a Catholic school, in areas where there is
neither a Catholic school nor adequate capacity. Our current policy
encourages all new schools to be either academies or free schools, and
that route should add to 243 existing Catholic academy schools.
Unfortunately, there is a cap on faith-based admissions that inhibits
the willingness of Catholics to sponsor a new academy or free school,
and therefore limits the diversity of academies and free
schools.</hs_Para>

is a one-dimensional view of inclusivity; 34.5% of children in Catholic
primaries are from an ethnic minority background, compared with 28.5 %
nationally, and 17.3% of children in Catholic secondary schools live in
deprived areas, compared with 12.2% nationally. Of course, Catholic
schools are also popular with non-Catholics.</hs_Para>

does the cap matter? A Catholic free school or academy is likely to
open only in an area with a large Catholic community, where there is
no—or limited—provision; given the popularity of Catholic
schools with Catholics and non-Catholics alike, many will be forced, in
practice, to turn away Catholic pupils to meet the 50% cap. The Church
is concerned because, first, Bishops are required to ensure that where
there is a demand for  
<?notus-xml column=24?>Catholic education it is satisfied; they feel that it would be a breach
of canon law to support a school that turned away Catholic children.
Secondly, there is a broader point about ethos. There is something
different about a Catholic school and its values. There are aspects of
school life that are bound up in the sacramental life of the
school—participation in mass, a set of shared values, and
reference points that relate to the Church and its teaching. It is hard
to see how those shared values and ethos can be maintained if half the
pupils cannot relate to the practice of the Catholic
faith<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:03:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000152">That
is not to say that the schools in question should be exclusively
Catholic. Indeed, three in 10 children in Catholic schools are
non-Catholics. However, a point comes where the dilution of a
school’s Catholicity means it loses its ethos, and it loses
parental support. I will give two examples of that. In Oxford, St
Augustine’s was a joint Catholic and Church of England school,
but parents did not perceive it as Catholic from its admissions
arrangements and therefore saw no discernible difference between it and
other state schools in the area; they viewed them all as non-Catholic.
Parents voted with their feet, and chose not to send their children
to  St. Augustine’s. The archdiocese closed the school
owing to the lack of demand from local Catholics, and then founded a
Catholic school called St Gregory the Great, with Catholic admissions
arrangements, which remains successful and
oversubscribed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000153">In
Bromley, there is a gap in provision owing to the closure of an
existing Catholic school, which Catholic parents did not recognise. St
John Rigby was a small Catholic secondary school serving the local
Catholic community. It became a grant-maintained school and, without
the consent of the archdiocese, doubled in size, despite the fact that
there was no additional demand for Catholic places. That meant that the
percentage of Catholics in the school decreased massively and Catholic
parents stopped sending their children there. Without support from the
Catholic community the school entered special measures and was later
closed by the local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:05:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000154">The
faith-based admissions cap is a disincentive to the Catholic Church to
set up faith schools, because it dilutes their ethos. I am sure the
Minister will say that other faiths are less concerned about that.
However, if a faith group establishes a school that is not
oversubscribed by parents of the relevant faith or, indeed, other
faiths, then the cap does not apply. Some people might be content with
the working of the dilutive effect that I have described, but the
experience of the Catholic Church has not been positive. The Minister
might point out that the voluntary-aided route is still available, and
he could give the example of the new Catholic school in Richmond, but
councils are required to meet unmet demand through academies and free
schools first, and funding is biased towards them. We would have a
richer and more diverse set of free schools and academies if the cap
were removed. It would give more parents the chance to give their
children the education in values that they
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:06:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000155">As
I said at the outset, to make choice real, we need some capacity in the
system to accommodate parental demand; otherwise, we will need to turn
children away. So, schools need to be able to expand. However, limited
capital resources mean that only 142 of the 518 academies that applied
for money from the Education Funding Agency to expand in the period
June 2012 to October 
<?notus-xml column=25?>2013 were accepted. In other words, almost 400 schools turned away
children and their parents because of lack of capacity. I know we
cannot write a blank cheque to fund the expansion of schools, but there
must be something we can do to stop seven out of every 10 applications
being turned down. I believe that the solution is to allow our best
schools to build on their success and borrow to satisfy
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:07:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020454000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020454000156">Schools
used to be able to borrow. Cams Hill school in my constituency is a
popular academy. It increased its intake last September from 210 to 240
and will take another 240 pupils this September, turning down
applications from a further 30 pupils. However, in 2015, because of
space constraints, it will have to revert to an intake of 210 pupils.
Demand from parents will not diminish, but the school’s ability
to meet that demand will. It has paid off its mortgage and in the past
has borrowed money, to fund a new sports hall. It would like to do so
again, so that it can permanently increase its intake to 240, but that
route is now closed. The school cannot borrow.</hs_Para>

things are actually not as clear-cut as that. In a written answer on 25
October 2013, the Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon.
Friend the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson), said at columns
300W to 301W that, in the 12 months to  22 October 2013, 44
schools were given permission  to borrow. Of those instances,
39 were for energy efficiency projects; none were to make it possible
to expand. Schools can borrow, therefore—but not for expansion.
Sixth-form colleges and further education colleges can and do borrow.
The principal of one sixth-form college said to me that it was a vital
freedom and that it enabled him to modernise and expand his provision
to meet local needs.</hs_Para>

then, cannot academies and free schools borrow? According to
parliamentary answers and correspondence I have had it is because the
borrowing of academies and free schools would count towards Government
debt and the deficit. The Secretary of State would therefore have to
approve borrowing to fund expansion and, because he does not want to
add to the debt, he will not do so. So how is it that sixth-form and FE
colleges borrow? The explanation is that the Education Act 2011
scrapped the Secretary of State’s controls over their borrowing,
and consequently the Office for National Statistics decided to take FE
and sixth-form college debt off the Government balance sheet. There is
a simple solution. If the Secretary of State scrapped his control over
borrowing by academies and free schools, their borrowings would not
count towards Government debt.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>Academies and
free schools are already entrusted to make decisions about the terms
and conditions of staff, curriculum delivery, term times and length of

freedom to borrow and to

the record of Cams Hill shows, schools can borrow and pay back without
a problem. The record of sixth-form and FE colleges shows that they can
manage their finances well. They do not fail due to financial
pressures. They are subject to proper financial controls and scrutiny,
as are academies and free schools. If we can trust our academies and
free schools with our children’s future, why can we not trust
them to borrow, so that choice becomes a reality for more

a Conservative, that we should support parents who have a clear vision
of their children’s education. Parents who want to send their

allowed to expand, even if they have to borrow money to do so. Parents
who want to send their child to a faith school should be permitted to
do so, but our policy on faith-based admissions is a block on Catholics

schools, to set up new voluntary aided schools. The academy route does
not have to be looked at first; if there is demand for faith-based
education in a local area, a diocese, for example, may propose a new
school outside the academy route. High demand for faith places
therefore provides a diocese with the opportunity to propose a
non-academy
route<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T11:15:20"></hs_TimeCode>. On

point of the new academies and free schools is that they should have a
broad base in the community, hence the limit of 50% on children from a

demand for a faith school in a local area, however, the diocese can
propose a new school not through the academy route; there is that

The result of that presumption by the Department is that permission to
borrow is given only exceptionally, in part because academies are
classified by the Office for National Statistics as public sector
bodies. That is different from the classification of further education
colleges. Any borrowing undertaken by academies therefore is also
counted in measures used to calculate public sector

require a change in our policy on academies and free schools, not
specifically on borrowing, but more generally on autonomy. As I
discussed earlier and as the PISA study demonstrates, there is always a
balance to be struck between autonomy and accountability in the school
system. The ONS says that the balance between autonomy and
accountability dictates that academies are classified as public sector
bodies, so any change would require amendment to the Department for
Education’s legislation on the structure of academies.</hs_Para>

Blomfield</B> (Sheffield Central) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
open this debate, Mr Caton, particularly with you in the Chair. I am
pleased to have secured it, not simply to highlight the disparity
between arts funding for London and the regions, but to make the case
for arts funding in general. I will argue not for regional versus
national institutions, but that the whole country is strengthened by a
more equitable distribution of funding.</hs_Para>

consider the matter in isolation from wider economic trends. Last week,
we saw reports that between 2010 and 2012, 217,000 new private sector
jobs were created in London, whereas my city of Sheffield lost 7,500.
We are clearly not alone: private sector jobs have been draining away
from the north to London and the south-east. There is a direct
relationship because arts funding is important not just for our social
life throughout the country, but for our economic growth. The arts
provide nearly 1 million jobs in the UK economy every year, and 67,000
cultural businesses contribute £28 billion a year. In addition
to that direct contribution, the impact of a vibrant cultural offer has
a decisive impact on those who are choosing where to invest, where to
start businesses and where to study. It is hugely
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000005">The
report, “Rebalancing Our Cultural Capital”, which was
published just before Christmas, sadly contained figures showing what
many of us already knew, but in much starker terms: that arts funding
from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Arts Council
is massively tilted towards London, which received £68.99 a head
compared with just £4.58 in the rest of England in 2012-13. The
issue is not just about the Arts Council and the DCMS, though. Those
funding imbalances form part of a bigger picture of disproportionate
cuts to local authorities in the most deprived areas, and
disproportionate private investment between London and the
regions.</hs_Para>

am sure that those of us here today do not need reminding of the
contribution made by the arts, but it is worth stressing that the arts
shape places and communities, regenerate and energise, and invest in
and develop future talent, so it is a problem if the benefits of the
arts are not shared equally. “Rebalancing Our Cultural
Capital” highlighted that, but the tension between funding in
London and in the rest of England is not new. It was one reason behind
the appointment of Jennie Lee, the country’s first arts Minister
almost 50 years ago, and it was certainly behind her pioneering White
Paper, “A Policy for the
Arts”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000007">A

will talk about private funding. The way in which different strands of
public and private funding pose challenges for the arts is important,
because it is often argued that we should look more actively for more
private sponsorship of the arts. That is fine, but there too, the
picture is weighted against the regions. Private sponsorship is
exacerbating the problem, not solving it. In Sheffield, there are many
deeply generous people, but we do not have major corporate sponsors.
There is no private giving on any significant scale, not least because
the London cultural organisations are hoovering it all up. In 2011-12,
for example, 90% of all private giving to the arts by individual
philanthropists was to London-based organisations. We need the

action to rebalance our cultural capital. I recognise that the Arts

am conscious that other Members want to contribute to the debate, so
let me turn finally to the significance of the decline in local council
funding. Local authorities have borne a disproportionate burden of the
cuts, and those in deprived areas more so. With less money available
and increasing demands for social care and other vital services, where
will money for the arts come from? Arts Council funding is rightly
based on the principle of additionality, designed to add to the base
provided by local authorities, but local authorities simply do not have

Gentleman was right to highlight some of the statistics and on the face
of it, they do not make very good reading. The south-west has 12% of
the national population and contributes 20% of the gross value added,
but Arts Council and lottery expenditure there is well below that. On
the face of it, it looks like we are not getting a fair crack of the
whip. Regions with remote, rural, sparsely populated communities such
as the one I represent have to compete with great centres such as
Plymouth and Bristol, so in percentage terms we probably get even a
smaller share of the money. However, focusing only on those statistics

are in the process of deciding their spending priorities for the next
three years, following the announcement of their funding in the next

are statutorily responsible. As we all know, that would mean great
peril for the arts

the difficult economic climate the Government face, having had to
extend their austerity programme, but I am sure the

contribution to the nation’s well-being and to our economy that
a flourishing arts and cultural sector makes. They will doubtless be

symbiotic relationship between arts and culture, and social and
economic well-being, is extremely visible in my own constituency of
Exeter. One of the reasons why Exeter has become such a desirable place
to live and work, and for businesses to relocate to, is the rich,
attractive and varied culture we can offer. From our national
award-winning museum to the sharp, edgy and award-winning Bike Shed
Theatre, we have built up in recent years a cultural capital that
attracts and keeps young talent and thrills and entertains residents
and visitors. That is recognised by my forward-looking local authority,
Exeter city council, which, despite suffering big cuts in funding from
central Government, has managed to sustain its support for arts and
culture in Exeter. That is in stark contrast to nearby Somerset, for
example, which ended all support for the arts after the
Government’s first round of
cuts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:57:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000049">That
leads me to the two requests I want to make to the Minister. The first
is that he and his Secretary of State should use their offices over the
next days and weeks to remind local authorities, as they face tough
spending choices, of the value and importance of arts and culture. The
leader of Devon county council, for example, has recently issued a
warning about having to pare council spending down to mere statutory
requirements. We do not want any more councils going the way of
Somerset. We want more to learn from the example of Exeter. A further
round of savage cuts in local government support will tip a lot of
excellent and valued cultural organisations over the
edge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000050">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:58:11"></hs_TimeCode>
second plea, through the Minister to the Arts Council, is that it use
its funding clout to encourage local government to do the right thing.
The Arts Council inevitably comes under huge pressure to step in, in
areas where local government is withdrawing support, to ensure the
survival of at least some cultural footprint. But I am afraid
that—if that is what happens everywhere—all that would do
is give the green light to philistine local authorities that want to
withdraw support, giving them the impression that the Arts Council will
simply step in and replace the funding. A far more sensible approach
would be for the Arts Council to base funding decisions,
where possible, on continuing support from local government.
That would reward good councils such as Exeter and deter bad ones such
as
Somerset<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000051">Finally,

culture already have a vibrant presence in the regions, and some arts
initiatives do not require any commercial support. I pay tribute to the
investment made by TV companies such as ITV and Channel 4, and by the
BBC, which continues to fund productions by independent companies. I
might also mention Glyndebourne, which manages to be rather successful
without a single penny of subsidy, or the extraordinary Melvin Benn,
who brings the greatest of modern culture to places around the
country—including my constituency, where he stages the wonderful
Latitude festival. Of course, I recognise that much of the arts
requires substantial support from the public purse, or from the pockets
of the public via funding redirected from their purchase of lottery
tickets. I value the contribution that the lottery makes to bringing a
wide variety of culture to large parts of the country.</hs_Para>

gentleman called Benjamin Britten, the centenary of whose birth we
celebrated  last year. In my constituency, we have sustained
his extraordinary legacy, which has involved children and world-class
artists. On 22 November, the centenary of Benjamin Britten’s
birth, we held an event called Friday Afternoons. It is estimated that
100,000 children from around the world contributed to that celebration
of probably one of the greatest ever British composers. In that vein, I
will give a quick plug for the director of Aldeburgh Music, Jonathan
Reekie. He has served with great distinction, and I want to thank him.
He was recognised in the Queen’s birthday honours last year and
is moving to take up the leadership of Somerset House in London. That

on tax credits for film and high-quality TV—that has, by the
way, led to a great renaissance in Northern Ireland, with the
production of “Game of Thrones” and the development of
the film and television industry in Belfast—by committing to
launching a consultation this spring on the introduction of a tax

local government. The right hon. Member for Exeter is right that we
should support creative local governments and say, in a pantomime
fashion, “yah-boo” to the baddies—the philistines
of local government. I do not want to be too political about this, but
when certain councils announced that they would cut every penny of
funding to libraries or the arts, there was a risk of shroud-waving.
Councils around the country have recognised that investing in the arts
locally is as important as investing in new roundabouts. In
Basingstoke, where I used to work, the council took a decision in the
’60s to do something about that to attract businesses. The
council recognised that Basingstoke needed a cultural offering to
encourage executives to locate there and to make the town feel good
about itself. I commend councils that have continued to recognise the
importance of arts and culture
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000058">Returning
to central Government, I applaud the work done to try to secure the
status of European city of culture. I congratulate Hull on winning city
of culture this year; we know how much good that designation has done
for Derry/Londonderry during the past 12 months. I also want to say
“well done” to Alan Davey from the Arts Council. I was on
the Culture, Media and Sport Committee at the start of the Parliament,
and there was a deep intake of breath when it became clear that things
would not be done as they had been before. I think that the Arts
Council has done extraordinarily well. By focusing on quality rather
than simply spreading money around, it has improved the quality of the
offering available around the regions.</hs_Para>

largest independent theatres in the country, which puts on some amazing
productions. It is extremely concerned about the ever-widening gap
between London and the regions and the serious financial imbalance that
exists; London is assigned 14 times as much taxpayer money per head
than the rest of England. As a Londoner, I also acknowledge that there
has been a skewing of funding from some of the bigger institutions in

Greenwich theatre might make a case for revisiting the way in which
funding is distributed. Will the Minister tell me—I genuinely do
not know the answer—whether any detailed work has been done
recently 
<?notus-xml column=40?>to look at all the individual funding streams and investigate whether
investment in those areas resulted in economic growth? I was pleased to
hear from my right hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw) that
the Culture, Media and Sport Committee is going to do some detailed
work on that. It is important that we understand better exactly where
money is going in the regions and what the outcomes of such investment
are.</hs_Para>

by the arts and cultural events put on in Plymouth? Apart from
Plymouthians, the evidence shows that the audiences who visit our
theatres come from a vast rural hinterland that extends to Exeter, into
Cornwall and beyond. Those visitors often stay overnight, which also
helps our local economy. Audiences find that going to Plymouth is much
better value for money than buying an expensive train ticket to London
and a very expensive ticket to an event, for which they may almost need
a bank loan. People in Plymouth simply cannot afford to do that.
Cornwall is recognised by the EU as one of the most deprived regions in
the UK, if not in Europe. It is unfair to isolate our region as the
current arts funding set-up does, and I agree with all colleagues in
the room that the matter really needs to be looked at again.</hs_Para>

transmission of live events on big screens and in cinemas has been a
wonderful way of bringing live performances out to the regions and even
into poorer parts of London. It has given people a way to see, for
example, the Royal opera or the ballet. It is not the whole answer,
however; it is something of a halfway house, and people would like to
see the real thing.</hs_Para>

heard, the impact of cultural development on an economy is significant.
We can see that by looking at what has happened in Gateshead or
Glasgow, or with The Lowry in Salford. In Plymouth, we are looking at
setting up a new cultural centre in the former civic centre, and a bid
has been placed with the Arts Council for the necessary funding. That
development would create international contemporary arts studios,
independent film options, theatres of different sizes and outdoor
festival performance space. That is a really exciting potential project
that I hope the Arts Council will look at sympathetically, not least
because 4 million tickets are sold for just those nine large regional
theatres, as compared to 13 million in London. That is not an
insignificant amount, but we could certainly do better. The regional
theatres are faced with London’s getting 90% of philanthropic
donations and 70% of business sponsorship. The match funding imbalance,
which so many Members have already touched on, is
significant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000066">I

Plymouth. I want the Theatre Royal, the Drum theatre, the Barbican

visitors to come, and to see our city as a real cultural treat. It was
the home to Beryl Cook, Joshua Reynolds and Robert Lenkiewicz. We have
a thriving college of art and design that is seeking to become a
university—fingers crossed on that. We have production companies
such as TwoFour productions, and a rehearsal space at TR2 used by west

things that have been mentioned in relation to the cuts are not new. I

was to go on an all-party delegation to the Arts
Council—probably in 1998—to try to save the D’Oyly
Carte theatre, which was about to go under. Luckily, Lord Bishop

hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones), who I think has
just departed, about the Lindisfarne gospels. If an area has a
particular relic or artefact that relates to it, that will be treasured
a little more than all the other riches we can find in museums. There

about theatres in regional centres, or those in

important that, to encourage people to go to such places, we ensure
that our young people are interested at an early age. They must not see
theatre, music, dance or whatever as being elitist. That is why I would
recommend that the Minister speaks to some of his colleagues in the
Department for Education and elsewhere to ensure that such arts are not
forgotten. We have heard that the arts are often the first to suffer
cuts because they are not at the front line. I would say the same about
education. People must learn the value of these things. If we put money

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Caton. I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul
Blomfield) on securing this debate. He has really shone a light on the
disparities in regional arts funding. My constituency, Blackpool, has
attracted under £1 million from the Arts Council over the period
covered by the report, compared with the £23 million granted to
London. Seaside and coastal towns such as Blackpool are often on the
periphery, but there can be a determined focus on funding issues, such
as occurred in the mid-2000s. Along with other MPs from seaside and
coastal towns, I put points very strongly to the Heritage Lottery Fund
regarding seaside parks and public
spaces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000079">How
we define things such as arts and culture will vary enormously, but for
me they are about performance, the visual, the oral, the written and
heritage. The north-west is a rich crucible for each of those; one has
only to think of art at Port Sunlight, Anthony Gormley’s men on
the beach at Crosby, the Liverpool poets, L. S. Lowry, the Hallé
orchestra and Carol Ann Duffy—I have made my
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0001.htm#14020480000080">Blackpool,
in the north-west, is a paradigm for how those things can be done not
just locally but opened out to all sorts of people across the country.
Over the past 15 to 20 years, Blackpool has reinvented itself for the
20th century. We have done so via regeneration; via the development of
the seafront and the public realm; by promoting public art such as the
glitter ball; through works of art featured in St John’s square;
and through the reinvention of the town and the winter gardens. All
that was done through funding from the last Labour Government, the
regional development agencies and Europe, with the co-operation of the
council.</hs_Para>

created new headlands with European money, especially the tower
headland, and we have had major new art exhibits such as the Comedy
Carpet, which celebrates the theatrical and showbiz history of
Blackpool. We have the Grundy art gallery and the Carnegie library,
which have fantastic local history collections, including the Cyril
Critchlow collection of playbills. That was part of a determined
programme of physical and cultural renewal. Those Members who have not
recently been to see how the winter gardens have been restored to
splendour or the major renewals to the tower are welcome to do
so.</hs_Para>

the process, the local authority and local bodies have played a crucial
role in the vigorous pursuit of collaboration with the Victoria and
Albert museum and the exchange of ideas and initiatives with York, and
they have contributed significantly to the injection of cultural
elements into the regeneration programme. For example, FYCreatives,
funded with money from the Government’s local enterprise growth
initiative, has design and art, and gallery space. There are
initiatives in the centre of the town and I pay tribute to council
officers and to the cabinet member for tourism, Graham Cain, and the
leader of the council, Simon Blackburn. He, in particular,
has put the heritage issue on the front
foot<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000083">The
Civic Trust has been a major force for highlighting heritage. We have
had incredible community support for oral history, and there is a
marvellous war memorial in the town, supported by the Royal British
Legion and the Comrades Club. There is a range of different things, but
we depend on good bids being made to unlock the available funds. That
is the reason, in crude terms, why we have failed to draw funds into
Blackpool. Others have pointed out the same thing. The good work done
in the community includes Wordpool, a literary festival that reaches
out as an alternative for children and young people, the Fylde coast
dance initiative, and in the next couple of weeks the Showzam project
in the centre of the town—a display of circus, magic and new
variety—as well as the illuminations themselves. All those
things are magnets to bring people into the town, but we need support
to succeed, and to make a reality of Blackpool’s heritage plans,
including the excellent suggestion for a new museum of popular culture
and the seaside, which has gone to the Heritage Lottery

investment in London must be corrected.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:46:17"></hs_TimeCode>In
“Rebalancing Our Cultural Capital”, the Mayor of London
clearly states that the per capita spending in London for arts lottery
funding in 2012-13 was £17.26, not the £86.40 that has
been cited. We must have the correct facts and figures, so I look to
the inquiry by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee to ensure that we
have the right figures before we move forward.

of theatres to encourage the creative industries in London and the
creative culture that promotes so much of London’s tourism.
Actually, very little spending is needed to enable many of
London’s theatres to prosper, grow and bring in private sector

of money spent on the lottery tends to be spent in poorer areas, but
they do not get their return

was not surprised by the findings of the report, “Rebalancing
our Cultural Capital”. It is right and proper that particular
funding is provided to important institutions of national and
international standing and it is logical that those will be located in
the capital, but that point only goes so far. I was genuinely surprised
by the extent of the funding and the ratio of £69 per head spent
on the arts from all sources in London, compared to the £4.60
for the rest of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:54:51"></hs_TimeCode>, a ratio

mark<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:55:19"></hs_TimeCode>. Its
authors have reflected carefully on the implications of their finding
and have come up with a number of modest, sensible, workmanlike
proposals. I hope that the Minister agrees at least to consider them
and see if they are workable. The report recommends that, of the
different funding streams administered by the Arts Council—the
money from the Department, the Arts Council and the national
lottery—the national lottery segment is hypothecated, at least
in part, to a specific fund dedicated to the non-London part of
England; in other words, to regional
arts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:56:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000106">When
one takes into account the private sector funding, 82% of which is
spent in London, with the remaining 18% spent in the rest of the
country, the thrust of the expenditure pattern is all too clear. The
proposal in the report is modest and is all the more justified when we
look at who is contributing into the lottery. Some 56% of households in
the north-east region play the lottery. In London, the region with the
lowest participation in 
<?notus-xml column=47?>percentage terms, 32% of households play the lottery. So it is possible
to win the lottery without playing it: all you have to do is move to
London. If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:57:15"></hs_TimeCode> the
figures in the report are right, it is fair to find some way of
altering the

plea for the north-east. We were able to get the Sage, one of the most
wonderful concert halls—similar to the symphony hall that the
people of Birmingham have—which is acoustically accurate and
designed for the performance of great music, but it costs money to
bring orchestras of worldwide distinction to venues of this kind and to
the north-east of England. If we could have a little fund that would
make up the difference between the amount of money that one can
reasonably get from the sale of tickets and the cost of providing the
orchestral concerts, that would go an enormous way to bringing the Sage
building back to its original intended purpose and would boost the arts
in the north-east of
England.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_04_PT_1/8C5943202F164E78A18CC4FFC92B9526654300C7" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="4 February 2014">Tuesday

Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown). He has laid
down a powerful challenge, because this debate, and therefore its
conclusions, falters on the uncertainty and ambiguity of the figures in
two respects. He has made the point about the lottery, but when the
claimed discrepancy between London and the rest of the country is
interrogated, it does not take account of the postcode distribution of
those figures. A cultural institution based in London but doing
a lot of performance and so forth outside it will still count against
the London
tally<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000109">I

will not spend a lot of time paying tribute to Bristol’s arts
and cultural scene and creative industries, which are well known.
Bristol has everything from the natural history unit to Aardman. We had
the “Gromit Unleashed” exhibition, if I can call it that,
in the city last year. There were some 80 Gromits dotted around the
city centre, and more than 1 million visitors came. People came from
Japan to take pictures of themselves with the Gromits, which shows that
Bristol does not always do things in the established way. There is a
big counter-cultural scene in Bristol, which for the most part operates
outside the realm of Arts Council funding and is probably happy doing
so. The Banksys of this world, for example, have no need for
anyone’s money except their own these

we have heard, arts in the regions have been disproportionately
affected by cuts to arts and culture. The Bristol Old Vic’s

whammy” of national cuts, local cuts and the greater

funding. We know from research published by the

the limited time that I have left, I will focus on the fact that not
all parts of Bristol benefit evenly from Arts Council funding. We have
talked about the discrepancy between London and the regions, but there
is a discrepancy even within Bristol. None of the 15 national portfolio
arts organisations in Bristol, which share the £4.3 million
grant in aid that goes to the city, are based in my constituency of
Bristol East<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:04:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
the 79 projects in Bristol supported by the Arts Council through its
national lottery-funded grants for the arts, only four are based in
Bristol East. That is partly because the city centre is home to
historical and cultural buildings and activities, but we need to
consider how we can use arts funding to take things out to the
communities, and to bring the communities into the city centre, too.
There is a divide, 
<?notus-xml column=49?>and many people do not feel that they share in the artistic spoils of
Bristol in the way they should. I have been approached by the Arts
Council’s south-west office on precisely that issue. We met a
couple of weeks ago, and I am reassured that the Arts Council is
committed to ensuring that Bristol’s imbalance is
addressed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_04_PT_1/56B6F1B59AE11B82F7F62B04D1E2496159EE387C" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="4 February 2014">Tuesday

Obviously one would expect more money to be spent on national
institutions, which tend to be in capital cities. The National Gallery
is bound to cost the taxpayer more than the Walker art gallery.
Equally, it is true that some of the work undertaken by the national
institutions directly benefits the regions, such as the National
Theatre’s streaming of “Richard II” to cinemas
across the country and the British Museum’s portable antiquities
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
the questions, though, it is disappointing that, three months down the

on the analysis that Arts Council England has provided, the picture

some £2 billion of public money will be spent on cultural
institutions in London, excluding the British Library. The direct spend
of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is £447 million,
of which 90% is in London. In a series of parliamentary answers to me,
the Minister has not justified the rationale for that support. It is an
accident of history that the Liverpool museums and the Geffrye museum
are nationally supported while the Laing art gallery in Newcastle and
the Dulwich picture gallery are not. When people learn that Arts
Council England supports 77 performing arts organisations in London but
only seven in the north-east, it is clear that the imbalance is not

whereas people in the north-east get 3.6% of the spend but pay for 7.6%
of lottery tickets. The authors of “Rebalancing Our Cultural

London, with 15% of the population, gets 19% of the spend. The east of
England, with 11% of the population, gets 10% of the spend. Yorkshire
and Humber’s 10% of the population is perfectly matched with 10%

is a relationship with the institutional structures of the

seems reasonable, but then one takes account of the disparate and
unfair funding settlements meted out by the Government to local
authorities. Liverpool and Hackney, which are among the 10 most
deprived local authorities, are seeing 27% reductions in spending
power, while local authorities in Surrey, which has some of the 10
least deprived, are seeing 1% increases in spending power. In the real
world, cash does not equate to commitment, whereas on the Arts Council
model, despite having seven museums, a major orchestra and being the
home of the Beatles and Daniel Defoe, Liverpool’s funding might
fall and Surrey would become the most cultivated county in
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000129">Furthermore,
the Arts Council proposed to take local authority investment into
account in Manchester and Middlesbrough, but not in Kensington and
Chelsea, which puts no money into the V and A, or in Westminster, home
to the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery, which has
just axed its entire arts budget, despite all the cultural and economic
benefits that flow to local communities from being home to those
magnificent institutions.</hs_Para>

public subsidy goes where the market fails, but that cannot be said for
the arts. London has the largest population of the well-heeled middle
classes, the most tourists and the most philanthropists. I am delighted
that the Minister, in partnership with the Wolfson Foundation, has
spread money across the regions, and I am not cynical enough to think
that the Bowes Museum 
<?notus-xml column=51?>in my constituency has had a particularly large grant because it is the
seat of the shadow Minister—it is obviously because it has the
best collection of European paintings between London and
Edinburgh—but will the £4 million make up for the
discrepancy in the philanthropic spend per head? I doubt it. In London,
the spend per head was nearly £60, but in the midlands it was
only £1.83.</hs_Para>

one simple question for the Minister. He cannot continue to hide behind
the Arts Council’s skirts. He has totally failed to persuade the
Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government of the need to
take account of the value of the arts in local authority settlements.
Can the Minister persuade the Arts Council to take radical steps to
reverse that trend? If he does not, we will see an existential crisis
outside the M25. In Somerset, the Brewhouse closed; in Darlington, the
arts centre closed; and, in Richmond, the Georgian theatre at risk. The
losses will be felt not only now, but for many years ahead as young
people across the country lose the stimulation and opportunities
provided by the
arts.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14020480000212" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000212">4.13

the debate, an e-mail arrived in my inbox from Sheffield Theatres

Noel Coward theatre on 25 February. “The Full Monty”
began in Sheffield a year ago and has since successfully toured what we

think Members in all parts of the House can agree that we have had a
good debate. The hon. Member for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham)
pointed out that the last time we had a debate on the regional arts,
hon. Members could not resist telling the House about the thriving arts
organisations in their constituencies. The paradox in a debate such as
this, when the message is that the arts and the arts outside London
need more money, is that most of the messages we hear are about
thriving arts communities outside

Falmouth (Sarah Newton) talked about north Cornwall museums benefiting
from the support of the National Maritime Museum. Two former
Secretaries of State—the right hon. Members for Exeter

regions are interdependent. The right hon. Gentleman asked the current
Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport to speak to local
government. I am sure he will be

70% of lottery funding goes outside London or to projects that benefit

of the coalition was to increase the proportion of lottery funding

Vaizey:</Member></B> My briefing from the Arts Council says the
opposite: that it is 70% now and was on average 60% under the previous
Government. We can trade statistics, but lottery funding has increased
and additional funds are available: £45 million for the
strategic touring programme, which helps organisations tour outside of
London; £37 million in the creative people and places fund,
which was specifically set up by the Arts Council to support the arts
where they are not well represented in certain regions; and £15
million to support 6,500 apprenticeship places, many of which will be
outside London. There is also the £171 million that I secured
with the Secretary of State for Education for music hubs. For 2015-16
alone, the Arts Council will have something like £570 million to
invest in the arts up and down the country.</hs_Para>

important, however, to understand why in the pure statistics it looks
like London is getting a disproportionate share of the funding. The
national museums are based in London, but the Victoria and Albert
Museum is opening a multimillion pound extension in Dundee and it works
with Sheffield galleries, as I know from my visits. The British Museum
only this week sent me a wonderful publication detailing all the work
it does across the country with other organisations. Plus Tate works
with 26 contemporary art museums in the UK. The Science Museum has
homes in York, Bradford and Manchester. The Royal Armouries is based in
Leeds. The Imperial War Museum has bases in 
<?notus-xml column=53?>Duxford and Salford, as well as in London. There are also organisations
that tour, such as the English National Ballet. I spoke to the
director-designate of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, about his
ambitious plans to support theatre and produce productions outside
London and bring them into the National Theatre. That will no doubt be
helped by the Chancellor’s generous decision to create a tax
break for theatre specifically to support productions outside
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000141">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:27:32"></hs_TimeCode>

the newsagent has been disastrous, with a big drop in trade. Not only
are newspaper sales down, but so too is their other trade. Neighbouring
shops in the village have also lost out as customers of the newsagent
no longer call in. As people drink their free coffee at Waitrose, they
no longer buy from the range of independent coffee shops. Instead, they
wait in long—sometimes very long—queues after doing their
supermarket shopping. A similar point was made to me by a Mr Cant, a
constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford), who
also has a Waitrose store near his shop. Colleagues from elsewhere
around the country will have similar
examples.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000157">The

No. 1 issue raised by independent retailers is business rates. One
retailer from Crosby told me that small businesses need help with
bigger rate relief, as they find their rates crippling. Business rates
date from a time when retailers had to have a premises and when land
and property values were easy to predict. It is a system from another
time, for another time—a time before out-of-town shopping
centres, dominant national chains and the internet. That is why so many
people are calling for a reform of the system to reflect the reality of
retailing and business in

can sell books online and pay no tax on the profits generated in this
country, and large retailers can set up shop on low-rated land. Local
shops need to be where people will go, which generally means high
street 
<?notus-xml column=58?>sites that are often expensive in terms of rent and rates.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:35:58"></hs_TimeCode> first step to
be requested is a full revaluation of the rates. Big retailers have
many advantages, because of economies of scale, however, so a reform of

an advantage to balance their lack of economies of

the autumn statement, the Government announced business rates support
for retailers, and my party is committed to a cut followed by a freeze
in business rates. The reality, however, is that small retailers need
us all to go further; as the NFRN points out, those are all short-term
measures. In some countries, business taxes are collected using a local
sales tax. That is only one possible option, although no doubt the
Treasury has reasons for rejecting such an approach—it usually
does.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020480000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020480000181">How<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:37:00"></hs_TimeCode>
many local shop keepers have good advisers and mentors to help them set

Sefton council offers a free half hour in Crosby and two hours in
Formby. Meanwhile, in Maghull, town centre parking is free for half an
hour in the privately owned car park in the town centre. In the run-up

survive—something I can confirm from personal experience, having
run my own business for many years. Government can help by making sure
that the economy grows and by recognising the importance of the

Independent retailers are a key part of our economy and are significant
local employers as well. 
<?notus-xml column=59?>Research by the Association of Convenience Stores suggests that 76% of
new retail space given planning consent is located outside town
centres. Far more planning consents are given to out-of-town

is about balance. Yes, the big chains are a big part of shopping, and
they need to compete with each other, but small, independent retailers
are at the heart of our local communities, providing valuable services
to local people and an alternative to the standardised approach of the
big chains. The issue is about having a level playing field, and about
fairness between large and small businesses. If the big chains wipe out
the independents, we will all lose as the identity of our communities
will suffer. Competition will be reduced if there is no one to
challenge the big players.</hs_Para>

is, who is on the side of the independent retailers? The big chains can
and do look after themselves. In Formby, Crosby, Maghull and Aintree, I
am supporting the “Shop Local” campaign and encouraging
people to support independent retailers. There is room for both large
and small retailers. We need both—our town centres and high
streets need both, and so do our communities. However, a fair balance
between large and small is not going to happen without intervention by
Government. The Government say that they want to support our high
streets, and, by implication, our local shops. The time has come for
them to make sure that their actions speak louder than their
words.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_04_PT_1/FFCA6888CFB0D8CA8D89D59AC4BC4C08A597DBCB" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="4 February 2014">Tuesday

Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
(Michael Fallon):</Member></B> I congratulate the hon. Member for
Sefton Central (Bill Esterson) on securing a debate on this important
subject. We certainly recognise the value of the whole of our retail
sector to our local and national economies. It employs some 3 million
people and contributes around £80 billion to gross value
added—almost 6% of our economy. Retail is a significant
contributor to self-employment and independent shops are themselves
often crucibles of entrepreneurship and innovation.</hs_Para>

the Centre for Local Economic Strategies discovered that for every
£1 spent locally, around 50p to 70p re-circulates back into the
local economy. Local shops provide hundreds of thousands of flexible
jobs, particularly for young people and those who juggle other
commitments such as child care. They are important hubs of social
interaction and can provide vital services to their communities. Many
operate in the convenience sector, which has seen real
growth—there are now nearly 50,000 convenience stores on the UK
mainland. The convenience sector is worth some £35 billion in
turnover, adding real social and economic value to communities. More
than three quarters of shops in the sector are independent, and almost
three quarters of owners, interestingly, are the first generation of
their family to own and run a business in the UK.</hs_Para>

is now growing for the first time since the recession, and the retail
sector is contributing enormously to that. Significantly, it is small
stores that are driving much of that growth. Figures from the Office
for National Statistics show that small stores are 
<?notus-xml column=60?>now seeing annual growth of some 8%. Figures released by the British
Independent Retailers Association on  31 January show that more
than half of independent retailers have had their best average growth
since 2010. Nearly two thirds of respondents to BIRA are confident or
very confident about the year ahead, and confidence levels are at their
highest since 2009.</hs_Para>

consumers are changing. We are using local shops more—including
independents—to top up our supermarket shopping. Independent
shops make our high streets, town centres and local shops more diverse

economy.</hs_Para>

Gentleman said, the independent retail sector has faced challenges. It
is simultaneously adapting to massive structural challenges driven by
changes in consumer lifestyles and preferences, the impact of new and
emerging technologies and the constant evolution in technology usage.
Modern lifestyles demand a much more flexible and fragmented shopping
style that combines physical with online retail, and leisure and
convenience shopping. Furthermore, the shift to shopping online is
reducing some retailers’ need for large and costly physical
stores, as well as creating the need for new and different design roles
such as web design. Technology is driving change—tablets and
smartphones are making it easier for consumers to buy online and in any
location, and new delivery options such as “click and
collect” are reducing the problems customers face with home
deliveries.</hs_Para>

Research is predicting that as confidence in the economy grows and the
population grows, consumer spending will increase. A bi-annual survey
of 500 small businesses conducted by Aviva shows that they have a more
positive outlook for the first six months of this year, compared with
two years ago. Retailers that have a distinctive brand, focus on their
customers and are well run are still managing to grow. That is true of
independent retailers as well as larger ones, and there are many such
examples from around the country. The hon. Gentleman referred to one
such small business in his constituency to which he has given his
support: Gentle Cosmetics, which has recently opened a store after
successfully trading online.</hs_Para>

increases in local shopping because  of consumer demand.
Research by the Association of Convenience Stores shows that the fruit
and vegetable sector has experienced considerable growth as people move
away from doing one big weekly shop, and are instead increasingly using
local stores and shopping more
often.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020485000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020485000009">I
turn now to some of the issues the hon. Gentleman raised. If I cannot
cover all of them, I hope he will allow me to write to him in more
detail. I will first say what the Government are doing to help
independent retailers. As he referred to, the autumn statement
announced the biggest business rates support package for 20 years,
including capping the retail prices index increase in business rates at
2% next year; doubling the small business rate relief for a further
year, to 31 March 2015, which will benefit over half a million small
businesses; a business rates discount of £1,000 for smaller
retail premises for two years, benefiting around 300,000 shops, pubs
and restaurants; a 50% discount for 18 months for new occupants of
property that was previously vacant; and allowing businesses to pay
their rates bills over  
<?notus-xml column=61?>12 months, which will help every firm with their cash flow.
In the spring we will publish a discussion paper on options for reform
of business rates administration.</hs_Para>

working with the Department for Communities and Local Government on the
town centre support package, which was launched on 6 December. That

that issue?</hs_Para>

business organisations such as the British Retail Consortium and the
Association of Convenience Stores, whose conference I addressed. They
would like a complete overhaul of the system. I have invited them to
put their thinking caps on and to come up with some thoughts on
longer-term radical reform of the system. Meanwhile, we have supported
the Portas pilots with some £2.3 million. We have supported
towns with high vacancy rates through the high street innovation fund

many in the independent sector are concerned about what looks like
unfair competition between large and small, between grocery and other
subsectors, between online and offline. We believe that consumers are
served by open competition between commercial interests, so Government
intervention should never be taken lightly, and any action must be
evidence-based, proportionate and reasonable. If the hon. Gentleman has
evidence of that not being so, it is a matter for the independent
competition
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020485000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/halltext/140204h0002.htm#14020485000015">Retail
has always been highly competitive. Retailers are swift to change what
they sell, where and how they sell it, and how they operate as
businesses if that is what they need to do to drive success. However it
is not for the Government to intervene in these matters. Changes in
technologies and consumer habits are not something the Government or
the House can stop or try to reverse, nor should we. The dividing lines
between different subsectors of retail—the hon. Gentleman gave
some good examples—are blurring as more and more retailers are
innovating to serve customers as best they can.</hs_Para>

retailers are not immune from these commercial pressures. They must
adapt and innovate if they are to survive, and the best of our local
stores are doing exactly that by trading online with a high street
presence, by offering new products and services to customers, and by
simply being the best at what they do in terms of customer
service—whatever it takes. If a retailer takes market share from
another retailer by doing something new or offering something
different, that is the nature of the sector. I assure the hon.
Gentleman that many small retailers are doing that and thriving as a
result. Of course there are things the Government can do to help.
Business rates and the planning system are two of the most obvious
areas where the Government have a genuine role to try to help cultivate
the spirit of enterprise that runs throughout the sector.</hs_Para>

are lots of other obstacles, such as A-boards left out in the path. We
have even seen cases involving safety signs—even though they may
be put up for sensible reasons, they can cause harm themselves, as in
the case of Cambridge resident Dr Peter Lawrence. A road sign was put
out to warn people that works were coming along. He did not see it in
the dark, because it had been knocked over, and he ended up falling
over, causing himself significant injury and harm. There are lots of
obstacles, but most of us simply are not aware of them most of the
time. When parking, most of us would not think about making sure that
we are not blocking off access to a pavement, whether that is about
somebody is getting on or off it. When leaving a bike by the side of
the road, I now always try to ensure that there is space for people to

is the solution? It is not just money. I absolutely appreciate that
times are tough, but money for repairs is needed. It is helpful that
the Government have top-sliced £50 million a year to encourage
maintenance of cycleways and footpaths. That will be worth a huge
amount. In fact, better than that, it can help to avert the costs that
are incurred otherwise. Research by Guide Dogs in 2011 asked a range of
councils how much they spent on compensation claims to pedestrians who
had injured themselves by tripping and falling on badly maintained
streets between 2006 and 2010. From the people who 
<?notus-xml column=66?>responded, it found that well over £100 million was paid out in
compensation. The estimate of the amount paid out in compensation, if
we cover all councils and include ongoing cases, is to the order of
£300 million. Surely it would be better to spend £300
million and more fixing the pavements than to pay it out to people
after they have been injured.</hs_Para>

is not only about money—although if my hon. Friend the Minister
announced extra money, that would be welcome—but about attitudes
and ensuring that things are done correctly and properly the first
time. I was told of one area, near where I happened to be door knocking
last week, close to the local shops on Carlton way, where the pavements
had been fixed seven times. The slabs were picked up seven times, sand
was put underneath, they were relaid, and the sand was washed away
again—and the cycle repeated. Time and again, people were unable
to get past the blockage. The underlying problem, which I think is a
blocked drain, was not being solved. A lot of effort was put into
trying to fix the surface at great expense, instead of fixing the core
problem.</hs_Para>

see that in other areas. Work is happening on Mill road in
Cambridge—it is a wonderful area that I urge you to visit, Mr
Caton—to try to repair the pavements that are very damaged,
affecting an area with a huge range of successful independent shops.
Piero D’Angelico, the chair of the Mill road traders
association, has done a great job in getting that work to happen, but
delivery lorries are still parking on the pavements, still blocking the
road as they do so, and still cracking the pavements that have been
freshly laid. We have to get out of that cycle. Slabs are laid on sand

work—I was involved at the launch, and it will report

Not all those have been repaired yet, but that shows the sort of scale

Evidence certainly suggests that investment in walking and the wider

areas. A United States study undertaken in 2012 suggests that
well-planned improvements in the public realm can help to boost
footfall and trading by up to 40%. In addition, people on foot also

is being provided simply for walking initiatives, to help people get
more active. I understand that Cambridge will benefit from the funding
in the form of a new footway and cycleway route between the train

Under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, public authorities have a
general duty to promote equality, and those who design, manage and
maintain buildings and public spaces have a specific obligation to
ensure that people can play a full part in benefiting from and shaping
an inclusive built environment. We encourage local authorities to
consult representatives of various user groups to help inform the

disability relates to difficulties with mobility, so it is important
not to overlook the needs of those with sensory or cognitive
impairment, the elderly and young parents with pushchairs. I find it
helpful to think of people not simply as being disabled, which is the
language often used, but as being disabled by the environment in which
they must operate. Politicians at all levels must try mitigate those
problems as far as possible.</hs_Para>

Department for Transport promotes guidance for practitioners involved
in the planning, provision and approval of new residential streets and
modifications to existing ones. The guidance highlights the importance
of street design’s being inclusive to accommodate all people
regardless of age or ability. It advises on a number of appropriate
surface level crossings that might be provided, where practicable, to
connect pedestrian networks to one another, particularly where those
networks are separated by heavily trafficked roads.</hs_Para>

also explains that street furniture, which is typically sited on
footways, can be a hazard for users and suggests that it be minimised
wherever possible. In Cambridge, Bristol and other places, I believe
that the local authority might benefit from an audit of its street
furniture—a highway engineers’ term for clutter, which
denotes signage, railings and so on—to see what might be cleared
away, with a particular focus on the supposedly temporary signs that
linger for a long time after the events that they advertise have
happened. People are keen to put things up but not always so keen to
take them down.</hs_Para>

finally to parking on footways, which my hon. Friend mentioned several
times. Cambridge has many narrow streets in which that will always be a
factor. We fully appreciate that parking on a footway or verge can
cause serious problems for pedestrians—particularly those in
wheelchairs, those who have visual impairments and parents or
grandparents pushing prams and pushchairs. Indiscriminate pavement
parking may also damage the verge or footway, and the burden of repair
costs normally falls on the local highway authority. In some streets,
parking on footways may be inevitable to maintain free passage of
traffic while meeting the needs of local residents and businesses, and
traffic signs are prescribed for this purpose. It would not be possible
to get a refuse wagon, let alone an emergency vehicle, down some of
Bristol’s narrow streets if that were not the case. That is
often left to the common sense of local residents.</hs_Para>

authorities outside London have wide-ranging powers under sections 1
and 2 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to make traffic
regulation orders that prohibit pavement parking on designated lengths
of highway or over a wide area. Such pavement parking bans outside
London would need to be appropriately 
<?notus-xml column=71?>signed so that motorists were aware of the restriction. In areas where
the local authority has obtained civil parking enforcement powers,
civil enforcement officers can enforce pavement parking bans on
designated highways by issuing penalty charge notices. In February
2011, the then Transport Minister, our hon. Friend the Member for Lewes
(Norman Baker), wrote to all local authorities outside London prompting
them to use their existing powers to prevent people from parking on the
pavement where that was a problem.</hs_Para>

the Government recognise the importance of ensuring that pavements are
not obstructed by vehicles, street furniture or other privately-owned
paraphernalia. It is not simply down to Government, however; I always
say as a Liberal that Government and the state are not always the

testing devices must be of a type approved by the Secretary of State.

define the requirements for the construction of Preliminary Drug

devices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140204101000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0001.htm#140204101000244">In

mobile devices for consideration for type approval. Work is ongoing
towards type approval of mobile drug testing devices that will test for
cannabis, cocaine and the main metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine.
It is anticipated that laboratory testing of devices will commence in
the next three months. This is to ensure that a

Eustice:</Member></B> European eel stocks have declined significantly
over recent decades. The European Council Regulation 1100/2007, for the
recovery of the European eel, requires relevant member states to
produce eel management plans aimed at reversing the decline in eel
numbers. These eel management plans (EMP) set out actions aimed at
achieving 40% 'escapement' of silver (mature) eel to the sea compared
to 'pristine' conditions (i.e. before declines started and without any
anthropogenic impacts such as habitat loss affecting the eels as they
grow to maturity in river systems before 'escaping' to the sea). The
UK's fisheries administrations have produced 15 EMPs for the European
Commission; we are putting these plans into action. These cover the
UK's 15 river basin districts and can be found at:</hs_Para>

assessment of recent year-on-year trends is not available for the UK as
a whole. A comparison of the results in the 2012 EMP report and the
next reporting period, due in 2015, may be possible when new data are
analysed. However, there are significant uncertainties looking at any
trends in eel populations, mainly due to unknowns from monitoring
information and because the eel is a long lived species any changes
will only be detected long term. The last two years have seen glass eel
catches the size of which haven't been seen since the 1990s, but this
improvement cannot be assessed in terms of eel recovery at this

review into extending entitlement to free prescriptions to all those
with a long-term condition, the Government made clear that in light of
the challenging financial context, no changes would be made to the

valuable income, in the region of £450 million each year, which
helps the national health service to maintain vital services for
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140204101000510" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0001.htm#140204101000510">An
extensive range of exemptions, based on age, income and medical
condition are already in place to support those who may struggle to pay
for their prescriptions. Around 90% of prescriptions are dispensed free
of charge, including to those who have a Prescription Prepayment

prescription charges and need multiple prescriptions. With the annual
PPC, someone can obtain as many items as they need for £2 a

that a reduction in stake and/or prize limits on category B2 gaming
machines would have on gambling related harm, which was published in
October 2013. Formal advice received from the Gambling Commission and
Responsible Gambling Strategy Board on the triennial review of gaming
machine stakes and prizes recommended that a precautionary reduction in
stake and/or prize limits was not supported by the available evidence.
Since then DCMS has asked the bookmakers to provide more information
which will help augment our understanding of the impact of these
machines, including looking at their stake and prize levels. DCMS is
working with the Gambling Commission, Responsible Gambling Strategy
Board, the Responsible Gambling Trust and the industry itself, to
assess a range of options-including but not limited to action on stakes
and prizes-which might be effective in strengthening protection for
users of category B gaming
machines.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="140204101000077" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0001.htm#140204101000077">Olympic

its cost estimates ahead of contractual negotiations, as this
disclosure would prejudice its commercial interests. The UK has full
access to US data on maintenance as well as conducting its own
independent reviews and estimates in support of financial planning. At
this relatively early stage of the programme, the support solution for
the F-35 programme is still maturing and support costs during the
current Low Rate Initial Production phase remain in line with forecast

Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005,
introduced in October 2006, abolished the 1971 Fire Precautions Act
which required certain businesses to apply for a fire certificate.
Under the Fire Safety Order, all those responsible for non-domestic
premises, including residential care and nursing homes, must now assess
the risk from fire in their premises and put in place, and maintain,
adequate and appropriate fire prevention and safety measures to
mitigate the risk to life in the event one
occurs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140204101000714" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0002.htm#140204101000714">Fire
and rescue authorities have powers to enforce the provisions of the
fire safety order in the majority of premises to which it applies in

Government is helping local small shops, restaurants and pubs with
their business rates, by introducing a £1,000 discount off their
bills for the next two years from April 2014. This is part of a package
of measures, including the further extension of small business rate
relief, a new relief to get empty shops back into use, the ability for
firms to pay bills over 12 month instalments to help them with their
cash flow, and capping the yearly indexation at 2% this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140204101000734" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0002.htm#140204101000734">The
discount will apply to eligible businesses with a rateable value of
£50,000 or less, and will be delivered by local billing
authorities using their Localism Act powers to levy new local
discounts. The cost will be met by central Government. Local
authorities will locally determine eligibility, given the practical

eligible local firms receive the support they deserve. I am placing a

various measures that would mitigate the impact for those institutions

this will be based on student numbers from the current academic year,

Timpson:</Member></B> The Government recognises that grandparents can
play a very important role in children's lives. While there is no
automatic right for grandparents to have contact with a child, they may
apply for contact through the courts in cases where agreement cannot be
reached within the family itself. The court will take into account the
circumstances of each individual case and will make a contact order if
it decides that it is in the child's best interests to have contact
with the applicant. However, the Children Act 1989 requires that the
court's paramount consideration in making such decisions must be the
welfare of the child; the Government has no plans to change this
fundamental
principle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140204101001881" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0003.htm#140204101001881">Wherever

disputes without court intervention, and we are improving the advice

collect information about the prevalence of racist bullying so it is
not possible to make a direct causal link between the recent public
debate on immigration and the incidence of racist bullying of school
children. UK and international research studies show wide variation in
the likely prevalence of all types of bullying, ranging from 69% to a
more moderate 21%. While this variation can in part be attributed to
different survey methodologies and research questions, it is more
likely to reflect variation in individual perceptions of what
constitutes
bullying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140204101001973" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0003.htm#140204101001973">The

whatever reason, should never be tolerated in schools. All schools must
have a behaviour policy with measures to prevent and tackle all forms
of bullying, including racist bullying. Schools are held to account by

its nuclear programme, Iran must take action on all of the key elements
of its nuclear programme that represent a proliferation risk. This
includes addressing concerns about the fuel cycle (enrichment levels,
capacity and stockpile), heavy water-related activity, research and
development as well as agreeing to enhanced monitoring and verification
measures (including ratifying the additional protocol). The steps Iran
has taken under the Joint Plan of Action, which came into force on 20
January, are an important first step. But Iran needs to take further

The promotion and protection of human rights continues to be a key

Russia that human rights are universal and should apply equally to all.
We have also expressed our concerns regarding recent legislation
prohibiting the promotion of “non-traditional sexual

society in Russia. We are working with the International Olympic

about RBS's treatment of businesses in financial difficulties and calls
for a thorough and independent investigation. On receipt, the Secretary
of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the right hon. Member for
Twickenham (Vince Cable), referred the report to the financial services
regulators. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has subsequently
announced the appointment of Promontory Financial Group and Mazars to
carry out an independent skilled persons review of the allegations
against RBS using powers in section 166 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000. The first stage of the review will include
consideration of whether any poor practices identified are widespread
and systematic. If this is the case, stage two will identify the root
cause of these issues and make recommendations to address any
shortcomings identified. Separately, the FCA has written open letters
to the other banks seeking confirmation that they are satisfied they do
not engage in any of the poor practices alleged in the

differ in how efficiently they discharge the obligation, and Government

potential of shale gas and, at this early stage, no scenario can be
definitive. The Department for Energy and Climate Change's Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA), which is for consultation, estimates
that community benefits to the value of 1% of revenue from production
could amount to a total of £2.4 million to £4.8 million
per site under the high activity scenario, assuming each well is
productive for 20 years. The industry have based their estimate that
potential community benefit per site would be the region of £5
million to £10 million on the Institute of Directors

scenario.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140204106000437" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140204/text/140204w0004.htm#140204106000437">The
two reports also have different assumptions about the size of a pad.
The IoD report on a broad economic analysis of relevant factors assumes
a pad with up to  40 laterals (horizontal sections)—10
wells with up to four laterals per well. The SEA scenarios, by
contrast, have the specific purpose of exploring potential
environmental effects and assume up to 24 laterals—24 wells with
one lateral per well.</hs_Para>

and particularly among those leaving custody. Our Transforming Youth
Custody programme will improve the education, and successful
resettlement prospects, of those in custody. Youth offending teams
deliver a variety of interventions to reduce reoffending, and we
recently announced a new system of support and escalation for those
YOTs where improvements are
required.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2014-02-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_04_PT_1/Index/9C5B1619E0926F99E378F084B39CB7B547D0C360" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="11" cday="Tuesday" cmonth="February" cyear="2014" date="4" day="Tuesday" issue="117" maxparts="1" month="February" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201314" type="back" volume="575" year="2014"><title col="117">Oral
