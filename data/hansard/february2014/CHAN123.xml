£24.7 million in 2011-12 and £29.1 million in 2012-13,
but that has decreased this year to £17.2 million, which is a
40% cut. The decision to cut the climate change mitigation and
adaptation budget by 40% was a serious error of judgment, one that the
events of the past weeks must lead the Government to reconsider. The
Minister will know that funding for flood protection remains
£63.5 million below 2010 levels, even after the additional
funding announced last week. Will he now agree to review the stringent

all Government reports, must go through a quality assurance process.
Once that is complete, we will publish a report—we have been
clear about that. But it is important also to note that the development
of food banks and the growth in their use is not unique to the UK.
Canada now has more than 800 food banks and 850,000 people helped;
Germany now has 1 million people helped; and France also has
about 1 million people using food banks. So rather than being critical
of this, we should celebrate the good work that civil society

it is important to recognise that food price inflation is now falling.
It was 1.9% in December, and that was below the average level of
inflation, and food is now 4.8% cheaper in the UK than in France, 14%

consideration and that both Houses would then separately consider it so

Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Patrick McLoughlin):</Member></B>
In the past two months, Britain has been hit by truly exceptional
weather. This has been the wettest January in more than 200 years, and
the severe weather is set to continue. From extra pumps and sandbags to
military support and emergency funds, the Government are committed to
providing all the practical support and assistance that is
needed.</hs_Para>

severe storm, with winds recorded at more than 100 miles per hour,
added further to disruption on the transport network, with the railway
network particularly badly affected and some motorways closed owing to
wind speeds. Network Rail and the Highways Agency have been working
through the night to address the damage caused, clearing scores of
trees from blocked lines, removing debris from carriageways and tracks,
and repairing overhead wires. Let me take this opportunity to thank all
those people for their dedication and hard work in the most trying
circumstances, and express my sympathy with all those affected by bad
weather.</hs_Para>

of the repair work overnight, I can provide the following updates for
those parts of the transport network affected by the storm. On the rail
network, the west coast main line is open, apart from the spur from
Runcorn to Liverpool, which is expected to be back in service later
this morning. Most of the east coast line is open. Continued work on
overhead line damage north of York is placing limits on the service,
and trains are expected to run at 80 miles an hour between Newcastle
and the Scottish borders until midday. The Welsh routes of Fishguard
and Aberystwyth are currently closed as engineers work to clear scores
of downed trees.</hs_Para>

with a few isolated exceptions, we have kept motorways and major A
roads running through this unprecedented level of severe weather.
Although the hard work of engineers has mitigated the worst effects of
the storm, there is no doubt that the transport network has taken a
battering over the past week. In Dawlish work continues apace to mend
the route between London and the south-west. During my visit on Friday
I met south-west MPs and council and business leaders to assess the
impact of the severe weather on the region’s transport network
and economy. That followed a briefing with local south-west MPs in the
House last Wednesday. The collapsed wall has been shored up with
material salvaged from the damaged section, and a temporary breakwater
made of shipping containers and filled with rubble has been erected off
the coast. Removal of the damaged platform continues, and work is
estimated to be completed by 18 March.</hs_Para>

we deal with the immediate fall-out from the weather conditions, my
Department has announced measures that I believe will make a real

projects to help repair damaged roads and build greater resilience into
our railway network. Yesterday the Government announced funding worth
£31 million to pay for rail resilience projects, which includes
money to continue the vital work at Cowley bridge in Exeter to improve
resilience against flooding. In addition, a further
£30 million has been found for road maintenance,
including pothole repairs, for local authorities in England affected by
the severe weather. That is on top of the £3.5 million from the

hard-working families are not penalised by the impact of the weather on
their travel plans. On Monday this week the Prime Minister also

the conditions are unprecedented, particularly because of their
severity and sustained nature, it is important that we ensure that our

Departments, local authorities, other transport operators and the wider
sector. Resilience to extreme weather and climate change also form part
of our capital maintenance programme. The Government have asked the
industry to build climate resilience into its plans for railway

making. There are a few things we need to do. First and foremost, we
need to reassure people that the south-west is open for business and
that the road network overall is working well. This morning, I had a
meeting with the country’s main coach operators about their
laying on extra services, which they are doing, and as we approach next
week’s half-term holiday, and the Easter break as well, people
and businesses in the south-west want to get the message out clearly
that they are open for business and that the south-west is not a closed
area; and certainly the road network gives us that option.</hs_Para>

as possible—Network Rail estimates it will take six weeks, once
it starts construction properly, to re-establish the line—but my
hon. Friend is right that we should look at the lines that have been
closed. It is not the fault of this Government, or even the last
Government, that they are closed. Since 1965, successive Governments
have seen development take place over some of these

because of a lack of alternatives or because the available alternatives
were not put into effect quickly. Clearly, one cannot build
alternatives to cover every situation that might arise, but will the
work on resilience—the word the Secretary of State is talking

Under the Labour Government, housing benefit doubled and the deficit

that the fairness of the system is established: the fairness of people
in social housing having a similar system in relation to
under-occupancy as those in the private rented sector; the 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>fairness of recognising that there has been a dramatic increase,
including under the last Government, of the number of people seeking
social housing but unable to find it, while at the same time large

constitute genuine business. Under the Standing Orders we are required
to have estimates days, so we are having estimates days. Under the

Wednesday’s debate is an unallotted day. Is the hon. Lady saying
to me, and through me, to the usual channels, that she does not think
that that merits the attention of the House? If so, hand that time back
to us, and the Government can use it to bring forward measures. As it
is, we are busy with legislation and the House is busy debating the
issues that are chosen not only by the Government but by the Backbench

his school to look up “Aesop’s Fables”. The hon.

is flying and is shot by an arrow and falls to the ground, and seeing
the arrow recognises one of its own feathers in the shaft of the arrow.

We, as a country and as a Government, are among those at the forefront

Speaking personally as somebody whose constituents have included many

that does not mean we should ever close down a debate that says we
understand—it is exactly this point—the nature of

sure that people in York are only too aware of the risk of flooding,
following the serious floods in 2007. He will know that the number of
dwellings being built in areas of high flood risk is at its lowest
since the land use change statistics began in 1989. To mitigate the
risk of flooding, the Environment Agency is consulted on planning
applications for areas that are at risk of flooding. In the last year
for which figures are available, 2012-13, 99% of planning decisions on
housing by councils were in line with the agency’s flood risk
advice. I hope that that gives him some reassurance about the role of
the Environment Agency in the decisions of his

where an awful lot of economic activity and growth can be generated. I

I will resist that temptation because we are a Government who believe
in ensuring accountability and scrutiny in the Chamber. We have
deliberately in this Parliament seen through reforms to the Backbench
Business Committee, which has afforded time, and from now on in this
Session time in this Chamber for that Committee will be in excess of
its 27 allotted days. As I said earlier, the same is also
true for the Opposition, which is fine and as it should be. We cannot
have a sort of closed period for scrutiny and opportunities for debates
generated other than from within the Government. Finally, I will take
issue again with my hon. Friend. We have just seen the introduction of
the 20th Government programme Bill in this Session, which, for a
Session of this normal annual length, is 
<?notus-xml column=1043?>broadly speaking what one would expect and what we have seen in previous
Sessions. There is no merit in having a large number of Bills as
such—perhaps the contrary—but the idea that there is a

with no apparent strong leadership to guarantee direction and

Davis:</Member></B> I do not want to widen the debate and have a rerun
of the Mitchell case, but I should say a couple of things about it. The
House knows full well that I did not approve of the Leveson
process—I strongly believe in a free press—but even I am
astonished that, after Leveson, a police force has yet again leaked
with an incredible spin a confidential document to which the victim in
the 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>case, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield,
has not had access. First, I expect the Metropolitan Police
Commissioner to have a proper leak inquiry into that—I have told
him that this morning. Secondly, an astonishing interpretation was put
on the leak. The leak shows that an officer, four hours after
attempting to stop my right hon. Friend going through the main gates of
Downing street—this did not happen in a panic or a rush and was
premeditated—wrote to his seniors not to say, “We have a
security issue. Will somebody please have a conversation with Mr
Mitchell to ensure he understands that we cannot let him
through?”, which would be the proper thing to do and what hon.
Members would have done, but to set up a circumstance in which the
situation would be resolved by a public confrontation at the front gate
after the officer had ensured that his seniors supported him in doing
so. If anything, that reinforces the story we were told by an anonymous
whistleblower that this was a premeditated action. Today’s press
coverage is not a good reflection on the police in two ways: it
undermines their main case and it is something that they simply should
not have done under these
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000413">If

Normington, a distinguished ex-permanent secretary at the Home Office,
is a classic Whitehall mandarin. If anything, he is more tempted than
most to be careful and sober in his language, and to pull his punches

utterly damning of the federation’s performance. It made 36

is a matter of great concern that the Police Federation is as
profligate as it appears to be. There are numerous examples of that. It
spent £26 million building its Leatherhead headquarters.
Frankly, that is extravagant enough to do justice to one of the London
merchant banks at the height of the City excesses. The headquarters
have a hotel, a bar, an indoor swimming pool and 11 grace
and favour apartments. Even more outrageous is that, to pay for the
extravagant cost, members’ subscription fees had to be raised by
23%. The federation’s 
<?notus-xml column=1047?>officers, with their salaries still paid by their respective forces,
receive salary enhancements of up to £25,000 from the
federation. They are given those enhancements for doing what is, after
all, an easier job than being on the cold streets of Britain on the
night shift: sitting in their luxury headquarters, instead of
performing public duties. I have been told that full-time federation
officers have free use of the grace and favour flats and live on
company credit cards. The purchase of large quantities of food and
alcohol on those cards is apparently not uncommon.</hs_Para>

at risk and so are loth to enter the public domain, which makes it hard
to check what they have said. As a result, I called on the federation
to publish its expense accounts and live up to generally expected
standards of transparency. I did this so that I could confirm or deny

accounts. Yet another reason concerns my right hon. Friend the
Member for Ashford (Damian Green), who as Minister for Policing,
Criminal Justice and Victims represents the Home Office on the Front
Bench today. We put taxpayers’ money into the

federation appears to have a problem with transparency. It is telling
that it failed to answer even Sir David Normington’s
requests concerning the so-called No. 2 accounts used by the various
branches. This money comes from selling insurance and then keeping a
rake-off or commission, but so far the federation has not been willing
or able to provide the information that Normington asked for. I
understand that this probably accounts for £35 million of assets
just sitting around the country. Again, this is money that belongs to

accounts. It is the only reference to the apartments, but it does not
contain what I would recognise as details telling us that these are
grace and favour apartments used for the benefit of federation
officers, with or without the approval of its members. It is clear that
the federation does not know what transparency means, but it can only
restore trust in itself if it imposes transparency on all
its operations as a matter of
urgency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000428" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000428">The
federation’s use of funds raises another matter. It has
formidable financial muscle. I guess its total assets come to about
£70 million, the majority coming from subscription fees, but
some from the No. 2 accounts. The last set of audited accounts showed

litigation should not be carried out against those bringing complaints

the federation has a long track record of defending the indefensible

come to the most serious point of the debate: the bringing of
defamation cases against people who disagree with the police’s
version of events. There is no downside for a police officer when they
pursue a libel action backed by the enormous resources of the Fed. That
raises two distinct and concerning issues. First, action against the
press, who must hold the police to account, is utterly against the
interests of a fair and free society except in very clear-cut
circumstances. Secondly, there is the action taken against members of
the public, whom the police are charged with protecting, who disagree
with the police’s version of events. That insulates the police
from criticism and from being held to account for what they do. Such
actions should not take place. If the federation is using its financial
might to crush legitimate claims against officers

a police stitch-up, to take an extreme example, that huge injustice
would compound existing
injustices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000438">My

week, Fiona McElroy, a former principal private secretary brought in to
help the federation achieve the reforms, was fired; her deputy also
left the federation in outrage at her treatment. I ask the Minister to
give the federation two ultimatums. First, it should immediately sign
up to recommendation 1 and accept the revised core purpose to act in
the public interest, with public accountability alongside
accountability to their own members. Secondly, it should accept all the
other Normington recommendations before its triennial elections this
year, when it will lock in place a whole set of officers for another
three years. If it does not do that, the Government will, I think, be
properly authorised to intervene. In my view, if they do intervene,
they should implement Normington-plus—put in place all the
Normington proposals and in addition act to deal with the profligacy
and misuse of public and members’ money.</hs_Para>

to the subject of the debate, the reform of the Police Federation. The
Normington report is pretty scathing in its criticism of the
federation. It says that it should be changed “from top to
bottom”, and talks about the present crisis being the result of
strategic failures. Sir David Normington also found that 91% of
federation members wanted the organisation to change, so this is not a
case of Parliament dictating to the federation and telling it what it
should do. I am sure we would all want to step away from doing that.
The members themselves are saying that they want change.</hs_Para>

ensure that the report’s recommendations are implemented by the
current leadership of the federation. I pay tribute to Steve Williams,
Steve White and Ian Rennie, the chair, vice-chair and general secretary
of the organisation. It was Steve Williams who set up the
Normington inquiry; we would not have had an inquiry, had the chairman
not decided to do that. I also welcome the fact that they told the
Select Committee that they intended to implement every one of Sir
David’s recommendations. Our inquiry will commence shortly, and
I hope that we will be able to look at the length of time it will take
to implement them.</hs_Para>

another member of the Committee, the hon. Member for Rochester and
Strood (Mark Reckless) is in his place. There were two things that
caused the Committee some concern. One was the lack of knowledge about
the No. 2 accounts that are being held across all the regions, which
the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden mentioned. No one
knows the figures involved. I would have thought that the chairman of
an organisation as important as the Police Federation would know how
much money it was holding locally. He told the Committee that he had
written to every regional chairperson to ask for that information, and
I hope that they will provide it. If the leadership of the federation
is to succeed in implementing the Normington report, as we want it to,
it must have that information.</hs_Para>

issue that struck me and other members of the Committee was the fact
that even Steve Williams did not know how many members the federation
had, because the database was not up to date. That is also a matter of
concern. Surely an organisation that speaks on behalf of thousands of
police officers ought to have the names, addresses and e-mail addresses
of every single member. That information is kept on a regional basis by
the regional chairs and committees, but it is not passed on to the
national headquarters, even though the national leadership has to speak
on behalf of the federation. I hope that those two important issues
will be resolved.</hs_Para>

leadership issue is an important one. The hon. Member for Skipton and
Ripon (Julian Smith) mentioned the need for effective leadership
earlier. I want to pay tribute to Paul McKeever, who sadly died at the
end of last year. He was a splendid leader of the Police Federation.
However, we can have the best leaders in the world, but if the
structures are not right, we will not be able to implement change. The
Normington report is about changing the structure of the federation,
and I think we all agree that it has to change. The federation must
also be open and transparent—not necessarily to Parliament,
although I would love that to happen. It must be open and transparent
to its members. In the end, we are all parts of organisations whose
leaderships need to respond to the members, but the members also need
to respond when leadership is shown.</hs_Para>

by outlining some of the issues that I hope the Select Committee will
look into. These are not agreed terms of reference—those will be
agreed at the next meeting—but they are the elements that I
think we need to look at. We need to look at the federation’s
spending and its use of public money; the contents and usage of the
reserves and the federation’s No. 2 accounts; the use of
members’ subscriptions by representatives; and the leadership of
the federation at national and regional level, including the elections;
the current membership and ensuring that the Police Federation’s
communications with all members are robust; and ensuring there is
co-operation between regional and national boards. We do need to hear
from some of the people who work for the federation and have made
statements in the public domain—we would like to hear from them
at Home Affairs Committee hearings.</hs_Para>

Normington report is damning—no organisation would like to read
such a report about the way in which it conducts its business—I
have confidence that the leadership is going to implement what
Normington has said, because it has told the Committee that that is
what it wants to do. The role of the Home Affairs Committee is to
monitor that and make sure that those good words are translated into
good deeds, for the benefit of the federation’s members and the

pleasure to follow the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith

wisdom. I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice
and Howden (Mr Davis) on initiating this debate. As he has pointed out,
the Police Federation was set up nearly 96 years ago, as part of a
concordat between the police and Her Majesty’s Government. A
simple deal was struck: in return for not striking and not joining a
trade union, the police would have a federation that would have
unprecedented access to Ministers and would receive taxpayers’
money. Over many years, the federation built up a superb reputation for
being measured, fair-minded and discreet. It built that strong brand,
which was the envy of many other representative organisations and trade
associations in this country and around the world.</hs_Para>

the then Member for Bury St Edmunds, Eldon Griffiths, and he was
followed by Sir Michael Shersby, the Member for Uxbridge at the time.
They were well paid, as indeed was the Labour representative of the
Police Federation, they were always called early in debates and they
had a status within the House that gave them the chance to speak up for
the police. That was accepted as being within the traditions of the
House and it was very much part of the concordat struck all those years
ago.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden has pointed out,
there has been an incredibly unfortunate downhill spiral, which
probably started 20 or 30 years ago, and professional
standards have slipped. Part of the blame must lie with the previous
Government, who in many ways undermined the police. They lost the
confidence of the police on many different issues, not least through
their determination to drive through force mergers and the fact that
they encouraged the building up of this compensation culture.</hs_Para>

stand up for the interests of members of the constabulary within my
constituency, and I do not believe they have ever leaked anything to
the press or done anything that would undermine the integrity of the
local police federation. Unfortunately, that excellent set of high
standards and conduct has not been replicated within the Police

point strongly. That point comes across crystal clear in the report. I
was going on to say that many of us have watched in this country as
cases involving minorities have often been overlooked. The truth is
that there are many cases, some of which emanate from my own
constituency, where there have been concerns about the Police
Federation and a closed shop, particularly in relation to getting at
the truth. However, what is so startling is that what may have been a
minority concern has broken into the mainstream. When three
officers so blatantly tell mistruths and so blatantly refuse to
apologise over an event involving a Cabinet Minister in a country such
as this, it must tell us something about a culture of impunity that has
become endemic in the system. It must also say something about the
necessary reform that must now come. I am pleased, therefore, that the
Police Federation has accepted the report’s recommendations. The
tipping point must surely have been reached if it has come to pass in
this way.</hs_Para>

this debate in 2014, it is clear that a number of our institutions need

closed practices in the NHS and the need for a stronger whistleblowing

involve taxpayers’ money, which must demand close scrutiny. I am
pleased that the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee suggested that
scrutiny should be No. 1 on the agenda. It is also the case that the
federation has seen fit to go after leading members of our society who
are looking at police reform issues. Why is it that it thinks that it
can get away with challenging a senior Cabinet Minister? Is it because
parliamentarians, MPs and Ministers at this point in the cycle just
happen to be a minority group that is up for attack and the federation
thinks it can get away with it? There is a connection with the way it
might deal with certain types of criminals. 
<?notus-xml column=1057?>There is a connection with the way it might deal

that they have experienced some sharp practices from parts of the

with this.” We must challenge that, because the honour of a

have been concerned, especially in the Duggan case, that officers have
been advised by the Police Federation not to give interviews. Attempts
to suspend officers facing serious allegations are always fought,
whatever the circumstances. If any of us were caught up in a situation
that involved the death of another individual, we would not be able to
refuse to give an interview. Why would we accord that power to people
who are in uniform? This is a very important issue.</hs_Para>

fundamentals of our system is the fantastic idea that we have policing
by consent. That is at the heart of our police service. Here in London,
there are only 32,000 police officers, and a population heading towards
10 million. In reality, it is the 10 million people who work alongside
the police who give us that feeling that we are safe almost anywhere in
London. The idea is that we police by consent, not by fear as is the
case in America or in parts of continental Europe where police officers
carry guns. It is an idea that we must treasure and protect. It is
grossly undermined when a minority of police officers misbehave, they
are not challenged sufficiently, there is not sufficient scrutiny, and
there is the sense of a closed shop where even those who are blatantly
lying are protected. That is why this report is so important, why the
House must look closely at implementing it and why we must revisit
these issues not just in Backbench debates over the coming months and
years but in debates in Government time where we are absolutely
rigorous about protecting this important fundamental of our
democracy.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_13_PT_1/B074B7E77FF60F67D73D9C043D834043A0D645D5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2014">Thursday

Member for Croydon South: 91% of officers want change in their
federation. That is an utterly devastating figure. I commend Steve
Williams, the chairman of the 
<?notus-xml column=1060?>Police Federation, who, as far as I can

us be in no doubt: the report is utterly devastating. Its
authors—Sir David Normington, Sir Brendan Barber, Sir Denis
O’Connor and others—are people of enormous public
standing who are worthy of our greatest respect. The devastating detail
of the report is reflected in stories that are coming out about the
federation’s actions, such as the discomfiting behaviour of its
representatives on memorial day and the astonishing financial excess
whereby £35 million or more in No. 2 accounts is not properly
accounted for. I am delighted that the Home Affairs Committee will
follow up the report, especially through an inquisition on the use of
public money. My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and
Howden (Mr Davis) suggested that police officers should receive a
dividend from their federation by having their funds returned. The
amount involved would be pretty substantial—£500 per
police officer—but in these straitened times, the taxpayer
probably has an interest, so I hope that the Select Committee’s
detailed inquiry will examine whether it would be proper for the
taxpayer to receive some
restitution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000506" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000506">The
federation has completely and utterly failed not only the people it
serves in the police, but in its public duty outlined in its founding
Act—the Police Act 1919. The federation has a responsibility to
the whole country. If the representatives of the police are seen as
rotten, what conclusion are we meant to draw about the police force
itself? When we go out on the front line, we have the opportunity to
see the police at first hand, so we know that most of the time they are
doing a difficult job extremely well. It can be difficult to deal with
members of the public who demand the highest standards of their police
force, but that is precisely the standard that we should
expect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000507" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000507">There
have been huge strides forward in policing over the past two or three
decades. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 brought about a
profound change in policing, as did the reaction to the Macpherson
report and the way in which senior officers have tried to lead on the
culture of the police. However, in policing, as is the case in the
federation, pockets of resistance remain, as do old-fashioned
approaches that are simply unacceptable in this day and age. The
federation must be a proper representative of all its officers, but it
comprehensively failed in that

me reinforce the message about the scale of legal actions taken by the
federation. It is truly frightening that people can be intimidated so
they do not properly criticise and complain about our police force as a
result of legal actions initiated by the federation. The situation is
so rotten that I understand that, informally within the federation,
police officers are encouraged to bring actions that are known as
garage or extension actions because the officers end up with a new
garage or extension as a benefit of being persuaded to take legal
action. Stories also circulate about the incentives that law firms
offer policemen to take action. I hope that the Home Affairs
Committee’s inquiry will cover such practice on legal action
which, frankly, stinks and has an especially unhappy consequence if it
makes the police seem to be as defensive and backward looking as the
federation has been in its attitude to the public and dealing with
straightforward requirements of substantial police reform. I hope that 
<?notus-xml column=1061?>there will be at least restraint on decisions about
whether legal action should be taken. Perhaps the Police
Federation’s insurers should make decisions about whether
actions should take place, rather than federation officials themselves
aggressively pursuing actions by using their members’ and, no

money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000509">There

there will no doubt be more. However, we should be absolutely clear
that if the federation will not deliver on the reforms required

clear that something is very wrong in the national Police Federation,
and has been for some time. The continual drip-drip effect is reaching
its zenith—or, should I say, its nadir—and is causing
considerable embarrassment and distress to the rank and file officers

police service is genuinely the best in the world. It deals with
extremely severe threats and incidents. It deals daily with historic
episodes and threats to the state and security of this nation, and it
does so without being armed and by consent. I am very proud of the
profession, and we all can be very proud of it, which is why the Police
Federation’s dysfunction is a humiliation to rank and file
officers throughout the country. Many officers have told me that if
they did not feel that they needed the protection of an organisation
such as the federation in case they should get into trouble, they would
not choose to be members of it and to pay the exorbitant dues that have
caused it to become
bloated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000512" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000512">The

embarrassment to the Police Federation. I have asked for an inquiry in
the Home Affairs Committee, to which the right hon. Gentleman has

repeated episodes that we still

Police Federation told the Committee that he did not know the exact
figure, but he agreed with my suggestion that there were tens of
millions of pounds in the No. 2 accounts. We do not have the answers.
These are enormous sums, some of which have been funded by a huge 20%
uplift in constables’ dues to the Police Federation. It is a
shocking indictment. Meanwhile, £26 million has been spent on a
luxurious headquarters that looks like something out of science
fiction. Apparently, senior federation officials travelled to Italy to
source the right slate for part of the edifice of that structure.
Expense accounts have not been published and salaries are not fully

it is the bully-boy tactics that most concern me, as they will concern

being driven by the House or by one political party; this is a

State, all matters affecting their welfare and efficiency, other than
questions of discipline and promotion affecting individuals’. At

reforms to the police have contained so many detailed changes that it

in not having unionisation—there are also the armed forces, of
course—as the police do not have the right to strike and do not
have a union as such. Some of the recent changes for the police have
been different from what has happened elsewhere in the public services.
To give just one example, the police had their pay increments frozen
for two years. That might sound like a small thing, but I do not
believe that it is, because across much of the rest of the public
sector, despite the vaunted public sector pay freeze and now the 1%
maximum increase, public servants have been receiving rises almost
automatically year on year as they serve in a post. Those increments
push them up pay scales in a way that the police have been specifically
excluded from. That is one source of discontent among the
police.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000532">Another
thing that stands out about the police is that, uniquely in the public
services, they cannot be sacked, except for gross misconduct. There is
no mechanism by which one can insist that a police officer is made
redundant. I thought that we were going to change that. Tom Winsor
rightly drew attention to it. The idea that after two years of
probation someone has a job for life, or at least for 30 years, has
been done away with in every other sector, if indeed it was ever
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000533" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000533">I
will enjoy hearing the Home Secretary when she strays beyond her brief

<?notus-xml column=1065?>It is difficult to reconcile those principles with
leaving that “jobs for life” specific legislative
exemption for the police while every other employee is potentially
subject to that type of dismissal. Once a police officer has a job and
has been in probation for two years, irrespective of the level of the
crime or the amount of money in the public sector, they have that job
and nothing can be done about it. That sets the police apart, and I was
looking forward to seeing that changed. I will be disappointed if the

area that we need to look at, in relation to the straitened financial
circumstances, is facility time, meaning the number of police officers
working on Police Federation business and the amount of their working

officer numbers overall, as the shadow Minister, the right hon. Member
for Delyn (Mr Hanson), vigorously emphasises, although they
have not been as great as they might have been, as a result of the
efficiencies and changes that we have made, for which the Minister
deserves much support. However, when we have had those changes, have we
seen similar, and indeed appropriate, reductions in the amount of time
spent on Police Federation duties?</hs_Para>

is good to have wider consultation, I think that some of the structures
of the Police Federation lead to a use of time that is perhaps not the
most productive. We need to look carefully at the extent to which
police offices could be spending more time on front-line duties and
less on that part of federation business that might not be delivering
directly the representative benefits that its members need. I hope we
will consider that in addition to whether some of the police officers

would like briefly to discuss the No. 2 accounts. I have not seen
evidence that anything has been going on within the accounts that
should not have been, and still less that there has been any
misappropriation of funds—I would like to make it clear that I
am not suggesting that there is. However, the very fact that they are
known as No. 2 accounts raises, for many people, the idea that money
might not be properly accounted for. We hear of people running a second
book of accounts in a business: one that is real and one that is for
the tax authorities. When people hear of the Police Federation No. 2
accounts, they wonder whether something like that is going on. I have
no evidence that it is, but I am concerned that people will draw
conclusions that may not be justified until such a time as that money
is properly accounted for, the chairman of the Police Federation knows
what is going on with those accounts and they are put properly into the
public domain. As a body, the Police Federation should not operate only
for its members, but act in the public interest.</hs_Para>

about the public interest, I think that legal action is an incredibly
important area for us to examine. The Chair of the Select Committee,
the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz), spoke earlier
about our terms of reference. I strongly questioned the officers who
appeared before the Committee on what they were doing with regard to
the legal actions. I think that is an area for us to include in our
terms of reference and in our report. I do not think that should mean
delving into the details of current legal actions, but we should look
back and get some baseline about what actions 
<?notus-xml column=1066?>the money has been spent on, how often the police defend a
member and how often they proactively go out with a sword, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Northampton North said, rather than simply
defending their officers, making members of the public subject to a
legal attack from the Police Federation and funded by it. That is an
area of huge concern. We need first to understand how much of that is

how much the law firms involved are earning and on what basis they are
given fees and are being commissioned. It is simply not good enough for
the federation to say that it looks at the merits of each case and then
decides on the basis of the prospects for success. Simply because a
case might have a better than even chance of succeeding is not a
sufficient reason for engaging in legal action. The federation also
needs to take into account its reputation as an organisation, that of
the police, the interests of its members, of course, and the public
interest. I think that area of legal spending by the federation should
be very closely examined.</hs_Para>

all of us. MPs, bankers and estate agents compete for the occupation
that is generally held in least regard and most contempt, and I would
not wish for the police to join us in that league. The key locally for
all of us is to enhance the reputation of our office through hard work
and integrity. Although I, like others here, still have bruising
e-mails and letters from a few officers in the constabulary who perhaps
saw an opportunity to use plebgate as a negotiating tool during talks
on police reforms, I do not believe that anything like plebgate could
ever have happened in Gloucestershire. Our constabulary would never

our constabulary are rightly focused on the major problems of human and

confidence in our police and all the experts who are seen less often
because they work behind the scenes. I am grateful for what all members
of the Gloucestershire constabulary do in resolving these vital issues
in our city. Crime is down in Gloucester, and that is what matters.
That is also why I will be delighted—through the wider police
service parliamentary scheme, which offers us all an opportunity better

subscriptions, which I suspect many police officers across the country
would welcome. Above all, they call for an ambitious programme of
reform, noting that the Police Federation itself commissioned this

something worth striving for. It is what federation members most want,
and it is now for their representatives to work together to deliver it.
At this stage, it is not for the Government to interfere but rather to

countries, where the democratic rights of the people are overtaken by
the forces of law and order, which intervene to have the type of
government that they want, rather than the type of government that the

basic civil liberties. The feeling was that they would be used to
develop a police state, act as an arm of the Government, enforce laws
unfairly and harass people, and that they would, therefore, lead us to

Sutton Coldfield—one of the most senior Ministers in the
Government at the time and one of the Prime Minister’s closest

Tobias Ellwood</B> (Bournemouth East) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure
to follow my hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob
Rees-Mogg). I pay tribute to many of my colleagues for their comments.
The words 
<?notus-xml column=1070?>“change” and “reform”
have been used a lot in this debate and I want to focus not
on specific events, but on how the force needs to evolve. The Police
Federation is made up of different levels, including constables,
sergeants and inspectors, who make up the majority of the police force.
If change is to come about, they must embrace
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000570" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000570">In
a fast-changing world, I think we would all call ourselves reformers,
but there are, perhaps, two kinds: those who want reform and those who
want reform but not now. I wonder which category the Police Federation
falls into. If we observe any major traffic incident, we will see that
the efficiency and ease with which all three of our blue-light services
work together—the gold-silver-bronze command structure—is
extremely impressive. However, if the incident is more complex and
involves other agencies or wider geographical areas—such as the
tragedies at King’s Cross, the events at Buncefield, the 2007
floods and the 7/7 terrorist attacks—an altogether more
complicated wiring diagram is relied upon, which attempts to link
together organisations, agencies and Government Departments by using
complex processes and protocols that have been built over decades, but
that urgently need to be updated. They are so embedded that successive
Governments have been reluctant to address
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000571" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000571">The
Police Federation must appreciate that there are cultural and technical
shortcomings that affect the ability of different constabularies to
work together and with other agencies. Even today, different voice
procedures are used in the 43 constabularies in different parts of the
country. When Cobra sits, decision making is swift, as we have seen
over the past few days, but when it breaks there are 43 separate police
forces, 46 separate fire services and hundreds of local authorities
running separate independent local resilience forums without any formal
co-ordination from
above.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000572" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000572">We
can all be very proud of the London 2012 Olympics. It was the largest
and most complex event the nation has ever hosted and it was incident
free, thanks to the years of preparation for a time-limited event and
the additional resources and structures that have now largely been
dismantled. The federation needs to appreciate that. I hope it will
start to appreciate that there are strategic, operational and financial
efficiencies to be gained from not only simpler and stronger
ministerial leadership, but the streamlining of policy formulation and
unambiguous inter-agency operational command at both national and local
levels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000573" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000573">The
federation recognises and is in fact involved in the Joint Emergency
Services Interoperability Programme, designed to improve joint
doctrine. The federation must appreciate that if a forum such as JESIP
needed to be created, there is something wrong with the way in which
our emergency services work together. Given the types of natural and
man-made threats we now face, it is time to overhaul our resilience
capability, from the local resilience forums—the basic emergency
decision-making units found in every county—all the way to Cobra

hon. Friend the Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless) makes
an important point. The changes I have discussed can come about only if
the federation itself embraces them. As we have heard again and again
today, it has been an obstruction against, and a hurdle for, those
changes. My hon. Friend is right to ask the question, but it needs to
be put to the federation itself so that it can address what it needs to
do to recognise the changes
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000578" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000578">In
conclusion, the Police Federation has an important role to
play—from bottom up, not just top down. If changes are to take
place and if we are to see greater collaboration between
constabularies, that needs to be embraced and promoted by the
federation itself. Even with the advances in communications and
technology, traditional practices across the police force, as well as
those between all three emergency services, have resulted in a silo
mentality and a convoluted web of interoperability that successive
Governments have been deterred from overhauling. The longer we wait,
the more complicated it becomes to improve inter-service procurement,
training, operations and ministerial oversight. I believe that the
Police Federation will rise to the challenge of reform, and I hope that
it will consider some of the ideas and solutions proposed in this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14021362000756" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000756">2

colleagues on securing this timely debate. I pass on the apologies of
my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey), who

declare a sort of interest, in that as a former police Minister and as
the then shadow Minister, I met Sir David Normington and
members of his review team to give them my private view of the issues
we are debating today. I am glad that the analysis that has come

Northampton North (Michael Ellis), my right hon. Friend the Member for

very dangerous circumstances. There is no officer who does not wake up
every day of the week potentially to face a life-threatening situation
or to have to seek a depth of courage that none of us in this Chamber
has to experience. Even this week, police officers have been deployed
to deal with floods and serious crimes. If the right hon. Member for
Haltemprice and Howden was in his place, I would tell him that every
year I have had the privilege of attending memorial services for
officers who have given their lives for their community. The
police memorial services that I have attended have been dignified,

Police Federation itself commissioned the Normington report. I also
welcome the fact that the Police Federation recognises that mistakes
have been made and that it might be out of touch with its members, as
has been discussed, and that it has acknowledged the need for
reform. As has been expressed from both sides of the House, the Police
Federation independent review is a candid, frank, hard-hitting and
strong report. The hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob
Rees-Mogg) referred to that in his speech. The report looks in detail
at how the federation operates and how its membership is represented,
as well as at its structures, finance and professionalism, and it makes
36 wide-ranging recommendations for
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000584" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0002.htm#14021362000584">We
should remember a point that has been slightly lost in the debate,

of Paul McKeever in January. I think that he recognises the concerns
expressed from both sides of the House about the need for reform and
review. I know from talking to him that since the report was published
that the Police Federation has held meetings across the whole of
England and Wales this week in a two-day examination of the

Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims (Damian
Green):</Member></B> I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Member for
Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis) on securing this debate and Members
on both sides of the House on their heartfelt and thoughtful speeches,
and on the clarity of the debate. Anyone who has listened to this
debate or who reads it subsequently will see that it has sent a very
clear message to the Police Federation about the Normington
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000600">I
simply want to echo that message. I fully agree with the principles
behind the motion. I agree that public trust in the police is vital. I
agree that the federation, which represents 130,000 rank and file
police officers, has a vital part to play. I agree that the federation
must change significantly if it is to play its role effectively. I pay
credit to the federation and its current leadership under Steve
Williams for recognising that change is needed and for
commissioning the independent Normington review to guide that reform.
The report does that very clearly. I also agree with Members on both
sides of the House that the vast majority of police officers do what is
a difficult and sometimes dangerous job very well on a day-to-day
basis. The tradition of policing by consent is a vital part of
democracy and quality of life in this country. That is the background
to the problem that the Normington review
addresses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000601">The
review was undertaken because of significant concerns about the
transparency and integrity of the Police Federation and those who act
on its behalf. It is important that the federation addresses those
issues to ensure that it acts in the interest of its membership and
commands the confidence of the public. To that end, I welcome the news
that the Home Affairs Committee will produce a report on these
matters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000602" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000602">As
others have said, Sir David Normington and the other members of the
panel have produced a report that is thoughtful, comprehensive and well
evidenced. It is 
<?notus-xml column=1075?>insightful on the issues that the federation faces and considered in the
solutions that it recommends. We all agree with Sir David that the
federation must operate with openness and integrity. The review
suggests a great number of far-reaching reforms. We will soon see how
the federation
responds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000603">My
hon. Friend the Member for Bury St Edmunds (Mr Ruffley) intervened on
the former police Minister, who is revisiting former glories today, to
ask about the federation’s response. Steve Williams said before
the Normington review was published that he would accept it. Obviously,
discussions are now going on inside the federation. I assure the House
that those discussions are being monitored closely by the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000604">The
Government agree with the sentiment that has been expressed by Members
on both sides of the House that it is for the federation to reform
itself and not for the Government to step in at this stage. We need to
see what the results of the federation’s considerations are. We
do not plan to change the legislation before the review has been
considered and processed by the federation. However, it is important
that the federation moves forward with reform. I do not rule out the
possibility of new legislation or regulations because the federation
was created by an Act of Parliament and many of the changes may need to
be made in Parliament. We will come to that at the appropriate
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000605" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000605">One
of the virtues of the Normington report is that it has produced a
timetable for action by the federation. Outsiders with an interest,
such as this House, will be able to see how the timetable is being met.
The time to consider any legislative action that we need to take is
after the federation has considered its next steps.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021362000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000606">A number of
important points have been made by hon. Members. The issue of
federation expenses has been raised. I take any suggestion that
expenses have been misused extremely seriously. Federation
representatives are elected by their members to represent them. They
must therefore act in their members’ interests in using
federation funds. It rightly falls to the federation to handle and
respond to those issues. It is important for the federation to
demonstrate that it uses its finances, which are raised primarily
through member subscriptions, in a transparent and responsible manner.
If it does not show that it does so, it is difficult to see how it can
command the confidence of its members or the
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000607" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000607">References
have been made to the accusations of bad behaviour on national
police memorial day by representatives of the federation. Like the
former police Minister and the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, I
have attended national police memorial day. It is a very moving
occasion that is important to the friends and families of police
officers who have given their lives in the course of their duties. I
know that the leadership of the Police Federation would want to ensure
that that occasion is treated with the dignity that it deserves. If
there have been problems, I hope that action will be taken to ensure
that they are not
repeated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000608" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000608">There
have been a number of references to the notorious No. 2 accounts that
are held by some branches of the Police Federation. Those financial
issues have been covered thoroughly in the Normington report. It makes
a number of recommendations to improve the transparency and handling of
federation finances. It recommends 
<?notus-xml column=1076?>that all accounts, including No. 2 accounts, should
be published and available publicly. As that information comes to
light, we will gain a better understanding of how the money is being
gathered and spent. It will fall to the appropriate authorities to deal
with any unlawful or improper behaviour that is identified. That might
be the police themselves or it might be Her Majesty’s Revenue
and Customs. Clearly, we need to know more about what is happening in
those No. 2 accounts. I look forward to seeing how the federation
responds to the report’s recommendations. If help is needed from
the Government to implement the changes, it will certainly be
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000609" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000609">As
well as those specific reforms, the review recommends a great deal of
far-reaching reform. I am sure that all Members expect there to be
change. Behind all that, the federation must ensure that it performs
its most important role, which is to represent rank and file officers.
It is clear from the important surveys that many hon. Members have
mentioned that those officers still want the federation to represent
them. As such, our starting point must be to ask how we can make the
federation reform itself in order that it can deliver that service more
effectively. We are at the stage of giving the federation the
opportunity to consider how it will change on the basis of the
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000610" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000610">The
final matter that has come up frequently is the events at Downing
street involving my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield
(Mr Mitchell). It is clear that those issues have caused widespread
concern about police integrity, and demonstrate that unless all
officers operate to the highest standards of integrity, policing risks
forfeiting public trust. The court has now decided on the appropriate
sentence for the criminal conduct of PC Keith Wallis, and the IPCC has
stated that its investigation has provided evidence to support gross
misconduct proceedings against five officers, including PC Wallis. It
will be for the Metropolitan police service disciplinary panel to
decide on the culpability of the officers involved.</hs_Para>

will also be aware that the Home Office is currently
considering changes to the whole police disciplinary system, and the
IPCC is independently investigating allegations that three Police
Federation officers from West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire
police gave false accounts of their meeting with my right hon. Friend
the Member for Sutton Coldfield on 12 October 2012, in an attempt to
discredit him. As that investigation is ongoing it would obviously be
inappropriate for me to comment further at this
stage.</hs_Para>

conclusion, I am grateful to everyone who has contributed to what I
think will be a significant and important debate that will mark
progress and greater clarity in the necessary reform of the Police
Federation in the wake of the Normington review. I hope and expect that
the federation will address those concerns, so that it can become once
again an institution that its members will be proud of, and of which
the public will be proud, just as they are proud of our
police.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_13_PT_1/34BD763C837F60DD858839B503010D83EBA049C0" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2014">Thursday

I wish to emphasise at the start of my remarks that we should not allow
this matter to become a cosy understanding with the Police Federation

sand. That is why I was delighted to hear my right hon.

would like the federation to publish a clear timetable that we can come
back to and debate in this Chamber, to see how quickly it is
implementing the reforms. The reason we need that is that Fiona
McElroy, a former principal private secretary to the Attorney-General,
no less, was sacked because she had “serious concerns”
about the management of the federation’s accounts. Most
troubling is that—this was only a few days ago—she was
opposed by a “vocal minority” who were resisting attempts
to implement the changes recommended by the Normington report. I am
afraid I am not as sanguine as many colleagues who have contributed
today about the ability of senior members of the Police Federation to
reform themselves. Who are these individuals and to whom are they
accountable? Given the evidence I have cited, they seem to be a
roadblock to reform.</hs_Para>

Before those elections we need a clear statement from anyone seeking to

feel that they are not acting in good faith. There is unanimity across
the party divide, including from the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr

generated at national level

Baron:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. The fact
remains that, although there have been good increases in survival rates
and there has been progress when it comes to cancer care generally, we
still lag behind European and international average survival rates.
That alone means they are costing this country thousands of lives.
Thousands of families are suffering as a result of our not being able
to match international averages on cancer care. That is not to say that
cancer care has not improved over recent decades—it has.
Survival rates have improved, but they have done so in line with
survival rates across the world. That is good, but it somewhat masks
the fact that we remain well behind international averages.</hs_Para>

the additional funding, we still have not managed to catch up with
other health care systems and thousands of lives are being lost as a
result. My hon. Friend alluded to the fact that if we matched European
averages on survival rates we could save an additional 5,000 lives a
year. The OECD recently ranked Britain towards the very bottom of the
35 countries whose survival rates it measured, and it suggests that up
to 10,000 lives could be saved if we matched international survival
averages. Indeed, the Secretary of State for 
<?notus-xml column=1082?>Health himself, speaking at the Britain Against Cancer conference in
December, described survival rates as disappointing.</hs_Para>

predictions suggest cancer incidence is on the rise. The World Health
Organisation suggests its incidence will increase by 70% in the coming

structural change it has seen in recent years is not allowed to
obstruct the much-needed improvement in cancer services and survival
rates that are necessary if we are to catch up with our neighbours and
save those thousands of extra
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000653">The
report by the all-party group on cancer should be seen in this context.
We now have an NHS based around five domains, each with a
responsibility for delivering improved outcomes. The report makes
recommendations across each of those domains, and is the product of an
extensive consultation with the cancer community, from NHS England
right through to cancer patients, carers and charities. The
recommendations of this year-long project can therefore truly be said
to reflect the views of the whole cancer community. I should take a
brief moment to thank all those who are involved in the production of
the report, from those who responded to the consultation to the
charities that devoted significant time and expertise to crafting it,
including Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK, Prostate Cancer
UK, Teenage Cancer Trust and Breakthrough Breast Cancer.</hs_Para>

across the Domains” makes 18 recommendations and believes that
the Government have an important role to play. Although the
recommendations are specifically aimed at NHS England—the body
that now has responsibility for commissioning services—it is the
Health Secretary who retains overall responsibility for health
services. The support of his Department is invaluable in achieving
these goals, so my first question for the Minister is: will she
formally respond to the recommendations set out in the report, or
commit her Department to do
so?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000655" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000655">Other
hon. Members will address other parts of the report, but I want to
focus on the importance of earlier diagnosis and accountability. There
are very few magic keys— where someone can open a door and
suddenly untold opportunities lie before them. In cancer, such a magic
key does exist: earlier diagnosis, the importance of which cannot be
overestimated. When the all-party group on cancer produced its 2009
report, “Tackling Cancer Inequalities”, we found that
patients in this country who reached the one year point stood as much
chance of making it to five years as most other health care systems.
Where we fall down is in getting patients to the one year point. We
came to the conclusion, which expert witnesses confirmed at the time,
that this clearly showed that the NHS was as good, if not better, at
treating cancer when it was detected, but very poor at detecting it in
the first place, and that is why we fell so far behind on survival
rates.</hs_Para>

with the cancer community and asked: what is the remedy? Do we bombard
the NHS with more targets and regulation to try to encourage earlier
diagnosis? Should we adopt a much simpler approach—and this is
what we concluded—and put up in lights one and five-year cancer
survival rates, broken down at a local NHS level, then primary care
trusts, now clinical 
<?notus-xml column=1083?>commissioning groups, to encourage earlier diagnosis? We all know that
late diagnosis makes for poor survival rates. Therefore, putting the
survival rates up in lights and broken down by the local NHS should
encourage underperforming CCG management to promote initiatives, at
primary care level, aimed at promoting earlier diagnosis. It would be
up to them to choose which initiatives suit their local populations:
better prevention and awareness campaigns, better uptake of screening
programmes, better diagnostics at a primary care level or better
education or information for GPs. There could be a host of initiatives
in isolation or in combination, but the bottom line is that it would be
up to local CCGs to introduce them. Those at the bottom of the table
would be particularly encouraged to do so. That was the logic behind
the idea of one and five-year figures. We are happy to say that, with
the rest of the cancer community, we now have one and five-year figures
as outcome measures in the DNA of the NHS. This is to be welcomed. It
is in the NHS outcomes framework and it is in the CCG outcomes
indicator set governing CCGs at a local level. I will come back to the
five-year outcome measure at the outcomes indicator set level a little
later, but that is all encouraging.</hs_Para>

complicate issues by going on about the importance of introducing other
proxy measures at a local level, such as staging and emergency
admissions. We have recommended those initiatives, and they have been
taken up as complementing the one and five-year figures at a local
level because of the smaller population sizes of CCGs compared with
PCTs. The campaign has been a success, but it is a success only in that
we have managed to get these measures included. Actions speak louder
than words and the true success will be judged on what effect these
measures are having on survival rates. On that measure, the jury is
still out.</hs_Para>

me on to my next point: accountability. There is no point in having
these wonderful initiatives on one and five-year figures, staging and
emergency admissions to try to promote earlier diagnosis if it is not
followed through and there are no teeth in the system or levers of
change to ensure that underperforming CCGs raise their game on behalf
of their local patients. Key questions therefore remain on
accountability.</hs_Para>

accountable is NHS England to Parliament? NHS England’s annual
report is laid before Parliament, but it is the Secretary of State who
must assess performance. The extent of ministerial accountability
remains unclear. Parliament seems to have a very limited role in this
process. So does the Minister agree that there appears to be limited
scope for Members to scrutinise NHS England’s performance?
Furthermore, how will the Department of Health monitor NHS
England’s performance on cancer care against the NHS outcomes
framework and address areas that need
improvement?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000660" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000660">If
that is one concern, a greater concern I have is the accountability of
CCGs themselves. While some cancer services, as hon. Members will be
aware, remain the responsibility of NHS England, owing to their
specialised nature, many vital services are CCG-commissioned, hence the
importance of the CCG outcomes indicator set as a means of monitoring
performance. What remains unclear is the extent to which NHS England
will hold underperforming CCGs accountable. For example, what 
<?notus-xml column=1084?>happens if a CCG is continually at the bottom of the one-year survival
rate figures? Where are the levers of change to correct that? The
mathematicians in the House will understand that if we raise
the game of those at the bottom of the table, it will have a
disproportionate effect on averages in general, and that is what we are
talking about: catching up with European and international averages on
survival rates.</hs_Para>

clarity, therefore, about what action will be taken should CCGs
continue to languish in poor performance. What support would NHS
England give to a CCG to improve survival rates, and, should CCGs
continue to languish, what powers will be used, what levers of change
will be implemented, to ensure that improvements are made at a local
level? There is no point having the CCG OIS if failure is not addressed
and there are no teeth to the correction regime. We need clarity, both
to ensure that corrective action is taken, if needed, and because CCGs
need to know that the regime is in place.</hs_Para>

questions remain, which our report addresses, about the differences
between the last two CCG OIS iterations, and perhaps a little clarity
from the Minister would be helpful to the wider cancer community. In
the 2013-14 OIS, our call for indicators for one and five-year survival
rates for all cancers was accepted, and in the 2014-15 OIS, our call,
in the “Cancer Across the Domains” report, for indicators
on staging and emergency presentations was also accepted—all
very good news—but the indicators for the five-year survival
rates were dropped from the 2014-15 OIS.</hs_Para>

there were potential problems with the five-year indicator, as the
numbers were small, but those arguments had been made before, when we
campaigned for one and five-year survival rate inclusion. Will the
Minister help the House and the wider cancer community by explaining
what changed in the data between 2013-14 and 2014-15? That would be
helpful. We now have an NHS outcomes framework that retains one and
five-year indicators, but a local CCG OIS that does not have the
five-year indicator. This suggests a disconnect. It is important that
the NHS speaks with one voice, yet it has measures nationally different
from those at a local level. How will her Department work with NHS
England to address this apparent
disconnect?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000664" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000664">While
earlier diagnosis increases survival rates, without data on longer-term
survival rates, it will be harder for NHS England to ensure that early
diagnosis is being improved by CCGs. Will the Minister re-examine the
case for five-year survival rates in the next iteration of the CCG OIS,
or at least communicate to the cancer community the logic behind the
move and carry the community with the Department so that it is clear
for everyone to understand. It remains to be answered, however, why
there was a difference between the 2013-14 and the 2014-15
iterations.</hs_Para>

of the five-year survival rate indicator raises questions about the
process. The development of the CCG OIS is complex; suffice it to say
that the system provides for newly suggested indicators, but does not
appear to recommend indicators for removal. In the development of the
2014-15 OIS, while emergency diagnosis and stage of diagnosis were
flagged for inclusion, five-year survival rates were not flagged for

was a lack of communication, and certainly the process itself raises

She is well aware that few ministerial posts can literally save

for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) and the rest of the all-party
group on cancer in producing its recommendations. I am especially
pleased to speak in this debate as it gives me a chance to make a brief
contribution based to some extent on my own skirmish with cancer, which

experience and treatment as a patient, at the Pennine Acute Hospitals
NHS Trust, the Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust and the Christie NHS
Foundation Trust in Manchester, has been excellent. I owe enormous
thanks to the remarkable surgical skills of Mr Senapati and his upper
gastrointestinal team, and to the care of the Macmillan clinical nurse

will be based on the experience of seeing the delivery of cancer
services from the patient’s viewpoint; and that experience
places me among the 80% of cancer patients who rate their care as good
or excellent. We have yet to see the full consequences of the major
structural changes taking place in the NHS. Hopefully, we can expect an
improvement in cancer services—and an improvement is needed if
we are to save the extra 5,000 lives a year that we must achieve if we
are to match average European survival rates. Goodness knows we ought
to set our sights on being the best, not just the
average.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000674" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000674">Given
the scale and extent of the upheaval in the NHS, there is a real danger
that cancer services will end up being damaged and made worse. That is
why the all-party group on cancer’s report is so timely and
important. It sets out with admirable clarity what the Department of
Health and, through it, NHS England need to do if we want to improve
standards and deal successfully with the predicted increase in cancer
diagnoses in the period ahead.</hs_Para>

report’s recommendations do not depend on the injection of large
sums of money. Much of what is recommended is about doing things in a
better way—shaping sensible policies and working practices, from
GP and community care group level upwards. The recommendations are
particularly aimed at promoting early diagnosis, which, as
the hon. Gentleman says, is above all else the key to turning back the
cancer
tide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000676" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000676">I
do not want to go through all the report’s recommendations; I
just want to comment on a few points based on my own recent experience.
One of the main reasons why I consider my patient experience to have
been so positive was the close involvement of cancer nurse specialists
at every stage of my treatment. The easy one-to-one contact with a
named individual, a clinical expert in the field, meant that there was
a way to raise concerns and get reassurance when it was needed
and—this was very important for me—to give me the
confidence to be an active player in mapping out my own care
pathway.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000677" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000677">The
report is clear that access to clinical nurse specialists is patchy
across the country and decreasing in some areas and specialisms. NHS
England needs to be clear on how it will ensure the continuation and
enhancement of access to clinical nurse specialisms to maintain their
vital role in ensuring quality cancer
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000678" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000678">As
has been said, early diagnosis is obviously the critical factor in
improving cancer survival. My GP picked up reasonably quickly on my
symptoms and I soon entered a pathway of diagnosis and treatment. In
that respect, I was fortunate in having the right GP, but sadly more
than a quarter of people diagnosed with cancer see their GPs three
times or more before being referred to a specialist. Too many people
are still being diagnosed in the advanced stages of cancer. Again, the
report is clear on the need to improve GPs’ awareness of cancer
symptoms as a vital factor in helping to identify cancer earlier and
improving survival
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000679" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000679">The
starting point is for NHS England to make it clear to GPs, through its
community care groups, that they will be held to account on the basis
of their outcomes indicator set. Personally, I am encouraged that NHS
England accepts the need to incorporate measures to encourage earlier
diagnosis by recording the stage of cancer at diagnosis and whether the
cancer 
<?notus-xml column=1087?>is detected in an emergency. However, I agree with
the hon. Gentleman that that can be effective only if it is recoupled
with the survival rate measures to serve best as an important factor in
pressing clinical commissioning groups to promote earlier
diagnosis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000680">Under
the previous Government, there was huge progress in improving cancer
care. The national cancer plan and the cancer networks made a real
impact on lifting NHS care for cancer patients towards the standards
being achieved in other countries. However, the move from 27 cancer
networks to 12 strategic clinical networks, each covering a larger area
and with fewer dedicated cancer staff, is a backward step. The report
reveals that the funding of cancer networks will be slashed by a
quarter, and that 20% of their staff will go. Those worries are
exacerbated by the uncertainty over what the strategic clinical
networks will be able to deliver in comparison with cancer networks. We
face a real risk that the lack of clarity surrounding these structural
changes will damage outcomes for cancer patients. NHS England needs to
recognise that concern, and to act to remove the uncertainty over the
functions of the strategic clinical networks.</hs_Para>

cancer treatment programme can cause big problems and great worry for
patients of working age. I know from talking to fellow patients that
holding on to their job and continuing or returning to work were major
concerns for many. This is not just about keeping the money coming in.
The world of work represents a sense of normality for many, and a
target to aim for, to help them to get through what can be a
debilitating treatment pathway. Again, I speak from experience. My
treatment kept me away from this place for a long time, but my ability
to continue with a good proportion of my constituency work gave me a
sense of normality and helped to counter the negativity and uncertainty
that can be a feature of living with cancer.</hs_Para>

good economic reasons for supporting cancer patients to get back to
work. The report refers to the findings by the Policy Exchange in 2008
that estimated lost productivity at £5.3 billion in that year
alone as a result of cancer survivors not returning to work. It is for
all those reasons that the report calls for NHS England to publish
plans detailing how it will support people with long-term health
conditions to stay in or return to work. That makes sense not only for
the individual cancer patient but for the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021362000683" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000683">I

today in my capacity as the chair of the all-party parliamentary group
on brain tumours. I have not held the post for long and, like many
MPs,  
<?notus-xml column=1088?>I came to the issue through one of my constituents, an inspirational
lady called Nicole Witts. She was diagnosed with a brain tumour many
years ago, and she contacted me a few years ago and explained the
effect that it had had on her life. She talked about the massive need
for increased research funding for brain tumours and asked me to become
the patron of her local charity, which raises funds for such research.
I gladly agreed to do so, and I have been hugely inspired and impressed
by all that she has done. It is she who caused me to become the chair
of the APPG and to make this speech today.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021362000686" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000686">I did not
know a great deal about brain tumours before I met Nicole, and this has
been quite a sharp learning curve for me. Brain tumours are among the
very few conditions that are becoming more prevalent than they were a
few decades ago. They are much more common now than they were in 1970.
Cancer patients are reporting a worse experience in the NHS for brain
tumours than for any other cancer. Unfortunately, 58% of men and women
diagnosed with a brain cancer die within a year, compared with 5% of
people with breast cancer, 35% of people with leukaemia and 7% of
people with prostate cancer. There are also considerable regional
variations in incidence, ranging from 108 per million in London to 145
per million in the south-west. Brain cancer is the chief cause of
cancer deaths in children, in the under-25s and in the under-35s. The
consequence of brain tumours striking so young is that the average
tumour is responsible for over 20 years of life lost in the average
patient, making it the most lethal cancer by that measure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021362000687" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000687">Let us look
at the funding that brain tumour charities receive. I think that
Members will be quite surprised by how low it is. The National Cancer
Research Institute consistently devotes less than 1% of its research
spending to brain tumours. Between 2002 and 2012, the figure was 0.8%,
and in 2012 itself the figure was only 0.78%. There was an average of
6.9 deaths among the under-45s for every £1 million spent on
research for all cancers as a whole, but the corresponding figure for
brain tumours was 82.5 deaths, and more than £7,700 was spent on
research for every death from leukaemia, whereas just £1,400 was
spent for every death from a brain tumour.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021362000688" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000688">Between 2002
and 2012, breast cancer research received £352 million of
funding, leukaemia research received £291 million, prostate
cancer research received £149 million, cervical
cancer research received £47 million and, right at the bottom,
brain tumour research received only £35 million, less
than 10% of what breast cancer research received. As hon. Members can
appreciate, brain tumour research funding is very much the poor
relation. That is a particular problem because, unlike with many other
cancers, brain tumour research does not benefit from general research,
for a number of clinical reasons: brain tumours are very different from
other types of cancer; the blood-brain barrier presents particular
difficulties for researchers; and there are more than 120 different
types of brain tumour, which makes research much more difficult. The
conclusion to draw is that it is only through giving directly to brain
tumour charities and funding laboratory-based research that all types
of brain tumours—adult, paediatric, low-grade, benign,
high-grade and malignant—will be cured.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021362000689" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000689">Let us
examine the experience of people living with brain tumours. I am
indebted to the Brain Tumour Charity for its report on that just before
Christmas, just 
<?notus-xml column=1089?>as I am to Brain Tumour Research for its excellent
report last July on the research issue. When we examine their
experiences of care, we find that we clearly need to make improvements
to make sure that people have the best possible quality of life before
and after diagnosis. We know that 38% of people living with a brain
tumour visited their GP more than five times before being diagnosed. We
know that communication between health care professionals, and people
living with a brain tumour and their carers, very much needs to be
improved. The Brain Tumour Charity has made a number of
recommendations in that area: it wants professionals to recognise and
respond to the signs and symptoms of brain tumours more quickly; it
wants data collected on the quality of care in different areas up and
down the country, so that we can see who is doing well and who is not;
and it wants to ensure that written information about treatment options
is given to people, along with proper signposting to sources of expert
help.</hs_Para>

to highlight the importance of clinical nurse specialists, which was
mentioned by the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (David Heyes). We
know from the 2013 cancer patient experience survey that there is a
huge difference in the quality of care experienced by patients when a
clinical nurse specialist is present. When a clinical nurse specialist
was present 74% of patients were given easy-to-understand written
information about the type of cancer they had, whereas fewer than half
of patients—only 49%—received it when no such specialist
was present. Some 87% of patients were given a choice of different
types of treatment—that is pretty important—with a
specialist, whereas only 67% were given it when no such specialist was
present. If we look at those patients who were given information about
support and self-help groups—a really important area—86%
got that with a clinical nurse specialist and only just over half, 51%,
when there was not one present.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021362000691" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021362000691">For those
patients who were eligible for free prescriptions, 78% were informed of
that when there was a clinical nurse specialist present and only 55%
when there was not. Prescriptions are expensive, so that can make a big
difference. Similarly, with information on financial help and benefits
to which patients might be entitled, 58%, who had a clinical nurse
specialist were told what they could claim, and only 25% were told when
there was not one present. I think the Minister will agree that those
are pretty huge variations in the quality of care. I absolutely agree
with what my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay said
about the importance of early diagnosis.</hs_Para>

matter I want to raise is the excellent campaign run by HeadSmart,
which has produced information cards. I know that the Minister is aware
of them. I pay huge tribute to the Brain Tumour Charity and to others
who are absolutely determined to get these cards into schools across
our country. I have written to every colleague in the House—I
hope you got the e-mail as well, Mr Deputy Speaker—telling them
about how we can do that, and have provided a sample letter that we can
all send to our head teachers. I suggest that colleagues write to their
local authorities as well. It is so easy to get these cards. HeadSmart
provides them, so local authorities and schools do not have to pay
anything. The cards provide the warning symptoms that we need to look
out for in pre-school children, children aged five to 11 and young
people between the 
<?notus-xml column=1090?>ages of 12 to 18. Symptoms include persistent
recurring vomiting, recurrent headaches, balance and co-ordination
problems, abnormal eye movements, blurred or double vision, behavioural
changes and fits and seizures. They are all on the card, which will fit
in a purse or wallet.</hs_Para>

to Members here today and to those who read this debate is to get these
cards out to their schools, and to our young people. We know the vast
difference that early diagnosis can make; it could literally be the
difference between life and death. This is something practical that we
can all do as a result of this debate, and I ask all colleagues to try
to do
it.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_13_PT_1/B7DFB50A377936FD77B5700A21DAD5DDD70BC501" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2014">Thursday

happens to people who are either diagnosed with it or who have various
issues with it.</hs_Para>

cancer that is particularly close to my heart is melanoma, having lost
my brother to the disease 13 years ago. In 2011, more than 11,000
people were diagnosed with melanoma. It is a type of cancer that is
relatively easily treatable if it is caught early. Simply removing the
affected tissue can usually cure the disease. Given that it is easily
treatable in its early stages, it is shocking that 11 % of those
diagnosed die within the first five years. These figures would surely
imply that there is a problem with awareness of the symptoms of the
disease, and, as a consequence, with how long it takes patients to be
diagnosed. Doctors need to get better at it. As the hon. Gentleman
said, it often takes three visits to a GP before referral to a
specialist. My brother went to his GP three times in a year before the
GP suddenly said, “Well, there is nothing really wrong with you,
but I will refer you,” By that time, it was far too late, and he
died of a melanoma a few years later.</hs_Para>

the APPG’s excellent report recommends that the current
advertising campaigns should continue and I am very pleased that an
advertising campaign about melanoma will start in May 2014. Although
preventing skin cancer is vital, the focus of the campaign should be on
identifying its symptoms because, as lay people, most of us do not know
what to look out for. I met one consultant who used to work in
Australia, who told me that Australian school children go to school
with rucksacks on their backs to take their books and kit to and from
school and on each side are mesh 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>holders, one for water and one for sun cream. We must encourage that
practice in the UK, and teachers must not be frightened to help young
people apply the cream in case they are labelled paedophiles. That is
complete nonsense and they need to get over it and help young children
who cannot apply the cream
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000006">Through
my involvement with the charity Melanoma UK, I know that five-year
survival rates are hampered by NICE guidelines on the treatment
available to late-stage melanoma sufferers. The first line of treatment
offered to patients is dacarbazine, which is generally accepted by
clinicians as insufficient to treat late-stage melanoma. There is a
call for NICE to recommend a second-line treatment, ipilimumab or
Yervoy, in the first instance rather than dacarbazine and I believe
that NICE is consulting on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000007">One
study that recommends ipilimumab as a first-line treatment concerns a
man named Richard Jackson, who was told that he had only weeks to live
when he was diagnosed. He was deciding which hymns to have at his
funeral, but when he went to his doctor he decided to give him
ipilimumab straight away. As a consequence of the early prescription of
ipilimumab, Richard is still alive seven years after diagnosis. It does
not make economic sense to use a first-line drug with such a low
success rate only, in the majority of cases, to progress the patient on
to ipilimumab when they are much weakened by the first drug. That gives
them much less of a chance of doing well. Given the Government’s
commitment to fighting cancer, I think it is important that pressure
should be brought to bear on NICE to ensure that ipilimumab is
available in the first instance. This debate is timely, because NICE is
considering the issue right
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000008">One
type of cancer that has been part of a successful national advertising
campaign is, of course, bowel cancer. Perhaps Members will remember
that when we had not been here for long after the 2010 election one
Member wore a tie that contained a musical device that played a tune
and it went off. That probably did more to raise awareness of bowel
cancer than any other event. Although the Be Clear on Cancer campaign
has no doubt been helpful in fighting bowel cancer, it remains to be
seen whether its effects have been positive, as the results of the
national cancer audit are due to be published later this year. In the
interim, I welcome the APPG’s suggestion that the advertising
campaign should be extended, as it will undoubtedly lead to more people
being diagnosed with bowel cancer
earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000009">People
do not like talking about their bowels, but they should. They should
not be nervous or embarrassed about it, because if they talk about
things, they might realise that their symptoms are the very symptoms
that are causing problems for so many people. I speak about this from
personal experience because three members of my family have
died of that cancer between the ages of 51 and 54, and one at 66. That
is incredibly young these days. It is such a deadly disease unless,
like others, it is caught early. Then, it is
curable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000010">Although
there is no mention of cancer drugs in the report, one element of
cancer care that particularly concerns me is the legacy of the cancer
drugs fund and what will happen to the provision of cancer drugs after
its closure in 2016. The east midlands cancer drugs fund 
<?notus-xml column=1092?>closed in 2013, and in every year of its existence it was left with lots
of money to spare at the end of the financial year. One constituent of
mine, Jill Bilbie, contacted me when she was funding her own treatment
for cancer. It did not matter what I said or did, I could not persuade
the cancer drugs fund to pay for the Avastin she so desperately needed
even when it had the funding. All the fund said was that Avastin did
not work, but she survived for three years on something that did not
work. Sadly, she has now died, but during her illness, she paid more
than £31,000 for the drugs, and people should not have to do
that. It goes without saying that the cancer drugs fund and whatever
replaces it in 2016 must be more flexible to the requirements of those
making funding applications for drugs and must prevent the situation
whereby desperate people exhaust their limited finances to fund their
treatment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000011">Selective
internal radiation therapy involving spheres is another cancer therapy
that my constituents have had difficulty obtaining on the NHS. I was
contacted by a constituent, Kate, who I had known for many years, who
had been diagnosed with colorectal liver metastases and was trying to
get that therapy to reduce the progress of the disease in her liver. As
the cancer had metastasised from the primary tumour in her colon, she
was refused. Once again, the guidelines for that particular treatment
are insufficiently flexible and lead to premature mortality in
otherwise treatable cancers. Another of my constituents managed to get
the treatment not because the NHS funded it, but because she had
private medical insurance. She is still alive today, which shows that
the treatment works, so people should be able to get it. I am
disappointed that, regarding the treatments that my constituents can
get, the east midlands is a poor relation in comparison with other
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000012">I

early detection of cancer, but I am worried that not enough is being
done to ensure that cancer patients get the right treatment at the
right time. I am pleased that the Government are aiming to reduce the

is little need for me to repeat what other hon. Members have said:
cancer is a devastating disease. It is obviously right that the
Government do all they can to put the best support in place and to set
up appropriate frameworks to prioritise finite resources. I welcome the
all-party group’s report and its recommendations on improving
survival rates and supporting patients through recovery. A third of a
million people are now diagnosed 
<?notus-xml column=1093?>with cancer each year, and despite the considerable advances in
research, about half those cases will sadly still be
fatal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000015">I
shall focus my remarks on end-of-life care. There is a considerable gap
between what people want and what they receive. We know that 63% of all
patients would prefer to die at home, while a further 29% would choose
a hospice. Just 3% of patients would choose to die in hospital, yet
more than 53% ended up dying there last year. Among cancer patients,
nearly three quarters—73%—want to die at home, but only
29% are able to do so, which means that 36,400 cancer patients died in
hospital last year although they wanted to be at home, surrounded by
their loved ones. That causes great distress to family members, and
many hon. Members will have met constituents who have expressed a lot
of frustration about what happens at such a difficult time in their
families’
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000016">The
national end-of-life-care strategy has rightly called for that to
change as a priority, and it has support from across the House.
However, practical barriers need to be overcome to make it a
reality. This is rooted in reprioritisation of resources, which, if
done properly, will not mean increased costs. That is the challenge
with so much that happens in the NHS. If small changes are made in
certain procedures—the way that things work and research is
conducted, and the way that referral processes take place—money
can be
saved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000017">There
are three challenges. First, high quality 24-hour community support
needs to be available. Secondly, patients need to be able to see how
their services perform in helping people to die at home. Thirdly, the
NHS needs to use innovative tools more effectively so that hospital
professionals know what a patient has told their general practitioner.
Nearly half of all primary care trusts in 2010 did not provide 24/7
community services, despite groups such as Macmillan Cancer Support and
Marie Curie Cancer Care emphasising its importance and despite the
clear economic case for doing so. A day of community care costs around
£145, compared with £425 for a hospital bed. Improving
community care is one of the most effective ways to free up much-needed
bed space and prevent emergency admissions, and, of course, give a
better quality of life experience for the patients
involved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000018">In
Wiltshire, we have a dedicated community nursing team, and Sarum
clinical commissioning group in my constituency has chosen to focus on
improving end-of-life care. It has a clear target to ensure that there
is not just 24-hour community care, but specialist support and advice,
which is particularly important in the context of cancer. In addition,
it has chosen to set an outcomes indicator on the number of patients
who are supported to die in their place of
choice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000019">I
wanted specifically to highlight this as the APPG cancer report
recommends that the national indicators set by the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence should include it. I agree. It is
important that patients can see how their local health services are
respecting their wishes, or, in some cases sadly, not. It is important
that where they fail to do so they can be held to account and a local
dialogue can take place. This can only happen with clear and
transparent data. If this measure were adopted nationally, it would
mean that pressure could be exerted when patient preferences were not
being respected.</hs_Para>

and accountability are at the heart of many of the NHS reforms in
recent months and years. Those principles need to apply to end-of-life
care. In some London boroughs, I understand that as many as 70% of all
patients die in hospitals, yet fewer than half of Wiltshire patients
end their days in the same way. It is unacceptable that one area can
support 49% of cancer patients at home, while another can reach only
16% of patients. It is important that patients can readily see these
numbers, and clinical commissioning groups can account for
progress towards meeting their goals and targets.</hs_Para>

recommended that death in the preferred place of care should be taken
forward as an outcome indicator. I urge the Minister to make progress
on this issue and ensure that the data will be available as soon as
possible in a form that can be understood and digested by our
constituents. But it is not just about data for patients; it is also
about data for professionals. Innovation allows us to ensure that this
is used more effectively, and electronic palliative care co-ordination
systems are a real step forward in that area. The proportion of
patients on EPaCCS who have died in their preferred place is 76%, and
just 8% died in hospital. Not only is that a substantial relief for the
families who have benefited, but it delivers, on average, a saving of
£270,000 to a clinical commissioning group.</hs_Para>

district hospital, the outstanding hospital at Odstock that serves my

integration with GPs in the area, emergency department doctors can now
access medical records that include an end-of-life care plan. They have
trialled an innovative rapid discharge pathway for patients in the last
72 hours of life, and 20 patients were successfully supported
at home last year. As a result, the scheme is being rolled out across
the hospital and will bring great benefit to patients in the last few
days of their life.</hs_Para>

speak as someone who has a personal, family experience of cancer and I
speak on behalf of my constituents. As I have said in the House before,
both my parents died of cancer, as did three of my immediate
family—uncles and aunts. They died many years ago, when the
treatments now available were not available. Had they been, there is 
<?notus-xml column=1095?>no doubt that they would have survived far longer. The good news is that
progress has been made over many years in cancer

of this debate focuses on health matters, but I want to flag up
an issue that can also affect people who suffer from cancer. A
constituent came to see me. He had worked all his life, for 40 years,
in a particular industry, doing quite heavy work. He was suddenly
diagnosed with life-threatening cancer. He went to the jobcentre to get
benefit while he received treatment. He was denied any benefit, for the
simple reason that his doctor’s letter stated that his treatment
was likely to last six months. He was therefore disqualified from
receiving benefits. He was down to his last few hundred pounds to
sustain his family. Fortunately, I was able to intervene and it was
found that his treatment would last a minimum of six months, and more
likely a year or longer, so he would be out of work for that period.
Unfortunately, in many respects the way benefits are dealt with is not
helpful to cancer sufferers. I do not expect the Minister to respond to
that point today, but it is something we should flag up for Ministers
in the Department for Work and
Pensions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000027">I
also speak from another perspective. When I was a local councillor, St
Luke’s hospice in north-west London was founded in my ward. It
has gone from strength to strength. It started out as an outreach
service for people suffering from life-threatening diseases or who were
at the end of their life; it helped them at home. It has now moved to
its own headquarters, which is also a headquarters for Macmillan
nurses. It treats many thousands of cancer sufferers across north-west
London in an excellent way. St Mark’s hospital, which is
world-renowned in the treatment of bowel-related diseases, particularly
cancer, is also in my
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000028">As
some Members may know, over the past year, I have been under the care
of St Mark’s hospital following medical treatment, and I have
personally witnessed the terrible distress that individuals go through
when they are told that unfortunately they are suffering from some form
of cancer. It is not until you see those people and see the terrible
effect not only on them, but on their relatives and friends, that it
really comes home to you what a terrible thing this disease is and how
important it is that we continue to treat people in an appropriate and
sympathetic manner. However, the good news is that just because someone
has been diagnosed with cancer, that does not mean it is the end. There
is treatment available and the capability of a full recovery, but often
people do not realise that until they are thus affected.</hs_Para>

we all live longer and live healthier lives, there is a greater risk of
suffering from cancer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and
Billericay said, within six years, one in every two people will be
diagnosed with some form of cancer. That means that every family in the
country will experience the terrible problem of having a relative
diagnosed with cancer and the impact that that has on the whole family.
We need to understand that this will not go away but get worse as a
potential
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000030">I
congratulate the Government on the introduction of the cancer drugs
fund, which categorises money and makes it available for treatment of
cancer-related diseases. The sad fact is, however, that it is
time-limited; it will 
<?notus-xml column=1096?>end in 2016. Concerns are being raised—they are raised very
strongly in the report by the all-party group—about what will

diseases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000031">There
is another big challenge in relation to the clinical treatment of
cancers: quality of life issues versus the age of the patient and their
ability to recover from the treatment—whether the treatment will
actually kill the patient is a concern. More importantly, such issues
are balanced against the cost of the treatment to be provided. If a
patient is going to have their life prolonged by a week, the clinician
can be asked whether it is worth the huge amount of money that may be
invested in doing so. However, if they will be given another five
years, there is no question about what should be provided. Then the
challenge is what to do in between those time frames. That is a direct
challenge to our clinicians and to all those making decisions about
funding the cost of treatment and the provision that we make for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000032">During
this debate, we have talked about early diagnosis. There is no question
but that if people are diagnosed early, their treatment is less severe
and the chances of recovery are far greater. Women, in particular, have
had strong advice over many years to check themselves for breast
cancer. Smears have been available, as have other forms of treatment
and checks. Men often do not want to talk about the fact that they may
be suffering from early signs of cancer. They do not go to doctors
early enough. They do not consider themselves to need treatment, and of
course, by the end, it may be too late for that treatment to take
place.</hs_Para>

screening across the country for the most common forms of cancer needs
to be available for every single patient on the NHS. However, there
must be a word of warning—after screening, the patient may be
shown not to be suffering from a form of cancer at the moment, but that
does not mean that they will not suffer from it next week, next month
or thereafter. The risk is that people may feel that they are safe as a
result of screening, but they are not. Therefore, screening must take
place regularly so that people can understand that early treatment can
get them into a good
position.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000034">There
is also the aspect of specialist treatment that must be available.
There are a number of rare cancer diseases where the cost of treatment
is quite high but the number of cases is relatively few. We should
therefore ensure that the people who suffer from those rare forms of
cancer have a good chance of recovery through proper treatment, proper
drugs, and proper specialist
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000035">I
want to highlight in particular the work being done at University
College hospital on blood cancers. One of the problems is that, while
treatment kills many cancer cells, it leaves behind small numbers that
are very difficult to detect and that at some future stage may spring
back into action and infect the whole body via the blood. University
College hospital depends on donations from members of the public for
the equipment it uses. In my view, there should be far greater
investment from the NHS in that research, which enables experts to make
diagnoses and produce the detailed treatment needed by those suffering
from blood cancer in
particular.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000036">Another
issue is the drug companies that produce the drugs that treat cancers,
be they common or rare. It is clear that the cost of research is
enormous, that the failure rate of the drugs is difficult to determine
and 
<?notus-xml column=1097?>that there is a challenge—this is
particularly true of rare cancers—with regard to the number of
patients who can be treated. Will the Minister consider an open-book
policy for the drug companies whereby they would say,
“We’ve spent this much money on research and this is how
much it has cost us to develop these drugs, so this is how much we need
to recover from treatment using these drugs”? At the moment,
there seems to be a battle between the drug companies, the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the NHS with regard to the
cost of treatment. It is clear that that needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000037">It
would be remiss of me, during a debate on cancer, not to say that
individuals also have a responsibility. If we can educate young people
to have a better diet and not to start smoking in the first place, and
if we can educate people who do smoke to give up, we have a chance of
reducing the risks of contracting cancer. I congratulate my hon. Friend
the Minister, who has been a Health Minister for only a short period,
on the major change earlier this week to the Government’s policy
on smoking in cars when children are present and on the issue of
standardised packaging of tobacco products. She has made a huge

have not completed the job yet and we look forward to the regulations
being introduced, but now we have another challenge, which is the
treatment of cancers through the use of various drugs that assist
people who suffer from those terrible diseases. It is a new challenge

cancer, and mine is certainly no exception. It was also very good to

science has given hope to many people where no hope existed in the
past, and survival rates are much better than they were 20 or 30 years
ago. It seems to me, however, that the material question is whether
this country harnesses the benefits of advances in medical science as
well as other countries do. That raises many questions, as I suggested
in my intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and
Billericay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000042">Across
the health services of the constituent nations of the United Kingdom,
across the years and under Governments of both the main political
parties, there 
<?notus-xml column=1098?>has been a gap in survival rates for cancer compared
with those of other countries. There is a gap in how well we harness
the advances of medical science, certainly relative to comparable
economies in Europe, other western nations and the United
States.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000043">It
is a material question whether we are managing to close the gap. I drew
attention to that in a debate about the cancer patient experience in
Westminster Hall in October. Since then, further statistics have been
produced by Eurocare. In December, it published a survey of cancer
survival rates across Europe, which looked at the five-year relative
survival rates of adult patients who were diagnosed with cancer from
2000 to 2007. I am indebted to the House of Commons Library for
providing me with the results, which are the material comparisons we
should make. Eurocare is a cancer epidemiology research project on the
survival of European cancer patients, which is based on collaboration
between some highly esteemed cancer registries and specialists, with
results from 22 European
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000044">I
am afraid I have to report to the House that the survey of 22 countries
suggests that the gap in cancer survival rates remains considerable.
The clinical outcomes for cancer patients in this country lag behind
those of many other countries. For every type of cancer, the United
Kingdom is certainly well behind Scandinavian countries, and it is well
behind western European nations with similar economies to our own,
including France and Germany. We are also behind southern European
nations for every type of cancer except, perhaps understandably, skin
cancer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000045">The
economies of those countries are certainly no larger than
ours—in some cases, they are smaller—but it appears that
their cancer survival rates are higher. For example, the prostate
cancer survival rate is 9% higher in Portugal than in this country; the
breast cancer survival rate is 6% higher in Italy than in this country,
while that for stomach cancer is 15% higher; and the stomach cancer
survival rate is 8% higher in Spain than in this country. We have to
ask why that is the case. We are ahead of eastern European countries
for most of the common cancers, but we are behind even them for some
types, particularly stomach, lung and ovarian cancers. Why is the
stomach cancer survival rate 5% higher in the Czech Republic than in
this country, when it laboured for so many years under a very
undeveloped communist
system?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000046">I
invite the Minister to address those questions. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Basildon and Billericay and the Government have rightly
said, we could save the lives of thousands of cancer patients in this
country if we brought our survival rates just up to the European
average. Why does this advanced economy, which is doing very well
economically compared with other countries, have cancer survival rates
that are so much lower than those of comparable nations? That question
must be asked over and over
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000047">Some
excellent points have been made about the early detection of cancer. I
hope that the Minister will make a full response to those points. I
invite her to respond on the question of cancer survival rates for
older patients. Many people believe that older patients do not get as
good a deal in this country as they do in comparable European
countries. Will the Minister tell me—if she does not have the
statistics to hand, I would be happy if she wrote to me—whether
the gap that still exists is 
<?notus-xml column=1099?>being closed? Have we made any progress over the
years in closing the gap between ourselves and those European
countries? Is it the Government’s ambition to close that gap?
What specific measures does she think would help us to achieve
that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000048">There
is no reason why this country should have a lower cancer survival rate.
The advances in medical science are as available to us as to other
countries. We can afford them because we have a developed economy. This
country has wonderful pharmaceutical companies that produce
world-beating research. We also have excellent clinicians, doctors and
nurses, and very good hospitals. Why is it that we have this stubborn
gap in cancer survival rates, with survival rates for common cancers
being much lower in this country than in comparable western

applaud the Government for their ambition, but I urge Ministers to
focus on closing that gap. It is a stubborn gap that has been there for

hearing the words “You have cancer” is one of the most
frightening things that can happen to somebody. It is frightening not
only for the person who is given the diagnosis, but for their
family. He was also right that more and more of us will hear those
words in the future. As we live for longer, the prevalence of cancer
increases. Just last week, the World Health Organisation warned that
the world faces a “tidal wave” of cancer, with the number
of cases globally set to reach 24 million a year by 2035. We often
think of cancer and heart disease as issues of the western,
developed world. In fact, long-term conditions are becoming the
primary health conditions in developing countries as well. We have made
big strides in tackling conditions such as malaria and HIV, but
long-term conditions such as cancer are big issues in developing
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000053">In
the UK, 330,000 people are diagnosed with cancer each year. That figure
has gone up by 50,000 in a decade. The primary reason for

two of the biggest drivers of that change.</hs_Para>

Research UK produced a report in December, which showed that cancer
deaths have dropped by 20% over the past 20 years. I am proud of the
Labour Government’s contribution to that record. We launched the
first ever national cancer plan in 2000 and made cancer a top priority.
That work was led by Professor Sir Mike Richards who, as Members will
know, is now the chief inspector of hospitals. The plan was backed by
increased funding and, crucially, by reforms to drive improvements in
cancer care, including better diagnosis, reduced waiting times for
treatment and better standards of care. As a result, survival rates
have improved steadily and cancer deaths have fallen by 50,000 a

hon. Members have rightly highlighted the need to ensure that patients
with cancer have the best outcomes and survival rates, and that we
narrow the gap with other countries. Many figures have been cited, but
in some areas we have seen the gap narrow. An article by John Appleby
from the King’s Fund in the <I>British Medical Journal</I> in
January 2011 reminded us that death rates for lung cancer in men peaked
in the late 1970s, but they have steadily come down and are now lower
than those for French men. There has been a similar trend in breast
cancer mortality for which we have virtually closed the gap with
France. As the all-party group on cancer report rightly said, however,
we need to do much more to prevent, treat and cure cancer, which means
raising awareness of the symptoms of cancer among members of the public

GPs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000056"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Clappison" PimsId="2611" UID="14021374000185" xid="112" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000185">Mr

must tackle variations in treatment so that everyone gets the best

physical care, but emotional and social support such as help with
finances, benefits and work. The hon. Member for Harrow East made an
important point about how when they go through such a terrible time,
many patients have a problem with their finances and benefits. I
visited a brilliant multidisciplinary cancer team at Leicester Royal

people providing financial information and support, as well as
emotional support. That joined-up care is exactly what we

after cancer. People’s experience of the condition, as many hon.
Members 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>will know, does not end—hopefully—with the all-clear,
because there are all sorts of emotional problems after that. As the
hon. Member for Salisbury said, we must ensure that patients who cannot
be cured, and their families, have real choice and control over the
last days of their life, including where they die. The hon. Gentleman
has probably not been reading the <I>Hansard</I> reports of the Care
Bill Committee, but there is cross-party support for moving more
quickly on that issue. In that Committee, the Minister of State,
Department of Health, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb),

Member for Salisbury said, we should help people to stay at home with
the right social care and support, including support for family
members. It can be quite frightening to think that one’s loved
one may be dying at home, and people can feel panicked about that. If
we can provide the right social care support, and Macmillan specialist
nurses to sit with people through the night, it can be better for those
families and also provide better value for money. I hope that when the

commitments.</hs_Para>

overarching question that the all-party group focuses on is how we can
make such things happen on the ground. It takes the new structure
within the NHS and asks, “How are we going to make this
work?” The Health and Social Care Act 2012 reform was not
perfect, and it was clear that cancer networks took the lead in driving
changes and improvements in cancer services. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (David Heyes) has said, we had 27 cancer
networks that brought together the commissioners of services and the
providers of cancer care to plan high-quality services in their areas.
They were staffed by people with specific expertise in cancer care and
local knowledge of the different hospitals and services.
They worked across primary and secondary care and on a wide range of
issues such as increasing the uptake of screening, improving training
for staff on the best possible treatments, spotting early symptoms and
signs, and championing a focus on the patient experience and the
patient’s pathway through the
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000062">As
the all-party group’s report states, there is concern, including
among organisations such as Macmillan, that the good work and vital
expertise of those networks are being lost. I was first alerted to the
problem by Dr Mike Peake, a lung cancer specialist at Glenfield
hospital. He is also the national clinical lead for cancer and
responsible for the national cancer intelligence network. The worry is
that the Government’s reorganisation means that the dedicated
cancer networks have been abolished and subsumed into 12 generic
strategic clinical networks, which cover a larger geographical region
and have fewer dedicated staff. The fundamental concern is that moving
from a specialist to a generic focus will reduce the ability, which we
desperately need, to drive improvements in cancer
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000063">Members
on both sides of the House, and clinicians and staff, are saying that
in every other part of the health system we need to concentrate
specialist services like cancer services to improve outcomes, rather
than having them delivered through every district general hospital. It
does not make sense to people: we say that  
<?notus-xml column=1102?>we want clinical advice to drive clinical improvements and change, but
then we go the opposite way—from specialist to generic. That is
cause for
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000064">There
is also confusion about how the strategic clinical networks will work
with all the other parts of the new system—the 10
specialist commissioning hubs, the 19 commissioning support
groups, the 211 clinical commissioning groups, the 27 local area teams,
the 152 health and wellbeing boards, NHS England, Public
Health England and Health Education England. The new system is very
confusing. People have to work together, so clear lines of
responsibility and accountability are important.</hs_Para>

need clarity on two points. First, will the Minister update Members on
what is happening in the strategic clinical networks, and,
specifically, how is the cancer expertise being protected? Secondly,

work with other parts of the

all-party parliamentary group report makes many excellent
recommendations and raises many issues. I cannot go into all of them in
detail, but will focus on the two that I believe are the most important
for patients. The first, as most hon. Members have said, is early
diagnosis. The second is improving the patient experience, which we
have not discussed in
detail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000067">Getting
early diagnosis right is the key to improving survival rates. Several
things would make a difference, but I shall describe the most important
ones, the first of which is raising public awareness of symptoms. If
the Government want to meet their target of saving an additional 5,000
lives by 2014-15, we must arm people with knowledge of the warning
signs and symptoms. Once again, the Government’s reorganisation
means that the responsibilities for public health are
split between lots of different bodies and we are not clear how
they will work together. The APPG report says that the responsibilities
for increasing public awareness must be more clearly spelt out for NHS
England, the Department of Health and Public Health England, and for
local authorities and health and wellbeing boards. I hope the
Minister will set out exactly who will be responsible for running
public awareness and other
campaigns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000068">Secondly,
we have to improve the ability of GPs to spot signs and refer people to
specialists for early diagnosis. As the report states, more than a
quarter of people diagnosed with cancer see their GP three times or
more before they are referred to a specialist. Under the old system,
before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 and the reorganisation,
cancer networks absolutely led improvements in training for GPs and
other health professionals, but it is not really clear who is going to
do that now. How will NHS England work with Health Education England,
the royal colleges and other education providers to ensure that
training programmes for health professionals are really there on the
ground?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000069">Thirdly—this
is probably the most important point in the report, one which the hon.
Member for Basildon and Billericay emphasised—how are we going
to hold clinical commissioning groups to account for the one and
five-year survival rates? The report
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14021374000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000166">“NHS
England has not provided any guidance on how the one- and five-year
survival rates will be used to drive improvements in

available, but what will happen to them? Will NHS England identify poor
performers? Will it make practical support and guidance available to
CCGs? How will we know whether actions and steps have been taken? How
can we hold them to account? As a local MP, I would certainly want to
know how my CCG rates, what the problems are, what it has not been
doing, what its action plan is and when it is going to report back. We
do not know any of that. The survival rate targets are excellent, but
we have to make sure we can deliver. At the moment, we simply do not
have the mechanisms to do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000071">The
other point I want to focus on is improving the patient experience.
This is not only absolutely central for patients, but a key driver of
improvements in the quality of care and better value for money. As
such, it should be a much higher priority in the NHS. We all know,
whether from personal experience, the experience of those we love or
those in our constituencies, that a good experience makes patients feel
as though they have been supported and respected as an individual. A
bad experience makes them feel at best that their needs do not matter,
and at worst that their basic human dignity has been denied. Cancer
patients I have spoken to, for example those at the Macmillan Cancer
Support group in my constituency, constantly emphasise their experience
of care and how they are treated by NHS staff. That would be important
at any point, but for someone going through such a frightening time, it
is even more important.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021374000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000072">The
importance of patient experience goes far beyond the personal value to
individuals. There is now strong evidence that good patient experience
is consistently and positively associated with better health outcomes,
and safer and more clinically effective care. The <I>British Medical
Journal</I> published a systematic review of 55 studies last
year, which provided very clear evidence. Patients who have a good
experience are more likely to stick to their recommended treatments and
medicines, and more likely to use preventive services such as screening
and healthy living programmes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021374000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000073">There is also
increasing evidence, although I would say that it is from the US and
not the UK at this stage, that a good patient experience is linked to
getting better value for money. It is associated with reduced length of
stay in hospitals and fewer problems with patient safety—the
so-called “adverse incidents”. A good patient experience
is also associated with higher staff retention rates and, in turn,
lower staff turnover. That is common sense: when staff feel valued and
respected they are more likely to treat patients in that way.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021374000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000074">For all the
reasons I have outlined, the patient experience in cancer care should
be given an even higher priority. The cancer patient experience survey
introduced by the previous Government has made a big difference in
trying to drive improvements. I welcome the assurances given to the
all-party group on cancer that the survey will continue, but for how
many more years? We must ensure that we use that information to drive
changes on the ground, and I will make some concrete proposals on how
to do that. First, commissioners should be held to account through the
inclusion of a cancer patient experience indicator in the CCG OIS. If
that is how we hold them to account, we have to include patient
experience. Secondly, 
<?notus-xml column=1104?>patient experience should be much more central to
the hospital inspection process led by the chief inspector of
hospitals. Currently, out of 150 CQC indicators, only two concern
patient experience. We need more patient experience indicators in the
work of the CQC, including one specifically for cancer teams or
services.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021374000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000075">Thirdly, we
need to look at how we improve professionals’ training in
patient experience. I want to highlight a brilliant example from my own
constituency that I hope the Minister will look into. Under a joint
Macmillan and De Montfort university partnership project, people
training to be nurses, pharmacists and NHS managers get training from
Macmillan in patient experience and how to talk to and support
patients. In return, those students volunteer for Macmillan in the
community in order to increase awareness about cancer, particularly
among black and minority ethnic groups—Leicester is a very
diverse city. That is something to think about. Has the Minister spoken
to Health Education England and the royal colleges about how to improve
training in patient experience for professionals, and will she speak to
Ministers in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to see
what other universities could do to learn from the fantastic work at De
Montfort?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021374000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000076">To conclude,
Members on both sides of the House want to see big improvements in
cancer care. The new system in the NHS is confusing. Both as MPs and as
people with families and friends, we want the right people held to
account so that they take the right action, but it is not yet clear how
that accountability will work. For me, that was at the heart of the
all-party group’s report. The Minister might not be able to
respond to all the many questions she has been asked in this debate,
but if she cannot, I hope she will write to me about the specific
issues I have raised. This is about improving patient experience and
early diagnosis and ensuring that CCGs are held to account. We as MPs
must hold them to account on behalf of our
constituents.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_13_PT_1/F6D6421B65FD41FC4B70C8C9888174F63C1FDDEF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2014">Thursday

Out of that dialogue, I think we can progress in some of these areas.

I am pleased that the national clinical director is to meet the

debate, I was particularly struck by the fact that NHS England is
considering the report in great detail—indeed, it contributed
during the consultation phase. I am really encouraged by that, as NHS
England is absolutely critical in our new health structures. It is very
aware of its responsibilities. Some of the challenge today has been
about how we interact and how those new responsibilities
settle.</hs_Para>

delivering on our ambition, articulated by other Members, to make
England among the best in Europe on this issue. My hon. Friend the
Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison) said that we had major challenges

domain that the report addresses is preventing people from dying

accountability in the new health system. It is right to challenge on
such issues; we cannot pretend that, when there is such major change to

that there is a challenge. Our progress must be as speedy as possible

devolving power on delivery in a way that empowers clinicians while

suggesting that. However, in highlighting concerns about where the new
system is settling down, it is sometimes tempting to think that
previously Ministers had a big lever under their desks that they could
pull to make everything right. Even if that was the theory, it

accept the point that that is quite a macro way of looking at things,
and that Members are also seeking a sense of what can be done on the
ground. Perhaps I need to respond in more detail after the debate on
the challenges relating to the role of the strategic clinical networks.
Cancer has been made a priority for those networks. Making the new
networks work is also a challenge for the national clinical directors
and other colleagues in NHS England. Their role in relation to cancer
is obviously to drive quality and innovation in prevention and
screening, survivorship and end-of-life care. I know that NHS England
is keen to see the links between the national clinical directors and
those respective networks strengthened. There is clearly more to do,
and I welcome the fact that the all-party group is in direct dialogue
with the national clinical director. I will pick this up with the group

to clinical commissioning group accountability, NHS England is
responsible for ensuring that the CCGs secure the excellent outcomes
that we want, through commissioning. The assurance framework provides
the basis for that assessment. It is an integral 
<?notus-xml column=1107?>part of the agreement of improvements to be delivered locally. When CCGs
are found to be at risk of failing to deliver improvements, NHS
England will provide the necessary support. Statutory
intervention powers exist, but they are to be used as a last resort

improvements.</hs_Para>

2014-15 CCG outcomes indicator set is used as a tool by CCGs to
understand trends in outcomes and to help them to identify potential
priorities for improvement. It has a range of new cancer measures
covering early detection, stage at diagnosis, and diagnosis via
emergency routes. I pay tribute to the all-party group for championing
the inclusion of those indicators, which have now been adopted, as the

most accurate and timely cancer data that have ever been available in

the five-year data, I am sorry that things have changed since the
answer that I gave to the hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay at
Health questions. That was the information that I was working on at the

and Tropical Medicine to establish whether the five-year indicator was
statistically valid. When I answered the hon. Gentleman’s
question, the data had not been fully gathered in. Having gathered them
in, however, the conclusion was that because of the small number of
survivors at five years, disaggregating the data down to individual
CCGs would not leave the data statistically robust enough to draw
conclusions. It would therefore be unsafe to do
so.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_13_PT_1/28BE7CE639F7B32881A267B3E639767D7295F0E6" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2014">Thursday

take it up and raise it. On what we can do with data and transparency
at the local level, the Department is looking at a number of things.
The Government have tried to use data transparency in lots of different
ways to drive improvement and accountability, and we are currently
looking at some other ideas which I hope will produce a far greater
sense of what is happening on the ground and in someone’s local
area. We are very open to suggestions, and some have been made during
the debate. I am happy to look at those, but this is an area under
active
consideration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000098">There
has been a lot of discussion in this excellent debate about awareness
and early diagnosis, and we know that it is one of the keys to getting
better survival rates. It is central to meeting our ambition of saving
the additional 5,000 lives each year by 2014-15, and we have committed
more than £450 million in funding to achieving that and doing
more on early diagnosis. To date, we have run national campaigns on
tackling bowel and lung cancers; we have the Blood in Pee campaign,
which hon. Members will be aware of, to raise awareness of bladder and
kidney cancers; and we are currently running a breast cancer campaign
for women aged 70 and over. The early response to that campaign has
been really encouraging.</hs_Para>

Minister raised some of the core public health issues which I spend
much of the day job discussing: obesity, alcohol and smoking. I am
slightly surprised that we have had relatively little discussion of
those in the context of early diagnosis and prevention. Public health
has been devolved to local authorities. They have more than £5
billion of ring-fenced money over two years, and all the local
authorities I speak to—I was at the Local Government Association
public health conference two weeks ago—are excited by the
possibilities that that holds for them. There is a fair challenge about
where the responsibility sits, but if everyone is doing work on
awareness and early diagnosis, that can only be a good thing. Many
local authorities are taking seriously the challenge of raising their
game locally, and that is in addition to the national
campaigns.</hs_Para>

gave the authority an empty unit and it worked with NHS London,
staffing the unit for six weeks during the same hours as the shopping
centre. It was run on a walk-in basis, and hundreds of people in my
local community have popped in to that non-threatening environment to
talk to trained nurses and get advice about cancer and some of those
important awareness issues. Such local initiatives can only help us in

younger—as more are living with and beyond the disease. In March

concern of the all-party group is how NHS England intends to support

England has issued an invitation to tender for a piece of work to
examine the factors that impact on the employment rate

already seen the publication of “Quality of life of cancer

update commissioned by the Department, which provides important
information on recovery, unmet needs and the consequences of treatment.
NHS England has already begun work to extend the PROM programme. A new

to halt the programme. NHS England is the lead, but I think the more
often we in Parliament recognise how important the programme is, and
show how much parliamentarians value it and regard it as central to
understanding the cancer patient experience, the more NHS England will
feel that it is the right decision to go forward with it. I know that
NHS England intends to examine the potential for a survey-related
indicator as part of the future development of the clinical

and although it focuses more on the experience of carers in general,
NHS England will consider cancer care as part of that. The 2014 cancer

school: children, like the seven and eight-year-olds whom I have read
about and heard of who have never been at school; children who are now
in 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>their teens and will never finish their education; young girls who are
now being trafficked in Lebanon and in other parts of the region, who
dream of a future that is violence

this debate—I am grateful that the Minister is here to reply to
it and that he had a meeting with me yesterday about these
issues—I do not want to focus on the diplomatic complexities of
the region, nor do I want to speculate on the foreign policy
considerations that I know are involved. I am not here to do anything
other than to acknowledge the Government’s £1 billion
contribution to Syrian aid; to appreciate their recent announcement of
£100 million of extra aid at the Kuwait pledging conference; to
thank the Secretary of State in her absence for the £6 million
that has been given to Lebanon for books for Syrian and Lebanese
children. But I am here to join 50 international development agencies
and departments from around the world, all known for their humanitarian
work, which have today made an urgent appeal to Governments about an
emergency that can be addressed by a very specific plan that they are
asking this Government and other Governments now to support.</hs_Para>

Minister—to whom we should be grateful —will
be able to meet the Prime Minister of Lebanon. He is the Prime Minister
of a troubled, divided country, bleeding from the biggest inflow of
refugees, who now form one quarter of the population of his country.
His plea is not only for more food, more shelter, more medical care for
girls and boys and for adults, but, because he knows too that these
young children need more than food, more than shelter, more than health
care, his is an appeal that their right as children to have an
education, even in these troubled times, be upheld, and be upheld
during the crisis as long as it
lasts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000133">I
want to ask the Government today to accept and to contribute to what I
believe is the most innovative plan that has so far been developed, by
UNICEF and UNHCR, to provide education, not for a few hundred or a few
thousand, but for 435,000 Syrian refugee children who are now located
in Lebanon but who now are not at school, and without this plan may
never be at school. The plan that I want to address today is one that
will support the biggest number of pupils ever helped in an education
conflict zone. I believe it could be up and running within weeks and
months, not years. I believe I can show that it is
cost-effective and affordable, and I believe that it establishes a
principle that just as the Red Cross established a right to health care
150 years ago when it moved into war zones and said that health should
be a right of people even in these troubled areas, so too the right to
education can exist across borders and even when children are located
and caught and sometimes trapped in areas of
conflict.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000134">Let
us look at the figures we are dealing with. Today, of the 3 million
children who have been displaced in and from Syria, 1 million have had
to flee their country, and almost half of them are in beleaguered
Lebanon. Those children are the subject of the call today by the 50
anti-poverty advocacy groups that—this is the
slogan—“education cannot wait.” On best estimates,
those child refugees are likely to spend at least 10 years away from
their homes, in camps, temporary shelters or
elsewhere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000135">However,
if we adopted the plan submitted to the Government several weeks ago,
which has been compiled by the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees 
<?notus-xml column=1115?>and UNICEF, as many as 435,000 of those
children could get to school, and it could happen quickly,
as I have said, because the plan is beautiful in its simplicity. It
would put existing Lebanese schools on double shifts, offering one set
of classes by day and one set in the evenings. Thus, all the
435,000 refugee children, who are spread across the country in about
1,500 locations, rather than concentrated in one place, could be
offered the chance of schooling. Because we would be using existing
classrooms and would thus be spared the expense of building new
schools, the annual cost would be an astonishing £5 a week per
pupil, or $8, which is $400 a year.</hs_Para>

I think the Minister knows, would go to five separate projects that are
part of the Education without Borders initiative: 80,000 children would
be in the schools; 100,000 would be catered for by non-governmental
organisations and the Government in joint projects; 175,000 would be
catered for in NGO-led projects—many of the NGOs that have
signed the missive to the Government and other Governments are part of
that—and at the same time 40,000 children would be in nursery
schools, so that they could start school at age three; and 35,000 15 to
18-year-olds, many of whom may have missed out on education over the
past three years because of the conflict, would be given skills and the
chance to get jobs. It is a figure that offers almost every refugee
child in Lebanon the chance to enrol in schooling and the hope of the
better future that goes with it.</hs_Para>

the double shift system is working, albeit on a smaller scale, can be
found in a north Lebanese village called Akroum. In a unique effort, we
have volunteer Syrian teachers, local Lebanese school heads and a small
Scottish charity called Edinburgh Direct Aid operating the local school
there, in what they call a timeshare, outside normal school hours to
give those refugees the chance to be taught, this time in Arabic.
Almost immediately, boys and girls who had fled from burnt-down and
bombed schools, and who only a few weeks ago had been, in some cases,
child labourers and even beggars, have started to recover their lost
childhood and now have hope that there is something to live for. What
has been achieved on that small scale in that village on the border
with Syria can now be achieved at speed for 435,000 Syrian refugees, if
we urgently adopt this plan.</hs_Para>

frustration, and the reason I called this debate, with the permission
of Mr Speaker, is that that idea was conceived nine months ago. It was
negotiated with the Lebanese Prime Minister six months ago—we
have met, had talks and agreed the plan. It has been subject
to two in-depth reports: one by the respected Overseas
Development Institute, a British charity working in that area; and the
other by UNICEF, with the UNHCR. It is now sitting on a table awaiting
implementation while the problem has worsened and while all this winter
children, with few exceptions, are walking the streets, some tragically
trafficked into prostitution and some even forced into early marriage
as child brides. That is why, for three reasons, I urge the Minister to
be positive in his response today and to tell me not only that he
supports in principle the plan being put forward by all the different
agencies and led by UNICEF, but that the Government will contribute to
it in the way that others have done.</hs_Para>

we started on this exercise, 300,000 more people have moved into
Lebanon. In the past nine months, 150,000 children have been added to
the list of those in need, and that number is growing at about 5,000 a
week. If we do not act now, the problem will simply get worse. I think
the Minister is aware of the politics of Lebanon, where in a divided

was saying that, first, this is urgent and the Government should act
because the problem is getting worse. Secondly, the Lebanese Prime
Minister, as the Minister will particularly recognise after he meets
him tomorrow, has sold this plan to a divided population, some of whom
would want to throw out the Syrian refugees and some of whom would want
to deny them any help. The Prime Minister is now asking why so much of
the world has yet to support this humanitarian plan. One of the reasons
why action is urgent is that his Ministers are risking their lives
every day while his Government struggle to hold together around a plan
that he has personally championed—and that I believe the
Minister will wish to
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000145">The
third reason why I think the Minister will want to respond positively,
as I hope he does, is that other countries want to be part of this
initiative and want to help. The United States of America, Norway,
Denmark, the European Union, the United Arab Emirates and other
countries, one or two of which will announce tomorrow that they are
giving money, are committed to providing finance for this plan, and a
consensus is growing in favour of it. It is money that will not be
wasted and, as I can tell the <I>Daily Mail</I>, it is money that will
be well spent. Given the International Development Secretary’s
own personal commitment to the “no lost generation” plan,
which is about helping children in all the different areas of the
region, I want her to put her weight behind this plan as part of her
own
initiative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021374000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/debtext/140213-0003.htm#14021374000146">I
know from my own experience as a father that every single child is
precious, every single child is unique, and every single child is
special. That means that, if we can do something about it, every single
child deserves the chance to fulfil their talents, to make the most of
their potential, and to bridge the gap between what they are and what
they have it in themselves to become. We have the chance to make that
opportunity possible for not just a few but several hundred thousand
children in this troubled region.</hs_Para>

the Minister and I agree that the Government have made a general
commitment to this region and that we both appreciate that the sums
announced at 
<?notus-xml column=1117?>Kuwait include money that could be devoted this
project, I hope that he will be able specifically to address the
UNHCR-UNICEF plan. I think it is common ground that the Government have
done a huge amount in this region and that they wish to do more on
education for children, particularly for girls. However, what we need
to agree on today—I hope the Minister will play his part in
contributing to this—is that when we have an innovative plan,
when we have the support of the Lebanese Government, who would find it
difficult in normal circumstances to finance anything that is now
happening with Syrian refugees, and when we have international aid
agencies in support of this plan and prepared to unite around it, it
would be a mistake for us to delay any longer in providing this urgent
support that is needed in an emergency. It is needed for children like
the girl I mentioned who are losing hope because, despite all our
efforts, they do not feel that we are reaching their needs and those of
their fellow children—boys and girls like them. I hope the
Minister can respond positively to the desire not just that this plan
be supported but that it be properly
financed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_13_PT_1/8527287712F91687174C4A07860F695C9EC386B4" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2014">Thursday

John Whittingdale</B> (Maldon) (Con):</Member> Thank you, Mr Benton,
for this opportunity to debate the Select Committee on Culture, Media
and Sport report, “Supporting the Creative Economy”. It
was the result of a major inquiry, in which we took a great deal of
evidence and came up with a wide range of conclusions. There has been a
lot of interest in some of our proposals across the industry and the
House. I thank Elizabeth Flood, the Committee’s principal Clerk,

others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000009">We
are debating a great success story. There is no question but that in
this country we are very good at creative industries. Since the report
was published, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has
published the latest figures, which show that the creative industries
are worth £71.5 billion to the UK economy and generate around
1.68 million jobs. They are a substantial part of our economic activity
and are growing steadily. We are achieving ever greater
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para tab="yes">Those bare figures conceal
remarkable achievements. In almost every sector of the creative
industries that we have examined, there have been fantastic successes.
The British film industry continued to produce some great films, and we
have some of the greatest talent in the world, but we have also been
remarkably successful in attracting highly mobile international
investment to the UK to make
films.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000010"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jim Cunningham" PimsId="2803" UID="14021365000283" xid="147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000283"><B>Mr

of the
arts?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Whittingdale" PimsId="4590" UID="14021365000284" xid="629" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000284">Mr
Whittingdale:</Member></B> I am happy to, because I agree that the arts
make a substantial contribution, not just to this country’s
cultural life, but to our economic life, and provide an important
economic stimulus. We are well aware of that, which is why, in a few
weeks, the Committee will conduct an inquiry into arts funding in the
UK, and will discuss with the Arts Council its priorities and how to
ensure that the benefits are felt throughout the UK. Some hon. Members
feel strongly about that, and it is very much a component of the
creative economy’s
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000012">I
have spoken a little about film, but the music industry is another
enormous success for this country. The biggest selling artist last year
was British: the band, One Direction. I may not have added to their
album sales, but that is a huge success, which comes on top of 
<?notus-xml column=336?>another remarkable achievement: in five of the last six years, the
best-selling album in the world has been by a British artist. This
country continues to produce enormously successful artists, and it is
worth noting that the music industry does that without any financial
subsidy from the
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000013">The
electronic games industry is another hugely important contributor to
our economy. Some of the best-known games, including “Tomb
Raider”, “Grand Theft Auto” and “Football
Manager”, are British products. It is important that we continue
to be a centre for the electronic games industry; that is another issue
that I want to talk
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000014">I
went to the MIPTV annual market in Cannes, where international buyers
go to purchase TV programmes. There is no question but that the UK
dominates that market. BBC Worldwide has a substantial presence at
MIPTV, but independent production companies such as Shed Productions,
Shine TV and All3Media, are also hugely successful at selling British
products across the world. Then there are the fashion and design
industries. Britain is in the lead in all those
industries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000015">We
started our inquiry on the basis that this country is remarkably good
at the creative industries. Is there more that the Government could do
to support those industries? Are there risks attached to that success?
In each case we came up with recommendations. We started our inquiry on
the back of the most extraordinary showcase for British
talent—the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games in London, where
British talent, not only sporting but creative, was on display. That
creative talent was on display not only in the Cultural Olympiad but in
the games themselves, in the extraordinary opening ceremony by Danny
Boyle, which gave us an opportunity to exhibit British creative talent
to the world.</hs_Para>

were concerned to hear, when we received evidence, that some of the
companies that played a key role in those events have not been able to
take advantage by using that fact in their marketing campaigns. I am
sure that the Minister will refer to the supplier recognition scheme,
which is a huge step forward that gives companies an opportunity to
market themselves on the back of their contribution to the Olympics,
but we received evidence from the Professional Lighting and Sound
Association, the trade body that represents the professional
entertainment technology industry, which remains disappointed that it
has not been able to publicise its involvement in the London 2012
games. PLASA gave as an example the fact that some of its members were
responsible for the appearance of those rings out of the fire, for the
70,500 LED tablets that were placed on every single seat in the stadium
ahead of the opening ceremony, and for the industrial chimneys that
rose out of the ground. All of those were iconic moments in the opening
ceremony, and the companies should have had an opportunity to make it
clear that they were responsible. We still hope that the Government
will reconsider the supplier recognition scheme and find a way to allow
companies in such fields as audio, video and audiovisual equipment to
promote their success in contributing to the
games.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000017">A
key contributor to the success of the British creative industries is
the tax credits offered by the Treasury, for which we give full credit
both to this Government and the previous one. The film tax credit has
been hugely successful. I understand that last year it generated almost

<?notus-xml column=337?>£900 million in international investment in this country through
just 37 feature films. I will always remember visiting Paramount
Pictures to see the trailer for “World War Z”. There was
astonishment on the faces of Committee members, particularly Scottish
members, when we discovered that, although the film ostensibly showed
Philadelphia being overcome by waves of zombies, it was not
Philadelphia but Glasgow. Since then, several members of the Committee
have been to a screening of “Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit”,
which is currently on at cinemas. That film is set in America and
Moscow, but it was filmed in this country, mainly in London but also in
a number of other places; locations included Barnet, Battersea,
Islington, Tower Hamlets, Birkenhead, Liverpool, Hatfield, and a power
station in
Nottinghamshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000018"><Member ContinuationText="Tracey Crouch" PimsId="5551" UID="14021365000285" xid="1041" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000285"><B>Tracey

Might one of the other reasons film companies come here be our

dramas make use of some of our great heritage assets. There are a large
number of reasons why people want to

would not. We pay tribute to the previous Government for introducing

examining the creative industries, we received a lot of evidence about
an issue that lies at the absolute heart of their success: intellectual
property rights. For a long time, Governments have sought to address
some of the problems created by online distribution. In the previous
Parliament, the Government passed the Digital Economy Act 2010, which
was a valiant attempt to put in place measures to deter online piracy.

will not recap the whole history of what has happened since the Act was
passed—the judicial reviews, the arguments and so on. However,
the principle behind it is that people who illegally download
copyrighted material, and so jeopardise the success of the music, film,
television, and, I suspect, in due course, games industries, need to be
told that what they are doing is not only illegal, but poses a real
threat to the economic viability and success of those industries. It
was suggested that that should be done through the dispatch of warning
letters. Once people were identified as serial downloaders, their
internet protocol addresses should be identified and the internet
service providers asked to send
letters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000028"><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Bingham" PimsId="5578" UID="14021365000291" xid="1084" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000291"><B>Andrew

Whittingdale:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Some of the
websites deliberately set out to appear legitimate. They might even
make a small charge, although often they are distributing the content
for free. Perhaps that would be another advantage of sending letters:
it would increase awareness and oblige people to ensure that when they
did download, they did so from a legal site, so that the artists and
producers concerned received the remuneration
due.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000030">Despite
the difficulties in enacting the DEA, the recent development of a
voluntary agreement is in many ways preferable, if it can be made to
work. In America, that is already working well. A voluntary copyright
alert programme would involve an agreement between the rights owners
and the ISPs that there would be a system through which letters were
issued to those identified as illegally downloading. If that can be
done voluntarily, that is preferable, and we should get on with that as
quickly as possible. The Committee’s report is clear: we prefer
a voluntary system, but if agreement cannot be reached, the Government
need to stand by to bring into force the provisions of the Digital

legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000031">Unfortunately,
we were perhaps less optimistic on copyright law. The proposals on the
modernisation of copyright law have given rise to huge controversy. The

<?notus-xml column=339?>Minister will be only too aware of the concerns expressed right across
the creative industries about the dangers of tampering. Copyright law
supports the success story that I have described. The enormous economic
contribution made to our GDP by the creative industries is possible
because copyright law ensures that they receive the reward that they
are due. Extending the exemptions on the basis that it might produce
extra economic activity and income is dangerous if we do not take
account of the risk of widened loopholes jeopardising existing
success.</hs_Para>

Hargreaves report with some concern. When we tried to find out how
Professor Hargreaves came up with the figures quoted in his report on
the substantial potential benefits of some exceptions, we were
concerned at the lack of hard evidence to support those figures, and no
account was taken of the risk that widening exceptions poses to the
industry’s success. That debate continues, and we await the
statutory instruments implementing some of the exceptions. Great
concern is still being expressed across the industry about the lack of
clarity on some of the proposed exceptions, and on the loopholes that
might be created. We are particularly concerned to ensure that
Parliament has an opportunity to examine each exception in detail.
There should be proper scrutiny.</hs_Para>

copying exception has caused most concern, because it has the widest
effect. No one would argue that transferring a piece of music that one
has legally purchased from one device to another should not be
permissible. Millions of people do that, and it is nonsense that
putting a song on an iPod, for example, technically puts them in breach
of copyright law. Legalising private copying, however, has to be done
carefully. The Committee took evidence on that, and listened in
particular to the concerns expressed by the film industry. Most of the
rest of Europe has not applied a private copying exception to
audiovisual material. The film industry said that the exception was
unnecessary and that, in any case, legal means were already being
developed through which consumers who purchased audiovisual material
could store it in the cloud, or access it through different devices.
The Minister will know that the film industry remains very concerned
about the private copying exception. Perhaps he will say a
few words on that in his
speech.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000034">We

opportunities for start-up firms and app manufacturers to develop. It
is at the forefront of the development of technology and making it
available to entrepreneurs and small start-up firms. YouTube has been a
great success in generating revenues for people who post material on
it. More than £1 billion has already been generated in
income.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000035">The
Committee was concerned about the issue of searching and the direction
of people towards illegal download sites. Google has supplied us and, I
am sure, other hon. Members present with statistics on how, if someone
searches for an artist, most of the results that come up will be legal.
Part of the argument is about the fact that Google is citing results of
searches in which people simply put in the artist’s name,
whereas the music industry points out that if, as well as naming the 
<?notus-xml column=340?>artist, people use the word “download” or
“MP3”, that produces very different results. The latest
figures that I have been given show that the proportion of links to
infringing sites appearing in the top 10 search results remains roughly
the same as before. The latest figure that I was given was 252 out of a
possible 400, so 63% of results in the top 10 were illegal
download
sites.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000036">Google
will tell us about the huge number of pages that it takes down when it
is notified that they contain copyrighted content being distributed
illegally, but the notice refers to a single page, with the result that
the music industry has sent more than 50 million notices to Google.
Google does take the pages down when notified, but no sooner do they
come down than they go up again. A much more sensible recommendation,
which the music industry, among others, promotes, is that when a
website is the subject of, say, more than 10,000 notices, it
should be removed from the front page of search results, and when the
figure of 100,000 notices is reached, it should be removed from the
first 10 pages. Eventually, if that goes on, it should be blocked in
its entirety, on the basis that it plainly consistently makes available
copyrighted material
illegally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000037">The
Committee was persuaded that there was a very strong case for
increasing the penalties for online copyright infringement from two
years to 10 years, so that they were of the same severity as those for
physical piracy. I know that the Government are looking at that. We
were very impressed when we visited the new City of London
police’s IP crime unit. That is an encouraging innovation. It is
doing impressive work. However, there is a question about its long-term
funding. I hope that the Minister can give some indication of whether
the Government see it as a permanent part of our policing, with
appropriate
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000038">I
now come to the final area that I want to discuss. I am sorry that the
right hon. Member for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw) is not present, because he
felt very strongly about it. I understand that the severe flooding in
the west country prevents him from being with us. I am referring to
education. It is obviously right that the Government focus on the
promotion of the so-called STEM subjects—science, technology,
engineering and maths—but, as the Minister knows, the debate is
about whether STEM should in fact be STEAM. In other words, arts should
be part of the core curriculum. I believe that the success of our
creative industries is an ample demonstration of why it is so much in
our interests to make arts a core part of the curriculum—so that
this country can continue to produce the extraordinary talent that lies
behind the success of all the industries that I have talked
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000039">I

Sharon Hodgson</B> (Washington and Sunderland West) (Lab):</Member> It
is a pleasure to follow the Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon.
Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale). This is an excellent report. I
welcome the Select Committee’s investigation of how we should
best support our creative economy. The hon. Gentleman made the case
very well in his opening speech.</hs_Para>

UK’s creative industries are known worldwide for their cultural
capacity to shape, influence and inspire. As the hon. Gentleman covered
in detail, the success of the British film industry and the choice of
this country as a location is a great example of that, as is the
British fashion industry. Our fashion designers dominate the catwalks
of London, Paris, New York and Milan; British musicians, songwriters
and composers top the charts and dominate the international airwaves;
and British architects and designers shape skylines and create beauty
all around the world. That is important for not just our international
cultural presence but the benefits to our
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000042">As
we have heard, Britain’s creative industries account for more
than 1.5 million jobs and contribute more than £70 billion to
the economy. That should be all the reason we need to know why it is
imperative that we do everything possible within our power to support
such an increasingly crucial sector, and it is why the report is right
to address issues that affect it, such as the protection of
intellectual property, tax reliefs and education and
skills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000043">I
chair the all-party group on art, craft and design in education, which
was set up to champion high-quality and inclusive
arts education in our schools. I therefore particularly welcome the
Select Committee’s recommendation, as well as the Secretary of
State’s intervention during her speech at the British Museum
last month, for STEM—the focus on science, technology,
engineering and mathematics—to be expanded to STEAM, as we just
heard from the Chair of the Select Committee, to improve the status of
arts education in our schools. That recommendation must be supported,
especially when there are concerns that changes being implemented by
the Department for Education—such as those to discounting codes
and the exclusion of creative subjects in the gold-standard English
baccalaureate performance benchmark—will turn off the talent tap
for our creative industries, so undermining their long-term
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000044">If
we are to support and expand our creative industries, that must be
through not just reforms to public funding and protection of

Hodgson:</Member></B> I will come on to the difference between the
state and the independent sector later in my speech, but I agree that
there is room to extend the school day from, say, 8 am until 6 pm,
especially with regard to child care. During that extra time, children
can obviously be doing all the extra-curricular stuff that is available
in the independent sector. That would be ideal, but the issue is how
that is funded and who pays. We know that 
<?notus-xml column=342?>some schools currently offer extra-curricular lessons in music and other
things, but they must be paid for. The divide is between who can and
who cannot pay. Nevertheless, we should definitely debate and explore
that idea
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000047">Although
the traditional subjects of English, maths and the sciences are and
will always be important, so that young people are numerically and
scientifically literate in the 21st century, it is also important that
young people are creatively and culturally literate. As we have heard,
the gaming industry is a perfect example of where both the traditional
and the creative can be merged to create competitively skilled
employees.</hs_Para>

point, I should declare an indirect interest as the mother of a young
man currently at Teesside university studying computer games art,
having done precursor courses at Gateshead college. According to
figures cited in the Select Committee’s report, the boxed and
digital UK video game retail market was worth almost
£3 billion in 2011, so I hope that he is going into a
thriving industry and will get a job after all his studies.</hs_Para>

games such as “Moshi Monsters” and
“RuneScape” have more than 100 million registered users
between them. With two out of every three households playing video
games—a number that I am sure will keep rising as they become an
ever more pervasive feature of smartphones—it is an industry
booming like never before, and it is crucial that our education system
is geared towards creating the pioneers of tomorrow, including my son,
I hope.</hs_Para>

that future games developers should be competent in maths and the
sciences, and I welcome the introduction of computing to the English
baccalaureate, to allow young people to become literate in coding from
an earlier age, but we must remember the important creative aspects of
the gaming industry such as drawing and design skills. Hence the title
of my son’s course: games art. Those skills have created such
British successes as “LittleBigPlanet”, “Tomb
Raider” and “Grand Theft Audio”, as we heard from
the Chairman of the Select Committee. The most recent edition of
“Grand Theft Auto” has sold more than 30 million copies
worldwide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000051">The
value of creative subjects lies not only directly in supporting the
creative industries, but in imparting the soft skills that benefit
young people for employment in other sectors. That is precisely what we
mean by a rounded education. As Josie Barnard, senior lecturer in
creative writing at Middlesex university, said in evidence to the
Select
Committee:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14021365000256" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000256">“Students

thinking.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14021365000052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000052">That
could be said of all creative subjects, from drama and art to music,
all of which involve problem solving and the importance of practice,
providing young people with the ability and confidence to overcome
situations in the workplace creatively.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021365000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000053">Despite all
that, reforms implemented by the Department for Education over the past
three years have made access to creative subjects harder for young
people. According to the Cultural Learning Alliance, the impact of
those changes is already being felt, with art GCSE take-up declining by
14% between 2010 and 2013, while geography take-up has risen by 15%. We
cannot fail to be cognisant of the effects that the reforms are
having.</hs_Para>

reforms involves changes to discounting codes, so that subjects such as
fine art and photography will be credited as just one GCSE rather than
two in the school league tables, even though they have different
teaching pathways and practices and distinct teacher specialisms. How
is that fair, when pupils are encouraged to take multiple sciences,
humanities or languages, with good reason? We would find it absurd to
restrict a child by discounting French and German or chemistry and
physics, so why do we accept discrimination against creative
subjects?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000055">The
impact of that discrimination is that schools are pressured to deter or
even prevent students from doing similar creative subjects, not to
impact their league table status. Alongside that has been the
introduction of the English baccalaureate as the gold standard
performance measure for schools, which has further compounded the focus
on the traditional subjects of maths, science and geography, rather
than on the creative subjects, to maintain or increase ranking in the
school league tables.</hs_Para>

prompts the question: why is the Department knowingly and deliberately
undermining creativity in our schools? That is not an unsubstantiated
criticism. Recent research by Ipsos MORI found that 27% of schools
withdrew non-EBacc subjects from their curriculum this academic year,
and that art was one of the most commonly withdrawn subjects, at
17%.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021365000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000058">Even the
Government’s own figures have shown that the take-up of creative
subjects decreased in 2012, with design and technology down by 5.1% and
art and design down by 2.4% from the previous academic year, while
others in the EBacc standard have increased. That decline has rightly
drawn criticism from the great and the good of the cultural world.

quoted as saying

Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins) some moments ago. This is not a
criticism of the National Youth Orchestra, as all it is doing is
recruiting the most talented kids, but this is a shocking indictment of

state school that is really good at music, drama or dance, but
regarding the majority, the figures speak for themselves. These
subjects are being dropped, and in the teaching profession numbers are
dropping in initial teacher training for arts and drama teachers. We
have to look at this long term. In the short term, we will not see any
damage, but if this trend continued in the long term, I definitely

of 600 in 2009, which is much fewer than the vast majority of other
subjects. To respond to the hon. Gentleman’s intervention, those
figures show the decline. This is further proof that the Government and
the Secretary of State for Education are marginalising creativity,
because they regard creative subjects as soft and do not value the
opportunities that studying these subjects can bring, and that is why I

UK’s creative industries, as we have heard, enjoy a pre-eminent
position in the world, we must not be complacent. For that reason, I
welcome many of the recommendations made by the Select Committee in its
excellent report. In particular, I welcome suggestions that the
Intellectual Property Office should become a more powerful champion for
the creative industries and play a greater role in educating consumers
on the value of intellectual property. The importance of a strong and
secure rights regime to the success of our creative industries should
not be underestimated. Where is the incentive, for example, for a
songwriter, composer, or software developer to create content if their
work can effectively be stolen online?</hs_Para>

the Government, in their response to the Committee’s report,
provide evidence that many people still remain unsure about the legal
status of the sites they access. I agree that that evidence is very
clear. In fact, Ofcom commissioned research on copyright infringement
that suggested that almost half of all users cannot confidently
identify whether the online content that they download, stream or share
is legal. In a YouGov survey last year, more than 2,000 UK adults were
asked to differentiate illegal websites from legitimate retail sites;
more than a third of parents were unable to spot pirate websites for
music, film and TV content.</hs_Para>

important work going on to improve awareness of the importance of IP. I
welcome the recent launch of a joint IPO and UK Music game, which
educates young people about copyright in a fun and interesting way. I
understand that the IPO’s karaoke shower is continuing its live
tour of the UK and promoting the importance of IP, and that is very
welcome. Through the Alliance for Intellectual Property, the industry
has developed a content map, which allows users to check which services
are licensed. Signposting and nudging consumers in the right direction
is sensible, but we need further action to ensure that our creators are
properly rewarded.</hs_Para>

positive steps forward, but education will not tackle illegal content
if it is not accompanied by mechanisms to ensure that consumers are
able to make the right choices about where to get their content.
Earlier this week, I and other colleagues here today were presented
with a proposal from PRS for Music for an IP traffic light system for
online content. That system would provide consumers with clear and
visible indicators that would allow them to determine easily whether a
website provided illegal or legal content before they entered the site.
The merits of such a system are clear, and importantly, it would tackle
the root of the problem, which is consumer confusion, while cutting off
the traffic to illegal sites, and the revenues collected from
advertising on them. In fact, in a survey by Harris, 91% of
online downloaders said that they would welcome the introduction of a
traffic light system to aid understanding of which sites were
legal.</hs_Para>

technology companies to work more closely with the creative industries
to find a way of delivering such a system. The company whiteBULLET,
which received a grant from the Intellectual Property Office, has being
doing good work in that space, but more support should be encouraged. A
signal today from our excellent Minister that he backs the principle
behind the traffic light system, along with a commitment to support it
going forward, would be welcome.</hs_Para>

Farrelly</B> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab):</Member> We are well used to
Governments of all colours responding to Select Committee
reports by saying that they take issue only with 10 out of 100 of the
Committee’s recommendations and agree with the remaining 90.
Usually, of course, those are the 90 places in which the report has
agreed with the Government in the first place. The Government’s
response to this report is firmly in that mould, and there is a general
feeling on the Committee that it is perhaps the most disappointing
response we have yet had from the Government to a major report. I do
not blame the Minister for that; we have love and respect for
him.</hs_Para>

the response shows a determination to plough on regardless. All too
often, such a determination is justified loosely by a wry reference to
a previous Administration, either because the recommendation has
cropped up before but was not, for whatever reason, pursued by the
previous Government—that is the case with the sensible proposal
to equalise penalties for copyright theft in the online and physical
worlds—or because, as in the case of the private copying
exception, the recommendation follows a course that was endorsed before
2010, but the then Government did not get round to implementing the
proposal.</hs_Para>

impression from the response is that it is the first time in the
history of the coalition Government that the previous Labour Government
have been accorded the accolade of omniscience. It appears, for the
first time, that we could do no policy wrong. But of course what is
right or wrong is what suits the present, not the past, not least when
digital technology and services are moving so quickly that they can
often render a policy redundant, harmful or both.</hs_Para>

contribution I want to focus on two areas that are central to our
inquiry: intellectual property and copyright, and education, which is
so important to the strength of the industries. That strength is
recognised worldwide. Just a fortnight ago I attended a discussion with
the CBI and its German counterpart, the Federation of German
Industries, which was held at the instigation of the German embassy.
The federation’s director-general, Dr Markus Kerber, made the
point that although Britain might be envious of Germany’s car
makers, its household electricals manufacturing and its engineering
prowess in general, we should realise that there is the same envy and
appreciation in Germany of our creative industries—music, film,
video games, and general digital and online UK consumer and business
services. Our report cites a legion of statistics about how important
the creative industries are to the economy, and ahead of this debate
such statistics have been coming in thick and fast. I will not repeat
them all, for lack of time.</hs_Para>

the submissions from the creative industries, during the inquiry and
since, is the importance of copyright and of having a strong framework
of intellectual property law and enforcement. That is the bedrock on
which those industries’ success stands, and if we tinker with
the framework rashly, we will weaken those foundations. Having heard
the evidence, our Committee, in the report, takes issue with the
direction of travel of the Hargreaves review in general—quite
frankly, its quantification of the so-called benefits of relaxing
copyright law simply vanish under the slightest scrutiny—and
questions the effect of the proposed copyright exceptions in
particular.</hs_Para>

conclusions, we agree with the creative industries that too often the
changes seem to be driven by the commercial interests of digital
technology giants. They were invariably American, and chief among them
was Google. That company, as we have heard from the Chairman of the
Committee, clearly does some good works. It has opened up the worldwide
web, through YouTube in particular, an outlet that is much used by new
talent. However, we must remember that like all those American digital
giants, it goes to extraordinary lengths to avoid UK taxes, and indeed
those of its own country and every other.</hs_Para>

response, the Government highlighted the role of the Under-Secretary of
State for Intellectual Property, Lord Younger, as the UK’s IP
champion and guardian of our creative interests. The hon. Member for
Selby and Ainsty (Nigel Adams) referred to the Prime Minister’s
new IP tsar—that is my description—the hon. Member for
Hove (Mike Weatherley). There is still no Liberal Democrat even on the

industry’s concern about that influence does not stop at our
shores. I will quote from a recent submission to us from the BPI, which
represents the music industry. It is worried not only about the
Government pressing ahead with their copyright exceptions in the UK,
but Europe doing so under the EU’s copyright directive. It
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14021365000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000260">“The
UK has, for reasons the BPI doesn’t fully understand, achieved
for itself a reputation in Europe as being hostile to copyright. This
is despite the UK being one of the European economies that gains most
from the creation of copyright content and has most to lose from
hostile attacks on the copyright
regime.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14021365000091" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000091">It

will conclude with a few words about education, skills and training. On
the education front, since 2010, there has been a history of repeated
corrective actions. Whenever a light bulb goes off in the Secretary of
State for Education’s head when he is in the bath, humming
“Jerusalem” and mentally chiselling his epitaph for when
he is in the Elysian fields, we have to take action to try to correct
what he is doing. I will give a recent example. It has not had much
coverage here, but it was important to those involved. It involves
Japanese, the language of manga comics and of “My Neighbor
Totoro”, which is perhaps the finest and most enchanting
children’s animation of recent times.</hs_Para>

surprised, Mr Benton, to learn that quite a number of primary schools
around the country teach Japanese. They tend to be clustered around
factories, such as Toyota in Derby, where there is a lot of
Japanese-related employment. Those schools do not have to teach
Japanese. It is not statutory, but voluntary, and they should be
commended for teaching any language. However, that was not good enough
for our Secretary of State for Education, who is always on manoeuvres.
Last year, he published a list of recommended languages for those
primary schools. It included, of course, the ancients, German and
French, but it did not include Japanese, so at a stroke, those schools
felt that they were being discouraged from teaching Japanese. There was
also the small matter of including Mandarin, and the resulting
diplomatic incident. After concerted pressure, the Secretary of State
was forced to change his mind. He may zig and occasionally zag, but he
often returns to his same true course; it is veritably an exercise in
constant vigilance.</hs_Para>

industries’ concern starts with the Secretary of State’s
focus on the STEM subjects; he gives little place to the arts. After
much concerted campaigning, 
<?notus-xml column=349?>the Government changed some of the plans for the curriculum. There have
been changes to the EBacc, but the continuing concern is that schools
will still encourage pupils to opt for what they believe they are being
measured on most strongly, and that de facto choice is being driven out
of the curriculum, leading to an ongoing downgrading, as we have heard,
of the arts, design and technology of computing in the state
curriculum, but not the private sector. The industry fears that that
will lead to further narrowing of the social background of those in our
creative industries, making it more dominant in the products of some of
our excellent private
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000095">I

Bray</B> (Ealing Central and Acton) (Con):</Member> The debate is
important. It is clear that we need this opportunity to discuss the
Government’s response to the Select Committee’s report on
the shape of the creative industries in the UK. Our recommendations
focus on how we can harness our extraordinary success and growth in the
field, while ensuring that that welcome development is not compromised
by any failure to tackle crucial issues such as copyright infringement.
The UK has cemented its reputation in recent years as a leading light
in the creative world, a place where talent in the creative industries
is nurtured and allowed to develop and thrive, backed up by
wide-ranging financial support and a sympathetic tax system. As a
result, we are a destination on the film-maker’s map. We are a
place to go to make films, where a director can come from abroad with
the smallest of crews, because he or she can call on superb local
technical talent to direct and produce, and where he or she can source
some of the finest acting and musical talent. All that creative skill,
know-how and nous boosts the Treasury’s coffers by nearly
£40 billion a year.</hs_ParaIndent>

and proud to have a fantastic example of the recent renewed success of
our creative economy on my doorstep in Ealing studios, the
world’s best known and oldest continuously running film
production studios. They showcase great British talent with, among
other things, some of the “Downton Abbey” sets and the
stunning Imaginarium studios, which use performance capture technology
under the direction of one of our best exports, Andy Serkis. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer recently paid a visit to see for himself
the success story sitting at the heart of Ealing. He was keen to find
out that the view of what the Treasury is doing is positive, and it is.
The message that he got was that the film tax relief, the extension of
which he announced in the autumn statement, is turning the UK into one
of the most popular film locations.</hs_Para>

Committee had in mind the question of what more might be done when we
took the fascinating evidence sessions for our report on the creative
economy. We carried out work here in London and on our Committee trip
to the United States. The aim throughout was to get to the bottom of
how we might best protect the livelihoods

the issues that we raised in our report stand out as being particularly
important for the growth of our creative industries. The most
significant, as other hon. Members have said, is the need to stand up
for intellectual property rights in an ever-changing and increasingly
challenging environment. The modern internet dictates most
people’s daily movements, and it is all about accessing as much
information as possible and sharing it as easily as possible. If proper
protections are not put in place for those who create, we will not get
much more creation. As those protections get weaker, the chances of
proper recompense diminish, which is a hardly an incentive to carry on
creating. A critical balance must be found and maintained between free
access and property rights, but the Government’s feedback on our

difficult subject provided the basis of our discussions when we visited
film studios in Los Angeles, which are also battling with issues
relating to copying and piracy. Whenever technology moves on, piracy
moves with it, and it is always a problem. Creators need certainty that
the Government will protect the principle that the right people must be
rewarded properly. The danger, as I think is apparent in the
Government’s response, is that standards may slip. For instance,
when we met the chief executive of Fox, he spoke about his concern over
plans to legalise the copying of audio-visual material on to other
formats, which is illegal at the moment but everyone does it.
Organisations such as Fox are well aware of that, but they choose to do
very little about it, essentially because it is too difficult. He
underlined the point that any change in the law that recognises the
right to copy would be a slippery slope. That law may be rarely
applied, but it serves an important purpose in limiting abuse.
Meanwhile, he and others are working on legal mechanisms that would
allow copying on to different formats but would still allow due
financial reward for the creators. Unfortunately, the
Government’s response suggests that they have no intention of
listening to that message.</hs_Para>

to those who worry about intellectual property rights. In providing
easy-to-access information for nothing, Google’s search engine
can take users through to sites that breach copyright regulations.
Google told us that, wherever possible, it takes such offending sites
down. It is hampered, however, by the many millions of pages that must
be trawled through. The BPI alone sends Google well in excess of 2
million notices per month relating to individual pages on sites guilty
of copyright infringement. Again, Google says that in many cases the
pages are contained on sites that otherwise host legal content, making
it difficult to take action. My view and that of my colleagues on the

produce that work. I have always been baffled that people do not equate
someone’s labour and input into artistic work with labour, time
and money spent on producing something more tangible and less easily
shared. IP and copyright are important. They allow musicians and

the environment that I have described, the loss of income

individual musician or performer. The Government will argue that
account is already taken of that in the purchase price, but the

introduction of an exception without fair compensation would leave UK
artists worse off than their counterparts in 25 other EU countries. All
25 EU countries that have introduced private copying exceptions have

have introduced exceptions to copyright granted under the European
copyright directive, because they have decided, in interpreting the
directive, that copying would result in economic harm to creators; so
why is the UK, which has by far the biggest music scene of all EU
countries, taking a different view, as flagged up by my hon. Friend the

is expected to come into force in the UK, although the Government
currently have no plans to delay implementation. Have the Government
received representations from UK collecting societies such as PPL, for
British musicians, and the British Equity Collecting Society, for
actors, which collect revenues from private copying levies in other
European countries that operate such systems? I am concerned that what

Music shows that consumers ascribe between 32% and 53% of the value of
an MP3 player to its ability to copy music. There is a need for balance
between protecting creators’ rights and not placing inhibitions

would be minimal. The Minister nods, so I expect that I shall hear that
again today when he makes his response. In their response to the
Committee 
<?notus-xml column=355?>inquiry, the Government said that the proposed private copying exception
will be the narrowest in Europe, but they have not provided sufficient
evidence to support that. I asked them in a written question last year

Government intend to make the narrowest exception. However, the draft
exception, which was open to technical review last summer, was as wide
as most European exceptions. If the exception is not seen before it is
laid before the House, there are concerns about whether the intention

Collins</B> (Folkestone and Hythe) (Con):</Member> It always seems when
we debate the creative economy that it falls at a good time, because
something interesting, exciting or dynamic is always happening. That is
particularly true now, as we have the BAFTA film awards, where we
anticipate British success, London fashion week, which has gone from
strength to strength as one of the major international fashion weeks,
and the BRIT awards, where British creativity and excellence is being
celebrated. In the nearly four years of this Parliament, we have had
many debates on the creative economy and industries. Warnings and
concerns have often been raised, some of which have been legitimate and
some less so, but we always have these debates in the context of
increasing strength, popularity and ingenuity in the creative
industries nationally, regionally and
locally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000131">This
debate has seen considerable discussion about copyright and IP, so I do
not intend to dwell on them too much. Instead, I want to discuss the
economic development of the creative industries and, in particular, the
role of tax incentives for investment and of clustering, which was
considered by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee in its
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000132">The
bedrock of the underlying strength of the UK’s creative
industries is Britain’s talent pool and unique heritage, as a
recognised leading performer in music, film, drama and arts over many
years. Why businesses are coming to this country and investing now has
much to do with the tax regime that has been put in place. The
production tax credits for film, video games and high-end television
drama are bringing production to the UK, and it would not be unfair to
say that those industries—in particular, film production and
television production—are booming in this country. That is not
only good for companies that work in that sector directly, but for the
great infrastructure—the great web of businesses—that
also rely on that investment. The post-production, including the sound
production, for a film shot at Pinewood studios would probably take
place in Soho and use the talents of a great number of people in that
production process, from technicians to musicians and artists, as well
as
actors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000133"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Vaizey" PimsId="4825" UID="14021365000315" xid="902" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000315">Mr

sort of investment that the film industry and production industry are
bringing to this country. Of 
<?notus-xml column=357?>course, as he will be aware, we anticipate success in the film awards
this year for “12 Years A Slave”, which of course is a
film that Britain can be proud of. It is based on a book published many
years ago by Penguin. Writers involved in the film industry are an
important part of the talent mix. Whether the writers of original
scripts or writers who adapt books that have previously been published,
they are all part of the same
ecosystem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000135">When
I worked in the adverting industry, I was always impressed that Soho
could draw on the talents of such a broad base of people, which is why
people from around the world come to be here. A film company seeking to
make a big feature film can come to the UK and know that we have the
facilities to make it and the talents to complete the job at every
level. That is what makes working in the creative industry in the UK so
exciting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000136">The
development of creative centres of excellence, not only in London but
around the country, is an important part of the ecology of the creative
economy and its future success. We do not want our creative industries
purely to be centred and located in the traditional centres of
excellence in London and the south-east; we want to have a strong
network of them right across the country. We can see that happening
now. Particularly with the investment in Media City at Salford Quays
and projects such as the Sharp Project, Manchester city council has
come together with members of the business community to create a hub
for creativity in that city. Such developments are helping to make
Manchester the fastest growing media city, or creative city, in Europe.
In Birmingham, there is an important and growing creative hub and
community in Digbeth, and in Belfast, around the Titanic centre and the
Titanic quarter, near the old Harland and Wolff shipyards, there is
another important centre of the creative economy.</hs_Para>

creative and digital clusters around the east Kent coast, particularly
in Folkestone, Ramsgate and Canterbury. In my constituency of
Folkestone and Hythe,we now have more than 200 businesses that can be
considered as part of the creative technology economy, according to the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s definition of that
economy. It is a rapidly growing sector employing a large number of
people, and that growth is only accelerating in the scope and range of
the tasks that the sector is undertaking, as well as in the number of

among 
<?notus-xml column=358?>them, but Folkestone is less than an hour by high-speed rail from one of

Chancellor of the Exchequer set out his ambition that London should be
the tech hub and creative hub for Europe. We are well on the way to
achieving that, if it has not already been achieved. One key aspect of
making that possible is attracting businesses, investment and talent.
We want to see as many people as possible born in Britain taking
advantage of the opportunities to work in such a centre of excellence.
We also need to ensure that we can bring in the best talent from around
the world. At the moment, the industry is growing apace, but we do not
currently have enough people to satisfy all the demand. Therefore,
having the right policy on visas that allows the most talented people
to work in the UK is a crucial issue facing
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000144">Another
element of that development is ensuring that young people have the
skills that they need and the understanding to take part in this
growing sector of the economy. The importance of young
people’s having the opportunity to develop their creative
talents at a young age, when at school, through music and the arts has
been discussed in this debate. I do not believe that the Secretary of
State for Education’s focus on some core academic subjects in
any way undermines that. People need good skills and qualifications in
those core subjects to do almost anything that they would seek to do;
that is an important part of a good education. There is no reason why
creativity and artistic talent and flair cannot form part of the
curriculum. Schools can do that. A longer school day will give schools
many more options in pursuing
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000145">There
are also uses for such talents in other sectors in the creative
industry, particularly for young people who might want to work in the
video game sector. We want a nation of young people who not only play
video games, which are increasingly made in this country and exported
around the world, but know how to build them. That is why bringing
computer science into the science curriculum, as an equal science
alongside chemistry, physics and biology, is an important step. We need
more young people learning computer coding at school, so they 
<?notus-xml column=359?>know the building blocks of computer programming and the creativity
needed to build websites, computer games and animation programmes. That

equal standing and equal weight, alongside other areas of the science

understanding that people are working there but never acquiring the
skills to take advantage of the jobs that are being created. It is very

important development that the Government are supporting through the

qualifications that they will gain, but do so in conjunction with
direct work experience as part of the ordinary school day. Studio
schools linked to creative businesses in the towns and cities that they

innovation, alongside having more of an emphasis on creativity and
creative skills as part of the school

final point that I want to add to the debate about IP is this. I
followed very closely the argument made by the hon. Member for Bristol
East (Kerry McCarthy) in the speech before mine. With regard to private
copying, we can look at Nick Hornby’s book “High
Fidelity” and the film made of it. In some ways, that book and 
<?notus-xml column=360?>that film celebrate private copying. That is an important part of the
story in the book. It is something that everyone has done or certainly
people who grew up with records and cassettes have done. Probably
everyone in this room has breached copyright law by copying a record on
to a cassette or by loading a CD into a computer and copying the
contents on to the hard drive. Each time, they are infringing
copyright. Some people may consider that once they have purchased an
item of music—once they have paid the fee for it—it is
theirs to enjoy personally. A change in the law that reflects something
that is already commonplace—that people already do—is not
necessarily something that we should be frightened
of.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000152">I
agree with the hon. Lady, though, that when we get to a position where
people can share music, in particular, or film or another form of
content through the cloud and potentially with a wider audience, they
are getting into a remit where they are no longer privately copying
but, either intentionally or unintentionally, distributing content.
That is a very different matter and something that we must be very

course, France has done what she describes for some time. Personally, I
think that it is a blunt tool and that the key is to ensure that we do
not, particularly as technology develops, make it easier for more
people to distribute things. We have talked about the role that search
engines play in taking people to sites where they can easily download

therefore right that we look at the various tools that exist in the
internet world and that make it easier for people to infringe
copyright. I believe that that is where our energies should lie. We

unintended consequence of allowing people to distribute music through

<?notus-xml column=361?>it is no longer wedded to the purchase of a television set. It also
throws up challenges about the way in which different television
companies—different content creators—distribute their
content and pay a fair licensing fee for the distribution of that
content through the multiple channels through which it is being
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000157">There
is a debate to be had between the cable and satellite broadcasters,
such as Sky and Virgin, and the old terrestrial television channels,
such as the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV, about how they agree on a fair
price to pay for distributing someone else’s content through
their channels. That is particularly necessary if distributing through
avenues where advertising is excluded or can easily be excluded by the
consumer. As people consume television in ways that are very different
from those in the past, we will have to debate the future of television
and how it is funded through different revenue streams, such as the
licence fee, advertising or subscription. I do not intend to go into
that issue at great length now, but it is one for the
future.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_13_PT_1/2704F645A5515149B1F754165746A316856433ED" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="13 February 2014">Thursday

Lazarowicz</B> (Edinburgh North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It is
a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs Osborne, particularly
as I want to make a few remarks with a Scottish dimension. It is also a
pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian
Collins). He emphasised the importance of the cultural and creative
industries, both to the entire UK and to different parts of the
country. I represent Edinburgh, and the subject is of particular
interest to me, my city and my constituency; Edinburgh North and Leith
can claim to be a creative hub in many ways, as many who have visited
it will
know.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000159">I
will not run through all the positive features of my constituency, but
I would like to mention a few. There have been a number of mentions of
“Grand Theft Auto”. Of course, that game comes out of the
Rockstar North stable, which is currently headquartered in my
constituency. It is perhaps a sign of the times that, as I understand
it, it is soon to move into the building occupied at the moment by The
Scotsman Publications Ltd. That is an interesting example of how the
emphasis in the different sections of the creative industry is moving
from older to newer
technologies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000160">I

my constituency, so I will take the opportunity to mention that. APS
Group Scotland has just won a prestigious award in the academic
category at the digital book awards 2014 in New York, ahead of several
hundred fellow international entrants. That is another example of
success in my constituency. Of course, my city also hosts the Edinburgh

Lazarowicz:</Member></B> The Minister clearly recognises that festival

but to the UK as a
whole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000163">The
main point that I want to make is that the report is about supporting
the creative economy in the United Kingdom. It is important to make
that point. Colleagues from outside Scotland will understand why the
possible implications of Scottish independence are on the minds 
<?notus-xml column=362?>of most Members from Scotland—indeed, it is also quite rightly on
the minds of many Members from the rest of the UK. One argument put
forward by the Scottish Government in support of independence is that
the cultural and creative sectors would gain more from independence
than from the status quo. The Scottish Government do support the
creative economy and cultural industries in many ways—I pay
tribute to that—but so did previous Scottish Governments under
different political leaderships.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021365000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000164">Local
authorities also recognise the incredible importance of the sector. My
local authority, the Labour-led Edinburgh council—I must be
fair: it is a Labour-Scottish National party council—has been
supporting the creative economy in many ways for many years. That
illustrates how the very success of the sector in Scotland underlines
the fact that we are better together. We can be successful because we
are part of the UK; we do not need an entirely separate state to
nurture such successful parts of our economy. They are important for
us, but they also benefit the economy of a much wider area and allow
the UK as a whole to support and draw on what we are doing in
Edinburgh, and in
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000165">Some
good examples of that are highlighted in the report, such as the
international activities of UK Trade &amp; Investment, which I am sure
the Minister will refer to in his closing comments. Scottish creative
activity can take part in that and draw from it. There is also support
at the UK level for film, which benefits Scotland directly and
indirectly. There is the very fact that we in Scotland have access to
the UK market. Of course, if Scotland were independent, no one is
suggesting that it would not be able to export from its creative
economy to the rest of the UK, but the strong foundation in a UK-wide
market, in which the cultural or creative economy is a major sector, is
something on which we can base our activity. That applies to other
sectors as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000166">We
also have the BBC. It is interesting to note that that is one of many
areas in which those supporting independence suggest that not much
would change; the BBC would just be slightly different. They are trying
to get the best of the UK while also going for
independence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000167">That
is my picture of the benefits for Scotland of being part of the UK, but
there are of course areas in which there could be improvements and more
could be done. Mention was made of the importance of broadband. The
Minister knows that I have for some time been pressing on the issue of
superfast broadband in my city of Edinburgh. It is ironic that,
apparently, part of Edinburgh city centre will not be included under
the arrangements for additional superfast broadband that were recently
announced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000168">The
hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe mentioned the advantages to his
area from being close to high-speed rail. I will not hold the Minister
and his Department responsible for High Speed 2, but I emphasise an
important point: if the entire UK is to draw on the benefits of
London’s role as a media centre for Europe, we need to have fast
and efficient transport from the entire UK to London in as many ways as
possible. That includes HS2 reaching Scotland and having direct
high-speed lines at the earliest possible
opportunity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000169">There
are so many clear benefits to Scotland’s creative economy, and
the rest of Scotland’s economy, being part of the UK. The
Government have produced a wide range of useful papers by independent
experts highlighting 
<?notus-xml column=363?>the benefits, for both Scotland and the rest of the UK, of
Scotland’s involvement in the UK. It would be useful if the
Minister’s Department were to consider something similar in the
field of the creative economy. I put that challenge to him today. I ask
him to think about it and to consider bringing forward such a report or
study, allowing it to feed into the debate taking place in
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000170">We
have some travel difficulties at the moment from parts of the south to
the north, but things are not too bad at the moment, so I hope that you
will excuse me, Mrs Osborne, if I leave the debate a few minutes before
the end of the sitting, if we go to full time. Having said that, I am
glad that I have been able to contribute to the debate with something
of a Scottish perspective on the creative economies of the entire
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14021365000278" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000278">3.14

congratulate the Select Committee and in particular its Chair, the hon.
Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale), on producing a thorough report on
an extremely important subject. He waxed lyrical about the great
quality of the British creative industries. Whether one looks at the
economic or the artistic dimension, we have much to be proud of. That
is one reason why Labour Members think it is extremely strange that the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills—not the
Department for Culture, Media and Sport, of course—has not
included the creative industries among its 11 priority
sectors. The creative industries certainly should be a priority
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000173">The
hon. Gentleman began with a little reference to the Olympic legacy and
the need to change the “no marketing rights” protocol to
allow people who were involved in the productions for the Olympic and
Paralympic games to exploit their success further. I agree with what he
said, and I have met representatives from PLASA. In addition, some of
my constituents were involved in the building and engineering aspects
of the games, and they have also been prevented from exploiting their
success to the full. That is a shame, and I hope that the Minister will
look again at the
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000174">In
this debate, a lot of time has been devoted to the important question
of copyright protection. I will not repeat in full the remarks I made
on Second Reading of the Intellectual Property Bill on 20 January, but
I want to highlight what I believe to be the priorities. I agree with
the Select Committee that the law is not enforced adequately, and I
agree with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for
Stoke—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I apologise; I meant
my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly). The
Annunciator has not been working properly, so I have had to try to
remember all my colleagues’ constituencies, and I clearly made a
mistake on this occasion. The point is that the Government do not seem
to understand that the copyright issue is urgent, and I am sorry to say
that the Minister’s response to the Select Committee report did
not demonstrate the necessary zing and zest. During this Parliament,
the total cost to the creative industries in our country of people
downloading films, television programmes and music will be some
£1 billion, which is why it is so important to crack on
energetically with tackling the problem.</hs_Para>

Committee highlighted the role of search engines and described
Google’s efforts as “derisorily ineffective”. From
the discussions I have had with both sides of the industry—the
publishers and the search engines—I believe that that is a
reasonable judgment. The Select Committee rightly states that the
Intellectual Property Office should be beefed-up to make it a champion
for intellectual property; at the moment, it really is not. My hon.
Friend the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) spoke eloquently
about the impact that a failure to get to grips with the matter will
have on individual artists, particularly when it comes to pay, and she
emphasised that many people in the sector have extremely low
incomes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000176">All
the comments made about the different exceptions and exemptions, and
the complexity of the issues, highlight the importance of dealing with
the issues through separate statutory instruments, so that we can look
at each matter individually. I hope that the Minister will discuss that
with his colleagues in BIS, who will probably take the lead on
producing those statutory instruments. I hope that the Government will
adopt a joined-up approach. Surely it must be possible to have a regime
that protects musicians but does not hinder, for example, scientific
researchers in epidemiology departments. Their needs are not the same
as the needs of people in the music
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000177">I
want to draw the attention of hon. Members to the remarks of Roly
Keating, the chief executive of the British Library, who has said that
the goal is to foster an environment that benefits researchers and
creators. That is absolutely right. Separating out the statutory
instruments and enabling us to look at them individually will give us a
much better chance of producing that
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000178">The
Committee also looked at funding and finance. It was right to identify
that issue, but I am not so confident that its solutions were
commensurate with the scale of the problem. Investors are not well
informed and do not have sufficient understanding of the value of
intangible assets in the sector. The difficulty in securing finance in
the sector was brought home to me by some film makers who came to my
constituency surgery in Bishop Auckland. The people of Bishop Auckland
are creative, imaginative and intelligent, but I have to say that the
arrival of film makers at my surgery was a surprise. The film that they
had made really could not be further from the “Grand Theft
Auto” model—they had made a rather lyrical and poetic
film about the lives of hill farmers. They are finding it extremely
difficult to move from the first stage, which is having 60
hours’ worth of film, to the next stage of producing something
that can be shown and watched. That highlighted for me the difficulties
that people in the sector have, particularly outside the M25.</hs_Para>

more deliberate and proactive approach from the Government in building
partnerships across sectors and skills. I was pleased to receive a
briefing from Creative England, and to see the work that it has done in
setting up accelerator programmes and commissioning, film innovation

bigger scale.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=365?>It has been particularly productive in finding ideas from research for
extremely interesting films and television programmes. A more active

agencies. He needs to talk more to his colleagues in other Whitehall
Departments, 
<?notus-xml column=366?>because those self-same big cities are seeing the biggest reductions in
funding in their local government settlements. The reduction in
Liverpool is somewhere between 30% and 60%, and the picture is similar
in Gateshead and Manchester. He should be less complacent about the
situation faced by the creative sectors beyond London. He cannot get
away from giving the impression that the Government are not developing
creative industries across the entire country because they are staying
within their comfort

taking arts subjects at GCSE. We must incorporate arts into the

quote a letter from my constituent, Jonathan Carney. He is head of

would all agree with that; none of us could have put it better. One
thing that is a bit worrying about the Secretary of State for
Education’s approach is that he seems to think that those
subjects are not intellectually rigorous. Has he not met an architect

intellectually rigorous as mathematics, Latin grammar and English
literature. It is patently absurd to think that rigour is only in one

of the fact that the music hubs are not making up for local

the Committee might have looked more at two issues. One is geographical
spread, which we have discussed; I will not go over that ground again.
The other is the importance of widening access and opportunities to

did not mention it, because then we could have had a contest to decide
in the course of this debate whether the offspring of Labour MPs are
more creative than the offspring of Conservative MPs. I was
particularly pleased to open a copy of my local newspaper

Howell)—Conservative—has won the first scholarship from

thing that all of us who have spoken in this debate can point to the
success of the creative industries. In the spirit of ecumenicalism that
often surrounds such debates, I point out that the creative industries
were identified by the former Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport, Lord Smith of Finsbury, who has managed to make an impact on
other areas of public policy since then. That was the process by which
the UK’s creative industries were put on the map. The process of
identifying a rather disparate sector as a coherent whole has been
followed by many other countries. Because of it, we can identify the
success of the creative industries: more than 1.5 million jobs, over 5%
of UK jobs; growth of 8.6% since 2011; a contribution of £70
billion to the UK economy.</hs_Para>

Government have built on the achievements of previous Governments in
supporting the creative industries. I was particularly pleased that we
have built on the success of the film tax credit, which now brings in
roughly £1 billion annually of inward investment in the UK, with
the introduction of television tax credit for high-end drama and a tax
credit for animation, which was responsible, incidentally, for more
than £200 million in inward investment in its first year. To
answer the first question posed, we are expecting an announcement
shortly from the European Commission on the video games tax credit. I
have been in discussions with the Commission for a time. It has a job
to do, and the Government, particularly the Conservatives, recognise
the importance of policing state aid and unfair and
anti-competitive Government subsidies to industries. It is
important that the Commission is convinced that a tax credit
is the right thing to do, but we have made great
progress and we expect an announcement
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000204">As
well as the tax credit support—I was delighted when the
Chancellor extended the film tax credit; it is particularly important
to support the visual effects industry, in which the UK is among the
leaders in the sector—there are other forms of support. I hear
what the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) asked about
whether the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills has designated the creative industries as a priority
sector. We are certainly the first Government to set up a sector
council for the creative industries; we now have a Creative Industries
Council, which is co-chaired by the Secretaries of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills and for Culture, Media and Sport

that council, which considers a range of issues including access to
finance, skills and exports, we have set up Creative England, which is
designed to support the creative industries outside London. We take
that support seriously. To respond to what my hon. Friend the Member

significant support from the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills in terms of money from the regional growth fund.</hs_Para>

Tech City, which acts as a beacon to show this country’s support
for the technology industry. It is important to recognise that Joanna
Shields, the chairman of Tech City, has made it an imperative to reach
out to all the other clusters across the UK, to bring them together as
a coherent whole and to ensure that other parts of the UK also benefit
from that extraordinary growth. I have written to the chairmen and
chief executives of local enterprise partnerships—many of them
already recognise this—to remind them of the importance of the
creative industries when setting out their strategies. Some of the city
deals, particularly the one in Brighton, have put the creative
industries centre stage. With Tim Davie from BBC Worldwide, I co-chair
UK Trade &amp; Investment’s sector advisory group, which works
to help the export of our successful creative industries and to attract
inward investment. There is a hugely successful story to tell about

is also important to stress that we should include the Arts Council in
the mix. The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland talked earlier about the
need to support people in employment. The Arts Council has set up a
£15 million fund to fund apprenticeships in the creative

places fund to help fund the arts in areas where they have previously
been under-represented. The agenda is wide, but there is a huge range

changes to the copyright regime. As the Minister with responsibility
for the creative industries, I understand the concern of many in the
creative industries about copyright enforcement. I have tried to bring
together the different sides of the debate—the rights holders,
the internet service providers and the search engines. We take a wide
range of action. Let us not forget that existing law has been used
effectively by rights holders to seek and obtain injunctions against
some of the biggest sites that exist for the sole purpose of
distributing infringing material. We also work with City of London
police and credit card companies to take down payment sites, and we

industry initiative, not only because we hope it may be up and running
before the end of the year, but because it requires a partnership
between both sides of the debate, and because it brings important
flexibility to make it possible to adapt. I suspect that it will be
easier to adapt the system as technology changes.</hs_Para>

Members will know that I sought out the job as culture spokesman in
opposition and was lucky enough to be appointed Minister when we came
into office. I passionately support the arts and would be concerned if
I thought that some of what people allege about the state of the arts
in schools was genuine. The Secretary of State for Education is a
fantastic supporter of the arts. I have no doubt about that, and I work
closely with him, as I have done for several years. One of the first
things that we did was jointly to commission Darren Henley to look at
music education, to secure the ring-fenced funding of music education
services at a time when most funding was being devolved to schools, and
when schools were becoming academies, as they still are. I felt that it
was important to take that strong position.</hs_Para>

services to change, which is why we re-christened them music hubs.
Obviously, more has to be done than simply change the name. We want
music organisations—orchestras, and so on—to be genuine
partners with local authority music services and for music services to
be able to call on the talents of a wide range of people who deliver
music in different ways in any local area. That is why we introduced
the qualified music educator status, to allow people who teach music
but are not formally teachers to be recognised for their talents and
skills. And that is why we extended the In Harmony programme, increased
its funding and integrated it into a wider national music
plan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000224">We
are at the beginning of this journey. Nobody is expecting music hubs to
spring fully formed from this policy change. We have achieved two
important things: we have ring-fenced the money and established the
principle that music organisations and music services should be
partners. A third important principle is that the money is contestable;
no one local music service or local authority should be
complacent—a word that has been used in this debate in other
contexts—and simply expect to receive that money every three
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021365000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000225"><B><Member ContinuationText="Angie Bray" PimsId="5526" UID="14021365000342" xid="1069" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/halltext/140213h0001.htm#14021365000342">Angie

That is absolutely brilliant. Again, we tend always to look at what we
say is going wrong and not good enough and often fail to recognise what
is right in front of us, which is that tens of thousands of our young
people are brilliant musicians enjoying a brilliant music education.
Funnily enough, I was lucky to visit Twyford school with Howard Goodall

been written off, as have their life chances. He has determined to

about all this. We are not saying that it is a competition or a matter
of either/or. The fact is that there are unintended
consequences to the baccalaureate. The number of art teachers being
trained has dropped by 14%. The discount codes are deterring young
people from taking more than one GCSE in arts subjects.
This has to be looked at. The reality is there in black and

Government recognise the differences between artistic disciplines, and
it is important to get it across that decisions on discount codes are
made on the basis of a detailed scrutiny of the exam specifications,
rather than on a general view of the subjects concerned. Where
substantial overlap between two specifications exists, the subjects
will be discounted. Those decisions can be reviewed and are being
reviewed in the case of drama and dance. I emphasise again the
Department for Education’s continued support for music and dance
schemes, which equates to some £18 million-worth of bursaries
over the next three years, which is a huge amount of support. The
Department has also listened to concerns about the EBacc and that is
why we now have the new progress 8 measure, which allows schools to
have their teaching of arts subjects taken into account when measuring
their progress and

ceramics in the statistics, which is a Stoke argument. When examining
the statistics, we found that, of the £36 billion,
£20 billion was attributed to the so-called fashion
industry, so I asked the Chairman of the Committee why we were
discussing music and film, but not clothes. It seems that the
£20 billion attributed to the fashion industries includes pretty
much everything that goes by the name of clothing on the high street,

published in December 2013, some 15.5 million people are playing sport

shows a strong recovery on the last six months and a sustained growth a
year after the games. As we said in June, bad winter weather during

the motivation. We have also seen record numbers of disabled people
playing sport—1.67 million people aged 16 years and over with a
long-term limiting illness or disability—and more people from
black and minority ethnic (BME) communities participating than ever
before—2.7 million). The number of women playing sport has also
increased by 55,000 over the last six

Children’s social work is one of the most demanding careers a
person can pursue, with the power to transform the lives of deeply
disadvantaged children. It requires a unique and highly complex set of
skills and knowledge. When those skills and that knowledge are not

too many universities is not fit for purpose. He concludes that entry

and children; a sound knowledge of the evidence base around parental
capacity and effective intervention including how to prepare a child to
move home, either in an emergency or to a new permanent family;
management of risk; the legal framework; and child development. To
learn how to apply this knowledge in practice, training must always

number of entrants and worryingly low entry standards: less than a

provision of late night refreshment and regulated entertainment in
England and Wales, and is primarily administered by local authorities,
acting in their capacity as licensing authorities. Licensing fees are

fee levels were set in 2005 and apply nationally. They have not been
adjusted since—other than for the introduction of new fees for
new processes. The Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011
amended the 2003 Act to introduce a power for the Home Secretary to
prescribe in regulations that in future fee levels should be set by
individual licensing authorities on a cost-recovery basis. We consider

also seeks views on how best to provide guidance to licensing
authorities so as to ensure that unjustifiably high costs and

laid a statement to respond to the police arbitration tribunal’s
findings on all recommendations in the final report of Tom
Winsor’s independent review of police officer and staff
remuneration and conditions. The tribunal had not been able to reach a
conclusion on measures to introduce compulsory severance, and I
therefore referred the matter back to the Police Negotiating Board. The
Police Negotiating Board was not able to reach agreement on compulsory
severance, nor on the management of officers on restricted duties and
these matters were referred to the police arbitration tribunal in
November
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14021363000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/wmstext/140213m0001.htm#14021363000190">The

received on 20 December. The tribunal considered six recommendations

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Jeremy
Wright):</Member></B> I am today announcing the Government plan to
commence reforms to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 on 10
March 2014. These reforms are important in supporting our wider agenda
on transforming rehabilitation. We know that obtaining employment can
be an important factor in reducing reoffending and these reforms will
help more people who have shown that they have put their offending 
<?notus-xml column=81?>behaviour behind them to get back into productive work. The provisions
will reduce the period of time during which some offenders may have to
disclose their convictions to prospective employers—the
rehabilitation period. I should emphasise, however, that public
protection will not be compromised. It will remain the case that fuller
disclosure of cautions and convictions will continue to apply to a
range of sensitive occupations and activities. In addition, the most
serious convictions will remain subject to disclosure for any
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14021363000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/wmstext/140213m0001.htm#14021363000197">The
measures being commenced are contained in sections 139 and 141 and
schedule 25 to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders
Act 2012. These reforms shorten the rehabilitation periods for most
convictions, after which they are considered to be
“spent” and need no longer be disclosed for most
purposes. The changes also extend the scope of the 1974 Act as it
applies in England and Wales so that custodial sentences of up to, and
including, 48 months may become spent. Previously the longest custodial
sentence which could become spent was 30 months. The reforms will act
retrospectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14021363000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/wmstext/140213m0001.htm#14021363000198">These
amendments to the 1974 Act apply in England and Wales only and impact
on criminal conviction certificates, which show an individual’s
unspent convictions. section 112 of the Police Act 1997 governs the
issue of these certificates and it is also being commenced
in  
<?notus-xml column=82?>England and Wales on 10 March to ensure that accurate criminal
convictions certificates are available reflecting the revised
rehabilitation periods in this
jurisdiction.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14021363000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140213/wmstext/140213m0001.htm#14021363000199">The

fully section 56 of the Data Protection Act 1998, the only provision in

has been set at £500 a week for couples (with or without
children) and single parent households, with a lower cap of £350

sales of ultra-low emission vehicles over the period, relying on early
product launches and relatively fast consumer acceptance of new
technologies. Sales of ULEVs have been increasing year on year, but at
a slower rate than originally anticipated. We are currently projecting
to spend c.£230 million over the period. Grant uptake in 2013

Highways Agency is proactive in measuring and managing supplier
performance at contract level. The specifics of performance management
differ across the contract portfolio but by using a common umbrella
framework (the Motivating Success Toolkit—MST) the agency is
able to ensure that there is a consistent focus on performance. The MST
is weighted appropriately to reflect the needs of different types of
contract—and is designed to assess the performance of the
service provider against contract requirements and assess performance
of providers across the strategic road network. In addition, it can
also assess the effectiveness of the providers' quality management
processes and be used to identify opportunities for continuous
improvement. When performance failures are identified, corrective
actions are agreed and progressed to completion. If the providers
persistently fail to deliver on corrective actions they can have work
taken away from them. If performance does not improve this can lead to
termination of the contract. In addition, the HA undertakes audits of
each supplier and has an invoice checking procedure in
place.</hs_Para></entry></row>

Government's property estate was under-used and under-occupied. Since
2010 this Government has been working to rationalise its estate and
dispose of unnecessary properties. We have got out of hundreds of
properties and now publish more details than ever before on how
Departments are using their buildings. The Government has exited over
1.8 million square metres between May 2010 and December 2013, reducing
the size of its mandated estate by around 17%. Our work to rationalise
the Government's property estate resulted in the disposal of 401
buildings in 2012-13, saving the taxpayer £620 million last year
alone.</hs_Para>

there had been a 49% reduction in anti-social “incidents of

the Strength campaign, where retailers voluntarily stopped selling
high-strength alcohol. That is why we are challenging industry to raise

best from a diverse workforce in its day to day activity. While there
are individuals who have particular responsibility for promoting
equality and diversity, this is in addition to their other duties. The
Department is unable to break down figures to show how much was spent
on the equality and diversity aspect of their role. On 1 April 2013,
the Government Equalities Office 
<?notus-xml column=794?>(GEO) joined DCMS under a Machinery of Government transfer. The
Government Equalities Office works to take action on the Government's
commitment to remove barriers to equality and help to build a fairer
society, leading on issues relating to women, sexual orientation and
transgender equalities. In this broader sense the whole of the staff of
GEO and its programme spend is devoted to promoting equality and

Truss:</Member></B> Schools remain legally required to provide a daily
act of worship for all registered pupils up to age 18. Some maintained
schools and academies serve communities where the majority of pupils
are of a religion other than Christian. In this situation, a maintained
school can apply to the local Standing Advisory Council on Religious
Education (SACRE) for a determination which allows the school to
provide collective worship based on a non-Christian religion. We do not
collect data on these applications or specify criteria that SACREs
should use in making decisions. Academies in this situation would apply
to the Secretary of State, and no applications have been
received.</hs_Para>

Submarine Enterprise Performance Programme efficiency measures,
indicate that we remain within the 2006 White Paper estimates of
£11 billion-£14 billion (at 2006-07 prices) for the
Successor platform costs (assuming a four boat fleet). This equates to
some £25 billion at out-turn

Department's budget beyond 2015-16 has not been agreed and will be
subject to consultation in the next spending review. Additionally,
estimates on individual projects are subject to ongoing negotiations
with industry. Therefore, I am withholding details of the proposed
spending and annualised percentages at project level, as to release
this information would be likely to impact upon the formulation of
Government policy and future negotiations with industry. The Department
annually publishes detail on equipment expenditure for the next 10
years in the Defence Equipment Plan. The latest version was published
in 2012 (DMC00575 01-13) and I expect to publish the 2013 version in
the near future.</hs_Para>
