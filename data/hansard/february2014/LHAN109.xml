2014 provides an opportunity for greater stability in the DRC. We
encourage the Government of the DRC to deliver on their commitments

disarmament of militia groups, security sector reform and an elections

McConnell of Glenscorrodale (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, on the
disarmament of militias, it is now nearly 12 months since
the peace, security and co-operation framework was signed by the 11
countries of the region. Although there has been some success against
the M23 armed group, other groups, including the FDLR, those
responsible for the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago, are still
operating in the eastern DRC. Will the UK use its seat on the UN
Security Council to press for continued action on this front to create
conditions for development that require the removal of these armed
groups?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="1402031000175" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000175">Baroness

of the conditions of the peace, security and co-operation framework,
signed by 11 countries including the DRC and Rwanda and other countries
in the region as well as the African Union and the UN, was about these
militia groups laying down their arms. The M23 laying down arms at the
back-end of last year is a hopeful step, but we continue to press
countries and individual groups, including those linked to the FDLR, to
move towards disarmament and

that there are now some 2.9 million people displaced in the DRC, 60% of
them in the North Kivu and South Kivu areas, where the M23 was most
active? Half of those displaced people are children. Does the Minister
therefore view with consternation the report from the United Nations
group of experts that the M23 is continuing to recruit fighters in
Rwanda and that sanctioned M23 leaders are moving freely in Uganda? Has
she seen Navi Pillay’s report accusing both countries of hosting
some of the most serious perpetrators of human rights violations in the

Warsi:</Member></B> The noble Lord will take some comfort from the fact
that the Minister for Africa, my honourable friend Mr Simmonds, will be
landing in the DRC in about two hours. Part of his role is to look at
these particular camps. The noble Lord will be aware that
DDR—disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, which is
effectively bringing these fighters back into the mainstream—has
happened in the DRC, predominately in relation to foreign fighters, but
there is not a particular programme, or a detailed enough programme, in
relation to Congolese fighters who have laid down their arms. These are
matters upon which my honourable friend is hoping to make progress over
the next two days. I can issue a statement or put a letter in the House

Chidgey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the news that the Government of
the DRC are to postpone—basically, to suspend—a
controversial oil extraction bill is welcome news. However, will the
Government support the NGOs, other donors and local MPs in using this
delay to press for the inclusion of strong transparency measures to
root out corruption and to ensure that the country’s oil wealth
goes towards helping the very poor in the Congo rather than
disappearing offshore in dodgy deals through companies such as
Nessergy, with links to the controversial businessman Dan

right: corruption means not only that the wealth of the country does
not help the poorest but that money earned from minerals in that
country serves to finance conflict and abuses of human rights. That is
why we have been pushing both for UK businesses engaged in that country
to make sure that they follow the OECD guidelines and for the DRC to
make progress on the EITI, the extractive industries transparency
initiative. The noble Lord may be aware that its candidate status was
suspended and we hope that it will be restarted. We also hope that the

out a pupil premium review. Schools must publish online details of what

as a matter of policy that prescription from the centre has not worked.
The evidence of the performance of our school system over the past
15 years speaks for itself. However, we believe, as we have
debated many times in this House, that PSHE and programmes such as
first aid are incredibly important, and we are sending out messages as
far as we can. We have a new PSHE review and we are engaging with
bodies such as the PSHE Association to get the message out to all

developing a better vision for school nurses. There are 1,300 school
nurses but all schools have access to a much wider range of health
professionals who may be appropriate depending the particular
conditions. It may be the school nurse’s job to be the bridge
between that wider range. We are conscious that, with the new medical

will need to watch carefully to ensure that there is capacity in place

Empey (UUP):</Member></B> My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is
very simple. Basically, Members will recall that in 1998, in the Act
that implemented the Belfast agreement, a rather complicated form of
mandatory coalition Government was introduced to provide for the return
of devolution to Northern Ireland. Let me say at once that, while it is
a complicated and unusual system, I support that system and that
nothing in the amendment before the House alters it 
<?notus-xml column=13?>in any way at all. In other words, if parties achieve at the election
sufficient support to entitle them to sit in the Northern Ireland
Executive and exercise executive powers and occupy ministries, then
that is entirely a matter for them. At present, if a party decides not
to sit in the Executive or does not have sufficient numbers to qualify
for a seat in the Executive, it has the option either of not taking its
seat in the Executive or of remaining on the Back Benches. However, the
missing link here is that those who are not in the Executive have no
status as regards the Assembly’s
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:10:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1402031000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000069">Amendment 1 seeks to
give the option to allow the Assembly, should it so wish, to apply to
the Secretary of State, who would respond. That would allow the
Assembly to draw up Standing Orders, under characteristics that she
would determine, which would provide parties that wish to seek
opposition status with the opportunity to seek that status from the
Speaker. That would give people who took that position basic rights
such as speaking rights, where the Speaker would call a member of the
Opposition in response to a government amendment or a government
proposal, but in proportion to the size of the parties. It would give
the opposition the power to have supply day debates, which I think
would be accepted in any reasonable jurisdiction. Finally, it would
ensure that someone not from a Government-supporting party chaired the
Public Accounts Committee and occupied the deputy chair of that
committee<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:11:18"></hs_TimeCode>. We
must be the only jurisdiction in these islands where government party
representatives also chair the Public Accounts Committee; that is a
severe weakness of our current
system<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:11:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000070">Much
has been made of the Assembly perhaps already having sufficient powers
to create an Opposition, and there is no doubt that there are Standing
Orders that the Assembly could make which could provide for such a
facility. However, what the Assembly gives, the Assembly can take away.
The main purpose of doing this through London is to ensure the
independence of that Opposition and that it is not dependent on the
good will of whichever parties happen to dominate the Assembly at any
point in time, so that it does not have to rely on other parties for
its supply days, speaking rights or any resources that might be made
available. That would be one small step on the road to a more normal
political set of arrangements. Given the fact that the vast majority of
the 108 MLAs in the Stormont Assembly are supporters of the Government
in one form or another, we do not believe that this is anything but a
minor step in the road to making the Executive more accountable for
their actions or
inactions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000071">Some
folk have said, “Would we be interfering in any way with the
current arrangements and the rights and entitlements of parties under
the Belfast agreement?”. The answer is an emphatic no. The time
is neither right nor appropriate for any significant change in how the
Executive are constructed, albeit I am sure that many of us wish to
look forward to a day when we have a more normal arrangement for a
Government, such as we have in Scotland or Wales. However, we are not
there and perhaps will not get there during the lifetimes of most of us
in this Chamber. We can, however, make one small step to give those who
do not occupy positions in the Government the opportunity to hold 
<?notus-xml column=14?>that Government to account. No rights would be removed; I see this as an
additional right that currently does not
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:13:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000072">When
this amendment was tabled a number of comments were made at home in the
local press. I must say that I have not yet heard anybody come out and
say that they are opposed to the concept of an Opposition. It is a very
hard thing to stand against. I noticed in the Irish news that on 24
January, a spokesman for the Social Democratic and Labour Party said
that the SDLP believes that the British Government should make
provision for legislation for opposition in the next mandate in a way
that protects partnership working under d’Hondt and is in line
with the spirit of the Good Friday agreement. That is precisely what
this amendment is designed to achieve, and it sums up clearly exactly
what I and my colleagues wish to
see<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:14:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1402031000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000156">3.15

is perfectly clear that any changes that one makes or proposes in
relation to arrangements for the governance of Northern Ireland are
very sensitive. For that reason, the amendment makes it clear that,
while provision might be made, the actual application and trigger for
its implementation would have to come from the Assembly itself. In
other words, although it could legally do so, there would be no
question of this Parliament imposing this change without the
Assembly’s consent.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:15:39"></hs_TimeCode>Therefore, to
reassure the many people who are mindful of the Sewel convention in
devolved matters—and much has been heard of it in terms of
Scotland and elsewhere—the convention is not offended by my
proposal for two reasons. First, matters pertaining to the Assembly and
the Executive Committee of the Assembly are actually excepted matters.
Secondly, and more importantly, the fact that the Assembly itself would
have to trigger a request, which could be triggered only by
cross-community consent, would mean that the convention would not be
offended<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:16:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000074">For
those reasons, I believe that the time is right; we have,
unfortunately, been going through a period of great stalemate. Looking
to the years ahead, a modest move such as this, which does not offend
anybody’s rights or require any imposition, would be the minimum
movement that most people would expect 16 years after the agreement was
reached. Those of us who were involved in negotiating that
agreement—there are a number in the Chamber today—know
that nobody foresaw that, so many years ahead, we would still not be
further down the road to a more normal political situation than we are.
However, if the system is made more accountable and it is not possible
for parties simply to stall things, in the sure and certain knowledge
that they control 95% of the membership of the Assembly, giving an
opportunity for an opposition and accountability to take root
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:15:39"></hs_TimeCode>can only have a

Lexden (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I attached my name to this
important amendment readily and enthusiastically. I very much agree
with my noble friend Lord Empey that a firm, statutory basis should be
provided through this Bill for the creation of a formal Opposition with

<?notus-xml column=15?>the appropriate rights and privileges if and when the Northern Ireland
Assembly should wish to bring it into being. This proposal has been
formulated by my noble friend, drawing on his deep knowledge of the
Assembly in which he served and of the Executive, of which he was a
distinguished Member. It has attracted widespread interest and no small
measure of support in Northern Ireland, as recent comments in the
Ulster press have indicated, comments to which my noble friend has
referred. Within the Assembly itself, advocates of the need for an
Opposition are making themselves increasingly heard. They do not
believe that the Assembly should remain in perpetuity the only
legislature in these islands in which the Government face no Official
Opposition who could hold them publicly to
account<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:19:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Conservative and Unionist, I am convinced that my noble friend’s
proposal should, through his amendment, be incorporated into this Bill.
Over the years, I have always been inclined to back forward-looking
measures proposed by members of the Ulster Unionist Party, with which
my party was closely allied for the best part of 100 years until the
relationship broke down after
1972<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:19:26"></hs_TimeCode>. My noble
friend, as chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party, has done much to
encourage closer contact with Conservatives once again. Indeed, at the
previous general election, Conservatives and Ulster Unionists in
Northern Ireland stood on a common platform. It included the following
statement:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1402031000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000144">“Over

has not been brought forward in any narrow party spirit. My noble
friend has made clear that it rests on a conviction that the prospects
of political progress would be assisted in the longer term if the
Northern Ireland Assembly had available to it the power to establish an
Official Opposition on the basis of primary legislation passed in this
Parliament. As he said, that would give any Opposition who are called
formally into existence a greater independence and strength than one
established under the Assembly’s current standing orders, as is
perfectly
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:20:49"></hs_TimeCode>. All
the central elements of the Assembly, including the arrangements for
the appointment of chairmen and deputy chairmen, and for the modus
operandi of the committees themselves are enshrined in schedules to the
Northern Ireland Act 1998. The role and functions of an Official
Opposition are obviously no less important. They, too, should rest on a

interest. I hope that it will attract support throughout the House as a

the government and law-making processes of Northern Ireland without in
any way dictating to the Assembly or attempting to impose a timetable
for change upon it. Should we not seek to give the Assembly

has often reminded us. Here, in this amendment, lies an opportunity to
offer a view on a crucial aspect of Northern Ireland’s political
future and to provide the means by which progress towards it could be
achieved. When my noble friend on the Front Bench comes to reply to the

notion put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Empey, my noble friend Lord
Lexden and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, that the question of
opposition within the Northern Ireland Assembly requires
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:24:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000081">Indeed,
if one looks back at the period up until the breakdown of Stormont, I
think it is true that in the whole of that period only one person
occupied an executive position who was not a member of the Ulster
Unionist Party. That was the right honourable David Bleakley from the
Northern Ireland Labour Party, who was for six months the Minister of
Community Relations in the very late stages of that unionist
Administration. That represents the problem. Those who wanted to be in
government were denied that opportunity and were kept in permanent
opposition. This was very much to the fore in the minds of everyone
during the negotiations on the Good Friday agreement—how to make
sure that those who wanted to be in government but had a permanent
minority status could participate in the Government and share
responsibility. It was not in the minds of anyone at that time to
insist that people had to be in government; the problem was the
blockage as regards getting into
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000082">There
were many other things that were not clear in the minds of some of
those involved. For example, I think it is probably the case—I
see that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, is not yet in his
place—that the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party and of
the SDLP, which were the two largest parties within unionism and
nationalism, scarcely at that time conceived that they might not
continue to be the two largest parties. Of course, the situation
changed dramatically. When the new institutions were constructed,
instead of bringing people together across the community divide, they
promoted strength within the two sections of the community. Not only
did they not provide for an official status for an opposition but they
did not 
<?notus-xml column=17?>provide for a proper status for those who did not want to describe
themselves as unionists and nationalists. Instead
of the cross-community voting system being as I and my colleagues tried
to promote, with a need for a two-thirds majority to form an Executive,
it was decided that they needed a majority within both the unionist and
nationalist communities and a majority of the whole. That made it very
difficult for people to appeal across the community divide and to have
a proper and reasonable status for those who did not want to consider
themselves either unionist or nationalist. Once one moved down that
road one created a real problem for any formal opposition
status<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:26:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord Empey, said about the absence of an Official Opposition being a
problem is true. He is right to raise it and I support the fact that he
has raised it. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will be able to
indicate to us that the Government will take this matter seriously as
we go through the remaining stages of the Bill. Does this way of
addressing the problem achieve what the noble Lord, Lord Empey, and his
colleagues want? First, the noble Lord has rightly said that it would
be perfectly possible under standing order arrangements to be made in
the Assembly for there to be a position for the Opposition. That is the
situation in this Parliament and it would be perfectly possible.
However, he made the point that the two largest parties as they are at
present probably have little motivation to support such a thing. That
is quite true but that is also true of the amendment before us as it
requires the two largest parties with the majority in the Assembly to
sign up for this. It does not give the Secretary of State the
opportunity to push it. I understand why the noble Lord does not want
in any sense to suggest that there should be imposition from outside.
The people of Ireland, north and south, respond particularly badly to
being pushed in any direction at all, even one they would agree with if
left to themselves. Nevertheless, the great vulnerability of the
proposition he puts forward is that it does not take us much forward
beyond what the Assembly could do itself if it chose to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:27:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the Alliance Party tried to play a role as an Opposition when they
did not have sufficient support to get a ministerial position.
Undoubtedly, they felt that the speeches they made and the stances they
took were constructive. However, the observation they made is exactly
the one that the noble Lord, Lord Empey, makes—that there is no
official position and that is a substantial weakness. Would it be
possible for a party at present simply to go into opposition? Yes, it
would. It simply means that during the running of d’Hondt the
nominating officer of a particular political party does not put a name
forward. The party is then automatically not in the Executive and
therefore is in opposition. The problem is that it would not have any

was encouraged, as I know the noble Lord, Lord Empey, was encouraged,
by the editorial in the <I>Irish News</I> as it suggested that not only
had we presently a cross-community basis for government but that it was
possible that we might have a cross-community basis for opposition. The
SDLP and the Ulster Unionists might come together on this and make a
presentation 
<?notus-xml column=18?>to the Assembly that said, “Together, we
think it would be more constructive for us to go into
opposition”. There is a bit of a tendency in Northern Ireland to
say that the Government over here should sort out the problem. However,
I would urge that not only do my noble friend and Her Majesty’s
Government here take this issue seriously, but the noble Lord, Lord
Empey, and his colleagues in the Ulster Unionist Party should take it
seriously in discussions with the SDLP. A cross-community presentation
that said, “Let’s have an opposition and we will form
that together by<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:30:45"></hs_TimeCode>

principle the noble Lord is right. The Belfast agreement was a good

the right direction or show that something further is necessary. I hope
that my noble friend, the Secretary of State and others in the

improve the performance of devolution in Northern Ireland, it would be
a mistake to assume it is a panacea. However, that system could provide
for both an Executive and an official loyal Opposition outside

are people here who know better than me and who have more experience of
the situation in which the 1998 agreement came about. It divided a
society. As was so eloquently put by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice,
the problem of a permanent Opposition was that it never had a chance of

June 2013, the Assembly and Executive Review Committee concluded that
it was possible to grant informal recognition to non-executive parties
in the Assembly on a proportional basis. As has been mentioned, this
could be achieved through additional speaking rights, recognition of
non-executive status in the order of speaking and the allocation of
time for non-executive party business. All this lies within the purview
of the Assembly; it requires no legislation in Westminster. There has
been a widespread desire expressed to see a situation such as this come
about. Surely the true test will be when the Assembly brings forward a
unanimous recommendation along these lines and takes action within the
powers that it already
has<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>. The

commensurate with the fundamental principle of inclusivity.
Furthermore, there is a broad consensus about giving non-executive
parties informal recognition. This could be given by the Assembly
itself. It would have much more power behind it if it came about in
that way. There does not appear to be a full consensus among MLAs about
reforming the structure to create an Official Opposition. It is
essential that all the structures within the Assembly operate in an
inclusive manner and are supported by broad cross-party consensus. The
question is: do these conditions exist or not? It is the responsibility

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may first respond to the noble
Lord, Lord Alderdice. He made the point that he felt the amendment
would not achieve the purpose being advocated for it. I understand
that, but there is a clash between the issue of imposition and the
issue of consent. While the mandatory coalition has been set out in
statute, during those negotiations we did not set out in statute
proposals for an Opposition because, to be honest, the main objective
at the time was to get agreement on devolution. That was seen to be the
way we could move on from where we were, in those bad dark days, to
where we wanted to be. But, as the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, has just
said, it is a

that my noble friend Lord Lexden is not, totally wedded to the language
of the amendment, but perhaps I can elaborate on why we feel that
something needs to be done here as opposed to leaving it to Belfast
alone. The reason is simple: we have to remove ourselves from the
current political arrangements and look ahead a number of years. If we
are going to establish an institution or see it modified, we cannot
confine ourselves to the current politics; we have to look at the long
term. I will tell the Committee, and in particular the noble Lord, Lord
McAvoy, why we feel it is necessary to have a dimension of this set out
here. First, we happen to have a legislative vehicle in front of us,
and that does not often occur. The second reason is this. The noble
Lord, Lord Browne, mentioned that the First Minister had said that he
would be happy to facilitate any party at Stormont that wished to take
up the opposition role. However, that is not the point I am getting at
because it would apply only if a particular party, at this point in
time, wanted to fill that role. Of course it would be up to 
any party to say so, but so far no party has said that it 
<?notus-xml column=21?>wants to. The point, though, is that it would be at the grace and favour
of whoever was in place at the time, and that is the
difficulty<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:41:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that happened last year in the Assembly. At a very late stage in the
Planning Bill, at the very last moment an eight-page amendment came in
from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister which would have
had the effect of taking power away from the existing Minister. The
amendment had not gone through the Committee procedure because it came
in late. It was bounced on to the Floor of the Assembly at the last
moment and it was put through. It failed to be implemented only because
of legal activity by the Minister and it has not come into effect, but
the example illustrates why it is necessary to have an element of
independence. For instance, as my noble friend Lord Lexden said, under
Schedules 3, 5 and 6 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, even a simple
body like the NI Assembly Commission, dealing with property issues,
grass cutting and appointments of staff, is set out in statute.
Standing orders are indicated so that they set out the characteristics
of the committees. It is not impossible, therefore, to marry these two
things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000099">I
accept entirely the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, that
the weakness lies in the fact that you still have to get consent, but I
feel that having the trigger at Stormont to implement something that is
enabling—this is an enabling amendment—and thus having it
on the stocks so that it is ready to go, would shorten the time the

is the best way forward, albeit I accept that there could be a
stalemate. The fact is that the Assembly and Executive Review Committee

move forward with these proposals. I would certainly request the

it, the point of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Empey, is to
prevent those rights being removed at a point in the future. The
Assembly could do this itself but, as the noble Lord, Lord Empey, has
pointed out, it could take away that right in the future. I believe it

of power-sharing and the Belfast agreement are absolutely fundamental
in this, and any arrangements must be made with cross-community support

discussed this. Mr John McCallister MLA raised the issue and is
contemplating a Private Member’s Bill in the Assembly on the

However, as he explained, the intention behind his amendment is that
the Assembly could not then unilaterally withdraw these rights. Once

McAvoy:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment allows us the opportunity
to reflect on the continued importance of Westminster and the Northern
Ireland Office in Northern Ireland. There is a vital role for
Governments and the Secretary of State in bringing peace, progress and
prosperity to Northern Ireland. These are areas where, at times, it is
appropriate for the Government to lead and others to support, at all
times working in partnership with the Assembly, the Executive and the
Government of the Republic of Ireland. Much progress has been made
since the Good Friday agreement, but there remains a need for a
comprehensive and inclusive process to deal with the past—the
name Haass comes to mind—a process that has the victims and
survivors of violence at the centre. As yet, there is no consensus
within Northern Ireland as to the structures which would enable this.
Nevertheless, it should be a priority of the Northern Ireland Office to
facilitate and advance dialogue in this area. Dealing with the legacy
of what has become known as the Troubles is expressly a responsibility
of the Northern Ireland Office. The publication of the
Executive’s cohesion, sharing and integration strategy is good
news, and the Secretary of State should co-operate with the Executive
and provide support for initiatives designed to build, and to continue
to build, a shared future in Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000120">Northern
Ireland’s future, like that of other parts of the United
Kingdom, can be built only on a strong economy and a compassionate
welfare system. These are additional areas in which the Government must
work with the Assembly. The Government should also acknowledge the

Northern Ireland.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:01:20"></hs_TimeCode> could be
regarded as inattentiveness has been evidenced in the
Government’s inequitable welfare reforms. Thirty-two thousand
households in Northern Ireland will be affected by the bedroom tax.
Northern Ireland is being disproportionately affected, since almost 90%
of social housing stock is family homes of three bedrooms or
more—another exposure of the falsehood that people can somehow

and firming-up of politics and political institutions in Northern
Ireland that these leaders felt confident enough to put hugely complex

functions on a UK Minister, all it needs to do is ask for the Secretary
of State’s consent. The formal consent process takes about 10
days. The amendment would, therefore, have a very limited impact
because it would only remove that consent process in a small number of
cases specified by the Secretary of State in advance.</hs_para>

not onerous and there have been no complaints from the Northern Ireland

required the Secretary of State’s consent since the current
Assembly was elected in 2011. Consent in relation to that Bill did not
relate to ministerial functions, so it would not have been affected by
the proposed amendment. Although I am grateful for the opportunity for

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, before the Minister sits down I
apologise: I should have been in a moment earlier. I want to reflect on
the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy. Clause
6  deals with the reduction in size of the Assembly being a
reserved matter. There is a general view that, at  108 Members,
the Assembly is too big. Compared with the Welsh and Scottish
assemblies it is proportionately far bigger, but the reason for this
was a deliberate decision to try and make it as inclusive as possible.
Some two years ago we thought that a solution  would be brought
upon us with the change in parliamentary constituencies, because
reducing the 
<?notus-xml column=27?>number of parliamentary constituencies would automatically reduce the
size of the Assembly—QED. However, one or two people around your
Lordships’ House and in other places had different views, and
consequently that did not come to pass. However, it would have been an
important step.</hs_para>

House that the Assembly deciding on how to reduce its numbers is as
important as actually reducing the numbers. Using the existing system,
if you reduced the numbers and left the existing constituencies the
same, it would be perfectly possible to have a major political impact.
It is a bit like the American states: the winning party then determines
the boundaries of the new congressional districts, and so it goes on.
This is a similar type of issue, and we have to be very cautious as to
how we deal with it.</hs_para>

overall that the operation of the Northern Ireland institution is far
too complicated and expensive, and everyone has the general view that
it should be reduced. How you do that is very important and can have a
significant political outcome, so I caution your Lordships that if we
agree to this, it will hand the ability to whoever happens to be in
charge when this happens to draw up the numbers to suit themselves,
because proportional representation under the single transferable vote

contested.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000130"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Alderdice" PimsId="3622" UID="1402031000258" xid="1044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000258">Lord
Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, I spoke to this question at Second
Reading. I have a concern about the question of the reduction in the
numbers of Members of the Assembly. I do not share the view expressed
by the noble Lord, Lord Empey, and others in other places that the
Northern Ireland Assembly is too big. I think that there is a certain
minimum size; I hear from colleagues in Wales that the Welsh Assembly
is too small, and that it is actually very difficult for it to
accommodate all the requirements for committees to scrutinise
Ministers, for internal committees and to do all the necessary things.
There is a certain minimum size below which it is difficult to address
all the required functions. Of course, in the case of Northern Ireland,
unlike in Wales and Scotland, there is a very significant cross-border
responsibility that is present in dealing with another state, which is
not something that has to be done in quite the same way by other
devolved institutions.</hs_para>

the question of the reduction of the size of the Assembly, particularly
since, after the Belfast agreement, there has been a decision to bring
a major reduction in the number of local authorities and the number of
elected representatives. We are going to move from a substantial number
of elected local representatives to a much smaller number, while at the

not persuaded by
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402031000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000132">The
second issue is the question that the noble Lord, Lord Empey, picked
up: the people who will deliver on a decision will be the majority. In
the old days the majority was from one side of the community, and the
manipulation of electoral boundaries and votes was not at all
unknown—in fact, it was quite a significant issue. One of the
problems that I find, 
<?notus-xml column=28?>looking back at it from this side of the water, is  that people
over here sometimes assume that if major parties on both sides of the
community agree, that is all you need to know. It is perfectly possible
for two large parties, one on either side of the community, to agree to
do something that is a major and inappropriate disadvantage to minority
parties on both sides of the community or from neither.</hs_para>

that if this became a reserved matter, the two largest parties, one on
either side of the community, could come forward with an agreed set of
proposals that would advantage them electorally and politically in a
way that was inappropriate but would be very difficult to resist
because of, if we take the argument that the Minister made, the danger
of a Secretary of State or people from this side of the water imposing
their will. What does that mean? It means that if the two largest
parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly came forward with a proposal,
it would be rather difficult for a Secretary of States to withstand it
and not be accused of inappropriately affecting affairs when there
would be a cross-community agreement to move on that front. So there is
a real danger, and I have to say that I am not at all enthusiastic
about giving powers to the two large parties in the
Assembly—that is what this amounts to—to affect the
number of elected representatives per constituency. That would have a
major impact, and we could live to rue the day if it were able to
proceed.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1402031000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402031000160">4.15

Bew (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the words of the noble Lord,
Lord Alderdice. This is a more significant change than the House has
fully grasped. We have recently lost a distinguished Member of the
House of Commons, Mr Paul Goggins, who was widely respected on all
sides. When he was Minister of State for Northern Ireland he used to
say at the Dispatch Box that, “Electoral law will remain in this
House for all
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:14:57"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Today we are, in a sense, changing that. The reasons why he thought
that are very close to the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord
Alderdice. I fully accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Empey,
that there is a general public perception in Northern Ireland and
throughout the United Kingdom that there is great expense associated
with the running of the Stormont Parliament. However, it is a lot
easier to make a case for a reduction in the number of relatives
assisting and the number of special advisers, as well as in this area,
to deal with the question of public expenditure.</hs_para>

is a fundamental point here. The very large number of
representatives—108 for a small population—permits a
greater role for smaller parties than otherwise would have happened,
and these smaller parties have something relatively fresh to say in the
context of Northern Ireland. Do not forget that we have a Parliament at
the moment where 105 out of 108 Members support the Government. All of

your Lordships have been contacted by the Civil Service Commissioners
for Northern Ireland. While the commissioners do not oppose the
devolution of their functions, they are very concerned that they at
present do not have the benefit of formal legislative provisions. This
distinguishes them from their counterparts here in Whitehall. Civil
servants generally are sometimes, like politicians, the butt of jokes,
and I am sure many a cartoonist has made a living out of it, but the
Northern Ireland Civil Service over many difficult years ensured a
degree of civilisation where proper governance continued, despite
threats, both personal and real. It is important that its impartiality
in serving whatever Administration it happens to serve is
maintained<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:18:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

former Secretary of State in his seat. He will know the importance of
having that impartial advice available. I believe that the Civil
Service Commissioners want to ensure that that remains the case. They
would like the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010—it
puts the Home Civil Service Commission on a statutory footing and
enshrines in law the requirement that selection of appointment to the
Civil Service should be on merit, following fair and open
competition—to apply to the Northern Ireland 
<?notus-xml column=30?>Civil Service. I think that they are very anxious that devolution of
this function should not take place until that is

examples; a modest one, and one perhaps more substantial and
persuasive. This question of maintaining the non-partisan stance and
community appreciation of the Northern Ireland Civil Service is of
enormous importance. Quite a lot has been written about the peace
process in Northern Ireland, and most of it concentrates on
negotiations between politicians, the people who are brought in from
outside to assist, the role played by the Prime Minister and the
Taoiseach and, in some cases, the impact of the United States, the
European Union, the NGOs and so on. Very few of those papers point up
the importance of civil servants in the Northern Ireland Civil Service,
yet they were absolutely critical. A few of those civil
servants—nominated by the Secretary of State and his
successors—basically spent all their time engaging with
politicians right across, and in some cases beyond, the spectrum to
keep the process alive. Whether Governments changed, whether leaders of
the political parties changed, with all the ups and down of elections
those civil servants continued to meet. They would make minutes. They
would ensure that meetings were held. They would keep people in touch
with each other.</hs_para>

little is written about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:22:56"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
absolutely essential. As I have involved myself in peace processes in
various other parts of the world, I have come to realise how important
it was. In many places, almost right across the Middle East, for
example, this is not a tradition in the civil service. It is difficult
to make peace processes work in some of these places precisely because
there is no civil service there of that kind—no non-political,
non-partisan civil
service<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:23:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

One of the problems I had when I became the first Speaker of the
Assembly was how to staff it. Nobody had been there for decades,
running, as clerks or other officials, an Assembly. There was only one
body of people who could be called upon in sufficient numbers: the
Northern Ireland 
<?notus-xml column=31?>Civil Service. People, particularly on the nationalist and republican
side, were very anxious about this. They had come to a view, for
particular reasons, some of them based on experience and some of them
on suspicion, that the Northern Ireland civil servants would be biased
towards unionists. We had a lot of negotiation about it, but we all
came to the conclusion that there was no alternative, so the agreement
was that we would take these people in—however, on only a
three-year contract. During that period, there would be open
advertisement, and people would come in from other places in society
and outside Northern Ireland. There would have to be this transitional
process.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1402033000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402033000009">The
fascinating thing was this: as that period of three years went on, it
became increasingly apparent to nationalists and republicans that the
concerns they had had about the non-partisan nature of the Northern
Ireland Civil Service were actually pretty groundless. As we came near
the end of the time, people from those communities wanted to keep on
many of the staff who had proved themselves perfectly capable of being
loyal to a power-sharing cross-community Executive and Assembly. That
was the quality of people and, to some extent, the culture, which was a
more non-partisan one than was realised.</hs_para>

anxiety—in this situation, I do not think that examples on this
side of the water are necessarily perfect—that Members of the
Government on both sides in Northern Ireland might well be tempted to
influence the appointment of some senior civil servants in a way that
would not ultimately be in the interests of any of us in Northern
Ireland. I ask the Minister to take very seriously the amendment put
forward in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Empey, and myself, and to
take it away and look at whether it is possible to accommodate the very
legitimate concerns—not concerns about devolution of the
function but about protection of the devolution of this function from
adverse and partisan impact.</hs_para>

Ireland—not that it was deliberately excluded for any particular
reason, but it simply did not apply. However, exactly the same
principles should apply, and I think everybody would want them to

as I would have expected: that members of the Northern Ireland Civil

years before these principles of fair and open competition were

Randerson:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lords, Lord Empey
and Lord Alderdice, for their amendment and the spirit in which it was
put forward, and I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in this
debate. They rightly emphasise the key issue: the importance of the
impartiality of the Civil Service. My noble friend Lord Alderdice
referred to the key role of the Civil Service prior to the days of the
Good Friday agreement. I was in a small way involved in the early
discussions and, from my own experience, was acutely aware of the key
role of the Civil Service in Northern Ireland in that regard, the
importance of its expertise and, above all, the importance of its
impartiality and the trust with which it could therefore be
regarded<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:32:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that Clause 10 does not change the current procedure for the
appointment of Civil Service Commissioners for Northern Ireland.
Appointments are currently an excepted matter; the Bill proposes to
make them a reserved matter, in common with the functions and
procedures of those commissioners. Commissioners will continue to be
appointed by the Crown: that is, on the advice of the Secretary of
State. The Civil Service Commissioners (Northern Ireland) Order 1999,
which currently governs the functions of the commissioners, will
continue to apply. However, that leaves open the possibility of the
future devolution of responsibility for appointment of the
commissioners and that of their functions and procedures. Under Section
4 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, that could only happen with the
agreement of Parliament and that of the Northern Ireland Assembly
voting with cross-community support. However, before any proposal of
that sort is put forward we would certainly intend to consult
publicly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402033000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402033000020">We
believe that the devolution of responsibility for the commissioners at
some point may well be appropriate. Matters have moved a long way since
the Good Friday agreement and the initial devolution of responsibility
in 1999. For example, we had big changes in 2010, focusing on policing
and justice. The commissioners’ independence and the maintenance
of an impartial public service are of paramount importance. I thank the
noble Lords for their suggested safeguards in this regard. It is clear
across the Chamber today that there is agreement on the importance of
the impartiality of the Civil Service and agreement that there should
be additional safeguards to those currently provided for in
legislation. The Government are certainly open to the possibility of
new statutory safeguards at the point of devolution and welcome the
suggestions made. We hope to hear more when the time comes for the

We have heard what your Lordships have said here but we believe that it
is premature to specify preconditions to devolution in the Bill today.
The necessary protections should be carefully debated before devolution
takes place, as it would be inappropriate to make such significant
changes without a thorough
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:35:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a question as a disinterested observer, although not an uninterested

general agreement around the Committee on the principle of the
amendment—unless I have missed something—why does the

Randerson:</Member></B> My response to the noble Lord is that, as I was
in the process of saying, we do not disagree with the concept of the
safeguards that have been suggested and laid out in the amendment.
However, we believe that before we devolve the Civil Service
Commissioners’ role, we need to have public consultation so that
we have a fuller understanding of what the public expect. It is also
worth pointing out that safeguards are already in place in relation to
the Civil Service Commissioners in England. Therefore, it is right and
appropriate to compare the safeguards proposed in this amendment with
those in place for the Civil Service Commissioners in England. In the
case of England, they go to several pages; they are very much more
detailed. The proposals in the amendment are an indication of the sort
of lines one would wish to put in place, but the Government believe
that they are nowhere near detailed enough for the final situation.
They would need a great deal more fleshing out and should rightly be
fleshed out following public

Hurd of Westwell (Con):</Member></B> I have been following this debate
with some care and would like to join, from my own experience as
Secretary of State, in welcoming the spirit with which the Northern
Ireland Civil Service conducted its affairs at a time when the
pressures on civil servants as individuals must have been really quite
substantial, coming from several parts of the community. They resisted
those pressures, as far as I could tell, with persistence because they
believed in the principles which have been endorsed in every speech
made here, including that of my noble friend. She is straining at a
gnat. We are all familiar, from being in government, with occasions
when Ministers are asked to take this line. She is saying, “Yes,
the principle is fine,” and so on, “but we need more
thought; we need more time, we need more consultation”. We have
had quite a substantial consultation in this House this
afternoon<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:39:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
principle is not at stake and is not being questioned. Is this not an
opportunity to endorse that principle, which is hugely important for
the future of the Province? It seems that the House should take the
opportunity offered to it this afternoon to underline its strong
endorsement of the principle, rather than be deflected by the arguments

However, I do not see this as an argument for delay. This measure must
go through the appropriate legal processes and there should be proper
public consultation. With all due respect to your Lordships, there is
another side to public consultation which involves, for example, asking
the opinions of the elected representatives in Northern

that there should be public consultation to ensure that
those safeguards are as full and detailed as is necessary. The
Government also believe that although the intention of the noble
Lord’s amendment is entirely satisfactory in many respects, it
is deficient in technical terms because the safeguards it specifies are

Civil Service Commissioners—has, as the noble Lord pointed out,
raised our awareness of this issue and is very much involved with the
whole process. I should point out that there will be a vote here and in
Stormont before the Civil Service Commissioners are devolved.
Therefore, noble Lords will be able to discuss once again the details
of the safeguards to be put in place as regards the impartiality of the
Civil Service. I hope that noble Lords who have spoken this afternoon
will contribute fully to the consultation that will take place in due
course. However, for the present, I hope that the noble Lord will not
press the amendment. I cannot agree to it for the reasons I have

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, when we started out on this amendment, I
thought it was a very simple matter that would not be at all
controversial. It just shows you that you never can tell around these
parts. First, nobody in Northern Ireland has asked for this. The
Assembly certainly has not made an approach. To some extent, the issue
has come as a bit of a surprise. As I said—I think there is
widespread acceptance round the House—the Northern Ireland Civil
Service did a good and impartial job. There are a number of former
Ministers in their places to confirm that, including the noble Baroness
on the Opposition Front Bench, who ran a number of departments and has
many years of experience. I accept that there may well be technical
deficiencies in the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, and
I have tabled. We are very happy for the amendment to be taken away and
those technical deficiencies resolved. However, the Minister referred
on a number of occasions to consultation. It is not clear to me what
the consultation is on—whether it is the principle of devolution
or not. To have a consultation on the merit principle would take us
back to ground zero. If we do not or cannot accept that, we will pretty

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, this clause deals with the potential
for devolution of certain aspects of the Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission. Human rights is a particularly important and sensitive
issue in all jurisdictions, not just those in which there are
conflicts. It takes on particular characteristics where there is
communal and intercommunal conflict. I well remember discussions at a
very early stage among the political parties and the two Governments,
well before those with which George Mitchell and colleagues were
involved—right back to the days of Sir Ninian Stephen, whom some
of your Lordships will probably have forgotten. It was very interesting
because at that stage four political parties and the British and Irish
Governments were involved. It was fascinating that the four political
parties could all agree that we needed robust human rights protections.
It is generally not that difficult to get people, particularly
opposition parties to agree. In those days, all the parties in Northern
Ireland were opposition parties. If you say, “Do you want the
rights of your people to be protected?”, they say, “Yes,
of course”. If you say, “Do you want the rights of
everybody else to be protected?”, it is difficult to say,
“No, I just want our rights
protected<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:51:50"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

involved at that stage all agreed and those who found it most difficult
were the British and Irish Governments. They could see the implications
of embodying this in statute and setting up human rights commissions,
and so on. What is important about that is that when people are in
government they have a very different perspective on human rights from
when they are in opposition. This is why I have a real anxiety and
wonder how much thinking there has been about the question proposed in
Clause 11. I would be interested to know from the Minister who exactly
has asked for this; certainly the Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission has not asked for it. If the Northern Ireland Government
have asked for it, I am particularly suspicious—not because of
the occupants of those offices but because, in principle, the point of
human rights commissions is to speak truth to power and to
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:52:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402033000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402033000039">That
is why in Scotland, it is not the Scottish Government but the Scottish

<?notus-xml column=38?>anxiety, or whether we are talking about the possibility that it might
be devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, where a whole range of
the community is represented by elected representatives. There is a
sort of reason for this. One of roles and responsibilities of the
Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly is that every piece of
legislation, before it comes to First Reading, must have the
Speaker’s approval that it conforms to the European Convention
on Human Rights. Before the legislation leaves the Assembly, in case
any amendments have been passed that change that, it must have approval
again. At<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:54:26"></hs_TimeCode>

intervene in the legislative process precisely to make sure that the

would be interested to find out where the drive has come from for this
particular change. Is it a question of giving more power to the
Northern Ireland Executive to control those who are supposed to hold
them to account, or is it possible that we might look at devolution to
the Northern Ireland Assembly? That would at least ensure that it was
not those in government appointing those who scrutinise government, but

asymmetric situation in the United Kingdom, whereby Scotland has a
separate human rights commission reporting to the

does not have anything separate; and Northern Ireland has a human

commissions is jointly considered under the United Nations process. The
A status of the human rights performance of the UK is an extremely
important feature of our foreign policy. The fact that we retain an A

11 moves certain functions relating to the Northern Ireland Human
Rights Commission from the excepted to the reserved category. Human
rights issues have long been politically sensitive in Northern Ireland
and at the time of the 1998 Act it was considered that functions
relating to the new commission should remain in the Secretary of
State’s hands. In the context of stable devolved institutions
and of their development in the future, it may become desirable in due
course to devolve responsibilities relating to the NIHRC if the
Northern Ireland political parties so wish and if the Secretary of
State considers that the Northern Ireland institutions are better
placed than the Government to carry out the functions concerned. Clause
11 will mean that the appointment, functions, procedures and funding of
the NIHRC will be reserved.</hs_para>

commitment, in their response to the Northern Ireland Affairs
Committee’s pre-legislative scrutiny report on the draft version
of this Bill, to consult formally on any future devolution of
responsibilities relating to the NIHRC and the other

taking place. I reiterate that commitment today. We will also ensure
that the NIHRC retains its responsibility for the scrutiny of
non-devolved matters relating to Northern Ireland such as national

responsibilities for the institution.</hs_para>

concerns that have been expressed both in this Committee and elsewhere
that in the course of devolution the independence and freedom of action
of the NIHRC should not be compromised. Indeed, not only do we
understand those concerns, we fully share them. The independence of the
commission is essential to its effectiveness. Its international
standing is high and reflects that independence. We are well aware of
the importance to the commission itself of the Belgrade and Paris
principles, and it is essential that those are abided by. I also ask
noble Lords to consider the benefits of devolution. I understand the
concerns, but I ask them to consider the benefits. We believe that if
it can be accomplished without compromise to the independence and
important international standing of the commission, it would be a good
thing. It would show that the institutions have matured. After all, in
2010, we accepted that they should take responsibility for sensitive
matters such as policing and justice. It is not outrageous, therefore,
to suggest that they should be capable of accommodating the independent
oversight of institutions, as indeed they already do in various areas
such as that of the police ombudsman, with due respect for propriety.
So we do not believe that it is unthinkable that, at some point soon,
the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland should take on
responsibility for the NIHRC, but we are not asking for decisions at
this point. All that the Bill does is to make it possible for such
decisions to be reached and for effect to be given to them at a later
date. If that happens, it will be after full consultation, because
these issues need debate in Northern Ireland, of which we have had very
little so far. Devolution would require votes in the Assembly by
cross-community support and in both Houses here, so we shall certainly
come back to these issues before any act of

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, there is no question that, from an
administrative point of view, having the district electoral areas dealt
with by the same commissioner who deals with each individual ward makes
sense. However, as has been mentioned in the context of other issues,
this is a very significant development under proportional
representation, because the drawing up of district electoral areas out
of wards has two consequences. The decision on how many seats to award
for each district electoral area has consequences under proportional
representation, and which particular wards make up that DEA is also an
extremely sensitive issue. There are grey areas in many
respects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402033000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#1402033000056">You<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:14:49"></hs_TimeCode>
cannot of course go around in life with a conspiracy theory always at
the front of your mind, but I have to say that current
experience—within the past couple of years—is not
encouraging. I refer to the recent reorganisation of local government,
which I have previously referred to elsewhere. The recommendation of
the commissioner was overruled in one case. In my opinion, a scandalous
gerrymander has occurred in the city of Belfast, and barely a word is
said. I have absolutely no confidence that the time is right for this
particular function to be considered for devolution. A lot of people
say they want the single transferable vote system of proportional
representation but fewer people perhaps have had full experience of it.
We have had 40 years of experience and understand the
significance of deciding on the number of seats. For each local
government area, you have a number of district electoral areas, each of
which is a collection of wards. Those areas can include, in our case,
five, six or seven; in the Irish Republic it could be four or three.
Those decisions on the number are very significant. Equally, deciding
which particular group of wards form the DEA is also
significant<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:11:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

can lead to putting the cat in charge of the cream, to be perfectly
blunt. At this stage, I feel that this is not an appropriate thing to
do. Recent experience, as I said, is not encouraging and we could start
to create the particular problem which, as referred to, was a problem
in the past. Do we really want to go back down there again? It is not a
big deal—I have to tell noble Lords that the people on the
streets are not talking of little else—and not a source of
difficulty, so why move to a position where that could happen? The
point might well be made that we have done our local government
DEAs—we have just passed the order today—so this is not
something that will arise in the near future. That is indeed true, but
so what? If it will not arise, and will not be necessary right now or
in the foreseeable future, we can wait. Whenever it does come round,
and when is needed, we can hope things will have sufficiently matured
politically so that anxieties such as the ones I am expressing today

that this is not a matter that is talked of every Friday and Saturday
night in the pubs of Belfast. He is right about that, at this point,
because it is not an issue. However, I have found in conversations with
political friends and colleagues in the United States that districting
is very much a matter of debate, because it is actually in place. You
do not need to be a particular student of Northern Ireland history to
know that manipulation of electoral boundaries and arrangements was a
fundamental problem which led to many of our difficulties. I am a
little puzzled as to why this has come up at this stage. I am delighted
that we are 15 or 16 years on from the agreement, but we are not 15 or
16 years more mature than at the time of the agreement and it is quite
clear that it is very difficult to reach agreement on a whole raft of
issues in the Northern Ireland Assembly. I would feel much more relaxed
about this if, over the past 15 or 16 years, we had passed a whole
series of constructive pieces of legislation in the Northern Ireland
Assembly and agreed on all sorts of community initiatives that had to
be done, and if the walls of partition were coming down in the city of
Belfast and the word “dissident”—whether loyalist
or republican—was consigned to history and so on. In that case,
I would probably not be standing up here.</hs_para>

therefore be beholden to study extensively whether such changes truly

areas in Northern Ireland cannot be designed for the benefit of two or
a handful of political parties, but in full accord with the guiding
principle of the 1998 agreement—that of inclusivity. This is not
Westminster abdicating responsibility in this area. Instead, it imposes
a major responsibility on Westminster Governments to impartially

the Assembly and endorses its ability to make inclusive decisions and
scrutinise them. It also retains a vital role for the Secretary of

a lack of understanding about the difference between the local

recommended that the processes of setting ward boundaries and electoral

business of having a civic forum was set out in paragraph 34 of strand
1 of the Belfast agreement. Earlier today we heard the Minister say
that the principles of the Belfast agreement are fundamental. The Civic
Forum was then enshrined in Section 56 of the Northern Ireland Act
1998. The problem is that, in terms of that Act, it is almost an
aspiration, or something that may happen between now and
infinity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000003">A
Civic Forum was established in October 2000 but it was suspended,
alongside the Northern Ireland Assembly, in 2002. That is now 12 years
ago and the Civic Forum is still not functioning. We must realise why
it was put there in the first place. When the Belfast agreement came to
pass, there were tremendous numbers of people in civic and civil
society in Northern Ireland egging on that there was an agreement and
they wanted to be part of it. There is a sense that we are all in this
together, but there are those who cannot bring themselves to be part of
political parties. We know what has happened throughout our kingdom
with membership of political parties. There are plenty of people who
are interested in the political process and civicness but cannot bring
themselves to be associated with political parties. An opportunity
arises, under the Belfast agreement, for such people and those in
non-governmental bodies, quangos and everything else to be involved in
this forum. It will bring people together. We hear about there being a
“shared future”—a splendid phrase—in
Northern Ireland. The establishment of the Civic Forum will hold the
political parties to making certain it is a shared future and not a
shared-out
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000004">In

is further consultation. This is not putting it into legislation with a
heavy hand. I hope we can, by legislation, make certain that the Civic

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, I commend my noble friend Lord Shutt
of Greetland and support his amendment. We have been discussing a
number of amendments which go way beyond what was agreed 
<?notus-xml column=46?>by the Northern Ireland parties and the two Governments in the Good
Friday agreement. There is some space for debate and discussion on
those issues, but at least one of the parties which supported the
agreement had the mantra that it has to be in the agreement; the
Belfast agreement has to be fully implemented. Here, in one hugely
significant element, the Belfast agreement is not being
implemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000006">One
might ask why, if there was sufficient enthusiasm to get it into the
agreement, it fell into disarray so quickly. One could look at the
forum itself and whether it performed to its maximum; one could,
perhaps, say the same thing about the Assembly. However, there was a
dynamic there which may not be familiar to the House. During the long
period of direct rule, the Government here at Westminster—the
Secretary of State and members of the Northern Ireland
Office—wanted to find some way to relate with the Northern
Ireland community. There was great difficulty in relating with elected
representatives who were, in any case, elected either to the other
place or to local authorities because there was not an Assembly. It was
very common to invite people from NGOs and civil society generally to
drinks at Stormont and Hillsborough, and to discuss with people who
were running sometimes very commendable NGOs what would be a good way
of spending money locally, how things should be organised and who might
be appointed to bodies.</hs_para>

say that a considerable resentment grew up between politicians and
those in political parties on the one hand and members of civil society
on the other, because politicians felt that they themselves were often
in danger and considerably exerting themselves—going out,
knocking on doors, delivering leaflets and desperately trying to get
votes—and then being ignored by the Government when it came to
sharing things out, whereas those who did not go out to try to get
votes but set up their own frequently unaccountable, though in many
cases quite commendable, organisations were actually being favoured.
So, when politicians started to take control of things after the Good
Friday agreement, they were not in a mind to share them with anyone,
certainly not those who they felt had been the beneficiaries of
government largesse over a period of 20 or more years. There was
antipathy towards the Civic Forum and civil society organisations on
the part of the newly elected representatives in the Northern Ireland
Assembly. So not only was there not quite the momentum that there might
have been in the Civic Forum but there was a real
antipathy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000008">Has
that changed in any way? There are still feelings of that kind around,
but I revert to the very first debate that we had in Committee about an
Opposition. One of the difficulties when so many people are in
government is that any opposition parties will be a minority, possibly
in some cases a permanent one. If they are going to have an
impact—noble Lords will recall that I raised questions about the
amendment at that stage because of the lack of leverage that smaller
parties had in the Assembly—then one way in which those who
question the Government within the Assembly might gain some help,
strength, leverage and public accord might well be if there were a
civic forum that 
<?notus-xml column=47?>could also address these issues and might well also say, “Well,
actually, here’s a situation where the Opposition in the
Assembly may not have the numbers but they have the argument”.
In this way, a civic forum could help the Assembly to strengthen its
scrutiny function when a majority of Members of the Assembly were
members of government parties, under any kind of arrangement based even
loosely on the Good Friday agreement.</hs_para>

where this important element of the agreement was not implemented
beyond 2002, it seems that there could be a change that may well make
it possible to bring it back into play. The Civic Forum will never be
any kind of emulation of your Lordships’ House, but it may
nevertheless be able to perform not a governmental, parliamentary or
legislative function but still a useful one. In any case, we should all
be trying to ensure the full implementation of the Good Friday
agreement, because that is what most of the progress of the past 15 or
16 years has been based
upon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Empey" PimsId="5912" UID="14020316000078" xid="2122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000078">Lord
Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, there is no doubt that the noble Lord,
Lord Shutt, is correct that the Civic Forum was and is in the
agreement. It fell into disuse in part because of the resentments that
the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, referred to. People said that many of
these individuals were usurping the role of elected representatives,
and that feeling persists. The other reason, though, was that it did
not get off to a terribly good start. It did not distinguish itself
during the relatively short period of its existence. That does not rule
out having a look at it again, but I suspect that that was the
reasoning.</hs_para>

will be coming to this in the next amendment, is that if the agreement
had been left as it was agreed, there would be strong pressure on those
who signed up to it in principle to follow it. However, as we will be
referring to in the next amendment, the Government unilaterally changed
the agreement in 2006, so therefore a lot of people do not feel as
obligated to the full agreement as they would have done prior to that
happening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000012">Another
point is that people are getting a constant stream of criticism about
the costs of the Northern Ireland Assembly and its complications, and
they felt, “Well, here we have another layer. Were we right to
agree to this in the first place? Is it going to be too expensive? Do
we really need it? With 108 MLAs representing the people, do we need
this?”. That is the kind of argument, but there is no question
of doubt about the fundamental point that the noble Lord Shutt, makes:
it is in the agreement. It is not the only thing that is not
implemented—I hear a sound from a sedentary position that I know
may well emerge in a moment or two from this chrysalis and bring
blinding light to the House. Those are some of the reasons why we are

familiar refrain. The Civic Forum is a matter for the Northern Ireland
Assembly and does not require legislation in this House. The 1990 Act
gave responsibility for the creation of the forum to the Office of the
First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and gave them the
responsibility for scrutinising the body as well. Provisional
arrangements for the Civic Forum were created and approved in this
manner. These arrangements also established that there would be a
review of the forum after one year of its operation. This was deferred
until 2002, but unfortunately the suspension meant that that was not
completed.</hs_para>

Forum has once again been under review, and surely a six-year to
seven-year review tells a story of its own. The
review was initiated by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy
First Minister. This decision and the review have rightly been
approved, scrutinised and debated by the Assembly. The transitional
Assembly’s Committee on the Preparation for Government concluded
that a review of the mechanism for civic society to promote its views
was necessary. Here, sad to say, the opinions expressed by the noble
Lord, Lord Empey, about the role in society of quite a large Assembly
raise necessary doubts. It serves some nebulous cause to have a good
thing in operation, but on the other hand we have to be professional
and sharp about things and not just have bodies just for the sake of
them. Anyway, as I said before, this comes under the aegis of the
Assembly.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020316000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0001.htm#14020316000016">The
best way in which to engage with the community in the political process
is surely a matter for the Assembly and Northern Ireland politicians to
decide upon. There are indications that there is a nationalist/unionist
split—I use the terms roughly—about the worth of the
forum and whether it should be reinstituted. As the noble Lord, Lord
Empey, said, in this era of austerity the costs of an extra, subsidiary
body have resulted in some doubts about it as well. Once again, though,
I say that the initiative must come from the Assembly. This is
devolution in practice.</hs_para>

contributed to a short but interesting debate. As my noble friend
highlighted, the community and voluntary sector plays a vital role in
Northern Ireland society, as it does in my home country of Wales and in
other parts of the United Kingdom. Alongside the important services it
provides to citizens, the community and voluntary sector can be
particularly influential in informing debate and helping to shape our
society. I believe that is what led to the Civic Forum being
established under the Belfast agreement. However, as noble Lords have
already said, the Civic Forum has not always commanded the support of
the parties in Northern Ireland. In its short existence between 2000
and 2002, the forum met a total of 12 times and produced a number of
papers 
<?notus-xml column=49?>on various issues. There was a wide range of useful papers. For some in
Northern Ireland that was seen as beneficial and important in
delivering good government but, as the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, has
just pointed out, for others it was seen as poor value for money.
Others also pointed to it being
ineffective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:40:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020324000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020324000003">Whatever the situation,
the Civic Forum fell by default when the Assembly was suspended. I
believe that the disagreements on how effective it had been are what
prompted the First and Deputy First Ministers to initiate a review of
the Civic Forum in 2007 which would make recommendations on the way
forward. As noble Lords will be aware, that review has never been
published but that has not quelled the interest of the parties at
Stormont on progress around the Civic Forum and, as my noble friend
Lord Shutt pointed out, it was debated last year in the
Assembly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:41:41"></hs_TimeCode>. What
was clear from that debate is that there is no clear consensus to this
day on the merits of the Civic Forum or the manner in which it should
be constituted in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:41:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Shutt pointed out that political parties are not always popular these
days as organisations to join and that civic involvement is often the
favoured choice for members of the public. That is an important point
and it points to the continued, or potential, significance of a forum
if it were to be re-established. As the noble Lord has pointed out, the
Civic Forum is an important component of the Belfast Agreement. His
proposed amendment requires that the First and Deputy First Minister
launch a formal consultation on the Civic Forum. I expect they may
argue that this has already been carried out through the review which
they launched in 2007, although the current status of that review is
unclear<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I say
to my noble friend that I reread the Belfast agreement at the weekend
and it is quite clear that this is an issue for the executive and the
parties at Stormont to agree, as the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, said.
Ultimately, the onus is on the parties at Stormont to agree a way
forward on the Civic
Forum<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:43:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020324000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020324000005">If the Civic Forum is
to reappear, it would be essential for it to have a clearly delineated
role. It would be especially useful to agree that beforehand. That
prospect would obviously follow only from the review undertaken by the
First Minister and Deputy First Minister, which has never been
published to this day. We are therefore speculating about a potential
re-establishment which, although still under active consideration
within the Assembly, is in my view some way off—if it is on the
horizon at all<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
This is very much an issue for the parties at Stormont. I thank the
noble Lord for raising the issue and hope that, in doing so, he has
given the issue some renewed impetus. I hope that the parties in
Belfast will take notice of our debate here and the comments of your
Lordships this afternoon. In the mean time, I ask my noble friend to

Lords, I thank the three noble Lords who have spoken, and the Minister.
I understand that it is always possible to put up an argument against
something. Costs have been raised. There are plenty of costs in
Northern Ireland that I could have a go at before getting at the costs
of a body 
<?notus-xml column=50?>such as the Civic Forum. The reduction in numbers of those who are going
to be involved in local government is another reason why setting up the

that that was the cost of the Civic Forum. My noble friend is right to
make that important point. If they were unpaid, I often wonder whether
there was any point trying to get a group of people together at 10 am
on a Wednesday if all those people were in work. They would be far
better meeting at 10 am on a Saturday. I do not know what the position

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, a few moments ago we were talking about
the Belfast agreement and the obligation of those parties who supported
it to uphold it. Undoubtedly, if you make an agreement you might
subject it to a referendum, a subject regularly discussed in your
Lordships’ House. We are getting in the mood now for all sorts
of referendums. We had a referendum in 1998 and the agreement was
agreed. However, that is not where it ended. One of the reasons we have
difficulty is that that agreement was worked out after many
months—in fact, years—of delicate negotiations. At the
core is the concept of a
partnership<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:48:54"></hs_TimeCode>,
which is the point that the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, made earlier. I
understand his point about designation and that he has an issue, but at
the core was the concept of a partnership. That partnership was such
that those at the top of the Government each had a hand on the wheel.
That obviously made decision-making much more difficult but it was the
only way that we could figure of getting people to consent to the
re-establishment of
devolution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020324000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020324000011">The
noble Lords, Lord Kilclooney and Lord Alderdice, and others, sat at the
table when these matters were discussed; the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis
of Drumglass, sat there with the rest of us. We looked at these issues
and came to a conclusion. We set out, as was set out clearly in the
1998 Act, how we were going to identify the First Minister and Deputy
First Minister. These are the people who are charged with the
responsibility of oversight and for steering the business of the
devolved Assembly. They jointly chair the Executive.</hs_para>

legal terms, the two personages are absolutely equal; there is no
distinction between them. I know 
<?notus-xml column=52?>that clearly because, when I occupied the post for a short time with
Seamus Mallon, the first issue we had to agree was the notepaper: you
could not send out a letter from the department without both
signatures. Because Seamus Mallon was the Deputy First Minister and I
was coming in in place of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, who was the
First Minister, he assumed that his name would go to the left-hand side
of the notepaper, and that mine would go to the right-hand side. I
said, “No. I am not substituting for you; I am substituting for
him”. Consequently, we were unable to send a letter out for a
week<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:51:10"></hs_TimeCode>. The
settlement was that I went on the left-hand side as Minister for
Enterprise, a post which I held in parallel with First Minister, and
his name stayed where it was. That was a classic case. The point is
that it is a

behind our backs in 2006, this process was torn up. In the original
agreement, the First and Deputy First Ministers’ names had to go
before the Northern Ireland Assembly in a joint Motion that they both
be appointed to their respective positions. That meant that the
Northern Ireland Assembly had to agree, by cross-community consent, who
the First and Deputy First Ministers would be. The Northern Ireland
Assembly now has no say in that. That was removed at a stroke and
replaced by the current system, which is that whichever party is the
largest from one designation and whichever is the largest from the
other designation between them occupy the two posts. The Assembly is

turns all subsequent elections into sectarian headcounts. People go
around the country saying, “If you don’t vote for me,
Martin McGuinness will be First Minister”. Somebody else says,
“If you vote for me, I can put Peter Robinson out”. The
fact that there is no difference in the powers that either of them
exercises is set aside. If we made any mistake in 1998, perhaps the
titles that we chose for these two offices were wrong. We have created

that is how the system works. How it came about is another bone of
contention. The agreement was agreed by all parties sitting around the

the dynamics of devolution, my party was not consulted, the Social
Democratic and Labour Party was not consulted and I suspect that the
Alliance Party was not consulted. It may have applied to others, too.
It was just done, and appeared in the draft of the Bill. It was not
part of the St Andrews agreement; while it was part of the St Andrews
agreement Act, it was not dealt with at St Andrews. It came out of
nowhere; it was just produced as a deal and appeared in the Bill. When
I saw it, I knew exactly what was happening and why. It was a major
mistake, and people say to us that every part of the agreement should
be implemented, when a part of the agreement that was implemented in

a significant and 
<?notus-xml column=53?>unfortunate course of events, first, to create a row over
nothing—when there is no difference between the powers of the
two persons elected—and, secondly, to change the dynamics of
electoral politics in Assembly elections much more in favour of
sectarian headcounts than ever was the case before. Under the original

between the Assembly and the First and Deputy First Minister, they
inevitably feel less obligated. That is a mistake. It is interesting
that, in the Irish Parliament, the Taoiseach is elected by the members
of the Dáil. You might say that if that is the case, it is the
very last thing that I would want in Northern Ireland but it is not,
because the partnership principle is paramount. If we made a mistake,
we did so in the titles of the two positions. However, who could have
foreseen that somebody would go behind your back eight years later,
without consulting you or participating in any process whatever, and
just produce a clause in a Bill out of nowhere? I hear so many
speakers—the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, and others—saying
today, “Oh, this is the Assembly and we cannot do
anything—it was part of the agreement”, or, “It
was up to Stormont”, or whatever. That is true, but whenever it

for the amendment. It is also almost, to the word, the same position
that was adopted by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, who is
not in her place at the moment. She pioneered a similar amendment in
2006, when the St Andrews agreement Bill was going through this House.
She opposed the introduction of this proposal on the same grounds and I

will briefly take his point from a slightly different angle, which is
particularly important for people looking into Northern Ireland from
outside. Everyone is familiar with the fact that the history of the
20th century in Northern Ireland was one in which a substantial
minority felt that it was not fairly involved and a significant
majority was constantly in control. That is largely true. However, from
that came an assumption that if you could get an agreement that had
support from the majority on the two sides of the community, it must be
a good thing and should simply be accepted without too much
argument.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020316000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020316000020">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:58:33"></hs_TimeCode>
is a serious mistake. It is wholly possible to create an environment in
which a majority rule in two sections of the community can be, if not
as bad, certainly not very commendable. When we look at the majority in
the community as a whole, we realise that that, on its own, is not
satisfactory in a divided community. This is an issue way beyond just
Northern Ireland. When people look into divided communities, whether in
Syria, Israel/Palestine or other areas, they should not assume that
just because you get a majority on each side that you have a
satisfactory outcome. It may 
<?notus-xml column=54?>be more satisfactory than getting a majority from only one side, but it
is not of itself a satisfactory outcome. When noble Lords look not just
at this Bill but at other Bills, it is important to think about the
implicit warning of the noble Lord, Lord Empey: solving the problem is
not just a matter of satisfying a majority within each of the two
pillars. On that, and on the principle behind it, he is right and not
just for Northern Ireland.</hs_para>

currently have the longest period of stable government in a generation.
What is detailed in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Empey,
simply takes us backwards and returns us to a position that was in the
Northern Ireland Act pre-St Andrews. There is a legal requirement
placed on the Assembly to provide a report on how the Assembly can be
improved. My party would be reluctant to pre-empt the work going on in
the Assembly to review their workings and all the political
institutions by supporting an amendment such as this.</hs_para>

of the other ministerial appointments, with the exception at present of
the Justice Ministry, require cross-community support so it seems
rather odd that we would isolate the First Minister and Deputy First

bit-by-bit approach. It is important to take a comprehensive approach.
If changes are to be made, one must look at the totality of the system

other things. Therefore, I cannot support the

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an issue that the
noble Lord, Lord Empey, has returned to in the past and I am sure he
will do so again. I do not feel we can support it here today. Clearly,
as I recall, the time leading up to the St Andrews agreement was tense
in Northern Ireland. I seem to recall various deadlines in reaching
agreements so that the Assembly could be re-established after what was
then four and a half years of suspension—a situation that nobody
wanted to be in at the time. The agreements made there were not just
agreements made there and then. There were discussions for several
weeks after, before the legislation came to your Lordships’
House. My noble friend Lord Rooker took the legislation through your
Lordships’ House at that time. Legislation giving effect to the
St Andrews agreement and ongoing discussions was passed by both
Houses.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Empey, whom I have known for many years—indeed
I followed him into his department, DETI, in Northern

He has had criticisms of it for some time. However, there is no doubt
that that agreement led to the re-establishment of the Assembly and the
process we have now. I really feel that it is not appropriate to unpick
just some parts. The noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, made an
important point about the ongoing review by the Assembly. However, it
would be unfortunate in this 
<?notus-xml column=55?>legislation to unpick one part of the St Andrews agreement, even though
I understand the concerns raised, and it is not something that we will

noble friend Lord Alderdice have to say. In some ways, it may be a

the St Andrews agreement, and the subsequent legislation, is the basis

as the noble Lord said, from the 1998 agreement. There was one change
subsequently, with the effect that the largest party in the Assembly
nominated the First Minister, but the basic principle comes from St
Andrews and I do not think we should now move from it. It would be
highly disruptive. The reality is that such changes as those proposed

was voted on on both sides of the border and, as the noble Lord has
pointed out, the St Andrews agreement is in a
different category. As the noble Baroness pointed out, it was a
response to an urgent and difficult situation. It was not an agreement
dealing with things as one would ideally wish them to be, but an
agreement dealing with a very difficult situation. However, I take
issue with the noble Lord 
<?notus-xml column=56?>that there has not been progress. I understand frustration at lack of
progress—I think everyone who is involved with and visits
Northern Ireland might feel that frustration—but there is
progress. When I look back at what the Northern Irish devolved
Government was like in about 2000, maybe 1999, they have moved on
significantly in that time. With every year that passes, they become
more secure. As the noble Lord, Lord Browne, pointed out, this is the
longest period of stable government we have seen in a

the moment, it would reopen old debates, risk destabilising politics in

several things because there is an issue of fact that needs clarity
here? The current method of electing or identifying the First Minister

agreement. It was not discussed at St Andrews—let us be very
clear about that—but emerged after a deal between Sinn Fein and
the Prime Minister of the day. I want to make it absolutely clear that
it was not dealt with at St Andrews. Therefore, if we are to talk about
unpicking, the unpicking was the removal of the process that was voted
on by the people in 1998. However, it was never part of the St Andrews
agreement, which was an agreement between two Governments, not between
the parties. I want to make that absolutely clear, because if that is
the case, it makes a major difference. It emerged as a deal subsequent

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, during the passage of the then Crime and
Courts Bill through this House I asked the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of
Holbeach, who was answering that evening, what he would do in
circumstances where the National Crime Agency did not extend to
Northern Ireland. What would the Government do if they identified a
national threat in the event that the National Crime Agency did not
apply to Northern Ireland? His answer to me was that he would
“act responsibly”. Quite a lot of time has passed, and I
know that the Northern Ireland Office is in discussions with the Home
Office and that they are working in consultation in Stormont with the
parties that are objecting. I wish them well; I understand that it is a
very delicate matter. However, let us be absolutely clear about the
downstream consequences of this.</hs_para>

a large amount of time has passed since the establishment of the
National Crime Agency, but to replicate the services that would be
needed would cost the PSNI resources that it simply does not have and
never will. Even if it was able to do that, it would lack the
connectivity and intelligence that would be required in order for it to
act effectively<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:14:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
I therefore put to your Lordships that while everybody has been
prepared to be patient, to encourage and to wish the negotiations
well—I hope that they are progressing—I would be very
interested if the Minister could tell us what progress has been made.
Are we any nearer to getting this dealt with? Just as we will deal with

wrong about that, and I hope that I am. The other party that objected
to it has other reasons, and I hope that it will be possible to address
them. However, at the end of the day, our objective must be to have the
best security and anti-crime prevention that we can put in place. To
have this gap in Northern Ireland creates a vacuum, which will be
filled over time if it remains. However, I will hold the Government to
the commitment that they made through the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of

that on this side of the water there are people in senior positions in
government who do not realise what had to be done to reach
accommodations in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:17:34"></hs_TimeCode>. For
example, it was unthinkable, even in those days, that a
Government—in which the noble Lord, Lord Hurd, who is no longer
in his place here, served—would have embarked on a key issue of
security policy that involved the border area without any discussion
with the Government of the Republic of Ireland, and that was long
before many of the agreements with which the subsequent political
progress was made. The Labour Administration, particularly under Tony
Blair, would never have engaged in some kind of agreement on security
issues without discussing it with the Government of the Republic of
Ireland. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister had a very close
relationship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020316000041">When

the Police Service of Northern Ireland, we have one of the most
accountable police forces in the world, with constant checks and
balances, scrutiny and high-level review. With the introduction of the
National Crime Agency, this high level of scrutiny would continue. The
head of the National Crime Agency, under statute, would appear in front
of the Northern Ireland Policing Board once every year. Significantly,
the NCA could not operate in devolved matters at all without the
instruction of the chief constable. Despite these control mechanisms,
some politicians in Northern Ireland have constantly blocked attempts
to allow the full operation of the

been sounded by my noble friends Lord Empey and Lord Alderdice. There
can surely be no more important issue of concern to the whole United
Kingdom than the national security of us all. It is intensely worrying
that, in one part of our country, the national interest is not being
secured fully and effectively. That is the simple point at issue. The
principle is the same as applies to the amendment in my name to which
we are coming shortly. We have in this House the right to look to all
those involved in the Government and the law-making processes in
Northern Ireland to do everything possible. In no area is it more

sympathy with the amendment posed by the noble Lord, Lord Empey. He and
I have discussed this before. I regret that my experience of trying to
raise this issue with Ministers was identical to that of the noble
Lord, Lord Alderdice. I was leading for us on Home Office issues on the
then Crime and Courts Bill, and when this issue first came up I raised
it with Ministers on the Bill team. The advice I was given was not to
draw attention to it. That is pretty horrendous, because people knew
there were concerns and issues to be addressed. I believe that early
intervention and early political engagement from both Governments could
have addressed those
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:24:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020316000048">On
a number of occasions, on the Floor of this House and outside, I asked
Ministers about it and found myself in the curious position of

State at the briefing on Northern Ireland issues, I was told it was a
matter for the Home Office. So the NIO was telling me it was the Home
Office and the Home Office was telling me it was the NIO, and I was

does not mean disengagement. The British Government had a
responsibility when setting up the National Crime Agency—or, as
I now call it, the nearly-National Crime Agency, because it is not a
national crime agency—to ensure that very early on, when the
proposal was first discussed, there were discussions between both
Governments and between the political parties. I hold David Ford in
very high regard; I regard him as a friend. He is, however, one person
in one Government. In the old days, under the Labour Government, there
would have been political engagement and political discussion on
something as important as this. As the noble Lord, Lord Empey, and the
noble Lord, Lord Browne, have indicated, the difficulties and the
problems are not just for Northern Ireland, but also for those who are
genuinely trying to fight crime across the whole of the UK, who are

of this amendment, I have assumed that this is a probing amendment. It
was clear at Second Reading that your Lordships consider the role of
the National Crime Agency in Northern Ireland to be of great interest

clear, the National Crime Agency is operating in Northern Ireland, but
as a consequence of the Northern Ireland Executive’s failure to
agree to take forward a legislative consent Motion, the Agency’s
powers and activities in Northern Ireland to tackle serious and
organised crime are restricted. The NCA is providing support and
expertise to partners in Northern Ireland and continues to take forward
its own investigations within the scope of the limitations on its
powers and responsibilities. We, however, remain keen to extend its
remit to cover crime falling within devolved responsibilities, if
agreement can be reached on this within the Northern Ireland Executive;

say that the NCA has expertise that the PSNI cannot match. For example,
in fields such as cybercrime and in its connectivity with international
agencies it goes to places that the PSNI is not able to. However, I
hope the House will agree that it is equally important that this is
achieved with the agreement of the Northern Ireland Executive and

the issue of the will to succeed on this issue. I emphasise that
because this is a devolved process it is absolutely right that the
discussions were led by the Northern Ireland Justice Minister, David
Ford, to whom my noble friend paid tribute for his role in this.
Government intervention in the process, whether during the then Crime
and Courts Bill or now, would not be appropriate. Given the sensitivity
of this matter, which is so central to the devolution settlement, we
could have undermined discussions altogether. We must continue to
support David Ford in his efforts and certainly not do anything to
undermine them. He has continued to try to reach agreement with the
nationalist parties on this. The Policing Board itself is currently

want to make it absolutely clear what the NCA is still able to do.
While NCA officers are not able to be designated with the powers of a
Northern Ireland constable, NCA officers in Northern Ireland are able
to be designated with customs and immigration powers and will focus on
serious and organised customs and immigration crime. The NCA in
Northern Ireland still has tax powers under the Proceeds of Crime Act,
so will continue to be able to remove any ill gotten gains accumulated
through taxation, but civil recovery activity is restricted to
non-devolved investigations. Examples include using its customs powers
to target work on the importation of drugs and guns from outside the
UK, and using its immigration powers to target human trafficking in
Northern Ireland. Despite the considerable powers that the NCA still
has, an unavoidable consequence of the failure to get agreement is that
the capability of the agency in Northern Ireland is less than that
available in the rest of the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020316000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020316000057">Comments

substantial changes to the NCA arrangements to reflect the situation in
Northern Ireland. We remain hopeful that there will be further progress
in the future and that this is not a closed issue because we accept,

regard to this specific amendment, I will have to look at

correctly, that we could not, or would not, overrule the Northern

any devolved Administration. Devolution means that part of our
functions and powers are devolved, but it also means that they can be
undevolved. We have a convention to which we normally stick, and I
understand that. However, if the Minister is saying that the Government
will not introduce any legislation on this matter in Northern Ireland,
she is effectively giving Sinn Fein a veto over a crime issue. That is
a very disturbing comment. I will check the record tomorrow and, if
necessary, return to the issue at a later stage. However, when the
noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, answered my question on the Crime

if progress was not made, the Government would have to take the
national interest into account. That was the inevitable implication of

underperformance in this area in Northern Ireland, which is an
inevitable outcome of the agency not operating totally and without

else—like nature itself—will fill a vacuum. We have
enough people in Northern Ireland with certain skill sets. I need

has already been mentioned, it raises the same principle that lay at
the heart of the previous amendment—the incomplete
implementation of a matter of vital national interest throughout our
country. The amendment seeks to probe the Government’s response
to the Northern Ireland Executive’s failure to implement the
Defamation Act 2013—a failure for which the Executive have
provided no clear or convincing
explanation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:42:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I
introduced a short debate in Grand Committee back in June on this
issue. The Executive gave no account of their inaction then and have
not done so since. This has been a story of evasion and irresponsible
delay<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:42:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the momentous significance of last year’s Defamation Act, which
recently came into force in England and Wales, cutting them off from
Northern Ireland where libel law is concerned for the first time in
history. The Act makes the law cheaper and easier to use. It tackles
the dire impact of the old libel regime on free speech and updates an
antiquated area of law that was out of step with the rest of the world.
It is a liberalising, modernising law that will confer lasting benefits
throughout our society. It is wholly unjustifiable that the people of
Northern Ireland, an integral part of the United Kingdom, should be
excluded from the benefits and protections of this new law. It is
important that the damage that this will do should be clearly
understood. The Province’s exclusion will have harmful effects
on six main aspects of its internal
affairs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:43:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

seriously at risk. Some 4,000 people work in publishing in Northern
Ireland and another 2,000 work in the broadcast media. Some of them
will lose their jobs if media companies decide that it is too risky to
operate in a jurisdiction that stifles freedom of expression and then
move out of the Province. Secondly, thousands of ordinary
people—citizen journalists, casual bloggers, social tweeters and
those who produce news for their families on Facebook—will be
exposed to the intense dangers of costly libel actions that can wreak
great havoc on individual lives. Thirdly, new investment will be
deterred. The companies leading the digital revolution are unlikely to
invest money, which the Northern Ireland economy needs so badly for its
future success, while the Province retains a law of defamation that is
hopelessly out of date. Fourthly, those who teach in Ulster’s
great universities and colleges will be deprived of the new defences
for academic freedom that the Defamation Act confers. Will higher
education in Northern Ireland be able to maintain its international
reputation for excellence if academics face the threat of legal action
for voicing controversial or unconventional opinions? Fifthly, the
Executive’s failure to act means that UK publishers will face
difficult decisions. They will either have to edit each edition of
their newspapers separately in order to avoid being caught by outdated
libel laws or they will have to withdraw their papers from sale in
Northern Ireland. Sixthly, the Executive’s inaction is bad for
democracy in the Province. That is the inevitable consequence of laws
that inhibit investigative journalists because the dice are loaded in
favour of wealthy or powerful claimants and their lawyers. When those
under investigation hire lawyers, most regional and local newspapers
almost invariably react either by sanitising their reports or dropping
the
investigation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:45:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020326000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000117">6.45

these six implications of what the Executive have left undone matter
profoundly. However, there is an even more fundamental issue at stake.
The new dual system of defamation, overturning centuries of unity in
our country, will create doubt and confusion in an area of law where

Bew:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment, which is in my
name and those of the noble Lords, Lord Lexden and Lord Black. I
support it very much for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord Lexden,
has given. I declare an interest as I served on the Select Committee of
both Houses that worked on the defamation question in the year leading
up to the Defamation Act which has recently passed. The committee was
chaired by another Ulsterman, the noble Lord, Lord Mawhinney. Both of
us feel a certain pain that the one part of the United Kingdom in which
the Act is not effectively operating is the part from which we come. I
feel a particular pain on the grounds that the noble Lord, Lord Lexden,
has already referred to—that a key part of the Defamation Act
was to enhance academic
freedom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:49:42"></hs_TimeCode>. It
consequently means that my fellow academics at Queen’s
University in Belfast are now second-class citizens with respect to
academic freedom as it is now being defined and protected in the rest
of the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:49:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000017">There
is an important point here with respect to the recent Haass talks. One
of the key reasons why those talks failed in Belfast was around the
issue of dealing with the past. Do we honestly believe that the
antediluvian libel laws, which restricted freedom of certain key
questions with respect to the past in Northern Ireland, should be
maintained to improve understanding of the past? The idea is too
ridiculous to consider for a
minute<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:50:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000018">Although
I was deeply committed to the Defamation Act when it went through the
House, I fully accept and understand that there are serious reasons why
serious people had objections. I can respect that, but we are in a
changed situation. As far as the bulk of the United Kingdom is
concerned, this is now the law of the land. It places people in
Northern Ireland in a different situation; it is not simply a matter of
the merits or demerits of the old law. It is the new concrete situation
that has been created by the change in the rest of the United Kingdom
that I want to consider. On my way here I read the <I>Belfast
Telegraph</I> in which a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly
referred to the debate that he knew would take place here this
afternoon. That Member made a fair and certainly accurate point which I
accepted, that this is a devolved matter for the Assembly. However,
there are some things that are 
<?notus-xml column=67?>devolved matters for the Assembly which are, as it were, matters which
stay in Northern Ireland, if I can put it like
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:51:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000019">Whether
one approves or disapproves, the Northern Ireland Assembly’s
view on gay marriage is an issue that is internal to Northern Ireland.
Another issue that does not quite stay in Northern Ireland is the
position of the Northern Ireland Assembly on abortion, which
effectively means exporting many of Northern Ireland’s problems
to the United Kingdom. None the less it can be argued that there are
issues where the Assembly reserves its competence on devolved matters
which affect only the people of Northern Ireland. In this case there is
an “incoming” element—the United Kingdom media,
which have to operate within Northern Ireland, and the greater risk to
which they are now exposed. It has to be remembered that the people of
Northern Ireland have many virtues, but not being naturally litigious
is not one of them. I have put that as a double negative as I think
that it is the most polite and accurate way of stating
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:52:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000020">There
have been many major libel cases in Belfast over the years of the
Troubles in which very heavy costs were paid out by our national media.
Put ourselves in the position now of a Northern Ireland judge. In the
past a Northern Ireland judge at least had the comfort that his job was
to interpret the libel law as it existed throughout the rest of the
United Kingdom. If a case comes up tomorrow, the Northern Ireland judge
is now dealing with a much more difficult and complicated question. He
will be dealing with media produced in the rest of the United Kingdom
where certain assumptions now exist about what can and cannot be said
and operating and trying to deal with a legal problem in a part of the
United Kingdom where those assumptions do not exist. The Government
have to think seriously about the almost intolerable position that the
Northern Ireland judiciary will be placed in if it is left with this
status quo. I do not know quite how one makes these

my noble friend said, we last looked at it in a debate in June when I
set out from the perspective of somebody involved in the media the
profoundly damaging consequences of the Northern Ireland
Executive’s inexplicable decision not to implement the
Defamation Act in Northern Ireland. I do not need to go over that
ground again, not least because my noble friend has summarised it so
eloquently. I support absolutely his analysis of the six things that
will flow from this decision. There is certainly no doubt in my mind
that this quixotic decision will cost jobs. It will put off the vital
investment that is needed to create a sustainable economy based on
modern industries, and it will expose ordinary people in Northern
Ireland—anyone who uses social media, which I suspect is the
vast majority of the population there—to the intense dangers of
costly legal actions that can destroy
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:56:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000024">Three
things have happened since we had that debate in June that make the
case for action ever more powerful and urgent. First, as my noble
friend said, has been the strong response to the consultation on Mr
Mike Nesbitt’s Private Member’s Bill. It is a very
thorough and very well publicised exercise that has produced an
overwhelming response in favour of the Bill. I praise Mr Nesbitt for
the way in which he handled the consultation so magnificently. People
in Northern Ireland have clearly understood the dangers of the status
quo and the need to bring Northern Ireland’s libel laws into
line with England and Wales. The case was powerfully made out in the
<I>Belfast Telegraph</I> today, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord
Bew. So, the media are in favour of change. We now know that ordinary
people are in favour of change. Civic society in Northern Ireland wants
action, and international press freedom organisations have been queuing
up to support change. The only stumbling block appears to be the
Northern Ireland Executive, who, as my noble friend said, have never
produced one compelling argument in favour of their
position<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>. That
is the first thing. We now have a very clear view of public
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:57:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000025">Secondly,
since the debate, there has been the sealing of the royal charter on
press regulation. Since that took place in October, I understand that
the Northern Ireland Executive have decided to opt out of the
provisions, or rather not to opt in to them. I say that I understand
because it is not easy to discern how, when or why the
decision was taken. As noble Lords will be aware, I am no fan of the
royal charter—completely the opposite because I believe that it
has potentially long-term damaging consequences for press freedom. But
I have to set my personal views on that to one side. The
point is that the charter is now part of a hugely complex legal web,
including provision of exemplary damages in libel and privacy cases
that is now ensnaring the rest of the UK media. If Northern Ireland is
outside of that and outside of the Defamation Act, that will
produce massive legal uncertainty of the sort talked about by the noble
Lord, Lord Bew. There will be uncertainty for the media, for litigants
taking actions against newspapers, magazines or any other media, and
for the wider creative economy. Uncertainty is the enemy of the
law and it is also costly. It will cost jobs, as we have
heard, and it will cost extra money for those seeking 
<?notus-xml column=69?>legal redress. So the decision on the charter compounds the problem over
defamation in a way which will be deeply
destabilising<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:59:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020326000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000118">7

and most crucial point, which the noble Lord, Lord Bew, made, is that
the Defamation Act has now been implemented, which was not the case
when we last debated this matter. That means that many of the dangers
which I and others have been warning about move rapidly from the
theoretical to the real. The biggest risk, as has been alluded to by my
noble friend Lord Lexden, is to the future of media plurality in
Northern Ireland. As we all know, a healthy democracy requires a range
of different voices to flourish. Yet that is now in real jeopardy
because, in effect, we have two libel jurisdictions in the United
Kingdom. As a result, in a very short time, UK publishers will have to
confront a difficult choice. Either, as my noble friend Lord Lexden has
said, they will have to edit each edition separately for Northern
Ireland. That will often mean sanitising the copy, and readers and
viewers in Northern Ireland will not always get the full story that
people outside Northern Ireland might. Or else—perhaps simply
for reasons of cost, which is, of course, a big matter for many
hard-pressed media companies—they will have to contemplate
withdrawing newspapers from sale in Northern Ireland. That is a very
real issue and in many ways the clock is ticking so fast that we are at
five minutes to
midnight<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:01:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:00:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000027">If
Mike Nesbitt’s Private Member’s Bill does not
proceed—and it seems that the Northern Ireland Executive and
some of their friends in the Northern Ireland legal establishment will
always find ways to kill it—then we will have to take
legislative action here in order to avoid the very real dangers that
will be done to media plurality in a part of our country that
desperately needs it. I know that that sort of action is unprecedented,
but not to take action would be a deeply irresponsible act in itself. I

the original decision, was characteristically frank and honest in
indicating that there was heavy opposition to what is being proposed
here. When you get that sort of difficult situation, you must
resort—maybe that is the wrong word, but you must go
back—to basic principles. The basic principle is that there is
devolution in Northern Ireland. It is a difficult subject, but the
Assembly and the Executive will need to take full, political
responsibility for it. I have heard powerful pleas, but I am taken with
the honest assessment of the noble Lord, Lord Bew, that there are
serious differences and points of view on this. In that event, the
Assembly must make its own mistake—if, indeed, this is a
mistake. We have devolution, and devolution is the principle that we

it, I was struck by the very high level of expertise, and by the very
real concern felt by many noble Lords about the fact that the law on
defamation in Northern Ireland has not been reformed. My noble friend

extend the defamation law to Northern Ireland. He also emphasised legal

referred to the fact that there are also differences in defamation law
in Scotland. As the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, has pointed out, this is
the result of devolution. As a Minister, I can sympathise with the
frustrations of noble Lords about devolution. It may be that the
slowness of response in Northern Ireland is particularly frustrating on
occasions. However, it is essential that we respect the devolution
process, and part of that process is that you have different laws in
different parts of the country. I am not suggesting that I regard it as
a good thing that Northern Ireland has not updated its defamation law.
I do not regard it as a good thing at all that Northern Ireland is in
this position. However, it is important that we respect devolution and,
under the Sewel convention, decisions on whether legislation in
transferred areas should apply to Northern Ireland would normally fall

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be brief. The power to appoint
junior Ministers in Northern Ireland already exists. Junior Ministers
are appointed by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and,
while only two have ever been appointed in each Assembly and they have
always exclusively been in one department, the Department of the First
Minister and Deputy First Minister, that does not preclude them being
in other departments. Indeed, it does not prevent the appointment of
more than two. What I feel is lacking is that while junior Ministers
could be appointed to more than one department simultaneously, I want
to try to achieve in Northern Ireland the same thing as is available
here, and even in Dáil Éireann. You can have a Minister
who serves in more than one department, as we have in this House. The
noble Lord, Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, worked in the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign Office, and his
successor does the same. Moreover, there are other examples in the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020326000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000040">The one thing that a
junior Minister does not have is any executive authority. The junior
Minister works exclusively for the Minister whose department he or she
happens to serve in. What I am hoping to achieve is that, with the
agreement of the relevant Minister, some power could be devolved to the
junior Minister—they might be called a deputy Minister—so
that that person can carry out a specifically indicated function. I
shall give an example of what I am driving at. Years ago, we set up
what was called the West Belfast and Greater Shankill Task Force, which
was set up to deal with areas of deprivation. The thinking was that if
you could prove to people in such an area that devolution worked, you
would encourage support for it and you would improve the social and
economic circumstances of that community. Invariably, a number of
departments were involved. Two departments appointed the task force,
one for which I was responsible and one for which, I think, Mr Nigel
Dodds was then responsible. It meant that several departments were
involved. What we had was a ring-around-the-roses of all these people
being involved with the task force. While, obviously, the political
situation over devolution did not help, the fact was that even after
all those years, we were not able to get the outcome that we all
wanted.</hs_para>

thought it would be a good thing to be able to appoint a junior
Minister in more than one department and, with the consent of the
departmental Ministers, have some executive power in and of him or
herself. Currently, such power is not available to a junior Minister.
Executive power flows through the departmental Minister where the
person is based. I want to find a practical solution by having someone
in charge of tackling underachievement in particular areas, and for
that individual to be able to deliver that responsibility rather than
have it spread over a whole range of departments with different
budgets, funding priorities and so on. I am sure that, having been
there, the noble Baroness will know what I mean. That is the purpose of
this amendment. I beg to

Randerson:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for his amendment and I
recognise the importance of cross-government co-operation in addressing
certain challenges in which several departments have a role. Indeed, as
he has just said, there are several examples here in Westminster such
as the Minister of State for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims and
the Minister of State for Trade and Investment. It is plausible that we
should consider a similar approach in Northern Ireland, and the noble
Lord has already highlighted some of the areas in which it could be
most
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:18:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recall that this issue was debated when he was First Minister in the
Assembly in 1999, and a determination was made to appoint the junior
Ministers in the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First
Minister. Section 19 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 already provides
for what his amendment is intended to achieve. The section permits the
First Minister and Deputy First Minister to issue a determination to
appoint junior Ministers. It is conceivable that, in that
determination, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister could
specify that the junior Minister is appointed to lead on a particular
issue and across more than one department. That determination could,
for example, specify that a junior Minister would work alongside the
Ministers for Regional Development, the Environment and Agriculture on
issues such as—to take a very topical
example—flooding.</hs_para>

provides sufficient safeguards around the appointments of junior
Ministers. Subsection (4) requires that any determination on the part
of the First and Deputy First Ministers be approved by a vote of the
Assembly. As the Government read it, the amendment may open the way to
encroachment by junior Ministers on the authority of departmental
Ministers. That would be a significant departure from existing
structures. As to junior Ministers contributing in other ways to the
working of the Executive, the noble Lord’s points will have been
heard. I hope that the noble Lord will agree that this is a debate that
should now be taken forward in the Assembly. I hope that he will

course I want this to be debated in the Assembly, but I take issue with
the substance of her point that what we have currently does what I seek
to achieve. The point on which we differ is that you cannot
unilaterally give departmental power to a junior Minister. Each
departmental Minister has certain functions, and they cannot and should
not be usurped. An example is the attempt last year to usurp the
functions of the Minister for the Department of the Environment. It
would have to be clearly spelt out that no encroachment could be made
on the powers of a departmental Minister unless that Minister
consented, because the politics of this are very important. You cannot
have a Minister from one party come into a department and take part of
the departmental Minister’s powers away. That would be vey
dangerous. So I interpret things slightly differently from the noble

explain its actions and for the security forces to explain their
actions and be accountable for them. Yet the average individual who has
been a silent victim feels that they are not valued accordingly. For
example, recently some Sinn Fein figures who were actively

in discussing the needs of victims and survivors, two different issues
have been mixed. I think this affected the Haass process as well. The
first issue is the welfare, treatment, counselling and all that is
involved in helping individuals who have suffered as
victims—people who have been in bombings, shootings or attacks,
or have observed them, or who have been affected through their
families. These individuals need to receive appropriate care and
attention, which has not been
happening<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:29:35"></hs_TimeCode>. This
has never been given proper attention. I remember quite some time ago
putting two Written Questions to the Secretary of State asking if had
there had been any exploration of the sort of funds and resources that
were required in other countries to deal with these kinds of things.
The answer was no, it had not even been looked at.</hs_para>

that the care that individual victims need has not received the
attention that it ought to have had. The health service, perhaps even
more than the voluntary organisations, has not had the resources it
ought to have had. I say that as someone who set up and ran a centre
for psychotherapy to try to deal with a range of problems, including
some of these difficulties. However, that is a separate issue from how
a community as a whole deals with the impact of violence upon itself.
That is different in kind. The two things are confused all the time,
which is one of the reasons why we have not got anywhere with
addressing this issue. I do not want to say more because it is a major,
complicated and difficult issue, but I am quite clear that there are
two separate questions. One question is in many ways not frightfully
contentious, so it is surprising that so little attention has been paid
to it, but the other is more complex and difficult. This amendment does
not sufficiently distinguish between
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:29:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000053">The
second reason is that there is a kind of black and white clarity in the
amendment. That certainly applies in respect of certain individual
circumstances; there is no doubt about that. You can point to
particular circumstances in which it is clearly an iniquity that
matters are dealt with in the way that they are. However, big cases of
that kind do not necessarily make good law, because many smaller
circumstances would be swept into an amendment like this.

example, somebody can infringe the law in a minor way—maybe some
young person who has been drinking too much throws a stone
at a police car, or something like that—and there is a wholly
disproportionate response. There is no real threat to anyone but they
are shot dead or left brain-damaged. Would one say that there should be
absolutely no 
<?notus-xml column=76?>question of any kind of compensation for that young person and their
family because of some stupid thing that they did, when a wholly
disproportionate reaction was observed? This is the kind of real
problem that one has when one tries to put all the complexity of the
circumstances of conflict into a simple black and white amendment,
where you are either in or out. The reality is that things happen in
the dead of night, with big crowds of people and some having drunk too
much. A more recent example is perhaps of somebody involved in a flags
protest. They are breaking the law but some wholly disproportionate
kind of action is then taken. Is there to be no recognition of that at
all?</hs_para>

problem I have with this amendment. It deals in a simple black and

support the amendment, I do not want to fail to recognise that the
noble Lord, Lord Empey, is pointing to perhaps the most difficult and
complex, but least resolved and addressed, parts of the legacy of the
Troubles. That is what he is doing and he is absolutely right to do it.
It is a running sore that these issues have not received the attention
that they deserve in all the ways that I have described. However, for

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a very sensitive and
complex issue. Of all the meetings and conversations I had and events
that I went to when I was a Minister in Northern Ireland, the ones that
had the most profound effect on me were those during the years when I
was a Victims Minister from 2003 to 2006. If I look back, I think now
that I was singularly unequipped to deal with some of the issues that I
faced. People would tell me their life stories, what had happened to
them and about the impact on them and their families. They would come
from both sides of the community: I recall the anger of the Ballymurphy
victims as well as the quiet resilience of those RUC widows left to
bring children up on their own. Among all of them, I felt that it would
be very hard for me to define who was a victim or who felt they were a
victim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000058">I did
some of the work on the definition taken in 2006, although my right
honourable friend David Hanson took the order through. It is
extraordinarily difficult to try to define who is a victim and who is
not. I totally understand the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord
Empey, having spoken to so many people affected by physical and
psychological trauma and damage during the Troubles in Northern
Ireland. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, about
people’s ongoing needs, there is that difference between
individual needs and the collective needs of the community. I was also
Health Minister at the same time. Trying to provide an adequate health
service for the needs left by those 30 years is extraordinarily
difficult. The challenge has not yet been met, in respect of both
physical and mental health

who you talked to were scarred by what had happened to them and damaged
by what they had seen and heard; some were damaged by what they had
done themselves or by what members of their family had been involved
in. An extraordinarily wide range 
<?notus-xml column=77?>of people were considered to be victims and felt themselves to be
victims. That is why, in the 2006 Act, there was that fairly wide
near-attempt at a definition. The definition we take is of those who
felt that they had suffered as a consequence of those years. I am not
defining some as having suffered more than others—clearly some
have been through the most terrible and horrendous experiences and
others have been able to cope better with what they have experienced.
However, in each case, if somebody came forward and felt that their
life had been altered and that they had suffered as a result, whether
due to life-changing injuries or life-changing mental health issues, we
did not feel able then, and I still would not know how, to
differentiate any kind of

than 3,000 people lost their lives and thousands more were injured and

Northern Ireland speak with far greater authority and understanding,
and with direct experience, of the issues than I ever can, but our
approach has been consistent and ongoing in support of a comprehensive
and inclusive process to deal with the past. We stand by that and I
hope that the Assembly has also asked for the British Government to be
involved in that process. It would be a major step forward if the
Government were to take a lead. There needs to be an inclusive and
comprehensive process in Northern Ireland, covering the two areas that
the noble Lord spoke about: one dealing with the physical needs and the
other trying to help a community that is still scarred by what
happened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000061">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:36:11"></hs_TimeCode>

a white South African involved in the ANC who had come over to talk to
people. He commented on some people—white South
Africans—who were hedging their bets, as I think somebody in the
audience he was speaking to put it. Somebody said,
“They’re just trying to save their skins”. He
replied, “We’re all trying to save our skins”.
There is a very similar situation in this case, with a whole community
whose members are all trying to heal together. We have to have the
British Government at the heart of that, with the Irish Government.
There is a legacy of the Troubles that is difficult to address but,
collectively, it can be done. It is not easy—there is certainly
no consensus to start with and there are points at which it will be
very difficult to gain consensus along the way, but it may be gained on
very small areas.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Empey, has brought this amendment forward, but one
of the difficulties with it is that definition. One of the things we
looked at in 2006 was the issue of children whose family had perhaps
been involved in terrorist activities and who were orphaned as a result
or whose lives were changed. They were victims and, as children, were
innocent. Once you get into definitions, it does become more complex.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:37:44"></hs_TimeCode> remember a
particular case I dealt with where a mother wanted her son, who had
been accused of terrorist activities and had been shot by the Army, to
be vindicated. That has now been done and it was totally accepted that

for Victims and Survivors. Many noble Lords here today will have far
more direct knowledge than I about the impact of the conflict in
Northern Ireland on people’s lives over more than three decades.
I recognise that those of us who do not have personal experience of the
conflict must approach this debate with considerable humility and great
care. I recognise the concerns that the noble Lord is making clear here
today. Like the noble Baroness, I have met people in Northern Ireland

have had on their lives and the result of the conflict in terms of the
damage that it has done to them. These are people who still suffer

Lords will be aware of the recent talks chaired by Dr Richard Haass,
where the right approach to dealing with Northern Ireland’s past
was debated in detail. A key element of the approach taken during those
talks was that victims and survivors should be central to any efforts
to deal with the past. The Government commend the progress made by the
parties in Northern Ireland in dealing with these issues during the
Haass talks and I hope that progress will continue to be made in the
future. As I said earlier in this debate, there are still meetings

that progress will be

noble Lord, Lord Empey, has made a moving argument. However, the
Commissioner for Victims and Survivors is the responsibility of the

Government are particularly anxious not to cut across the initiatives
in the Haass talks. To address the issue here, in this Bill, might have
a negative impact on the ability of the parties in Northern Ireland to
develop an inclusive process of dealing with the past. I am sure that
noble Lords will agree that the all-party talks, building on progress
made by Dr Haass, still represent the best chance of making progress on

Lord Alderdice, made about the differences between the recognition of
the individual and the provision of services that can be made available
to that person as a victim. However, there is a growing recognition
that that has been an issue. My party leader, Mike Nesbitt, 
<?notus-xml column=79?>proposed at the end of last year a new mental health initiative where we
could perhaps teach the rest of the world the expertise that we have
developed in treating people because, sadly, we will all be facing the
downstream consequences of the trauma caused by Iraq and Afghanistan.
That will be coming before us and I do not think that, as a country, we
have any grasp as yet of the scale of what people will face. Even now,
30 or 40 years after they were involved in the conflict, people,
including those in the security forces, are still presenting with
trauma. The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, is a professional in this area

that whenever you try to define something it becomes very difficult to

examples that were perfectly fair and reasonable. I understand them

victims the most pain is what they see as the lack of equivalence

were the perpetrators. When they see politicians who openly admit to

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Faulks)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I have put down an amendment to the
Inheritance and Trustees’ Powers Bill that will amend the way in
which the level of the statutory legacy is set. As noble Lords will
know, the statutory legacy, referred to in the Bill as the fixed net
sum, is the sum awarded to a surviving spouse for his or her future
maintenance before any other part of an intestate deceased’s
estate is shared with any other beneficiary. It is therefore important
that it takes account of the prevailing economic
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000073">The
Bill as introduced required the Lord Chancellor to make an order
specifying the level of the statutory legacy at least every five years.
The proposed government amendment would sit alongside the existing
requirement 
<?notus-xml column=81?>but would oblige the Lord Chancellor to make an order short of the
five-year deadline if the level of the consumer prices index, known as
the CPI, rises by more than 15%. The purpose of this would be to allow
for the statutory legacy to be updated more frequently in times of high
inflation so that it more accurately reflects the cost of
living.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000074">The
CPI, which is published monthly by the Statistics Board, will be judged
to have risen by the requisite amount if a particular month’s

most recent order specifying the level of the statutory legacy was
made. It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:49:56"></hs_TimeCode> should
be noted that although the default position would be that the order
would raise the statutory legacy so that it is in line with the rise in
CPI, the Lord Chancellor will still be able to amend the level of the
legacy in some other way. However, if he chooses to do this, he must
first submit a report to Parliament setting out his reasoning for doing
so. If an order is made because the CPI has risen by the necessary
amount, this will signal the start of another five-year period within
which another order must be
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000075">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:50:33"></hs_TimeCode>

things go out of one’s mind so quickly that I have had to
refresh my mind as to what took place at the two meetings that we have
had. At our previous meeting on 13 November, the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, asked why the fixed net sum should be reviewed only every five
years and not annually. The noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, strongly
supported that
suggestion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>.
Professor Cooke said that she would look into why the Law Commission
had come up with the figure of five years in the first place. In her
letter of 28 November, she explained the Law Commission’s
reasons: on the evidence that it had received, five years was a
compromise

the time of our next meeting on 16 December, the noble Viscount had
drafted his amendment, but it contained two, quite separate features.
It contained, first, the requirement of an annual review such as we had
discussed at our first meeting, but it also contained the new feature
of a compulsory order if the consumer prices index should increase by
more than
15<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020326000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-0002.htm#14020326000079">There
was support for an annual increase from the noble Lord, Lord Beecham,
but doubts were expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I took
the same 
<?notus-xml column=82?>view as the Law Commission; in other words, that an annual review was
too frequent, certainly if it led to an annual revision of the fixed
net sum. There was very little, if any, discussion of what is now
before your Lordships; that is, the proposal for a compulsory review if
the index rose by more than 15%—I think that a passing reference
to it was made by the noble Lord, Lord

due course, the noble Viscount sought leave to withdraw his amendment,
but said that he would come back on Report. It is now proposed by the
Government that we should accept the second half of the noble
Viscount’s amendment but not the first—I think that I
understand the Minister right in saying that. There is to be a
compulsory review if the consumer prices index is increased by 15%, but
there is to be no annual

this new amendment now before your Lordships, confined as it is to the
compulsory feature, was not considered in any way by Professor
Cooke—at least not to my knowledge. However, it seems a sensible
amendment, and I cannot imagine the Law Commission, had it been asked
for its views, having any objection. It makes sure that the Lord
Chancellor will in only limited circumstances be, as it were, brought
up to the mark, even though he will then—again, if I understand
the noble Lord correctly—have discretion as to the amount. In my
view, this represents an improvement to the Bill and I therefore

new paragraph 3A(1)(a). When does the figure become
“available” within the meaning of the provision? Does it
mean published or “available” to the public? The figure
must be available to others privately before it is published. I do not

Mr Nugee, who gave evidence to the Committee. I have to say
that he received the same fee for his services as the Minister receives
for his in his present capacity, and I am obliged to Mr Nugee for his
advice. Having considered it, I am not proposing any further amendments
today. He would perhaps be inclined to support such amendments but,

the original effect of Clause 1 and the amendment. I assume, but
perhaps wrongly, that Clause 1 deals with the situation that the
amendments now seek to modify. I just hope that the provisions are

further our discussion on the impact of Clause 1 and the

situations. One will be governed by one rate of interest, as specified
in Clause 1, and the other will be covered by these amendments. This
raises a further question of why there should not be consistency, in
terms of the interest to be calculated, in respect of what appear to be
two separate situations. If they are not separate situations, there is
a degree of confusion; if they are separate, there needs to be a
rationale for having two different rates of interests. I invite the

which equipment to be used by our Armed Forces can also be sold to

makes a valuable contribution to our export earnings. Such exports also
provide us with important links, influence and contacts with other

defence procurement arrangements, we need to ensure that an outside
company operating a GOCO contract is mindful of the importance of
defence exports and continues to give this area of activity the
priority it needs. Perhaps the Minister can say whether the setting up
of a DE&amp;S as a bespoke central government trading entity from
April, with new freedoms, flexibilities and private sector support,
will or could lead to any change in approach as far as the potential
for defence exports is concerned.</hs_para>

He spoke about the premises, and he raises important points, but those
are points you deal with in contracts, when you have a

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:38:09"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, these
amendments have enabled the Committee to have a debate on Clause 1. As
has been identified, Clause 1 is the key clause in Part 1 of the Bill,
and it is important that we consider it in detail, because it will
enable the Secretary of State to contract with the company for the
provision of defence procurement services, should that be the way
forward that is eventually agreed. It is also the clause on which most
of the rest of Part 1 hangs. The amendments we will be discussing today
have highlighted some very important issues and the reasons behind them
have been clearly and comprehensively covered by the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser, and my noble friend Lord Palmer of Childs
Hill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020310000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020310000014">Amendment
1 relates to the GOCO acquiring rights over the premises and property
used by today’s Defence Equipment and Support organisation and
ensuring that assets are properly maintained and managed. I agree with
the intent behind this latter point as it recognises the importance of
ensuring that effective arrangements are in place to ensure that any
such 
<?notus-xml column=4?>assets continue to be properly managed. Clause 1(1) specifically makes
it clear that the provisions within Part 1 of the Bill will apply only
when three clear conditions have been met. The first condition is that
the Secretary of State makes arrangements with a company—in
other words, the GOCO—for the delivery of the defence
procurement services currently undertaken by DE&amp;S within the
Ministry of Defence. The second condition is that the GOCO acquires
from the Secretary of State rights in or over premises and property
used by DE&amp;S. The third condition is that the GOCO becomes the
employer of some or all of the civil servants employed by DE&amp;S
immediately before the company becomes their employer.</hs_para>

that, although the GOCO will be given the right to use existing
DE&amp;S property, the ownership of the assets themselves will not
change. In the vast majority of cases this means that ownership will
continue to lie with the Ministry of Defence and the management of the
assets will be the responsibility of the Defence Infrastructure
Organisation. Amendment 1 seeks to make the acquisition of rights over
existing DE&amp;S premises and property by the GOCO,</hs_para>

fully support the intent behind the amendment it is simply not required
as the issue will be more effectively and better addressed in the
contract between the GOCO and the MoD and on a case-by-case basis in
the individual leases or
agreements.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14020310000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020310000016">The
premises and property occupied by the GOCO will remain the property of
their existing owners, which in the majority of cases will be the
Ministry of Defence. The GOCO’s rights and obligations in
respect to using these assets will be agreed with the MoD and set out
in the GOCO contract and the relevant lease or agreement. This will
include conditions on maintenance and upkeep, as normal in a commercial
contract or lease. The Defence Infrastructure Organisation within the
Ministry of Defence will continue to be accountable for the delivery of
infrastructure services, maintenance and upkeep. However, in some cases
it is possible that responsibility may be contracted to the GOCO in due
course. In conclusion, although the amendment raises some excellent
issues, I must resist it for the reasons I have just set
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020310000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020310000017">I turn
now to Amendment 2. Its purpose is to prevent the Secretary of State
commencing the establishment and operation of a GOCO under Part 1 of
the Bill until he has published guidance on the operation of the
contract. In particular, the amendment proposes that this guidance
should include the system by which available defence contracts will be
advertised to potential bidders and how any follow-on GOCO shall
produce and report annually against progress on an export strategy. The
amendment seeks to address concerns raised during the oral evidence
sessions in the other place about a possible lack of visibility on how
the contract will work, particularly in relation to how defence
contracts will be placed, and about ensuring that the new GOCO pays
sufficient regard to wider defence industrial policy issues, such as
the exportability of equipment. The concern was that the GOCO would 
<?notus-xml column=5?>be focused solely on delivering equipment more cheaply and would not
have to take into account other aspects of our industrial
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020310000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020310000018">It is
our intention that the GOCO will act as the Secretary of State’s
agent when contracting for defence equipment and support. This means
that the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Public
Contracts Regulations 2006 and the Defence and Security Public
Contracts Regulations 2011 will apply in the same manner as they do
today. This includes advertising in the Official Journal of the
European Union where required. MoD commercial policy on advertising
defence contracts will also continue to apply. In addition, it is to be
remembered that any contract entered into by the GOCO to deliver
defence equipment, support, logistics and services will be entered into
by the GOCO as agent on behalf of the MoD, which will remain a
counterparty to defence
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020310000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020310000019">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:39:17"></hs_TimeCode>
is also our intention that the strategy for wider defence industrial
policy and exports remains with Government, but supported by the GOCO
providing defence procurement services under contract, including
providing support to Government marketing of defence materiel at
defence exhibitions and shows; managing the provision of defence assets
and resources to support defence export opportunities,
including assistance with export licence applications; and providing
recommendations to government on export strategy and
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:45:13"></hs_TimeCode>, a point
that the noble Lord raised. The GOCO will therefore not be required to

of Amendment 3 is to prohibit the sale of financial securities in the

result in a change of majority ownership. The amendment deals with a
perfectly understandable desire to protect national security arising

subsequently selling their stake to other less desirable companies with
national security implications. I understand these concerns and agree

conclusion, the amendment is not required because, although the
underlying concern is fully appreciated, it does not recognise the
complexities of change of 
<?notus-xml column=6?>ownership and sale of financial securities in the context of the
proposed contracting structure either now or in any new arrangements.
These complexities can best be dealt with in contracts that can be
drafted and negotiated to meet specific requirements. There is no
necessity for a legislative provision to address the
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020310000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020310000024">The
purpose of Amendments 4 and 5 is twofold. First, they seek to put in
place additional security arrangements should the contractor be a
non-UK company. Secondly, they seek to disqualify from the directorship
of the GOCO any individual who is involved in the provision of defence
equipment or services in any other company in the defence industry. I
would like to reassure noble Lords that, although we have concluded
that these amendments are not required, it is because extensive,
effective checks and balances are either already in place or will be
put in place within the GOCO contract and that the risks in question
are already, therefore, being effectively managed through more
appropriate

amendments also seek to ensure that the GOCO cannot take advantage of
its privileged position to exert influence over British defence
interests and to prevent the company’s directors, whether or not
it is UK-registered, having conflicting interests in other defence
companies. Amendment 4 seeks to make it necessary for the GOCO to
include a number of mandatory obligations on the contractor. The first
requires that non-UK companies must establish “special security
arrangements” for the operation of the contract. Amendment 5
provides a definition of “special security arrangements”
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14020310000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020310000073">“a

second and third obligations seek to disqualify from appointment to the
GOCO directors who have conflicts of interests, because they are also
directors of, or have financial interests in, other defence companies.
For example, this would mean that the CEO of BAES could not hold a
directorship within any company associated with the GOCO. The MoD
governor will monitor any changes to share ownership and directorship
to identify any major changes that might introduce conflicts of
interest. Ultimately, should it be required, the MoD will retain and be
able to use appropriate change of control provisions within the

Reading on the Government’s decision no longer to proceed with
their then plans for the GOCO option but to continue nevertheless with
Part 1 remaining in the Bill. It was not made clear then why Part 1 was
still relevant or needed and, in my opinion, that remains the

1 is not about some minor change, it is about a major change to the
£10 billion annual defence procurement arrangements and
procedures, a change to an as yet untried and untested way of doing
defence procurement not only in this country but in any other country
in the world. The Government now intend to go down the road of further
developing DE&amp;S+, something which one might have thought they would
have done before deciding whether the GOCO option should be considered.
Surprisingly, the further development of the DE&amp;S+ organisation
will be under the leadership of someone who, it has been claimed, does
not actually believe that it is the best way forward but favours the
GOCO

suspects that that decision has been made at least in part because the
view of that individual reflects the Government’s stance, a
stance that also involves putting in place the necessary legislative
provision to proceed with the GOCO option at some time in future, but
with the added advantage for a future Government of being able to make
the change with the minimum of further scrutiny and challenge by
Parliament. There can, after all, be little or no effective scrutiny
now of Part 1. There is a limit to the amount of hard information that
the Government can provide about why the GOCO option would be better or
what the financial advantages would be compared to other options,
because we did not even get to this stage of having two or more private
consortia willing to tender and set out their stall, a development

then are the Government persisting with the retention of Part 1 when,
even on their own admission, nothing will happen that needs the powers
contained in Part 1 this side of a general election? Part 1 is not
about giving this Government statutory powers that they plan to use; in
fact, it is the exact opposite, it is about giving statutory powers
that this Government have now explicitly said that they will not be

I fear that no soothing or calm words from the Minister about what

there might be will alter that fact, not because such words would not
be genuinely meant, but because nothing the Minister says commits the

ahead in circumstances that are currently unknown without having to
come back to Parliament with a Bill so that they can be made to justify
their proposals in detail in the light of the circumstances at the

not even have considered outsourcing through a GOCO until all options

the defence industry. Such decisions can have international and
strategic implications on collaborative projects, for example. It is
also the case that the provision of Armed Forces equipment involves
uncertainty over both the cost and capability, now and over some years,
of cutting-edge technology. This has to be capable of being upgraded or
adapted as necessary to meet the increasing sophistication of the
equipment deployed in the future by those we might confront in
differing conditions in different parts of the world. In addition, the
effectiveness of equipment used by our Armed Forces can only be
definitively assessed once it has been used in

support the idea and concept of a GOCO. However, I also recognise the
powerful case made by my noble friend in relation to secondary
legislation. We should consider the GOCO because something radical
needs to be done about defence procurement. I was Secretary of State
for Defence for two and a half years, too brief a period to get to
terms with the scandal that has been the continuing story of defence
procurement in this country. The story of cost overruns and time
overruns is deeply disturbing and
worrying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000003">Over
the past weekend, I took part in a security conference in Munich. There
was a special session with a number of talented and experienced people
talking about European defence and the crisis of diminishing defence
budgets in the face of both existing and emerging threats. I made the
point in that discussion that we were unlikely to get defence budgets
stabilised or increased. Unless the case can be made to the general
public that there are threats that need to be dealt with, defence
budgets will continue to go down. At the moment, advocacy of the need
for defence is missing.</hs_para>

case is consistently undermined by the fact that we do not use existing
defence budgets properly or effectively. First, there is a multiplicity
of defence projects across Europe which duplicate in many areas what we
could do; a focus on items of capability which are related to the Cold
War and not to future threats; and the sheer number of tanks and
hopeless aircraft in the European arsenal which relate to
yesterday’s enemy and not to the future. Secondly, and
importantly, a large amount of money is wasted on the way in which we
procure defence. As Secretary of State, I thought it was important that
we should deal with that issue and look at it radically. In the
strategic defence review of 1998, which I supervised, we made radical
changes to defence procurement. I am sad that I did not stay there long
enough to pursue it. My successors also tried and failed to get to
grips with it as well. The term “smart defence” was
coined by me at a press conference during my time at the Ministry of
Defence, but it has become less and less smart as time has
passed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000005">The
saga continues and will do so until something radical is done. The
thinking at that time was put together by me and my special adviser,
Bernard Gray. He was employed by me—I took him away from the
<I>Financial Times</I>, where he was the defence editor, in order to be
my special adviser—and I frankly admit that we would not have
had such a good and long-lasting defence review if it had not been for
Bernard Gray’s clear thinking and his powerful purpose during
that time. People criticise him now, but I believe that he
is  
<?notus-xml column=15?>one of the few people who has the intellectual grasp and dynamic
conviction to drive through the required changes. The noble Lord, Lord
Levene, was appointed by Lady Thatcher to look at defence procurement,
and he made a good fist of it then, but again he moved on before it
could be fully put into practice. If my private sector experience since
I left NATO has taught me anything, it is that execution is a critical
area to focus on to get outputs instead of just excellent
inputs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000006">The
GOCO concept is certainly radical—and my noble friend is right
that it is in many ways untried—but many people are watching us
because many countries have exactly the same problem. We have to look
at that. It is sad that the process failed, and that only one
competitor—if that is the right word—was left standing at
the end, but the process produced a number of proposals, as part of the
tendering, that indicated that major savings could be made. There may
only have been one left at the end of the day, but each competitor put
forward proposals that would have saved the taxpayer money and made
sure our troops got equipment much more on time. DE&amp;S+ is second
best, but it has to be tried, given the situation. The radical nature
of what we have to do is utterly justified by the fact that our troops
do not get the equipment at the right time and in the right form, and
the taxpayer also pays well over the odds for it. If we do not think
radically, the same old mess will
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000007">However,
my noble friend has made a powerful case for the GOCO, having been
shunted into a siding, remaining there until it is a reality and we
have had time to test it properly—and secondary legislation is
not the right way to do that. Therefore, Amendment 25 is a
good way of making sure that when the day comes, as I am sure it will,
when we go down the GOCO route, there will be the proper scrutiny that
the idea
deserves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Roper" PimsId="452" UID="14020323000152" xid="1155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000152">Lord

His points about the gap between now and when the GOCO comes into
effect are important; that is why I asked the Secretary of State, when
he came to see some of us, for an assurance that there would be an
opportunity for Parliament to make a clear decision before Part 1 came
into operation. That is why the Minister tabled Amendment 24,
suggesting that there would have to be affirmative Motions in both
Houses. My noble friend Lord Palmer and I have added our names to that,
because it is in response to the request that we made to the Secretary
of State. Since then the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has tabled Amendment

useful between now and Report to consider the value and possibilities

of the House of Commons, of any proposal at the time when it is put
forward. The super-affirmative procedure is a useful development of
recent years, and there is a case for its
consideration.</hs_para>

Palmer of Childs Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I will add a few points.
At Second Reading, I said that I understood the weaknesses in Part 1
but wanted it to remain part of this legislation. I have not changed my
mind on that. I thought the words of the noble Lord, Lord Robertson,
about the scandal of defence procurement summed that up. Coming into
this much more recently, it was clear to me with my experience of
procurement that it was not fit for purpose. I am not blaming anyone
for that: many people tried to change it, including some noble Lords in
this Room, but were not able
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000011">The noble
Lord, Lord Rosser, made the point about this being a stalking horse. In
fact, the word used was “baseline”. The question raised
by many noble Lords in previous debates was why two of the three
bidders for the GOCO came out of the bidding. In my view, they must
have realised that they could not work out the baseline—that is,
the actual cost of running the department. Numerous sorts of
contracts—even contracts with the same companies and
contractors—are done under different agreements and bases.
Therefore, two of the bidders left probably because they did not feel
they could see where the profit was with any degree of certainty. Left
with only one bidder, the Secretary of State was clearly right to say
that one could not go forward with a GOCO at that stage. However, as my
noble friend Lord Roper said, a great achievement was reached by some
of us who spoke with my noble friend the Minister and the Secretary of
State about having a sunrise clause—that is, Clause 24. That
means that it has to come back to both Houses before you proceed with a
GOCO. Whichever Government are in power when that happens, that will
give them a big
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000012">The
noble Lord, Lord Robertson, spoke very warmly about Mr Gray, the Chief
of Defence Materiel. I have only come to this more recently and
probably never saw all the good things that the gentleman did. We are
in a new ball game now. DE&amp;S+ will come into force only in April
and will probably get going properly only by the autumn. Mr
Gray’s contract ends on 31 December 2014. He might well apply
for the new chief executive post thereafter—that is of course
everybody’s right, and the employer has every right to decide
who it should be. However, this is purely a run in, using Mr
Gray’s experience in the coming months to help set up DE&amp;S+,
and it is obviously in the future as to who that person or persons will
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000013">A very
good question was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, about the
freedoms agreed with the Treasury. I hope my noble friend the Minister
when he replies can give some assurances on what levels of payment the
Treasury will allow to be made to senior employees of the MoD. Also,
why does he believe that the super-affirmative Motion is not needed
with Amendment 24—in other words, why should we go with
Amendment 24 and not Amendment 25? I look forward to my noble

reply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Levene of Portsoken" PimsId="1478" UID="14020323000154" xid="1311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000154">Lord
Levene of Portsoken (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I can claim to have
spent quite a lot of time working on this particular issue, having held
the post of Chief of Defence Procurement for six years. The noble Lord,
Lord Robertson, was kind enough to pay tribute to some of the work I
did but said that I did not stay 
<?notus-xml column=17?>around long enough to finish it off. I was actually there for six years.
If anybody could look through the results of the Procurement Executive,
as it was called at the time, they would see that at the end of those
six years as compared with the beginning we had actually resolved most
of the problems. I say that without fear of contradiction because if
anyone consulted the report prepared by the National Audit Office at
that point they would find that for the first time the outturn of the
budget matched what we expected it to be and that contracts were being
delivered on
time.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020323000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000145">4.30

the magic formula? It was to try to even up the negotiations between
the suppliers on once side and the buyer—the Government,
Ministry of Defence, the Armed Forces—on the other. There were a
few battles during that period but we seemed to have got it right. Even
some of the most implacable foes of the policy that we were trying to
introduce, at the end of the day accepted that we were, in fact, doing
the right thing. A side issue was the enormous success of the defence
export side of the industry which found that it was far better able to
sell its equipment because the terms on which it had been supplying it
to the Ministry of Defence were no longer so-called sweetheart terms
but tough, negotiated terms. This made the firms much more competitive
than the companies also in the industry in other countries.</hs_para>

through a combination of the late Baroness Thatcher and the noble Lord,
Lord Heseltine, at a time when they were actually speaking to each
other, to try to bring in a more commercial element into the work. I do
not claim any genius for having done this; it was simply to run the
operation on commercial terms, and it is a business involving one party
buying equipment and the other one selling it. Where had been the
problem? It was not in the civil servants’ and serving
officers’ understanding of the equipment, which they understood
well enough. However, they had not been trained in commercial
negotiation. That was the one element of the puzzle, if you like, that
I brought to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000017">I was the
first person who ever introduced a GOCO into the Ministry of Defence.
Before I started on procurement, I was given the task of trying to sort
out the problems that had existed in the naval dockyards at Rosyth and
Devonport since the time of Samuel Pepys. We managed to resolve them by
taking away the management of those dockyards from what had been an
extraordinarily bureaucratic organisation and giving it to two very

those dockyards. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, will
remember how things changed in Rosyth. That worked very well.</hs_para>

implacably opposed to the idea of a GOCO for procurement because it is
not the right place in which to use it. It works well in an industrial
operation such as a dockyard but does not work well as a commercial
negotiator. What are needed are the skill of the serving officers
within the Armed Forces and those who are seconded to the Ministry of
Defence, and the skills of the Civil Servants, particularly 
<?notus-xml column=18?>the technical ones who understand the equipment that they are buying.
That leaves just the element of commercial skill on top, which is what
I was asked to bring in, and which I did. Although we have yet to hear
what they are, I believe that with the new-found freedoms that we
understand the Treasury has agreed, the Ministry of Defence will be
allowed to negotiate and involve a small number of people with
commercial experience at the top. That will work.</hs_para>

best way to go and, as I understand it—although it is complex
for everyone—that is what DE&amp;S is intended to bring in. I do
not believe that it right to bring in a GOCO. We cannot discount the
fact that no one else in the world has brought in a commercial
organisation to run their procurement. If no one else wants to do it,
why do we want to do so? DE&amp;S+, which we have now ended up with,
with a suspension of any move towards a GOCO, is the right thing to do.
Although perhaps few people know this, the noble Lord, Lord Roper, who
sitting on my left, used to teach me. He may recall that that was the
sort of thing that he would have taught me at the time. If we stick
with DE&amp;S+, I would agree entirely that it would be good to shelve
permanently the idea of bringing in a GOCO and leave it as another
issue. If a future Government want to bring one in, that is entirely up
to them, but we should not have this sort of trap door through which it
can escape, if someone has the right key. We are now in the right place
and we should stay
there.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_03_PT_1/EAB53158C54A5917E56D7D0D9B9B3471486B48A6" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 February 2014">Monday,

Bach (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall not speak about the
advantages or disadvantages of a GOCO; I remain fairly neutral on the
issue. I have listened with great interest to the very good speeches
that we have heard so far on this clause stand part debate started by
my noble friend Lord Rosser. What concerns me is the point about an
affirmative order being somehow a solution to this problem.</hs_para>

will not speak with my ex-Minister for Defence Procurement hat on at
this stage, although there is plenty that I could say and would like to
say. I am concerned about statutory instruments being used in
Parliament in both Houses as a way of holding Governments to account.
My experience is that orders, whether negative or affirmative, are
useful and the debates that follow from them are often vital when
legislation is eventually brought into effect. My concern is that they
are no way for Parliament to stop something happening that should not
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000022">I
speak from experience. This is not a boast but I am one of the few
Members of this House who has successfully won a fatal Motion on an
affirmative order. There are others on all sides of the House, but it
is a very rare event. It happened a few years ago, on a completely
different subject from this one, to legislation which required an
affirmative order but was resisted. The House voted on that occasion by
a very small majority not to pass the affirmative order. The
consequences of that for the cause that I was espousing were probably
worse than if I had not won that vote. The Government decided that they
would do absolutely nothing about the fact that the affirmative order
had been voted against and so the previous position then 
<?notus-xml column=19?>applied. It was a worse position than the one I was trying to get and on
which the House had supported me. Since then, forgive me, I have been
slightly sceptical—even cynical, sometimes—about how
effective opposing affirmative orders can be. We know that we can
oppose them, regret them or just have a debate on them, whichever
either House decides to do, but the effect is nearly always the same:
the Government get their way. The primary legislation is there and it
is extremely hard—often impossible—even if the primary
legislation needs to be amended by the affirmative order, for that to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:38:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000023">All
I am saying in this debate is please do not choose an affirmative order
as a way to get around this issue. Frankly, once you have passed
legislation that includes a GOCO, if that is what the House decides to
do, it will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for either House
of Parliament to change the

the Armed Forces will have much more say over the amount of money that
may be spent on their equipment, and therefore they may take more of an
interest in the detail of the procurement side than was true in my day.
Nevertheless, it is important that they have confidence that whatever
system is going to procure their equipment has general support
throughout the country and throughout government. At the moment we have
two propositions, neither of which seems to be making good headway. The
GOCO has certainly made no headway and it remains to be seen how well
the DE&amp;S+ will go—I even have doubts about that—but,
of the two, I prefer it the GOCO.</hs_para>

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I was the last defence
procurement Minister in the previous Government. It is too early to
make definitive judgments about how well-based were the projects for
which I was responsible because some of them were quite long term. As
far as I know, most of them are doing well and are on track and on
time. They include the A400M, the Typhoon Tranche 3, the Chinook
contract—where the Government, sadly, cut the numbers from 22 to
12 —the Puma upgrade, the Scout vehicle and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000028">However,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:41:06"></hs_TimeCode> inherited a
number of contracts which were the subject of substantial cost and time
overruns. They were originally signed in the late 1990s. I will not
make party-political points by saying exactly when they were signed now
because otherwise you will think that I am making a party-political
speech, which I certainly do not intend to do. Those errors were based
on a fundamental mistake, which is to think that there is one simple
formula for defence procurement. There have been arguments for many
years, for generations, about whether you should have cost plus,
competition or fixed-price contracts. The answer is that all these 
<?notus-xml column=20?>formulas are appropriate in certain circumstances. However, the great
mistakes were made on projects such as Astute and Nimrod, which
involved new technology and new developments—a new generation of
reconnaissance aircraft in one case and hunter-killer submarines in the
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000029">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:42:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:45:22"></hs_TimeCode>
was a fundamental mistake to think that those procurements could be
conducted on a fixed price because, when you are at the frontiers of
technology—I said this on Second Reading—by definition
you do not know what problems you are going to encounter and how much
time and money will be needed to resolve them. If you ask a contractor
to come up with a fixed price it will either be crazily high to cover
all possible risks to himself or, more likely, if he thinks that being
a national provider he is going to get the contract anyway, he will
come up with an unrealistically low price, knowing that he can
renegotiate more favourable terms once the Government and the MOD are
committed to that contract because ultimately the Government have to
have that capability
delivered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000030">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:43:50"></hs_TimeCode>
is the phenomenon we suffered from with those two
disastrously-conceived projects, although the capability was absolutely
necessary. It was a great mistake for the Government to get rid of the
MRA4 when they came into power. The Astute programme has continued and
is delivering results, and I am very glad about that. The MRA4,
however, was a great error. If you have a first of class of a major
aircraft or naval vessel—a major platform—an absolute
rule is that that is inevitably going to be a prototype. You cannot
actually call it a prototype because you cannot build a combat aircraft
for £100 million, or a Type 45 destroyer for £1 billion,
or an Astute class submarine for £1.2 billion or £1.5
billion and then throw it away. So it is not going to be a
prototype.</hs_para>

are going to make some mistakes in building it the first time round.
You will need to make amendments and changes which you had not
originally foreseen and these will all add to costs and time. The only
solution is to have a version of cost plus during that period for the
first of class. Subsequently, when you have an idea of the technical
issues and have resolved them, you can refine the thing down and ask
for a fixed price. It must be a sophisticated version of cost plus and
the formula that I found most useful—we have got it now for the
Astute programme—is a target price with an incentive for coming
in under the target price; a share of the over-run if it is above the
target price; and a completely open book policy so that there is a
genuine sense of teamwork between customer and supplier.
Those<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:45:25"></hs_TimeCode> formulas
can work. One has to be quite flexible about this and not believe that
there is some perfect, platonic solution to defence
procurement.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020323000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000146">4.45

Reading I explained why I was against the GOCO in principle and the
noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has repeated some of the arguments that we
both used at Second Reading. The most important one is, of course, that
defence procurement should remain a core business of the MoD. I have
never believed in a GOCO. It has always seemed to me to be an expensive
solution; something which would add 
<?notus-xml column=21?>rather than reduce cost and would deprive the MoD, the defence
procurement Minister and the Government as a whole of the flexibility
which is so essential. It is essential because the threat changes, or
the enemy changes, or the enemy changes his tactics, or new
opportunities open up for international collaboration. One needs to be
extremely flexible and able to change the system quite rapidly. One
needs to be able to steer the

cannot do that if one has made a contract with some GOCO under which,
for a whole year, it has defined tasks to complete and it gets a
penalty paid to it if you make any changes in the specification. For
all those reasons, I have always thought it is a great mistake to go
the GOCO route. We would have greatly regretted it if we had gone the
GOCO route and we will greatly regret it if we go that route
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000034">The only
sensible argument in favour of it is that it would enable us to hire
people in the DE&amp;S or in the GOCO at market rates, rather than
being constrained by civil service pay. It would be utterly ridiculous
to go for a GOCO merely to achieve that objective, which could
perfectly well be achieved on the basis of DE&amp;S+. Indeed, I hope
that that is what DE&amp;S+ is substantially about. The MoD already
pays people, including the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and Mr Gray,
who has been referred to, on the basis of salaries which have nothing
to do with the Civil Service pay scale, so I do not see that as a good
argument.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000035">I am
against the GOCO in principle, as I have said before, but, as my noble
friend Lord Bach, has just said, there is an argument which goes above
and beyond the issue of defence procurement, significant and weighty as
that is for the national interest, about the way in which we legislate
here. It is fundamentally wrong simply to give a future Government a
blank cheque and say that Parliament will allow any Government in the
future to come back without full parliamentary scrutiny and go in for a
major reform of this kind. My noble friend Lord Rosser has made a
number of those arguments so I do not need to repeat them. It would be
a very unfortunate precedent if we establish that.</hs_para>

do not think that the Government even intended to create that sort of
precedent. What happened is that the Government changed their mind at
the last minute and thought it would be extremely humiliating to bring
forward a Bill at Second Reading having taken out the first part of it.
They therefore thought that the sensible thing to do would be just to
let it stay there. They would not make this humiliating cut to their
Bill on day one but would say, “This might be useful in the
future if we change our mind”. That is an extremely casual,
indeed frivolous, way to conduct parliamentary business and I am sorry
that they proceeded along those grounds.. They would have done much
better to have courageously said, ”We have changed our mind and
so the first part of the Bill does not apply any more. Let us have a
debate on the second and third parts and we will withdraw the first
part”. That would have been the sensible thing to have done. It
is still the sensible thing to do and I very much support my noble
friend’s
amendment.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_03_PT_1/44CE9F13491E002539BF29C96535568C0B9B4C4E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 February 2014">Monday,

very closely at their suggestions. I always listen very carefully to
the noble Lord, Lord Levene. He mentioned the importance of defence
exports, and I agree with him entirely on that. He mentioned that he
was brought in to bring more commercialisation to the operation, and
everyone tells me that he was very successful at that. That is exactly
what we are trying to do, and I agree that civil servants are not the

recruits, rewards, retains and manages staff. The detailed application
of those freedoms will be worked on through the first year of
operations, and DE&amp;S staff will remain core to organisational
delivery. We want to enhance our skills in bringing in private sector

tell the noble Lord that the Treasury has already agreed—this is

limited freedom for the MoD to recruit commercial officers from
industry at market rates in recognition of their niche skills. This

Defence Equipment and Support organisation into a government-owned,
contractor-operated organisation—a GOCO. On 10 December last
year, the Secretary of State announced a halt to the competition to
select a consortium to deliver the GOCO. Although the bidder, known as
Materiel Acquisition Partners, engaged effectively with the very
challenging brief set out and presented a credible and detailed bid,
the Secretary of State concluded that we did not have a competitive
process once the other remaining consortium chose not to submit a bid,
and that the risks of proceeding with a single bidder were too great to
be
acceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000041">Further
work is necessary to develop DE&amp;S financial control and management
information systems to provide a more robust baseline from which to
contract with a risk-taking GOCO partner. We remain clear that the only
realistic prospect of resolving the delivery challenges facing DE&amp;S
in an acceptable timescale is with the injection of a significant
element of private sector support. Noble Lords will also recall from
the Secretary of State’s announcement in December that we
decided to transform the DE&amp;S further within the public sector,
bringing in that private sector support and ensuring that it becomes
match-fit as the public sector comparator for any future market-testing
of the GOCO proposition.</hs_para>

expressed by a number of noble Lords about the continuing need for Part
1 in the light of the Secretary of State’s announcement, I
tabled a government amendment that would make the commencement of Part
1 subject to an affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament. We
have done this in recognition of the likely timescale for any future
consideration of a GOCO option as the way forward for DE&amp;S. To do
this, we intend to set the DE&amp;S up as a bespoke central government
trading entity from April 2014. The new entity will be at arm’s
length from the rest of the MoD, with a separate governance and
oversight structure consisting of a strong board under an independent
chairman, and  a chief executive who will be an accounting
officer, accountable to Parliament for the performance of the
organisation. Importantly, we will permit the new organisation
significant freedoms and flexibilities, agreed with the Treasury and
Cabinet
Office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000043">Although
I understand concerns that have been raised, I reassure noble Lords
that we would not seek to retain legislation without good cause. The
changes we are now making to DE&amp;S are important, but we cannot
guarantee that this approach will prove to be efficient. We need to
ensure that we can move quickly to run a future GOCO competition if the
new DE&amp;S freedoms prove insufficient to transform the organisation.
The Government are convinced that Part 1 remains necessary to deliver
an effective GOCO if—I repeat, if—that is the option
selected by a future Government. It should therefore remain part of the
Bill, to ensure that any Government can move quickly to a GOCO if that
is so
desired.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000044">Clause
1 is the key clause in Part 1, as I have already described. Although
the Secretary of State could enter into a contract with the GOCO using
common law powers, the scale of what is contemplated, in terms of both
money and people and the important nature of the work that DE&amp;S
undertakes, is such that Parliament should have the opportunity to
scrutinise and agree the proposals through specific legislation. An
important potential change such as this should be made with the
consensus of all parties and with the express approval of Parliament.
It is right that we have chosen this approach. Clause 1 is the main
provision for that debate, and there has already been an insightful and
important discussion on it through the amendments tabled by the
Opposition in the other place.</hs_para>

Clause 1 is removed, the Secretary of State could still contract out
defence procurement services to a GOCO using his common law powers, but
there would be no clause on the general issue of contracting out 
<?notus-xml column=24?>defence procurement services. This would deprive Parliament of the
opportunity to approve this significant change in the way in which the
Ministry of Defence does its business through its express agreement to
the clause. It would also require a significant rewriting of the rest

extends the period in which Parliament has to consider and debate the

25 would add yet more prerequisite requirements on the Secretary of

State to, first, lay before Parliament an evidence-based impact
assessment, which must cover the risks and merits of available options,
including the GOCO and the “do nothing” option of
retaining the existing DE&amp;S; secondly, lay before Parliament an
independent report setting out the comparative advantages of the

opposition amendment also seeks to require any decision to proceed with
a GOCO option to be subjected to independent scrutiny and for a report

already subject to external scrutiny by the National Audit Office and

for independent scrutiny while preserving the confidentiality of any
commercial process. The findings of either committee would be available

really provide any effective stop for Parliament, not that it does so.
Given my experience of affirmative orders that have been fatally
objected against, I wonder how the noble Lord can say that an
affirmative order that is defeated really changes things. What happens
is that the Government of the day—this is not a reflection on
the Minister’s Government—say that the legislation has
been passed and the affirmative order must therefore also be passed. In
reality, fighting affirmative orders is not an effective way of
allowing Parliament to give its view. For something as vital and
important as this, having merely the protection of an affirmative order
somewhere down the line is not nearly enough. I should be interested to

noble Lords who have contributed to this debate with varying degrees of
support for the super-affirmative procedure and for the deletion of

argument for removing Part 1 is that this Government no longer intend
to go down the GOCO road. It will be for the next or a subsequent
Government to make such a decision one way or the other, and it is that
Government who should have to justify their decision in detail to
Parliament in the light of what

put in writing what has and what has not yet been agreed with the
Treasury and whether there is also agreement by the Cabinet Office; we
understand that those freedoms and flexibilities have to be agreed with
both, and I do not think that the Minister referred to the Cabinet

justification that the Minister gave for keeping Part 1 was that it

this legislation in place on grounds of speed? The Minister also
referred to my amendment and the proposals within it as an unreasonable
burden on the Secretary of State. The convenience of the Secretary of

in a position to commit through words a future Government and what they

subsequent Government to doing that, even if they intend to go down the
road of the GOCO option. Their only legislative requirement would be to
do it through affirmative orders going through both Houses. The
question of what information they would be required to provide will
largely be a matter for the Government of the day. I seriously hope
that the Minister will give further reflection to what has been said
today about the importance in a major change such as this of making
sure that the Government who make this decision—if they decide
to go down the GOCO channel—fully justify their decision and the
reasons for it, giving the evidence to support the line they want to

meeting to see if we could make some progress down that road, if that
would be acceptable to the Minister. We might reach some sort of accord
on it. However, in the mean time our position is that we do not think
that Part 1 should remain in the Bill. I mentioned that our amendments
in relation to the super-affirmative order were very much the
second-best option. Obviously as far as that is concerned, we do

Amendment 6, I am grateful for the points raised by the noble Lord. I
fully accept the critical importance of protecting the interests and
integrity of decision-making within the Ministry of Defence and wider
government by maintaining the highest standards of propriety of those
Crown servants within the Ministry of Defence, which includes civilian
staff as well as members of the Armed Forces, who interact with defence
contractors. I believe strongly that the integrity and propriety of

I must resist the inclusion of the amendment as the issue is already
effectively addressed. The code of conduct that the noble Lords wish to
include seeks  
<?notus-xml column=31?>to address general concerns that senior government officials could be
perceived to be in conflict or have vested interests when dealing with
defence contractors in their day-to-day work. Further, the noble Lord,
Lord West of Spithead, in his evidence session of  3 September
to the House of Commons, also made mention of Title 10 of the US code,
the section of the code relating to the Armed Forces of the United
States.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020323000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000083">The
code of conduct that the noble Lords seek already exists within the
Ministry of Defence in two forms. The first is in the form of the
business appointment rules, which govern situations in which Crown
servants wish to take up a relevant offer of employment within two
years of leaving the Ministry of Defence. The second is the gifts,
reward and hospitality rules, which govern situations in which Crown
servants are offered a gift or hospitality. Together, these two
important sets of rules set out the standards of conduct expected of
Crown servants within the Ministry of Defence. For civilian officials
within the Ministry of Defence, both the business appointment rules and
the gifts, reward and hospitality rules are contained within the Civil
Service Management Code, which was issued under Part 1 of the
Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. For military officials,
the rules are contained within the Queen’s Regulations for each
of the services, and the provisions of the business appointment rules
have been in effect since July
1937.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000084">The
Civil Service Code states that civil servants must not accept gifts,
hospitality or benefits of any kind from a third party that might be
seen to compromise their personal judgment or integrity. The
Queen’s Regulations lay down the conduct and procedure to be
observed by service personnel on the acceptance of gifts, rewards and
hospitality. In all cases, any offers of gifts or hospitality must be
registered by the individual in receipt of the offer. The provisions of
the business appointment rules for both military and civilian officials
differ depending on the seniority of the individual, with the most
senior officials requiring permission from the Prime Minister to take
up an appointment following the end of their service within the
Ministry of Defence.</hs_para>

of the business appointment rules are as follows. For the most senior
officials in the Civil Service—at three-star level or their
military equivalents—the rules require that they submit an
application, which must be referred by the department to the Advisory
Committee on Business Appointments, which will provide advice to the
Prime Minister to enable a decision to be taken. Due to their role at
the highest level of Government and their access to a wide range of
sensitive information, all Permanent Secretaries will be subject to a
minimum waiting period of three months between leaving paid Civil
Service employment and taking up an outside appointment or employment.
As a general principle, there will be a two-year ban on civil servants
at three-star level and above lobbying the
Government—communicating with a view to influencing a government
decision or policy in relation to their own interests. For civil
servants at two-star level and their military equivalents, the rules
require that an application be made to the Permanent Secretary, who 
<?notus-xml column=32?>is responsible for making a decision and providing a written
recommendation to ACOBA—the Advisory Committee on Business
Appointments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000086"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Robertson of Port Ellen" PimsId="397" UID="14020323000169" xid="1413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000169">Lord

rules on the acceptance of gifts and hospitality set out that, even
where the acceptance of gifts or hospitality is not unlawful,
acceptance can still be improper and, in serious cases, may lead to
internal misconduct action being taken. This can be a particular risk
in the MoD where many areas of departmental activity bring Crown
servants into regular contact with outside organisations, and in
particular with defence contractors, who may regard it as normal
practice or social convention to offer hospitality and, sometimes,
gifts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000091">It is
impossible to set out rules to govern every conceivable circumstance in
which a gift or hospitality might be offered and accepted. Much will
depend on the nature of the relationship between the department and the
organisation, and the role of an individual Crown servant in that
relationship. However, a number of clear principles are applied to all
cases, and intended to enable Crown servants to act with propriety when
deciding whether or not acceptance is appropriate. If 
<?notus-xml column=33?>there is any doubt, the individual is expected to consult with their
superiors before accepting any gifts or hospitality. This consultation
can be elevated as necessary within the department if there is any
unresolved doubt.</hs_para>

noble friend, but there is an air of astonishment around the Grand
Committee that the Minister said that Permanent Secretaries have only
three months before they can take up some paid employment. If that is
what is being said, it is a remarkably short period. Who wrote that
rule? Was some Permanent Secretary responsible for it? If that is the
case, there is a real cause for alarm that junior civil servants are
being constrained in a remarkable way but Permanent Secretaries at that
level seem to be given a remarkably short period before they can take
up a new job. I have to say that I am profoundly sceptical about the
operation of the committee on business recommendations, or whatever it
is called, because it is completely toothless. It can make
recommendations that senior people in government are not obliged to
follow. The current record is that quite a few people completely ignore
the recommendation and time limits, even the three months that is

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 7 would require the
Secretary of State to withhold approval on any relevant contract price
change until a detailed report has been laid before both Houses setting
out the circumstances why the increased price is required. The
amendment also requires the Secretary of State to write to the chairs
of the relevant parliamentary committees, which I assume to be the
House of Commons Defence Select Committee and the Public Accounts
Committee, telling them that the report has been laid. Although I fully
support the principle of being transparent with Parliament regarding
the performance of the defence equipment programme, I do not believe
that this amendment is appropriate, as it would significantly constrain
the operational freedom of the Secretary of State and the department.
The amendment is also not required as the performance of the equipment
programme is already regularly reported on, including by the National
Audit Office, and scrutinised by Parliament.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=36?><hs_para UID="14020323000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000108">In addition, the
proposal would introduce significant practical issues. Under the
proposal, every change of price within a contract managed by the future
GOCO would require a report to be laid before both Houses. Given that
DE&amp;S manages many thousands of contracts, this requirement could
impose an unmanageable burden on the GOCO and the department. Gaining
better control over the schedule delivery and cost of the equipment
programme is a fundamental part of the likely future GOCO arrangements,
and that will not be helped by imposing an excessively burdensome
reporting constraint on the GOCO. Indeed, it could result in the
opposite effect. The amendment also provides no mechanism for how
contract price changes would be approved while Parliament is in recess.
It is clearly unreasonable for the day-to-day operation of the
department and GOCO in delivering equipment and support to the front
line to be constrained in this
fashion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000109">Turning
to Amendment 9, it is important to stress that Clause 2 of the Bill is
designed as a fallback option to be used as a last resort in
circumstances where a GOCO company is in need of financial assistance
and unable to obtain it from the commercial market at acceptable rates.
We would expect a future contractor to be a financially robust company
that would only very rarely need to seek financial assistance from the
market and that, should it need to do so, the assistance required would
be available on acceptable commercial terms. Therefore, the power to
provide financial assistance to the contractor from the Secretary of
State is anticipated to be required only in extremely rare
circumstances and as a last option to prevent the business from
becoming insolvent and ensure business continuity. Clearly, continuity
is critical and must be ensured when the business in question is the
provision of defence equipment procurement and support services that
are vital to supporting our troops on the front line. That risk must
therefore be effectively managed. A further important point is that the
Ministry of Defence would seek to claw back any financial assistance
provided under this clause through deductions from future contractual
payments to the
GOCO.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000110">The
effect of the amendment is to require the Secretary of State to
withhold approval for the grant of financial assistance until a report
has been laid before both Houses setting out why financial assistance
is required and until he has written to the relevant chairs of the
parliamentary committees telling them that the report has been
laid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000111">The
purpose of this amendment is about ensuring transparency to
Parliament—a principle, as I said in my opening remarks, that I
fully support. I understand and agree with the desire for Parliament to
be kept fully informed and to have the opportunity to consider and
comment on the provision of financial assistance from Government funds.
However, although the amendment seeks only to constrain the ability of
the Secretary of State to provide financial assistance—to the
extent that he could not do so until the report has been provided to
Parliament—it would have the effect of introducing a time delay
to the provision of such assistance, which could have very significant
consequences if assistance is required urgently to ensure business
continuity.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_03_PT_1/6BC5FF81DAA845D889DC425954A9A03AAB9CF896" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 3 February 2014">Monday,

further consideration would be that the content of the report may need

would the MoD need to be able to provide financial assistance to a

capability, but it is not possible to forecast that at this time. What
is the likely cost? It is not possible to say that yet: it will become
clearer as we go through the commercial negotiation process. That is

relation to Amendment 9, if I have understood the Minister correctly,
one could argue that if there is provision for financial assistance, it
would mean that 
<?notus-xml column=38?>the risk was not being transferred to the GOCO operator but would remain
ultimately with the taxpayer. That raises an important issue about the
GOCO operator and the proposals: what risk is being transferred? The

provide assurance that staff transferred to a GOCO consortium made up
of at least some major international companies will not find themselves
being told they must move to a position outside the UK when it is not
something they would wish to do, nor would have been compelled to do

new company should decide to relocate some or all
of the services outside the UK. However, I must resist the inclusion of
the amendment because it is not needed. Those employees transferring to
the GOCO would be sufficiently protected by UK employment legislation

this provision in the Bill.</hs_para>

the note on the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
(TUPE) Regulations 2006—SI 2006/246—provided in another
place for reference, which explained the protections that those
regulations afford to transferring employees. In summary, the TUPE
regulations protect employees if the business in which they are
employed changes hands, or the services that they provide are to be
provided by another organisation. The effect of the regulations is to
transfer employees and any rights, powers, duties and liabilities
associated with them from the old employer to the new employer. This
includes any rights specified in their contract of employment,
statutory rights and the right to continuity of employment.
Additionally, the new employer cannot change the terms and conditions
of employment of transferred employees if the sole or principal reason
for the change is the transfer. This is also the case where the sole or
principal reason is connected to the transfer, unless there is an ETO
reason for the change, usually requiring a change in number of the
workforce. This often makes it difficult, if not impossible, for new
employers to amend terms and conditions of employment of staff
immediately after a TUPE
transfer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:55:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000125">The
fact that this Bill makes it clear that the TUPE regulations would
apply to the transfer of employees to the company would have the effect
of protecting the employees’ terms and conditions of employment
in place at the point of transfer, as well as representational rights.
The terms of employment that will be protected include any obligation
with regard to mobility. Civil Service terms and conditions of
employment generally contain a mobility obligation within the UK and
abroad for all but the most junior of grades. Some employees who would
transfer to the GOCO will have, on previous occasions, relocated for
work-related reasons both within the UK and abroad throughout their
career in the Civil Service. Any proposed change of work location would
be subject to general employment law constraints, which require that
any enforcement of a mobility obligation must be fair and reasonable,
dependent upon the personal circumstances of the individual
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:56:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:56:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000126">Noble
Lords will be aware that amendments to the TUPE
regulations came into force last week, and those amendments will not
have a detrimental impact on employees. Further to the protections
afforded to employees by the TUPE regulations, part IV of the
Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004 (SI
3426/2004) places a general obligation on employers to provide
information to, and consult, employee representatives. Consultation is
the process by which management and employees or
their representatives jointly examine and discuss issues of mutual
concern. It involves seeking acceptable solutions 
<?notus-xml column=40?>to problems through a genuine exchange of views and information.
Consultation does not remove the right of managers
to manage—they must still make the final
decision—but it does impose an obligation that the views of
employees will be sought and considered before decisions are
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:57:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000127">To<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:58:30"></hs_TimeCode>

consult employee representatives on all matters in relation
to, first, recent and probable development of the undertakings
activities and economic situation; secondly, the situation, structure
and probable development of employment within the undertaking and on
any anticipatory measures envisaged—in particular, where there
is a threat to employment within the undertaking; and, thirdly,
decisions likely to lead to substantial changes in work
organisation or in contractual relations. The information must be

are appropriate to enable the representatives to conduct an adequate
study and prepare for

any consultation must be appropriate in terms of timing, method and
content, and conducted with a view to reaching agreement on decisions
within the scope of the employers’ powers. In other words, the
employer must ensure that any consultation that is conducted must be
meaningful, and commensurate to the change which is being consulted on.
For example, if an employer were planning to move their current
premises to a new building half a mile from where they were currently
located, with no effect on working practices or workforce numbers, it
could be deemed that the impact of this change would be minimal and,
accordingly, a minimal time period of consultation of two to three
weeks would be appropriate. However, if the proposal were to relocate
to new premises at the other side of the UK, or even abroad, this would
have a significant impact on the workforce and a period of two to three
months would probably be deemed more
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:59:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:59:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020323000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-gc0001.htm#14020323000129">I

Ministerial Statement of 21 May 2013, I published a list of
projects and programmes that had withdrawn from the RGF process. Below
is a list of further withdrawals since that date. In most cases
projects and programmes withdraw themselves during contractual
negotiations, when it becomes clear to them that they do not wish to
proceed with their plans as set out in their original applications.
This can be due to a number of reasons, such as a changing market
outlook or a reorganisation of their own future planned investment
priorities. In all cases all the money awarded to the project and
programme is recycled back into the Fund so that other companies can
benefit from the support of the
RGF.</hs_para><TableWrapper Columns="2" Size="8"><table><tgroup cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="25*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="25*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="25*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="25*"></colspec><thead><row><entry rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading>Beneficiary</hs_TableHeading></entry><entry rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading>Round</hs_TableHeading></entry><entry rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading>Beneficiary</hs_TableHeading></entry><entry rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading>Round</hs_TableHeading></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry><hs_para UID="1402038000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000035">Alnmaritec</hs_para></entry><entry><hs_para UID="1402038000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000036">1</hs_para></entry><entry><hs_para UID="1402038000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000037">Tees

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My hon Friend the Minister for
Immigration (Mark Harper) has today made the following Written
Ministerial
Statement:</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402038000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000117">I am
today announcing proposals to change the fees for immigration and
nationality applications made to the Home Office and for services
provided by the department. The government reviews these fees on a
regular basis and makes appropriate changes as
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402038000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000118">In
developing these proposals, the Home Office has sought to limit most
increases to 4%. There are further targeted increases to bring
dependant fees in line with main application fees, to register as a
British Citizen and some premium services. A staggered rise has been
applied to the long term visit visa (greater than six months) with a
higher rise to the 2 and 5 year visas to ensure the 10 year visa stays
at its current level. We are also introducing a reduced fee for those
applying to work within areas regarded as shortage occupations and to
the direct airside transit
visa.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402038000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000119">The Home
Office has given careful consideration to its fee levels, to ensure
they provide the funding necessary to operate effective immigration
controls and invest in improving service levels to customers. This is
balanced against the need to ensure that the UK continues to attract
and welcome the ‘brightest and best’ migrants from around
the world and those that make a valued contribution to British society.
Given the ongoing need to reduce public spending, we believe it is
right that we continue to reduce the contribution made by UK taxpayers
towards delivering the immigration system by asking those who use and
benefit directly from the system to make a greater
contribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402038000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000120">For
certain application categories, we will continue to set fees higher
than the administrative cost to reflect their value to successful
applicants. This helps to provide resources to run the UK immigration
system and enables the Home Office to set lower fees elsewhere in
support of wider government objectives to attract those businesses,
workers, students and visitors who most benefit the UK. This includes
the short term visit visa which remains significantly below
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402038000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000121">I have
laid regulations for fees set higher than cost. In addition, I will
shortly lay another set of regulations in Parliament for fees set at or
below cost. Further details explaining all fees changes are provided in
the Explanatory Memoranda for both sets of regulations. Subject to
parliamentary approval the government intends to bring new fees into
force from 6 April 2014 with some fees for premium services overseas
coming into effect on 31 March
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402038000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140203-wms0001.htm#1402038000122">The

The Secretary of State has highlighted that Golden
Rice could make a real difference to people’s wellbeing in
developing countries. It should not therefore be subject to
ill-considered opposition, as occurred last year when field trials in
the Philippines were vandalised. Golden Rice is being developed as a
humanitarian project and the seeds will be donated free to countries
for use by poor farmers. The Government believes that developing
countries should have fair access to GM technology and make their own
informed decisions regarding its
use.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

I recognise the devastating effect a dog attack can
have on a protected animal such as a cat but I do not propose that the
Government collect data on such attacks. It would be difficult to get
reliable data on all dog attacks on cats. There is already legislation
in place to enable the authorities to take action against dog owners
where a dog attacks a protected animal. In addition, the powers in the
Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, currently before
Parliament and expected to receive Royal Assent soon, will help to
tackle irresponsible ownership of dogs. Any data currently available is
likely to be held by the relevant enforcement

this type, coupled with a specialist membrane, prevented condensation
(which can lead to corrosion of the roof components). It is therefore
intended that, where possible, the sheep wool insulation will be fitted
when other cast iron roofs on the Parliamentary Estate are repaired as
part of this programme of work. As well as managing the levels of
condensation, the sheep wool insulation will reduce the amount of heat
lost through the roof voids. The use of insulation does, however,
