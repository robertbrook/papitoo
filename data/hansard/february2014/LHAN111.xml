welcome that announcement from the Government and I pay tribute to Bite
the Ballot for organising hundreds of events with the aim of
registering today thousands of young people to vote. The Minister spoke
warmly yesterday of citizenship lessons but warm words butter no
parsnips. I strongly urge the Government not to encourage but to ensure
that an inspiring citizenship curriculum is taught in every school,
including academies and free schools, and that every school should
facilitate everyone of or near voting age to register to vote. Will the
Government also consider enclosing electoral registration forms with
all their official communications with young people, for example those
regarding national insurance numbers and driving licence

that I will take back, as we are certainly considering how best to
encourage all this. The new citizenship programme for study, which has
now been agreed to be taught from September 2014, stipulates that

that citizens should take in democratic and electoral processes to
influence decisions locally, nationally and

allocated among local authorities according to the results of the
confirmation dry run, which showed that we are getting up to an 80%
level of confirmation, and indeed sometimes up to 85%, from data
matching. However, there are a number of local authorities, including
Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, where, because of the transient
population, registration is much lower. Places such as those, where
people move frequently, and others with a large number of students or
private landlords will be granted large amounts of money to target
those groups.</hs_para>

us on the proposals to cross-reference the databank of the DWP with the

have not registered but are on the DWP databank, and to encourage them

very difficult and complex area. It raises questions of privacy as well
as convenience. The DWP database has been used for data matching, but
in one direction and with very careful procedures so that we were not
transferring data, just checking their existence. There are a number of
other local and national databases that have been used. It has been
discovered, for example, that you can raise quite significantly your
confidence that people are there if you use local databases, such as
benefit boxes and council tax, as well as national

claiming as unemployed has gone down by 27%; that is by 7,500 to a
figure of 20,000. One of the interesting things about the unemployment
figures is how broadly based they have been. If you take the four most
northern regions of the country—the north-east, the north-west,
Yorkshire and Humberside, and Scotland—they have in combination
reduced their claimant count by 43,000 youngsters to 118,000. That is,

at the work experience figures, nearly half the people on work
experience were off benefits 21 weeks after starting a placement. That

past 12 months, although net lending has fallen in three out of the
past 10 months. Overall lending is a lot more than it was in 2012. I am
pleased to say that, although net lending has dropped, there are other
sources of finance available to SMEs and businesses from which they can
borrow money. The recent responses to the Bank of England credit
conditions survey reported that the overall availability of credit to
the corporate sector increased significantly in the final quarter of
2013. I normally stick to my own department, and I have not had any

from Bangui and into the rural areas of the Central African Republic.
In the past 72 hours some 75 people or more have been killed in Boda,
some 100 kilometres outside Bangui. What urgent steps are being taken,
not simply to reinforce the AU-EU peacekeeping efforts but to ensure
that backing up those efforts is a DfID and EU presence on the ground,
addressing the issues of interfaith relationships and sustainable

share the EU representatives’ concerns at the limited number of

deployed has increased since we discussed this matter on 16 January. It

Part of the discussions in setting that mandate were about individual
member contributions, and it was felt at that stage that our
contribution would be the 15% towards the core course. At this stage it
is important that the matter passes through the parliamentary scrutiny
process. I understand that it is in the Commons today, and I think that
it will be in your Lordships’ House tomorrow. If that were to

private family cases, there was a very real danger that the dominant
parent would overpersuade the less dominant parent that there was a
right to equal sharing of the child’s time after separation.

needs those services they must put them in the plan—and,

put that on the
record<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000093">I
would like to make two more points. First, the letter from the noble
Lord, Lord Nash, also says that he will set out clearly in the code of
practice the social care duties that must be included in the EHC plan,
and explain the duties to provide those services where they are
applicable. Could the Minister say in her summing up whether there are
particular social care services that must be provided—and
whether there are some, therefore, that may not be provided? Is there a
distinction
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:00:09"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020581000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000094">The second point is
that in relation to the code of practice the explanation to the local
authorities is crucial. As it stands, the Bill, even after this
amendment, is a very complex way of framing the respective duties of
health, education and social care to provide the services. I certainly
would have preferred, for the sake of clarity for those implementing
the Act, as it will then be, for social care to be included in Clause
42 rather than Clause 37; Clause 37 deals with EHC plans whereas Clause
42 deals with the duty to deliver the services. I think it would be
helpful to local authorities to see very clearly in one place in the
Act that all three elements of this new planning process—health,
social care and education—have to deliver. Unless the duty on
social care achieved by this rather tortuous mechanism is clearly spelt
out to local authorities it may not be fully recognised by social
workers. Will the noble Baroness comment on

noble Lords will have heard me say previously, one of our main aims in
introducing the special educational needs clauses in the Bill has been
to reduce the adversarial nature of the SEN system. We want children,
young people and parents to have a better experience when engaging with
the SEN system, particularly when children and young people are being

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:04:54"></hs_TimeCode> new

they or their children will be provided with the support that they want
more quickly than if they waited for a tribunal hearing to be arranged.

build up the evidence on which to make recommendations. However, three
years is a maximum and if the review felt it had the evidence in less
than that time it could report to Parliament earlier. I estimate that
we might have sufficient evidence by the summer of 2016, so I can say
that the review would report no less than two years from the

any recommendations the tribunal made. The pilots would begin in the

consider the findings or to reflect the findings in regulations. This
leaves the outstanding question as to what duty there will be on the
Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor to respond to any recommendation
to undertake definitive action as a consequence. In his opening

the Government on the substantial progress that has been made in the

from education to adulthood, particularly for young people and young
adults with autism. Transition is  a key focus of the Bill. At

the statutory guidance so that they can understand the needs of and
their duties towards children and young people with autism. Will the

the improvement of the system of special educational needs for

have listened and worked constructively with those who sought to make

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I am not very good at
accolades, but I just add to what has been said about the
Minister’s capacity to listen and respond. It has indeed been
remarkable and extremely helpful, so I hope that he will forgive me for
asking a few more questions—it is in my
nature.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000124">I turn
to the question of mediation. I had a number of exchanges with the
noble Lord, Lord McNally, about the definition of mediation. I hope
that the Minister can say for the record that mediation here has the
widest definition. We know that some mediators operate a particular
structure of mediation which can be very narrow and unhelpful to some
of the programmes that are being developed. There are some innovative
programmes of intervention on the mediation spectrum, and I hope that
those are what we will have under the helpful government
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000125">On
a rather unhappy note, all those provisions will be costly at a time
when local government is facing further cuts. I know that the Local
Government Association—I declare an interest as
vice-president—is concerned about the implications. With the
best will in the world, those who wish to provide services are
sometimes inhibited from doing what they would like by the sheer cost.
I noticed that the Minister mentioned a sum in his introduction.
Perhaps he could clarify that—it went rather quickly across my
thinking. We need to know whether some of the money will be clearly
ring-fenced for local authorities to use for those very specific pieces
of work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000126">On
the review of tribunals—again, I think this is utterly
remarkable—if the Government are able to achieve that joined-up
piece of work, then we are well on the way. I am not sure that I would
call it the holy grail of joined-up services, but it is what we have
all been working towards for a very long time, and we are much further

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, it is  always
understandable, in our relief at seeing positive improvements to the
Bill, of which this is one of the most important—we talked about
social care before—that noble Lords welcome them, and so do I.
However, I am mindful of the persistence and doggedness that it took to
get to this point not only here but in the other place. I do not want
to take anything away from the change, which is very positive, but
rewriting the history of the Bill as being one of consensus is probably
a step too
far.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000130">I welcome
the amendments that the Government have brought forward today and I
understand the Minister’s desire to see whether mediation can be
an effective alternative to a formal appeals process. I make no
criticism of that, as it is entirely understandable, and the amendments
that apply to mediation will make it available across the spectrum of
health, education and social
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000131">I have
three questions for the Minister: one on mediation and a couple on the
review and pilots. I read carefully the amendments on mediation and
particularly noted the requirement that the mediator must be
independent of the agency providing the services with which the parent
or young person disagrees. That point of independence is absolutely
right and understandable, but can the Minister say how this will work
in practice? One of the things that concerns me is that, if a parent or
young person wants to contest, say, both health and social care
elements of the plan, it is very important that they should have one
mediator who is independent of both the NHS and the local authority. As
the noble Lord, Lord Storey, has just said, our debates around this
issue have laboured the need for a single avenue of redress for
families. That applies just as much to the mediation process as it
would to the formal appeal process, as we were arguing.</hs_para>

because there are of course separate amendments for mediation in health
and in social care. I want to ensure that, when the time comes, which
may be when regulations are considered, there will be the opportunity
to consider this level of detail and to make sure that families are not
relating to two or three separate mediators, plus the First-tier
Tribunal, because in a sense that would not achieve the spirit that we
sought in the debate on the issue.</hs_para>

the review and the pilots. I welcome Amendment 33, which I think takes
up the amendment that we tabled on Report about the need for this to be
looked at in some detail. It may be three years’ time before we
have the results. I hope that there are enough of us still around to
see the outcomes of those pilots and the review to make sure that we
can use the results productively. In that regard, can the Minister say
whether during that time he envisages that there will be some kind of
oversight of the pilots and the review process? Could there be some
interim findings or representation from interested parliamentarians on
some kind of review board or body, with sector representatives? He
mentioned parents and young people as well. For us to approve this now
and then wait three years is a long time to see what, if anything, is
happening. Some oversight of that process would be very
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:27:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, this group of amendments builds upon
those that we brought forward on Report and, we hope, address some of
the important points raised by noble Lords during that debate. We are
grateful to those noble Lords who have continued to raise the important
issue of support for young offenders with EHC plans in custody. I
particularly thank the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for his expert and,
as ever, very determined contributions  
<?notus-xml column=222?>throughout and for his continued determination to ensure this small but
highly vulnerable group of children and young people get the support
that they
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000141">I am
pleased that noble Lords accepted the Government’s amendments on
Report. That means that today’s debate is, I hope, starting from
a strong position. The Bill already ensures that: young offenders,
their parents and professionals working with them can request an
assessment for an EHC plan and those assessments can now start in
custody; EHC plans will provide up-to-date, current information on
entry to custody, owing to the requirement for local authorities to
maintain the EHC plans of those under 18 who are not in education,
employment or training for any reason; both home local authorities and
relevant NHS health service commissioners are under a duty to use their
best endeavours to arrange the education and health provision set out
in an EHC plan for children and young people in custody; EHC plans must
be kept by the home local authority while a young offender is detained
and must be reviewed and maintained again immediately on release; and
both youth offending teams and relevant custodial institutions are
required to co-operate with the local authority.</hs_para>

set of improvements over the current system. However, now we want to go
even further to address the remaining concerns expressed by noble Lords
during our previous debate on this subject—namely, that
“best endeavours” seemed, certainly in the mind of the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, not to create a strong enough obligation
on local authorities and health commissioners, and that youth custodial
institutions should be required to have regard to the code of
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000143">Following
productive discussions between our officials, the Special Educational
Consortium and the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, we are
delighted to be able to say that through Amendments 28 and 29 we are
strengthening the “best endeavours” duty so that it now

arrange appropriate special educational and appropriate health
provision.</hs_para>

Amendments 30 and 31 amend the definition of “appropriate
provision” so that it is clear that local authorities and health
service commissioners must first seek to arrange the provision that is
in an EHC plan. Where that is not practicable, they will arrange
provision that corresponds as closely as possible to the EHC plan.
Where what is in the EHC plan is no longer appropriate, the local
authority or NHS health commissioner must arrange an alternative that
is appropriate.</hs_para>

her, this document makes it clear that the arrangements for the new

authorities in regard to young offenders with EHC plans. They will also

subject, including people who are far more expert in it than I am, will
be involved in the preparation of a code of practice which will be such
an extremely important document in the future. The second was her
assurance that the Ministry of Justice will be involved in those

disturbing fact is that few commissioning groups in the country appear

will deal first with the provisions on the age of sale of nicotine
products. There has been widespread support for the introduction of an
age-of-sale restriction from the public health community and from the
electronic cigarette industry. Responsible manufacturers of
e-cigarettes are clear that their products are intended for people over
the age of 18. I wrote to all noble Lords on 27 January to explain the
key elements of this proposed new clause. I will summarise the main
provisions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:43:14"></hs_TimeCode>. They
provide the Secretary of State with the power to make regulations to
prohibit the sale of nicotine products to persons under the age of 18.
At present there is no general legal restriction on people under the
age of 18 buying nicotine products, including electronic cigarettes,
which are also known as e-cigarettes. The regulations to be made under
this power would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure to

capture tobacco products, which are already subject to law restricting
their sale to persons aged 18 and over. The penalty for committing the
offence of selling a nicotine product to a person under 18 years of age
would be a fine not exceeding level 4 on the standard scale, which is
currently £2,500. We also have very little evidence on, for
example, the impact on children’s developing lungs of their use
of products such as e-cigarettes. The public health community is
concerned that nicotine products could act as a gateway into smoking
tobacco<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:44:27"></hs_TimeCode>, as well
as undermining the Government’s efforts to reshape social norms

turn now to the proxy purchasing of tobacco. Your Lordships will be
aware that we recently debated this issue in the context of the
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill. It was clear during
those debates that there was widespread support among noble Lords for
creating a proxy purchase offence for tobacco as a way of further
reducing the supply of tobacco to children and young people. We must
take action to address both the supply of, and the demand for, tobacco
products among young people if we are to reduce the uptake of smoking.
My noble friend Lord Taylor made it clear that the Government retained
an open mind on this issue and that some of the arguments advanced in
favour of a new offence had
merit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000160">Since
that debate, the Government have carefully reflected on the powerful
arguments made by your Lordships. The Government have also taken into
account the views of retailers and their representative bodies, which
have long argued for the creation of a proxy-purchasing offence for
tobacco. They feel it is unfair that current legislation sets out an
offence for retailers that sell cigarettes to children, but that there
is no offence of proxy
purchasing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Let
me be clear that I welcome the role that retailers play in ensuring
stringent application of existing age-of-sale legislation for tobacco.
I also pay tribute to the work done by retailer bodies, such as the
Association of Convenience Stores, in supporting their members to
effectively apply age-of-sale provisions for tobacco. The offence of
proxy purchasing will be enforced by local authority trading standards
officers, who will have the flexibility to issue a fixed penalty notice
if they believe that an offence has been committed, rather than taking
prosecution
action<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:47:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that this proposed new clause does not require local authorities to
undertake regular programmes of enforcement; it therefore does not
place any significant new regulatory burdens on local authorities.
Local authorities know their communities better than anyone, and will
know how best to address their public health priorities. This amendment
allows local authorities to take targeted enforcement on proxy
purchasing where they consider it is needed. It is an additional means
to tackle smoking in their
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:47:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:47:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000162">The
arguments around effective enforcement have been well rehearsed
previously, and I do not plan to revisit those issues in depth today.
However, it is fair to say that experience in Scotland tells us that we
are unlikely to see a vast number of convictions. Success will not be
measured by the number of prosecutions alone, because, importantly, the
new offence should generate a worthwhile deterrent effect. Alongside
this new offence, the Government will also work proactively with local
authorities, retailers and parents to highlight the issue of proxy
purchasing of tobacco. We must work with communities to make it clear
that it is wrong in principle for adults to buy cigarettes for young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

start with a general point, which I cannot resist making. I first went
to see the Public Bill Office after Second Reading last July and asked
its advice on whether there was any possibility of including a clause
on standard packaging for tobacco products as a child protection
measure in the Bill. I never dreamt that by Third Reading the Bill
would contain such a range of powerful tobacco control measures,
especially in view of the fact that there was no reference to a single
one when the Bill came to us from another
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:54:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000171">I
particularly thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Finlay of Llandaff and
Lady Tyler of Enfield, and the noble Lord, Lord McColl, for agreeing to
sign our original cross-party amendments on standard packaging. I
commend the noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, for persisting with his campaign
to ban smoking in cars when children are present, and my right
honourable friend Andy Burnham and my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings
Heath for their support on all these issues. I particularly thank the
Health Minister, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, whose courtesy, willingness
to listen and determination to get the policy right nobody in this
House could possibly fault. I also mention in dispatches the noble
Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach. As the Minister said, he indicated on
the second day of the Report stage of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime
and Policing Bill, as recently as 14 January, that he had an open mind
on proxy purchasing, although he was not as forthcoming as the Minister
has been with his amendment
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000172">When
the Government come to implement the policy on proxy purchasing, I
wonder if they would like to look at one element of the experience in
Scotland. When Scotland introduced a law on proxy purchasing in October
2011, it brought in a retailer registration scheme at the same time.
This is a low-cost licensing scheme that operates in conjunction with
fixed penalty notices and gives the courts the ability to impose
banning orders. It requires all tobacco retailers to  be
registered on one national register in order to sell 
<?notus-xml column=231?>tobacco. The costs to the industry of the scheme are minimal and are
limited really to the one-off labour cost needed to fill out the form.
Costs to the Government include the initial set-up costs of advertising
and marketing to give retailers information about the need to comply
with the scheme and the process to be undertaken, and the cost of a
database to hold national-level information on retailers. Such a scheme
would give local enforcement agencies a very valuable weapon in
tackling illicit trade and in enforcing other tobacco control
regulations—for example, the ban on sales to minors. It would
also help to protect the great majority of honest retailers from unfair
competition from the unscrupulous minority who are prepared to deal in
illicit
products.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000173">Finally,

to the Tube strike today, I came in by taxi. The best way to find out

today?”. He held up a packet of cigarettes, to my surprise, and
said, “I’m a smoker. I don’t smoke in
the cab, I go outside to smoke. Why would anybody want to smoke in a
car with children present? Why would they?”. That was his
reaction. When we know that 85% of smokers think that it is bonkers to
smoke in a car when children are
present, we realise that we have finally made the point that this is

welcome the package of measures being proposed. Ever since I introduced
the amendment that stopped smoking in the Peers’ Guest Room, I
have been one of the team quietly working towards the place that we
have now reached. The Minister must forgive me if I ask him to say
where we are and when we will reach the point at which all these
measures will be
implemented<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:05:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0001.htm#14020581000184">I
muttered to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, “Is it going to
happen, or not? Or is it simply a power that a Minister will
have?” Can the Minister give us a clearer picture as to when it
will happen? I am still waiting for the shutters to go down in 2015 on
tobacco in small shops. Every year it means that more children are not
protected by all the methods that he wishes to introduce.</hs_para>

cleverly, through to a point where the industry which was vociferous in

smoking is so dangerous that it ought to be stamped out
altogether—why do they not bring forward a Bill to make tobacco
smoking illegal? I have 
<?notus-xml column=234?>asked that question before; I have never had an answer, and I doubt very
much whether I am going to get an answer today. Those who take to
smoking provide the Treasury with about £10.5 billion in extra

principle before financial gain—would say that this is so
dangerous that we ought not to allow it to happen. I do not think that

the early discussions that he and colleagues across the House had with
the Public Bill Office to ensure that it was  in order to bring
an amendment on smoking within the Bill, and so, with a little
flexibility and the door slightly ajar, a great number of substantive

response from the Minister, in which he says that the regulation-making
power embraced within his amendments allows for exemptions, which could
include licensed nicotine products indicated for use under the age of

when developing the regulations, to establish which exemptions are
possible and necessary, and how they would work in practice. May I ask

Ministers to promote the health of young people under 18 in this
respect. I completely concur with the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, who
told us how addictive nicotine is: tobacco use remains the single
biggest preventable cause of death in England. We surely must do all we
can to encourage communities to make tobacco less desirable and less

Lady Howarth, asked me to be a little more precise about the timetable
for implementation across the piece. As regards nicotine products, we
have not taken a decision on timing. It will be partly dependent on the
timetable for laying and making regulations, but the Government want to
move as quickly as possible to get the provisions in place. As regards
standardised packaging, the timetable will be wholly dependent on the
decision the Government take once we have received Sir Cyril
Chantler’s report, and we have not taken that decision yet. On
proxy purchasing, we need to engage with stakeholders appropriately. It
is very difficult for me to give the noble Baroness a timetable because
there are technical issues to be looked at; indeed, we would want to
examine the experience of Scotland. But we are clear that this is a
measure that should be proceeded with.</hs_para>

think my answer has to be: one step at a time. Questions of whether the
Government would move forward with legislation or what the detail of
the regulations would include are debates to be had at another time,

be inappropriate for me to express firm views in advance of those

questions posed by the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Stoddart. The
noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, asked about the definition of vehicles. The
answer is that we have allowed ourselves the scope to define in
regulations, should regulations be laid, what kinds of vehicles should
be covered. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked me to confirm that the
police could be involved in the enforcement of this offence should it
be created. I can confirm that the wording of the amendment that we are
tabling today allows that scope but, as I have indicated, we need to

this would work.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Stoddart, posed the question that he has asked on a number
of occasions as to why the Government do not simply make smoking itself

people at a stroke. We want above all to help current smokers
to quit and to stop young people taking up smoking in 
<?notus-xml column=237?>the first place. We know that two-thirds of smokers want to quit but

Report, I committed to bring back an amendment in response to the
powerful arguments that had been made. I am pleased to bring forward an
amendment to consolidate existing legislation on parent carers of
disabled children into the Children Act 1989 and to streamline the
legislation so that it is consistent with 
<?notus-xml column=243?>the approach being taken to young carers and carers of adults. The
consolidated legislation will remove the requirement for those with
parental responsibility for disabled children to be providing
substantial and regular care in order to be assessed. It will take a
more consistent approach across carers and avoid confusion. The
legislation will also require local authorities to assess on the
appearance of needs as well as following a request by a parent carer.
This will benefit those parents who are not aware of the
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:27:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0002.htm#14020581000215">The
amendment specifically requires a local authority to consider the
well-being of the parent carer in carrying out the needs assessment
alongside the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of the disabled
child, which of course must remain of paramount importance. The
requirement to consider well-being builds on existing legislation,
which already requires local authorities to consider aspects of
parental well-being, including whether they wish to work or to
undertake education, training or leisure activities. The amendment
widens the definition of “well-being” to the definition
in Part 1 of the Care Bill. This wider definition includes other
aspects of well-being, such as physical and mental health and emotional
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:28:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The

our children or grandchildren were pushed out of their home at the age

change that. Your Lordships have done just that with this amendment.
Just consider the difference that this will make for young women. We
know that many women leaving care are prey to sexual exploitation. They
are more likely to have pregnancies as teenagers and more likely to
have their own children taken into care. It is highly arguable that a
contributing factor is their poor relationship with their father. I was
speaking earlier today to a woman who lost her father at the age of 14,
and the traumatic effect that had on her life impressed that on me once
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020581000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0002.htm#14020581000241">It has

have a very beneficial impact on their self-esteem and their future
choice of men. I was very pleased to hear my noble and learned friend

the fact that the references to any tax and benefit implications for

really need to help foster carers unravel any tax and benefit
implications of a staying-put arrangement, particularly when they get
financial support. The key will be in getting local authorities to
implement this fully. Perhaps the Minister could comment on how the

issue concerns the Children’s Commissioner and the request that
he or she would share equal footing with the equality and human rights
commissioner in being able to bring cases under the Human Rights Act.
On Report, the Minister said that initiating and intervening in legal
proceedings was, in the Government’s view, implicit within the
commissioner’s primary function; I certainly took that at face
value. Following on, he said that the commissioner would have
sufficient interest in a case, because of his or her statutory role to
promote and protect children’s rights, to satisfy any judge who
might question the right of the commissioner to intervene. He
emphasised that the Government did not wish to put into the Bill
anything to do with such a right, but assured me in answer to a

acknowledge the Minister saying that he agreed that the two

being made to the Equality Act, should be made to this Bill and to the
Children Act 2004, to allow the Children’s Commissioner to bring
things forward without running into the risk of being prohibited to do
so by something which I suspect was not meant by the Government or
anyone else. That is why I move the amendment. I apologise for doing so

amendment would mean that, when seeking to bring a case under the Human
Rights Act, the commissioner would be exempt from the requirement that
he or she must be the victim in the case. This would replicate a
provision in the legislative framework of the Equality and Human Rights

<?notus-xml column=253?>Commission, and would in effect put the Children’s Commissioner
on the same footing as the
EHRC<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:58:46"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
several reservations in respect of the proposed amendment. I am happy
to discuss the point further with the noble Lord, but I must state
those reservations now.</hs_para>

that the Children’s Commissioner and the equality and human
rights commissioner have the same role. As I have indicated at various
stages during the passage of the Bill, we see the role of the
Children’s Commissioner as being largely strategic, whereas the
EHRC has oversight of both strategic human rights issues and individual
casework. The amendment would give the commissioner a power to pursue
individual cases under the Human Rights Act, which would increase the
risk that the OCC loses its strategic focus. Noble Lords will
appreciate that we have tried to avoid
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:59:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T18:04:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020581000480" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0002.htm#14020581000480">6

we believe that it is important to avoid an unnecessary and unhelpful
duplication of functions between the Children’s Commissioner and
the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The EHRC has a clear remit in
relation to the HRA and we do not think it is necessary or appropriate
also to give the OCC an explicit power in relation to challenging
violations of individuals’ ECHR rights. The EHRC’s role
is not age-limited, and it is therefore open to it to bring a case
under the Human Rights Act in respect of a child under the age of 18,
in just the same way as it would be able to for an adult.</hs_para>

to prevent the Children’s Commissioner from bringing
children’s rights issues to the attention of the EHRC and
assisting it in any legal challenge it brings in relation to
children’s rights, whether it is under the Human Rights Act or
otherwise. The EHRC’s all-age focus is illustrated by the fact
that its strategic litigation priorities for 2012-13 included a number
of priorities in relation to education matters.</hs_para>

the possibilities for joint working between the OCC and the EHRC in his
2010 report and encouraged both organisations to work more closely
together in this regard. This approach is reinforced through the power
at Section 18 of the Equality Act 2006, which requires the EHRC
to,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14020581000464" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0002.htm#14020581000464">“co-operate

we all know how quickly litigation can swallow up resources. While I
would expect any commissioner to use his or her powers to instigate

would, in my view, be inconsistent with other aspects of the
OCC’s legal framework. For example, it is hard to see how giving
the Children’s Commissioner a free rein to take up legal cases

provision which precludes the commissioner from investigating the case
of an individual child in the discharge of the primary
function.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020581000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-0002.htm#14020581000277">I
can, however, repeat the reassurances I gave  when we last
debated the OCC clauses. First, in the Government’s view,
initiating or intervening in legal 
<?notus-xml column=254?>proceedings more generally is implicit within the commissioner’s
primary function. It is therefore open to the commissioner to bring
legal proceedings not based on the HRA, provided that the judge in the
case concerned is satisfied that the commissioner has a
“sufficient interest” in the matter. Secondly, I also
gave an assurance that the Government would explain this position to an
incoming Children’s Commissioner when they take on the role, and
I am happy to give that assurance again today. I hope that that is

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, in moving
Amendment 10, I will speak at the same time to Amendment 11. I have
tabled a series of amendments to the Bill, which I have formed into two
groups: this one and a second group comprising Amendments 14, 15 and
16, which we shall come to later on. The purpose of both groups is to
shed light on an issue that is causing rising public concern: the
increasing use of what have been variously called
“drones”, “unmanned aerial systems”, and
“remotely piloted aircraft systems”. I would argue that
the fact that there is no agreed terminology to describe these devices
is an indication of the very rapid rate of change and development
taking place and, perhaps, of the extent to which the appropriate level
of democratic oversight, control and challenge is lagging

was interesting to note the amount of public and press
interest—including international press interest—when I
tabled these rather modest amendments to be debated in the Moses Room,
which shows that this is a very live issue for many of our fellow
citizens. At this stage, these are all probing amendments, but there
are serious issues of public policy at stake about which I hope my
noble friend will be able to reassure all Members of the Committee. I
am grateful to my noble friend Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, the
noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, who put
their names to these amendments. I look forward to hearing their
particular concerns and contributions later in the

I said, there are two groups of amendments, but they focus on one
issue. I will give some general background which will set both groups
in context and enable me to be a great deal briefer when we come to the
second group. Finally, before doing so, I need to declare for the
record my interests in this and allied fields. I am a member of the

concern about drones takes, I think, two forms. The first lies in what
one might describe as the here and now. The public are concerned about
the collateral damage arising from what appears to be an increasingly
prevalent—some would say indiscriminate—use of drones. To
illustrate, I can do no better than to quote from a letter sent to all
Members of your Lordships’ House by Reprieve. It describes a
trip to Congress in the United States by Rafiq ur Rehman, a
schoolteacher from Pakistan, who was accompanied by his children
Zubair, 13, and Nabila, nine. The family were there to talk about 67
year-old Mammana Bibi—Rafiq’s mother, the
children’s grandmother and the local community’s midwife.
She was killed by a CIA drone strike in October 2012 while picking okra
in a field near her home. Zubair and Nabila were also injured when the
missile hit and had to be treated in hospital for shrapnel wounds.
Speaking to members of Congress on Capitol Hill, Rafiq described his
mother as

do not act in a vacuum—they act on information supplied to them.
The public are anxious to know who is supplying this information and
how it is being supplied. The legal context may be simply
stated—and, in saying that, I am benefiting from advice given by
Jemima Stratford QC. Individuals in a war are entitled to kill each
other. That is the doctrine of combatant immunity. In addition, both
the law in this country and international law recognise the status of
some individuals as lawful combatants engaged in international armed
conflict. However, killing an individual outside that framework is, to
put it starkly, murder. Assisting in the killing of an individual
outside that framework is assisting in an act of murder. The recent
killings by drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, neither of which is at
war with the United Kingdom or the United States, have increased public
concern.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020584000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000018">That
is the here and now. However, public concern is beginning to take on
another form. What does the future hold? This year we are
commemorating the outbreak of the First World War, 100 years ago
in the autumn of 1914. When the young men rushed
enthusiastically to the recruiting offices that autumn, they had no
real understanding of the killing power of the modern machine gun. If
they had, there were fears that their enthusiasm might have been
somewhat tempered. We, however, know about the capabilities of the
machine gun and the capabilities and consequences of the atom bomb.
Moreover, with the technical developments in television, by the 1970s
war was being brought into our front room.</hs_para>

critical point. The camera and the mobile phone are, in their own way,
rather effective peacekeeping devices. The Holocaust occurred
off-camera. Today, however, if a soldier fires a shot and it’s
on the “BBC News” that night, our political
process—albeit slowly, imperfectly and often in the wrong
way—begins to engage. Had there been pictures and tweets about
the carnage in the autumn of 1914, how long would the war have
lasted?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000021">Here
lies the second critical point. That door to the free flow of
information—arguably so important to the preservation of
peace—is slowly swinging shut. A drone is entirely anonymous. It
needs no boots on the ground. Yet the damage it does is no less
devastating than that done by the man with a machine gun. These
amendments therefore are designed to shed some light on these slightly
murky points. As the Prime Minister said, sunlight is the best
disinfectant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000022">After
those background comments, I turn to this first group, concerned with
jurisdiction and seeking to make amendments to Clause 5, entitled
“Jurisdiction of Ministry of Defence Police”. The
Ministry of Defence Police Act was passed in 1987. That may seem fairly
ancient—it is some 25 years old. However, it is a mere stripling
in comparison to the Visiting Forces Act that we shall come to in a
minute, which was passed more than half a century ago in 1952, or the
status of forces agreement passed a year
earlier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000023">Amendment

on the Marshalled List. The purpose of the amendment is simple. It is
to ensure that drones cannot be included as a type of aircraft, and to
recognise that they have an entirely separate legal distinction and
terminology. The amendment selects the phrase “unmanned aerial
systems” as a preferred descriptor. While I have no biblical
adherence to this phrase, there is the challenge that there is no
current legal definition of “aircraft” in the existing
Air Navigation Order 1970; it contains only a
classification.</hs_parafo>

descriptor is used, it is nevertheless important that it makes clear
that a drone is not an aircraft—a word which, to the public mind
at least, implies an aerial vehicle with at least one person inside it.
The effect of this amendment would be that the MoD Police jurisdiction
unquestionably extended to drones and the like, so they would not in
future fall through the gaps in legislation to some netherworld, out of
sight and mind. Amendment 11 runs in parallel and extends the power of
the MoD Police to contractors operating under the provisions of the
Bill—as we discussed in Committee on
Monday.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000025">To
conclude, whatever one’s views of the morality or efficacy of
drones, we need to ensure that the details of their operations are
properly recorded and that the MoD Police are unquestionably able to

Stern (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Hodgson, for that excellent and wide-ranging exposition. I
begin by declaring an interest; I am one of the vice-chairs of the
All-Party Parliamentary Group on Drones, established just over a year
ago in October 2012 and very active ever since. The core purpose of the
group is to examine the uses of drones—which the group decided
to call “unmanned aerial vehicles”—by Governments
for domestic and international military and civilian purposes. Among
the objectives of the group are to examine the legal and ethical
frameworks that govern the use of drones, raise awareness of the human
rights issues in the use of drones and look for increased
accountability and transparency in the use of drones by the United
Kingdom domestically and internationally. It is in that context that,
as a member of the all-party group, I put my name to these
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000027">I
stress absolutely that the all-party group is not opposed to drones per
se—far from it. Drones technology has many uses. I heard
recently from my noble friend Lord Sandwich that drones are a godsend
to archaeologists in Afghanistan because they can locate what is under
the ground and pinpoint where archaeologists should dig to find more
antiquities. That is a benign and helpful application of the
technology. My noble friend Lord Ramsbotham—General
Ramsbotham—has educated me about the indispensable role of
drones on the battlefield. The APPG is concerned not with opposing
drones but with transparency: ensuring that Parliament is well informed

briefly to these amendments, to which I have added my name, because I
want to spend more time on Amendments 14 to 16. What the two groups of
amendments have in common is the need for accountability so that
military activity or surveillance conducted from UK soil follows a
legislative framework and a line of accountability through our

<?notus-xml column=86?>State and parliamentary scrutiny committees. Such accountability is
entirely lacking at the

Dubs (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I want briefly to add my support for
these amendments and to make one point. When the visiting forces
legislation and other legislation governing the use by the United
States of airbases in Britain was enacted, the technology was at a very
simple stage. We did not have sophisticated techniques such as drones;
we did not have any of these things. The legislation was designed for a
different age when things were very simple. Because they have changed
so much there is a need to look again at the way in which these bases
operate. That is my simple
proposition<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:04:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000034">I

US has been a great ally of ours. We were delighted when its forces
came here and we welcomed them. Their airbases in Britain helped defend
us in the war and we must not forget that, but things have moved on.
The problem is that activities that were fully understandable to us,
and we were happy about, when these bases were first established may
now be considered in a different light. We are at least entitled to
have a better understanding of what goes on there and to be assured
that the uses to which the bases are put are compatible with our
system, our laws and our approach to using some of these very dangerous

need to look again at this issue. I am not saying that we should close
down American bases. I share the view of the noble Baroness, Lady

valuable to read the very important interim report that Ben Emmerson QC
delivered to the General Assembly on 18 September 2013, which not only
considers the way in which remotely controlled aircraft have been used
by both this country and the United States in various parts
of the world but makes a detailed inquiry into the
complications and difficulties of international humanitarian law.

Judd (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I speak in support of these
amendments. The point that has already been made cannot be stressed too
strongly—namely, that rules, regulations and definitions that
have been adequate to date need to be reviewed in view of the immense
and unforeseen scale of development in modern warfare. It would be
irresponsible to assume that the current rules and definitions, which
were drawn up in the past, respond adequately to the new

have absolutely no doubt that the service in which I was privileged to
serve, the RAF, is fully committed at the most senior levels to
implementing not just what the law says but the spirit of the law. I am
sure that that is the case. If it is the case, I cannot see how
reviewing the sufficiency and adequacy of existing legislation can do
anything but strengthen its position. It is good that these points have

is very difficult to share my next point with the Committee, as it is
not clear whether the issue should be raised now or on later
amendments. Reference has been made to the overlap in this regard. I am
deeply concerned about whether we as legislators are taking the
psychological implications of the new developments seriously enough. I
am sure some of those involved in the operations are taking them very
seriously. If I put it crudely, it is not out of any hostility to the
people concerned; it is just to try to bring home the starkness of the
reality with which we are dealing.</hs_para>

day with a good friend whose son has just got a very good engineering
degree. What does he want to do with his engineering degree? His
ambition is to work in computer games and eventually perhaps have his
own firm, I think. There has been terrific change in the nature of this
kind of activity and what it can involve. I hope I will not be accused
of being irresponsibly sensational, because it does not seem to me that
it is irresponsibly sensational at all. It is taking into account the
realities of life. When did we begin to drift into a situation where
the mental and psychological processes about playing very advanced
computer games and the processes of sitting in the Nevada desert, or
wherever it is, operating a machine became blurred? How do we continue
to take, as we have always tried to take, the responsibility of
recognising that war is a last resort and a very grave step to take?
How do we now undertake warfare in the context of all sorts of
humanitarian obligations and the rest? The Geneva conventions are just
one example. I think that for all these reasons there has been a
certain degree of complacency among legislators about what is happening
and its significance, and I am sure that it is time that this was
reviewed. I cannot stress strongly enough my appreciation of those who
have brought this amendment

Palmer of Childs Hill (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lord Hodgson for bringing this amendment forward because it is
clear in my mind 
<?notus-xml column=88?>that your Lordships’ House needs to have a debate on this
subject, not just in the APPG but elsewhere. What I am not so happy
with is the amendment to Clause 5. The real problem seems to be that we
do not debate defence Bills very often in your Lordships’ House
and there are very few places one can table an amendment such as this
and the other amendment in this group. I therefore appreciate why it is
here. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, said drones are treated
as aircraft. Clause 5, which relates to the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Defence Police, refers to aircraft and hovercraft, so if a
drone is an aircraft, it is in. At the moment, it is not, so perhaps we
need some clarification on that, because definitions are
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000043">A
good point was made about unmanned aerial systems, because it is almost
giving them a respectable name. The public know the name
“drones”, and we now seem to have tried to find a longer,
more convoluted phrase. I think a spade should be called a spade. If it
is a drone, it is drone. I wonder whether there is a
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000044">The
real problem as far as the public and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, are
concerned is the collateral damage when drones are used. Oversight is
essential, but the worry in international legislation at the moment is
that if someone in Texas, or maybe Nevada, is operating them, will they
be harassed if an error happens? I suppose errors should not happen.

other point that has not yet been made is about the other uses of
drones, because this is a defence Bill. However, Amazon has been
considering using drones to deliver parcels. It is at an experimental
phase but I imagine that it will continue. The real point is that I am
greatly worried about drones used as armed weapons. The fact that there
is no pilot in the plane makes it more dangerous in many ways. I am not
so worried—in fact, it can be safer to the Armed Forces and
civilians—if drones are used to gather information on
battlefields or the like. I welcome this discussion, although I do not
think that the amendment has a place in the Bill. However, there is an
argument for having a debate and a Bill on this and other matters
separately to this Bill, which is mainly about procurement and the

if we are to have this kind of debate, we need to be clear on a few
things. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:17:22"></hs_TimeCode>
first is that we should differentiate between systems and outcomes. The
legal framework for the use of armed force within the UK is essentially
about the outcomes that people 
<?notus-xml column=89?>are allowed to inflict on others, not the systems that they use for
those outcomes. If you think in terms of the unmanned aerial systems
that we currently use, there is little, if any, difference between
someone piloting the system from within a cabin on an airbase
somewhere—looking into a screen in that cabin, making the
decision about whether to engage a target and then firing a
weapon—and someone doing exactly the same thing from the cockpit
of an aircraft at 20,000 feet or 30,000 feet. In fact, the only real
difference is that the person on the ground is likely to make better
decisions because he is looking at a bigger screen, with greater
definition, he will be able to see more detail of the target area, and
he will be in a better position to avoid collateral
damage<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:17:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

second point is that today and in the future, before any clearance is
given for a target to be engaged by the UK Armed Forces, two questions
inevitably have to be answered. The first is: is it legal? That, as we
have all heard, can be a difficult issue, particularly in the area of
international law, and it is sometimes clear that we would reach
different conclusions on that matter from those of some of our allies.
That remains an issue. The second question is: is it wise? Does it
actually further your strategic objectives or does it hinder them? As
we have heard in this Room, and I agree, these systems have in some
circumstances been used unwisely in terms of furthering one’s
strategic objectives. However, we should be clear in distinguishing
between the two<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
In attacks on targets by US systems that are operating from—or
with the support of—the UK, the situation is clear. Such attacks
require clearance from the UK as well as from the United States
targeting authorities. Having been in this position, I can assure your
Lordships that that happens every time, even when it means waking up
the Attorney-General, night after night, at 4 am, as certainly happened
in my
experience<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:19:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which it is important to be clear is that unmanned systems are
not—and certainly will not be in future—constrained
merely to the air. They will operate on the surface of the land and

exploration of these issues, let it be about the widest possible use of
these systems and not just focus on unmanned aerial systems—or
“drones”, as they are incorrectly
called.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000051">Finally,
if we are to have this debate, the most important element is that of
autonomy—already exposed to some degree in the debate today. As
far as I am concerned, all the while that someone in the loop makes a
decision about the legality and military utility of the target being
attacked, the current framework is secure and will save us. When you
introduce degrees of autonomy into the system—decision-making
within the system itself as opposed to leaving it with a human in the
loop—of course you introduce a degree of risk into the whole
process. That is not something that happens at the moment, but it could
happen in future and it is where the focus of our attention should
lie.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000052">I welcome

Stirrup:</Member></B> First, one has to decide upon the reliability of
the intelligence, because intelligence is not knowledge—there is
no certainty about it. What degree of assuredness can we attach to the
intelligence? What sort of cross-referencing is there? Then, everything
else about the target—its structure, the things around it, the
possibilities of collateral damage and all the issues properly raised
under the law of armed conflict; that is, the military utility of
attacking the target versus the possible risks of doing so—is
gone into at great length. Certainly as far as the United
Kingdom—and, in my experience, the United States—is
concerned, it is done with a lawyer looking over one’s shoulder
the whole time. When I was responsible for these sorts of targeting

just amplify one of the points made by my noble and gallant friend. In
the popular mind, so-called “drones”, or “unmanned
aerial systems” or “unmanned aerial

we have used for many years—are large and operate over great
distances. However, within the same overall category come small
battlefield UAVs. Some are small enough to be able to look over a hill
into a valley beyond and report back to a ground tactical commander.
There are reconnaissance and weapons-deploying issues here, and issues
of large and small size. Because of that complexity, the issue
definitely merits further investigation and debate, with the formation
of a wide-ranging piece of legislation dealing with definitions and
bringing the whole into a proper regulatory format. For that reason
alone, while I recognise the intent behind the amendments, this should
be taken forward in a somewhat different

and the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for tabling the two amendments in this
group. It has enabled us to have a useful and interesting debate about
a number of important issues. The Defence Reform Bill deals with the
future arrangements for defence procurement and the Reserve Forces, and
I think it is fair to say that the debate on these amendments has
drifted some way from those issues—a point made by my noble
friend. In responding to them, I will try to address the specific
effect of the amendments on Part 1 of the Bill, but I shall also set
out more widely our position on some of the other issues that have been
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:26:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

detail of the amendments, it might be helpful if I set out the UK
Government’s policy on unmanned aircraft systems. I think it is
important to use the correct terminology when discussing unmanned
aircraft systems, or UASs. The term “drone” is often
used, but the word evokes thoughts and images of computer-controlled
machines free from human oversight, which is simply not the case. The
term “unmanned air vehicle” had previously been used
extensively in the UK, but it is no longer aligned with NATO or
international thinking, and in the interests of interoperability we
have now moved away from using
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:26:55"></hs_TimeCode>it. Often, the
actual level of human involvement is unclear when discussing unmanned
aircraft systems and hence it is entirely appropriate that the term
“remotely piloted aircraft system”, or RPAS, is also used
as it emphasises the reality that a trained professional pilot is in
control of the system. UAS and RPAS are the generic terms that define
the totality of the components of an unmanned or remotely piloted
aircraft together with the other necessary components, including all
equipment networks and, most important,
personnel<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:27:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020584000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000061">The UK operates a range
of these human-controlled systems principally for surveillance and
reconnaissance purposes. There is often a misconception that remotely
piloted aircraft systems are autonomous. Again, we have to be careful
with the terminology as the word “autonomous” can mean
different things to different people and organisations. The Government
consider an autonomous system as being capable of understanding
high-level intent, a system that is capable of deciding a course of
action from a number of alternatives without depending on human
oversight or control. Our current 
<?notus-xml column=92?>and future RPAS will not be autonomous. A military pilot will continue
to remain in control of our armed systems, just as they are now. In
fact, our current armed RPASs have greater human involvement than our
other armed aircraft types. Our Reaper RPAS crews comprise
highly-trained pilots, sensor operators and analysts who all make
decisions in real time.</hs_para>

deploys unmanned aircraft systems in support of operations in
Afghanistan and of Royal Navy ships. These systems are predominantly
used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance tasks, providing
vital intelligence in support of our troops on the ground and our
sailors at sea. They provide persistent video imagery for the
development of situational awareness in order to conduct planning and
to protect our forces. While the sensors are broadly similar to those
onboard conventionally manned aircraft, unmanned or remotely piloted
aircraft systems have the ability to loiter for longer, building an
intelligence picture that significantly enhances the situational
awareness of our
commanders.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020584000308" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000308">4.30

Army currently operates four unarmed unmanned aircraft systems. Hermes
450 is the largest system, followed by the hand-launched Desert Hawk
III and then the Tarantula Hawk, which operates solely as part of an
improvised explosive device route-clearing capability. Finally, it
operates the Black Hornet, which is a palm-launched nano-system used

Hermes 450, which has flown around 85,000 hours for
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes, will be
replaced by the more modern Watchkeeper, which is due to come into

interest without the need to deploy troops into potentially dangerous
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000065">This
brings me on to our larger system, the Reaper RPAS which is operated by
the RAF. Reaper is the UK’s only armed remotely piloted aircraft
system which, again, is predominantly used for surveillance tasks. It
has also been armed with precision-guided weapons since 2008, providing
an offensive capability if needed by our ground
commanders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000066">As
I mentioned previously, a UK Reaper does not have the capability to
fire weapons autonomously and can fire its weapons only when commanded
to do so by the very highly trained and qualified flight crew. When
tasked to attack a target, qualified Reaper pilots can select from two
types of precision-guided weapons, the weapon with the smallest warhead
appropriate to the target being selected. To reassure my noble friend
Lord Palmer, every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties,
aborting attacks when necessary, as is the case with manned aircraft
pilots. I thought the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, set that
out very
clearly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000067">The
UK policy relating to use of and targeting by remotely piloted aircraft
systems is exactly the same as that for manned aircraft. It is entirely
compliant with international humanitarian law and the law of armed
conflict. The rules of engagement used by Reaper 
<?notus-xml column=93?>pilots are no different from those used by manned aircraft pilots.
Targets are always positively identified as legitimate military
objectives following the principles of distinction, humanity,
proportionality and military necessity. The noble and gallant Lord
mentioned the role of lawyers in
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000068">In more
than 55,000 hours of Reaper operations, there has been only one known
incident that resulted in the deaths of civilians. On 25 March 2011, an
attack on two pick-up trucks resulted in the destruction of a
significant quantity of explosives and the death of two insurgents but,
sadly, four Afghanistan civilians were also killed. In line with
current ISAF procedures, an ISAF investigation was conducted to
establish whether any lessons could be learnt or if any errors in
operational procedures could be identified. In that case, the report
concluded that the actions of the Reaper crew had been in accordance
with extant procedures and rules of
engagement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000069">In
considering maritime UASs, the ScanEagle surveillance system is
operated by the Royal Navy and is expected to become fully operational
in the coming weeks. The system is launched from a pneumatic catapult,
from either a Royal Navy or Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, and is fitted
with a high-resolution camera which can see in the dark and poor
visibility. It has a wingspan of just over three metres and can stay
airborne for up to 10 hours, providing real-time intelligence which is
invaluable in protecting our troops. Once again I would like to point
out that ScanEagle is not armed and has no offensive
capability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000070">In
the years to come, technological advances and improving capability are
likely to increase the level of automation in some systems, making the
remote pilot or operator’s job easier, just as in other
non-military equipment. However, I stress that the Government have no
intention to develop systems that operate without human intervention in
the weapon command and control chain. I am not going to comment on the
operations of our allies, and it is long-standing government policy,
for reasons of operational security, that the Government do not comment
on their intelligence-sharing arrangements with coalition partners. I
would also like to emphasise the point that the UK complies fully with
its obligations under international law, as set out in Article 36 of
additional protocol 1 to the Geneva Conventions, to review all new
weapons, and means and methods of
warfare.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000071">Finally,
I am aware that the noble Lords who tabled this amendment have some
concerns regarding the activity that takes place at visiting
forces’ bases in the UK. I would like to take this opportunity

now to the detail of the amendments. They would amend the definition of
the places at which the Ministry of Defence Police have jurisdiction
under Clause 5(1). That clause would amend the Ministry of Defence
Police Act 1987 to make it clear that the MDP has jurisdiction over any
land, vehicles, vessels, aircraft and hovercraft that are in the
possession of, under the control of, or used for the purposes of, a
contractor and used for the purposes of providing defence procurement
services to the Ministry of Defence under Clause 1. The purpose of this
provision is to ensure that the MDP have jurisdiction over any property
or vehicles owned or used by the GOCO for providing defence procurement
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000074">The
amendment seeks to add unmanned aerial systems, distributed common
ground systems, ground control and other stations used to support the
operation of unmanned aerial systems to the things that the MDP will
have jurisdiction over, where these are in the possession etc of the
GOCO. The amendment is unnecessary because where the GOCO controls or
uses ground control stations, they would already fall within MDP
jurisdiction under Clause 5(1) because they are covered by
“land”. In any event, the MDP already have jurisdiction
under the 1987 Act over any land that is owned or under the control of
the Ministry of Defence. Unmanned aerial systems are already covered by
the words “vehicles” and “aircraft”.
Therefore, again the MDP would have jurisdiction over any UAVs in the
possession of or used by the GOCO by virtue of Clause 5(1) of the Bill,
and over any UAVs that are in the possession of or used by the Ministry
of Defence under the existing Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987.
Therefore, these amendments are unnecessary because the items would be

of Defence, under the 1987

and courteous, but I hope that he will say a word more about a couple
of points. First, he stressed the present policy of the UK Government
on autonomous weapons. If that is the case, is there not a strong case
for establishing this principle somewhere in legislation, if not in
this Bill? When war takes place the situation evolves, the pressures
are great, and one wants to be certain that established principles
continue to be observed. Secondly, will he assure us that when he talks
about US forces and what they do and do not do—those forces that
operate from our territory—in future any foreign services using
our territory must give a firm undertaking, with which we must be

for raising the issue of contractor immunity is straightforward. The

have taken to raising issues about the suitability or modification

that this legal probing, basking in the certainty of 20:20 hindsight,
will extend to questioning why original designs or modifications which
subsequently proved unable to match the opposition’s capability
were allowed to persist or be deployed or, alternatively, why
additional steps had not been approved though the technical capability
existed. Such concerns should be borne in mind in any changes to
responsibility for defence procurement. Indeed, they should add further
stimulus to taking positive action to reinstate immunities in a field
of activity where acceptance of risk to life has to be the norm if our
forces are not to be gravely neutered by legal
hindsight”.—[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/12/13;

amendment is designed to probe the case of contractor immunity and how
and to what extent it might be applied. It proposes one particular
approach but I do not suggest that it is the only or necessarily the
most appropriate one. The Committee will have noted that Clause 3 would
appear to provide a company that is or has been a contractor with
unlimited MoD cover for any financial claim that is brought in a court
in the UK against the company. However, this immunity is circumscribed
by requirements in subsections (6) and (8) of this clause. Bearing in
mind the frequency of claims and findings involving defence
contractors, it seems that this sweeping, broad-brush approach should
be further considered in the light of current experience. Would it not
give rise to a good deal of cross-claims—no doubt of value to
the lawyers involved—between the MoD and the delinquent company,
possibly at considerable additional expense to the taxpayer and the
Defence
vote?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000088">My
probing amendment considers an issue of immunity away from the
immediate battlefield—the clear domain of combat
immunity—in an area of defence activity, notably procurement,
that has led or might lead to legal claims by those injured while on
duty or by the families of deceased service personnel. The Minister
will recall in the case of the loss of RAF Nimrod XV230 in Afghanistan
in 2006 that the review found that a number of individuals, including
those in service, civilians and contractors, had been so seriously 
<?notus-xml column=98?>at fault as to bear responsibility for the technical failure that caused
the loss of the aircraft and all those on board. Other more recent
examples of aircraft accidents will be known to the Minister and other
noble Lords, where the absence or incorrect fitting of specific
equipment contributed to disaster. The coroner’s findings in the
tragic death of a Red Arrow pilot, reported in the past week, is one of
these.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020584000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000089">With
Crown immunity available to the MoD, as it was through much of my
service career, service personnel or their families were entitled to
compensation judged by the criteria that unless the MoD could prove
that the injury or death was not due to service, the set rate of
compensation would be awarded. This approach to proof was overturned by
the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces (Compensation Scheme) Order 2005.
Now it must first be established that the injured or deceased were on
duty at the relevant time before they are considered for any award or
compensation.</hs_para>

change in the burden of proof, in a climate where awards in civilian
life appear to far outstrip those available to the Armed Forces. The
Committee may recall the case of the typist with repetitive strain
syndrome being awarded a couple of hundred thousand pounds in
compensation. This has led to a growing number of claims being faced by
the MoD in the recent past. Of course comparisons with civil awards can
be misleading because in addition to a capital sum, guaranteed income
payments, tax-free for life, may be awarded to those service men or
women who are most seriously injured. Even allowing for that and for
less extreme levels of civilian awards and for the recent increases in
compensation for the most seriously injured service personnel, it is
still the case that without court actions, service awards do not come
close to matching those awarded to civilians. Excessive reliance is
placed on the additional support of service charities. It is no wonder,
therefore, that there has been an increase in claims against the
Ministry of Defence. These might have been even greater if I, with the
help of Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:54:05"></hs_TimeCode>

urge the MoD to be sure to put in place more representative
entitlements if they go down the route I am proposing of providing
immunity for the contractor in a GOCO set-up. At the heart of this is
the fact that the training and operations of the Armed Forces cannot be
totally risk free. Immunity coupled with more representative
compensation where death or serious injury occurs is a better
compromise. But because Crown immunity is now so circumscribed by
statute in the Crown Proceedings Acts mentioned in the amendment, I
have proposed a possible way forward if the concept of some specific
contract immunity were to be favoured. Perhaps there is a better
alternative, and I look forward to the Minister’s response. I
hope that he will at least be able to reassure the Committee that the
Government mind is not closed to the reintroduction of immunities at
some future date in a manner that caters for both peacetime and
conflict operations. The Armed Services Act renewal in 2016 
<?notus-xml column=99?>would seem to be the right vehicle for making such a move. I look to the
Minister for some reassurance on that since it could prove to be a more
comprehensive approach than the one in this probing amendment.

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Craig, for his amendment. It enables the Committee to
consider this important issue, which he also raised at Second Reading.
Although the amendment appears to be addressed at giving the GOCO
contractor immunity from liability for mistakes, I believe that the
real intent behind it is to debate the important issue of combat
immunity so far as it concerns our own service personnel. The noble and
gallant Lord is absolutely right to identify the matter as one with
profound implications for the conduct of military affairs in the
future.</hs_para>

that in mind, let me start by saying something about the recent Supreme
Court case known as Smith (No 2). The outcome of the Supreme Court case
in the conjoined cases of Smith and others v MoD, Ellis v MoD, and
Allbutt and others v MoD has created a new situation of which the
implications are not yet clear. These are all tragic cases of deaths on
the field of combat in Iraq. The Government have every sympathy with
the claimants but are obliged to defend these claims on important
grounds of legal principle. Briefly, the argument of the claimants is
that while these tragic incidents did indeed take place in the course
of combat, combat immunity should not apply because the incidents can
be traced back to previous decisions about the provision of equipment
and training to the soldiers which could, they argue, have protected
them more
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000094">The
Government are concerned that this argument could be applied to
virtually any claim to which the principle of combat immunity has
hitherto been understood to apply and if accepted could have the effect
of opening up the conduct of combat to the scrutiny of the courts after
the event. This in turn could have seriously debilitating effects on
the decision-making of commanders on the ground which could in the long
run seriously impair this country’s military effectiveness. They
therefore sought to have the claims dismissed by the courts on the
grounds that combat immunity applied. As the Committee is aware, the
Supreme Court declined to do so. This leaves the claims to be decided
by the lower courts after a full trial in each case. Ministers and the
military chain of command have been clear that commanders and other
military personnel, at whatever level, who make reasonable decisions in
good faith in the course of operations will receive the full backing of
the services and the Government. It is important to be clear that there
has been no decision by the courts that would suggest that they would
impose liability in such
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:03:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government’s initial response to the judgment will therefore be
to defend vigorously these and similar cases which turn on the issue of
combat immunity. For that reason, although we are considering the
option of legislating for a statutory definition of combat immunity, 
<?notus-xml column=100?>and we have not ruled out any legislative possibilities, we think that
it would be premature to bring forward any such proposals at this
stage. Our position is underpinned by our commitment to compensate
soldiers and their families for all injuries and deaths suffered in the
course of employment, including on active operations, on a no-fault
basis through the statutory Armed Forces Compensation Scheme. We firmly
believe that this approach is preferable in principle to the stress and
uncertainty involved in
litigation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000096">Finally,
coming back to the text of the amendment, which seeks to give immunity
to the GOCO, I should like to point out that Clause 3 already provides
a degree of protection for the contractor from exposure to those risks
that are unique to the role it will play in acting for the Ministry of
Defence to deliver the defence procurement services contract. The
contract will be structured so that current and future contracts for
the delivery of defence equipment and support will flow around rather
than through the GOCO. In other words, contracts that are currently
placed between the Secretary of State and industry will continue to be
placed in the same way. The contracts already in place will not be
novated to the GOCO and future contracts will not be placed in the name
of the GOCO. The GOCO will therefore be only a third party to the
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000097">As
the Ministry of Defence remains the contracting party, albeit advised
by the GOCO, liability should continue to lie with Ministry of Defence.
The intent of the clause is to provide the GOCO with protection from
those uncapped and uninsurable potential financial liabilities that
arise uniquely as a consequence of its role. To give the Secretary of
State the power to revive Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1947
in order to grant immunity to the contractor, as the amendment
proposes, would not in fact achieve that effect, since the scope of the
1947 Act was limited to claims against the Crown. However, I hope I
have shown that such a measure is not needed in any case because Clause
3 already ensures that the contractor would not be liable in those
specific
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:02:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000098">The
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, raised a point about the financial
immunity of the contractor. In the context of the Bill, the contractor
is the GOCO. The clause prevents the GOCO being financially liable and
an additional party to contracts between the Secretary of State and
industry because of its role as the Ministry of Defence’s agent.
At the moment, claims would be against the Ministry of Defence only,
and that should remain the case.</hs_para>

essence, the purpose of this amendment is to seek to replicate, in
respect of disclosure of information, the criminal offence provision
contained in Part 2 and Schedule 5 on single-source contracts in Part 1
and Schedule 2 in respect of defence procurement. In paragraphs 4 and 5
of Schedule 2, references are made to “unauthorised
disclosure” and “unauthorised use” 
<?notus-xml column=104?>of information but there is no reference to any penalties or
implications for disclosing or using protected information. However, in
Schedule 5, which relates to wrong disclosure of information obtained
under Part 2, on single-source contracts, there is a
reference to penalties of imprisonment or a
fine.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14020584000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000103">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>
do not understand why there is this distinction on unauthorised
disclosure of information between Part 1 and Part 2. It is our view
that failure to protect protected information from disclosure should be
an offence with laid-down penalties. We appreciate the purpose of
Schedule 2 in enabling a GOCO to be given confidential information
provided by defence suppliers and held currently by DE&amp;S in order
to take over the management of existing MoD contracts should a GOCO
come into
operation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000104">The
Government’s argument for not putting the penalties in Schedule
5 for misuse of confidential information into Schedule 2 appears to be
that the Official Secrets Act, along with the GOCO contract itself and
the constraints of Schedule 2, will give confidential information given
to the GOCO the same protection from disclosure as it has in DE&amp;S
today. If there was a misuse of information, the owner of that
information could bring an action directly against the GOCO as it can
at present against the Ministry of Defence. However, that raises the
obvious question of why similar arrangements are not proposed by the
Government in Schedule 5 in relation to disclosures of information in
respect of single-source
contracts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000105">The
information covered under Schedule 2 will include private and
commercially sensitive information to which the Ministry of Defence has
been given access, outside of a contractual obligation, in
circumstances where the owner has a reasonable expectation that the MoD
would hold it in confidence and not disclose it to a third
party—which, under a GOCO, might regarded by the owner of the
information as including companies that either had been, or might be in
the future, competitor
organisations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000106">The
Government say that it is not appropriate for a criminal offence to be
created for the disclosure of information acquired in the normal course
of defence procurement on individual projects and programmes, but that
a criminal offence of the disclosure of confidential information
provided to the Single Source Regulations Office is justified because
the information is highly detailed supplier information and is
forward-looking, covering future financial performance, anticipated
business plans and planned subcontracting
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000107">If
that is the argument the Government are going to advance again today, I
remain to be convinced by it. Sections of the defence industry have
certainly expressed concerns about the prospect of disclosure of their
confidential information that would be provided to a GOCO operator in
respect of defence procurement contracts and believe that firm
penalties are need to deter such activity. The Government’s
argument may be that the information that would have to be provided in
respect of single-source contracts is likely to be more commercially
sensitive, and thus potentially more damaging if disclosed, than the
information provided under defence procurement contracts. However,
surely that is something that should be reflected in the decision 
<?notus-xml column=105?>on whether to prosecute and through any decision of a court on the level
of the penalty to be imposed rather than by, as the Government propose,
having no provision for any criminal sanction at all in Schedule 2. I

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords,
Schedule<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:09:39"></hs_TimeCode> 2 in
its current form is necessary to allow a GOCO to have access to
existing confidential information provided by defence suppliers that is
held by DE&amp;S so that the GOCO can take over management of existing
MoD contracts. If the GOCO does not have access to that information, it
will seriously curtail the contracts that GOCO will be able to manage.
It will not be able to manage contracts that involve the need to access
confidential information provided by a supplier. If the MoD provides
confidential information from existing programmes to the GOCO without
the protection conveyed by Schedule 2 in its current form, the supplier
of the confidential information may claim that the MoD has no legal
right to do so. The MoD could seek to negotiate amendments to contracts
or obtain licences to supply the necessary information to the GOCO;
however, the volume of information concerned, the amount of time and
resources required to undertake the negotiations, the costs in licence
fees that may be incurred and the possibility of the owner refusing
mean that this is not a practical
proposition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000109">Schedule
2 as currently drafted provides protection for owners of confidential
information because there are only limited
circumstances—essentially where necessary or expedient for
defence procurement—when the MoD can share the information with
the GOCO. Schedule 2 also provides that the GOCO is then subject to the
same confidentiality obligations as the MoD. For example, some of the
information the GOCO has will be classified as “UK eyes
only”, the classification applied to certain information that
cannot be shared with non-UK nationals due to national security issues.
The GOCO would not be able to share this information with any employee
or parent company that does not meet the nationality
requirements.</hs_para>

confidential information, the owner can bring an action directly
against the GOCO in the same manner as it could have done if the MoD
had misused the information. This is in addition to confidentiality
obligations that the MoD will place on the GOCO through the management
services contract. The GOCO will be contractually required to maintain
the confidentiality of supplier information and not to disclose it to
third parties without the permission of the MoD. The GOCO’s
parent companies will be third parties, so the GOCO will not be able to
disclose the information to them without the MoD’s permission.
The Official Secrets Act will also apply to the GOCO and its staff. The
information will therefore receive essentially the same protection from
disclosure as it does in DE&amp;S
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000111">The
proposed amendment to Schedule 2 involves deleting the existing
schedule in its entirety and replacing it by what is largely a
replication of paragraph 2 of Schedule 5, which creates an offence of
disclosure of confidential information provided to the Single Source
Regulations Office. The creation of such an offence is reasonable in
the context where the information is 
<?notus-xml column=106?>highly detailed supplier information that will be received under the
single-source pricing regulations and which suppliers are required to
provide by statute. However, the situation is very different from the
GOCO situation, and it is not appropriate for a criminal offence to be

of defence procurement on individual projects and programmes, where any
confidentiality is capable of being protected by the GOCO contract
coupled with the Schedule 2 constraints. We do not want to create new
offences unless it is absolutely necessary to do so. The single-source
provisions cover a supplier’s future financial performance,
anticipated business plans and planned subcontracting activity. It is
highly unusual for the MoD to receive access to information covered by
Schedule 5. The offence and tariff proposed is consistent with that
applied to other price-regulated industries such as water, utilities,
telecommunications and railways. It is not appropriate to day-to-day
defence procurement business, which is best conducted as a commercial
relationship between the MoD and suppliers.</hs_para>

sensitive, and some of it market-sensitive, and it could do significant
commercial damage if it were to get into the hands of their competitors

ensure that the additional overheads and processes involved would not

Schedule 5. Frankly, if wrongful disclosure of information is going to
become an issue under Schedule 2, it will begin to strike at
the heart of confidence in the arrangements that the
Government wish to proceed with in relation to the GOCO. Sections of

difference to which the Minister has drawn attention is the view that
the kind of information that might be wrongly disclosed in relation to
single-source contracts would be far more damaging than the kind of
information that might be disclosed in relation to defence procurement
contracts under Schedule 2. Many in the defence industry think that the
kind of information that could be disclosed under Schedule 2 could be
extremely damaging to them and do not share the view that only

potentially more damaging if disclosed than information provided under
defence procurement contracts, then surely that should be dealt with in
the decision on whether or not to prosecute—and if there was a
prosecution, reflected in the sentence that the court

“We, as a Government, do not want to keep creating more criminal

14 obliges contractors to inform the Secretary of State for Defence

<?notus-xml column=109?>the reporting obligation will automatically broaden to cover any new

15 seeks to improve scrutiny. It does so in two ways: first, it inserts
a new section into the Visiting Forces Act 1952 to create a mechanism
for scrutinising overseas forces operating in the UK or within
UK-operated facilities. The amendment includes a requirement for the
RAF commander responsible for liaison with visiting forces to report at
least annually to the Secretary of State and a list of factors which
are to be reported
upon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000126">It is
worth while just to reflect on the position of the luckless RAF
commander responsible for liaison. For a sterling officer to be the nut

National Security Agency—is an unenviable position to be in, and
not a career-enhancing one if you are going to rock the boat and

very difficult, but that is by the

were tempted to buttress his position by defining the makeup of the
scrutiny group to include, as it says, a member holding high judicial
office—such as a judge—and a person who is capable of
understanding the technology being used. The amendment defines the
right of access to premises, to receive documents or to interview

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</Member></B> I do not think we are
discussing the other issues at this moment, so I shall return to the
matter of the debate. The fact is that Parliament has time and again
raised this issue. Indeed the Defence Select Committee in another place
also raised it. In October 2004, a number of changes of use at Menwith
Hill were put through as Written Statements prompting the Defence
Select Committee to tell the then Secretary of State, Geoff Hoon,
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14020584000281" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000281">“Despite

is a long history of Parliament being left in ignorance on this issue.
I do not know the reason for that. Was it because Secretaries of State
did not know what was going on there or chose not to let Parliament
know? However, the fact remains that the legislative framework applies
to UK operators and all communications between the UK and abroad. We
now have the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which was brought
in to cover some of these advances in technology. It will not come as a
surprise to Members of the Committee that, under the framework,
authority and warrants must be given if anything is to be done that
would interfere effectively with the private lives of 
<?notus-xml column=112?>UK citizens. We need to know that what happens on UK soil, whether it is
done on American bases or by people in the UK, is covered in the same
way. That is the point of these amendments. In Amendment 15, we would
give responsibility to an individual to ensure a reporting mechanism.

have a heavy responsibility here to make sure that the very
unsatisfactory state that has continued for decades comes to an end. In
last week’s State of the Union address, President Obama promised
to work with the US Congress to reform surveillance programmes. All we
suggest in these amendments is that we in the UK Parliament play our
part in making surveillance accountable. I fully accept the need for a
security programme but of course I am equally concerned about where the
lines are drawn and whether GCHQ overstepped its remit. At least I am
assured that GCHQ has a line of accountability to the Government and
our Ministers, and appears before committees of Parliament. In the case
of the visiting forces, that is something we can remedy by amending the

why we need such arrangements—the forms of monitoring and
oversight such as those proposed in the amendments. Bodies to ensure
that the law is being followed are a normal part of our public
administration. The IPCC scrutinises the police and Her
Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons inspects the prisons, just
as the Care Quality Commission inspects hospitals, and so on. The area
of defence weaponry and its uses is also subject to
law—domestic, international and humanitarian. Machinery to
ensure that the law is adhered to can bring great benefits in informing
the public, counteracting ill informed speculation and strengthening
the hand of all those in the system who want to operate within the law
but may find themselves in a culture where there is no 
<?notus-xml column=114?>pressure to do so because there is no scrutiny and no chance of a

friend Lady Miller, and the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, for their
contributions. I turn to a point made by my noble friend Lord Hodgson
in moving the amendment when he quoted from the useful and interesting
opinion received from Jemima Stratford. As I mentioned, there is an
ambiguity in the approach to international law in the United States and
in this country which raises some of the problems that we are having to
consider today, in particular the problems that would arise—I
realise that the Minister is unable to discuss the transfer of
intelligence between allies—if intelligence were able to be used

purposes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:45:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000151">I
am extremely grateful for having had the chance to read the interesting
interim report of Ben Emmerson QC. The problem is that the United
States considers itself to be involved in a non-international armed
conflict with al-Qaeda and its associated forces that are transnational
in character. That is not merely its view; it is the position endorsed
by the United States Supreme Court in the judgment of Hamdan v
Rumsfeld. There is a problem in it having that position which, as we
heard from the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, is not the
position in this country. There is a difference in the interpretation
of the law. Indeed, the final report of Mr Emmerson will, I hope, help
us to clarify it, but that is the problem that faces us at this
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T17:46:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000152">We
also have to realise that the United States can pray in its own defence
some of the UN Security Council resolutions that were passed in 2001
following 9/11. If we look at UN Security Council Resolution
1368 of 2001, or UN Security Council Resolution 1373, we see that they
almost gave the United States authority to deal with al-Qaeda wherever
it was met. As I say, there is a difference in the interpretation of
international law and an ambiguity that leads to some of the problems
that we are discussing today. Mr Emmerson provides an
interesting discussion of these matters in his report to the UN, and I
hope that if we return to them on Report, it will be possible for other
noble Lords to have read

issue. I am sure he would agree that, having stated that there is a
difference in interpretation, we then have to act in the context of
what is our interpretation. The danger is that we condone from premises
and territory which is ours activity that may be acceptable within the
United States interpretation but which is not acceptable within our
interpretation. Of course, this can realm into very controversial
issues, such as where does extrajudicial killing begin and end? There
is the issue of rendition, as we have seen in the past, and so on. That
is why it is so crucial to remember that the Minister in his very
helpful response to our previous 
<?notus-xml column=115?>debate gave a specific assurance that he would be able to say things at
this stage of our proceedings that would completely reassure us. The
point is that our territory and our premises can be used only in terms

the point that, in the end, what the hell are we defending if we are

am always very worried—and this applies in British domestic

extremism. One of the arguments that they love to use is, “look
at the hypocrisy of these people”. It is, therefore, crucial to

there is a perfectly good and important debate as to what is wise and

counterproductivity and that is why there is a dilemma in considering
how these things should be used—whether there is going to be a

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments have enabled us
to have a debate about a number of issues. The Defence Reform Bill
deals with the future arrangements for defence procurement and the
Reserve Forces. As with Amendments 10 and 11, which we debated earlier,
the issues in this group of amendments go some way from the issues
covered by the Bill. Therefore, I will address the impact of the
amendments on the Bill, and I shall also try to deal with some of the

Amendment 14 which would require the contractor—the
GOCO—to report annually, or more frequently if specified, to the
Secretary of State on the technical characteristics, capabilities and
use of the equipment and services procured under the provisions of Part
1 and to ensure that anyone who provides defence procurement services
to either the GOCO or the MoD provides all the information necessary to
enable such a report to be made. Currently, DE&amp;S does not report to
the Secretary of State on the details of all equipment and services
procured. Procurements are classified on the basis of value, and
approvals take place at the appropriate level, with approvals for very
high value, novel or contentious procurements elevated to the Defence
Council. Where appropriate, DE&amp;S seeks legal assessments of
equipment and services procured. An established project management and
acceptance process exists for equipment and services with the
customer.</hs_para>

this process would continue to exist under the GOCO arrangements. These
arrangements will be agreed in the defence procurement services
contract in place between the contractor and the MoD. It is currently
not practical or necessary for DE&amp;S to report to the Secretary of
State on the details of all equipment and services procured and
likewise it will not be practical or necessary for the GOCO to report

now to Amendments 15 and 16. The proposed addition to the Visiting
Forces Act runs contrary to the purpose of the Act and would impose an
onerous and unnecessary obligation on the Secretary of State for
Defence. The UK welcomes foreign military personnel from a large number
of countries. Their position in the UK is covered by the Visiting
Forces Act and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement. Some are here as
exchange officers, others for major exercises and some for training and
education. This financial year some 3,000 foreign military personnel
will have trained in the UK. For example, 65 foreign students are at
the Royal College of Defence Studies here in London. Some 80 foreign
officer cadets are at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and eight
foreign officers attend the Royal Navy’s principal warfare
officer course at Fareham. These military personnel are so enmeshed
into the activities of the UK Armed Forces that a separate reporting
mechanism concerning procurement, command and control, and premises and
property, is not needed. The amendment is broad since it
concerns,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14020584000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000300">“all

Visiting Forces Act and the NATO Status of Forces Agreement do not
place foreign forces beyond the reach of UK law. The Act and agreement
permit foreign laws and military discipline to apply to foreign

provisions for our forces when they are overseas. For these reasons,
the Government oppose this element of the

Communications Commissioner, and he reports annually to Parliament and
the Prime Minister on the exercise of those powers. I should add that,
as proposed, the amendment would also have the effect of broadening the
Interception Commissioner’s remit to cover the exercise of other
powers, such as covert surveillance, under RIPA. Those powers are, of
course, subject to separate oversight arrangements, not least through

have a word with her after the sitting about my personal experiences

advising commanders at tactical and operational level; in addition,
civilian lawyers advise at operational level and also, crucially, at
strategic level. That means that lawyers are involved at all stages in
operations and, in particular, that civilian lawyers advise and approve
the rules of engagement and targeting directives which set the
framework for the use of force in operations. I hope that that is of
some comfort to her.</hs_para>

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, it is important to
have on the record that these amendments are not meant to undermine

the security of this country depends on working with people and other

about was this: the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, referred to the
creation of a culture, and the question is whether we have the right
culture around how this issue should be approached. I do not want to
stretch the analogy too far, but the problems that happened in the City
of London were about culture. People said, “So long as it is not
breaking the law, we can do more or less what we like”. What the
noble Baroness is putting her finger acutely on is whether we have
people who follow the spirit as well as the letter of the law, or
whether we are, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, in danger of being

strangely, that systems for supervision and scrutiny exist, but he was
not prepared to confirm that they are being used because he could not
say that. That is exactly the culture question. The systems are there,
but are we using them properly? In that sense, unlike his response to
the first group of amendments, this was a rather less than satisfactory
response. We have not addressed the question of anticipatory
self-defence and whether we are providing means of collaboration with
our allies, whoever they may be and who believe that anticipatory
self-defence is okay, in things that would be unlawful under UK law. We
have had a good first canter around the field. My noble friend Lady

vacant posts in the DE&amp;S organisation will be filled, assuming
agreement is reached on the new freedoms and flexibilities, and over
what timescale will they be filled? Are the current discussions with
the Treasury and Cabinet Office about the principle of going outside

of the greater freedoms and flexibilities the Government referred to is

I have not touched on the issue of pensions for the staff but, as I

Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme with the new employer, rather
than having to move to a scheme providing an equivalent pension.
Perhaps the Minister can confirm that that is indeed the case. Of
course, such an arrangement does not mean that the new employer has to
place new staff into the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or,
indeed, to employ them on the same terms and conditions at all; hence

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, the provision in Clause 9 is
necessary to ensure that any initial transfer of civil servants to the
contractor will be under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of
Employment) Regulations 2006, or TUPE. These implement the EU-acquired
rights directive 2001/23EC, which ensures that employees’ rights
are safeguarded in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses,
or parts of undertakings or
businesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000195">The
TUPE regulations protect employees if the business in which they are
employed changes hands or if the services that they provide are to be
provided by 
<?notus-xml column=123?>another organisation. Their effect is to transfer employees and any
rights, powers, duties and liabilities associated with them from the
old employer to the new employer. This includes any rights specified in
their contract of employment, statutory rights, and the right to
continuity of employment. It also includes employees’ rights to
bring a claim against their employer for unfair dismissal, redundancy
or discrimination, unpaid wages, bonuses or holidays, and personal
injury claims. Liabilities arising from such claims also transfer to
the new employer. TUPE gives employees a legal right to transfer to the
new employer on their existing terms and conditions of employment and
with all their existing employment rights and liabilities intact,
although there are special provisions dealing with old-age pensions
under occupational pension schemes.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020584000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000196">Where the sole or
principal reason for a dismissal is the transfer itself, it will
automatically be deemed to be unfair. This is also the case where the
sole or principal reason for the dismissal is a reason connected to the
transfer, unless it is for an economical, technical or organisational
reason—an ETO reason—requiring a change in the workforce,
such as an organisational restructuring resulting in a reduced
workforce requirement, or a business relocation. This ETO defence is
narrow in scope, and it can be difficult for the new employer to
demonstrate. Even if the employer can rely upon an ETO defence and the
dismissal is not automatically unfair, it may still be unfair for other
reasons, such as a failure to consult properly in a redundancy
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000197">Similarly,
the new employer cannot change the terms and conditions of employment
of transferred employees if the sole or principal reason for the change
is the transfer. This is also the case where the sole or principal
reason is connected to the transfer, unless there is an ETO reason for
the change, usually requiring a change in numbers of the workforce.
This often makes it difficult, if not impossible, for new employers to
harmonise terms and conditions of employment of staff immediately after
a TUPE
transfer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000198">There
is a risk that the transfer could be regarded as being outwith the TUPE
regulations and be classed as a public administrative transfer.
Therefore, it is necessary to make clear provision through the Bill and
give the employees certainty that their rights will be protected by the
TUPE regulations. The TUPE regulations list explicitly situations to
which the regulations do not apply, and a public administrative
transfer is one such situation.</hs_para>

that if the contractor seeks to make redundancies or alter terms and
conditions of service, the TUPE regulations will apply. Further,
because the protection of employees’ pensions is limited under
TUPE, the amendments to the Treasury’s fair deal policy as a
result of the Public Service Pensions Act 2013 mean that the employees
will also retain membership of their public sector pension scheme upon
transfer, and the GOCO will enter into an employer admission agreement
with the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office, which will form a
contractually binding agreement to continue to allow access to the
public sector pension schemes for the transferred employees.</hs_para>

is required to avoid any doubt that the TUPE regulations will apply to
the transfer of Ministry of Defence civilian employees to a GOCO. It
will not apply to service personnel, who will remain with their
respective services, and will be placed in the contractor’s
organisation as required to provide military expertise. They will
remain Crown servants and will continue to be managed by their owning
military service, and their terms and conditions of service will
remain.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020584000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000201">The

10 and its related schedule provide a number of necessary safeguards,
including the power for the Secretary of State to create a transfer
scheme which will enable the transfer of the business to another
contractor or, in extremis, back to the Ministry of Defence. When a
contract expires or is terminated, for whatever reason, it may be
necessary for the Ministry of Defence to manage operations itself or to
transfer the undertaking to a new
company.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000203">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T18:25:29"></hs_TimeCode>
this power, it is intended that the Secretary of State would have the
ability to direct the transfer of certain specified property, rights
and/or liabilities such as real property, intellectual property,
contracts and people, to either himself, a company, including a
publicly owned company, or to a new contractor. This power would allow
the Secretary of State to decide exactly what is to be transferred at
the point that the transfer scheme is created. The power may be
exercised in unforeseen circumstances and maximum flexibility is
therefore required. The contractor will be conducting work which is
critical to national security and it would not be appropriate to rely
on contract provisions
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000204">For
example, in a situation where the entity becomes potentially insolvent
and elements of the business are liable to fall into the control of an
administrator, a statutory provision offers more certainty and control
and therefore less risk, while contractual provisions are more easily
amended or subject to dispute. Furthermore, third party rights can
usually only be transferred with the consent of the third party,
whereas a transfer scheme can direct that such rights are transferred.
The intention would be to use such a scheme in only a very limited
number of scenarios, such as the early termination of a contract. The
critical national importance of defence procurement makes it
inappropriate to rely on contractual provisions alone. Moving assets by
a transfer scheme will avoid the need for third party consent and
ensures the continued delivery of defence procurement
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T18:26:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020584000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-gc0001.htm#14020584000205">The
noble Lord, Lord Rosser, asked whether Clauses 8, 9 and 10

transferred. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T18:27:05"></hs_TimeCode>

and flexibilities, agreed with the Treasury and the Cabinet Office,
around how it recruits, awards, retains and manages staff along more
commercial lines, to reflect its role of running some of the most
complex procurement activity in the world. As part of the MoD, DE&amp;S
will remain a Crown body and its staff will continue to be civil
servants. However, there will be a number of significant changes,
including that governance will be through a non-executive chairman, a
CEO and a Chief of Defence Materiel, supported by a board and other
non-executive directors. DE&amp;S will be accountable to Ministers
through an owners’ council, with an agreed corporate plan and

for the work it does. DE&amp;S will publish its own plans and produce
annual reports and accounts, which will be consolidated within those of
the MoD. DE&amp;S will be accountable to Parliament through the CEO as
an additional accounting officer. DE&amp;S will have the freedom to
pay, grade, promote and manage Civil Service staff. These changes will
reinforce the customer-supplier relationship between the military
command customers and DE&amp;S and allow it to move earlier to a

noble Lord asked if there was one competition for each phase. There
will be a single competition for all four domains provided that the
performance of the domains are satisfactory as they transfer. That is,

GOCO-contracted performance, which is required to meet an agreed
standard<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T18:29:05"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Lord asked about discussions on Civil Service pay freedoms.
Discussion is ongoing on whether DE&amp;S will be able to go outside
the Civil Service pay framework. The noble Lord also asked about the
retention of staff. The decision has not yet been made on the
remuneration package for retained staff. Any decision will depend on
the freedoms agreed with Her Majesty’s Treasury and the Cabinet
Office<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T18:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Lord also asked about pensions. Civil servants transferred to the
GOCO will retain their pension arrangements. He asked about a two-tier
workforce. There will inevitably be staff on different terms and
conditions but that will not necessarily create a two-tier workforce.

return to Schedule 2. The noble Lord asked why, if there is a criminal
penalty under Part 2 of the Bill, one should not apply to GOCOs under
Part 1 as supplier contractors are very concerned that GOCOs may misuse
the relevant information. Under single-source provisions, contractors
are compelled to provide information. They have no choice in that.
However, under Part 1 the information is voluntarily given to the MoD
by the contractors as part and parcel of the particular procurement
being negotiated. It should also be remembered that the Part 1
provisions for disclosure of information to the GOCO apply only to
existing and legacy contracts at the date of vesting. After the date of
vesting for all new contracts it will be up to the supplier contractor
to negotiate for appropriate confidentiality clauses to be included in

review is, and will remain, an important means of ensuring that the
actions of Government and other public bodies are lawful. But I am
clear that a wide ranging package of reform is necessary to ensure that

of the reforms I am taking forward were previously announced in the
National Infrastructure Plan and Autumn Statement on 4 and 5 December
respectively. These are the establishment of a specialist Planning
Court, with timescales for case progression in Civil Procedure Rules,
which will speed the consideration of challenges to planning decisions;
changes to the way in which the courts deal with cases raising defects
that are highly unlikely to have affected the outcome, so that judicial
review focuses on matters of substance and not mere technicalities; and
reforms to enable more cases to ‘leapfrog’ directly to
the Supreme Court, ensuring they are resolved more quickly.</hs_para>

take forward a robust package of reforms which will see claimants carry
a more proportionate measure of financial risk when deciding whether to
bring or continue weak claims. This package includes limiting the use
of protective cost orders to exceptional cases with a clear public
interest; ensuring that details of anyone financially backing a
judicial review are disclosed, even if they are not named as a party,
to ensure that costs can be fairly awarded; strengthening the
implications for a legal representative of receiving a Wasted Costs

Autumn Statement ensured that the local government budget is protected
next year so that councils can deliver a council tax freeze. Councils
now have more stability and certainty to plan budgets and move ahead
with transforming local services and ongoing efficiency. English local
government is expected to spend some £117 billion in 2013-14, so
the settlement that we have set out recognises the responsibility of
local government to find sensible savings and make better use of its
resources and leaves councils with considerable total spending power,
with an overall reduction, excluding the Greater London Authority, for
next year of just 2.9 per cent. The settlement also confirms the
£9.5 million that we proposed for the most rural local
authorities in order to assist them in driving forward efficiencies in
their area. This grant will now be known as Rural Services Delivery
Grant in order to better reflect its purpose and will be rolled in to
the settlement, thereby offering further protection for the most rural
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020573000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-wms0001.htm#14020573000042">Every
bit of local government needs to do its bit to help pay off the deficit
left by the Labour Government, given it accounts for a quarter of all
public spending. The settlement offers increased protection from the
safety net so that no council will face a loss of more than 6.9 per
cent in their spending power in 2014-15. This is a higher level of
protection than we offered both last year and the year before. We have
achieved this by increasing the amount we have made available to
protect councils through the Efficiency Support Grant, now worth some
£9.4 million in 2014-15. But we will expect the councils in
receipt of that funding – in line with the efficiencies that we
are asking all councils to deliver – to improve services. We
will be paying £1.7 million to the Efficiency Support Grant
authorities in recognition of the extra progress they have made in
fulfilling their plans in the first half of
2013-14.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020573000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-wms0001.htm#14020573000043">In
order to further facilitate effective budget planning, we are also
making available illustrative figures for 2015-16, and that year marks
the introduction of the Better Care Fund, £3.8 billion worth of
pooled budgets available between health and social care. This is the
largest ever financial incentive for councils and NHS organisations to
jointly plan and deliver joined-up services. Alongside this the New
Homes Bonus remunerates those councils who help build more homes and
bring empty properties back into use. The New Homes Bonus will be some

they can freeze council tax for the next two years. This means we have
provided total freeze funding of up to £5.2 billion up to

funding for 2011-12 and 2013-14 freezes is now in the main local
government settlement total for future years. The Secretary of State
has also agreed with the Chancellor that the funding for these next two
freeze years will also be built into the spending review baseline. We
hope this will give maximum possible certainty for councils that the
extra funding for freezing council tax will remain available, and there
will not be a ‘cliff edge’ effect from the freeze grant
disappearing in due course. We have played our part – we now
expect councils to play theirs. Today I am publishing a list of the 137
authorities that have already indicated they will freeze or cut council
tax, and I encourage all eligible local authorities to follow their
lead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020573000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205-wms0001.htm#14020573000048">The
Localism Act 2011 introduced new protections for local residents
against excessive council tax increases. The report on council tax
referendums proposes to the House a referendum principle of 2.0 per
cent, with a slightly modified principle for the City of London element
of the Greater London Authority precept. This threshold is lower than
last year and, I believe, strikes an appropriate balance between direct
democracy and representative democracy.</hs_para>

most councils will wish to freeze council tax, but any which set an

reductions in the parish tax base. We have not separately identified
the money because it is not ring-fenced and as caseloads change and
schemes evolve, the amount that different parishes need will change. It
would be wrong to try to manage that centrally. But we have been clear

Nash:</Member> Local authorities are under a statutory duty to ensure
that there are sufficient school places in their area. To help them
meet this duty, they have the power to propose the closure of all
categories of maintained schools. The Department for Education issues
statutory guidance for local authorities and others on the statutory
processes surrounding school closure. Specific guidance on deciding
statutory proposals for school closure and the factors that decision
makers should take into account in doing so, is contained in the
“School Organisation Maintained Schools Annex B: Guidance for
Decision-makers” document which is published on the

seek to convert to academy status at any point during the statutory
process which a local authority must follow in order to close it. The
Department does not issue any guidance to local authorities about this.
However, the Secretary of State takes into account local authority
closure plans in deciding whether to approve an application to convert
to academy status. A decision on an academy application would not
normally be taken until after the local statutory process had
concluded.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14020578000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140205w0001.htm#14020578000271">Schools:
