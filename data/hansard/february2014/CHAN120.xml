Gove:</Member></B> The evidence is there in the gap between, for
example, the performance of independent fee-paying schools and state
schools. If one looks at those children who get the best results at the
end of primary school and what happens to those who go on to
independent schools and those who stay in the state sector, one sees
that at the moment those who go on to independent schools are more
likely to get good GCSEs and A-levels. A longer school day is one of
the ingredients that we believe will make a difference. It has already
been the case that great state school heads—for example, Greg
Martin at Durand academy—have come out and explained why, in
their schools, a longer school day definitely helps children,
particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to catch up with
their
peers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T14:36:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that more can do so. Where local authorities experience difficulties in

play a part in making sure that more young people can enjoy the sort of
character-building activities that those organisations believe in. Many
scout troops already work closely with schools, and it is certainly the
case that cadets are an integral part of the success of schools in the
independent and state sectors. I want to do everything possible to
ensure that children can enjoy those activities, and, in particular,
that children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who have not had the
chance in the past, now have that opportunity.</hs_Para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T14:41:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
makes a good point. High-quality, teacher-led early-years education is
vital to closing the gap between those on the lowest and those on the
highest incomes. At the moment, when those children arrive at school,
there is an 18-month vocabulary gap, which is why we are keen, and
Ofsted has confirmed, that although there should be no decision about
exactly what type of teaching takes place, it should be of a high
quality and it should raise the attainment of children and close that
gap before they arrive at
school<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T14:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

issues of historical abuse and the robustness of the current system.
When there has been abuse in the past, we need to investigate it and
take the evidence where it leads. I am clear, however, that the Working
Together guidance—along with all the other work we are doing to
improve social work practice and to free people working on the front
line to spend more time with families rather than sitting behind
desks—is the way forward. We are building on the Laming and
Munro reviews, and that is being reflected in the response not only
that Ofsted is having through its inspections but from front-line
practitioners themselves, who can see the sense in what we are doing to
ensure that all children are kept safe, whatever the
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1402102000018" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0001.htm#1402102000018">Teaching

note that the issue of international development funding was touched on
over the weekend. Let me say this: just as it is a false choice to cast
town versus country, it is also wrong to pit helping the victims of
flooding at home against helping those suffering abroad. We can and
should do both—to help the plight of those facing the awfulness
of flooded homes in Britain, just as we take action to help
malnourished children dying from dirty water abroad. But I believe that
taxpayers’ money should be well spent, and this applies just as
much to quangos as it does to the international aid 
<?notus-xml column=564?>budget. By spending money wisely, we can better meet our moral
obligations, first to Britain and then to the world, but the first and
primary obligation of Her Majesty’s Government is the defence of
the realm—urban and rural, city and county—and that is
exactly what we are

leadership; the Environment Agency will do whatever its political
masters ask it to do, and I think it has done that to the best of its

hon. Gentleman asked about the future security of British civilians in
Kabul. Obviously, we are monitoring the situation closely, and we will
make appropriate arrangements to support British civilians in Kabul,
particularly those on Crown service. He would not expect me to go into
the detail of those arrangements at the Dispatch Box, but there
should be no doubt in anybody’s mind that Kabul will remain a
dangerous place for foreigners for the foreseeable future. We will rely
primarily on the ANSF to maintain security in that
city<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:01:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000173">The
hon. Gentleman talked about the recent rise in the civilian death rate.
That is of course deeply regrettable, but I am sure that he would want
to focus attention on the fact that more than 74% of all civilian
deaths are directly attributable to the insurgency. In fact, the number
of civilian deaths attributable to ISAF action has gone down over time,
and the number of those attributable  
<?notus-xml column=588?>to ISAF air strikes—they were once the cause of considerable
concern—has gone down by 80%. That is something that we will
continue to
pursue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:02:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000174">The
hon. Gentleman asked about election security and what action ISAF will
take. Clearly, ISAF will support the ANSF in every way it can,
particularly in the provision of intelligence and surveillance
capabilities, but the ANSF must take the lead. The message around this
election is that the Afghans have taken lead responsibility for their
security. The ANSF is capable, and it is very determined to be seen to
lead this operation and to deliver the security that
Afghanistan’s fledgling democracy
requires.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000175">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:02:42"></hs_TimeCode>
will be threats to the elections. We have already seen a concerted
campaign of targeted assassinations. I am afraid that the realists
among us expect that to continue and probably to accelerate as we move
towards the election date. It is greatly to the credit of the leaders
of Afghanistan’s democracy that it has not yet in any way
undermined their enthusiasm for the democratic
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:03:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000176">The
hon. Gentleman spoke about the talks going on between the Pakistan
Government and the Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan in relation to the
situation in North Waziristan. We of course hope that there is the
possibility of a solution between the two sides, but it remains the
case that the Pakistan Government have to be willing to take firm
action against the TTP in North Waziristan if a settlement is not
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:03:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000177">The
hon. Gentleman also asked about the reports of joint patrolling in
Sangin. It is very difficult to get to the bottom of these reports, but
I have personally been able to establish at the very highest levels
that there is no mandate from the higher levels of the Afghan system
for any such activity. Indeed, action has been taken to ensure that
nothing that could be interpreted as joint patrolling or any kind of
compromise with the insurgency can happen
again<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:04:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000178">The
hon. Gentleman asked about the UK footprint. As he knows, our position
is that we expect to have a continuing footprint at the Afghan national
army officer academy at Qargha, just outside Kabul. That footprint will
be within a much larger complex, which will have a US and
ANSF-controlled perimeter. I cannot give him the precise number of UK
personnel at the moment, but it will probably be between 150 and 250,
depending on our precise assessment of the force protection needs at
the time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:04:50"></hs_TimeCode>. He
asked what percentage of training at the ANAOA is being done by
Afghans. I cannot give a precise figure. If I can get a useful figure,
I will write to him. It uses a “train the trainer” model,
so we expect the Afghans increasingly to take responsibility for direct
training<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000179">The
hon. Gentleman asked about media reports on remotely piloted air
systems and about US aircraft backfilling for the unavailability of UK
remotely piloted aircraft. We operate a combined fleet with the US and
there is ISAF tasking. UK and US aircraft therefore fly ISAF mission
tasks and they may be piloted by UK or US pilots. However, UK pilots
always operate to UK rules of engagement. The rules of engagement for
remotely piloted aircraft are exactly the same as those for our Tornado
aircraft and those that will apply to our Apache rotary-wing aircraft
when they are in

Gentleman asked for an assurance—with tongue in cheek, I
hope—that any volunteers for redundancy who are currently
serving in Afghanistan will be accepted. I cannot give him that
assurance. They will certainly be considered. The criteria for
voluntary redundancy relate to the future shape of the force and
whether the skills that individuals hold are needed for its
sustainment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T17:06:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402106000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#1402106000181">The
repatriation of equipment is slightly ahead of plan. We have
repatriated about half the equipment that we have to repatriate.
Originally, we estimated that the cost would be up to £300

that we have two offers for locally employed civilians. The first is a
redundancy scheme for eligible individuals who have served on the front
line as interpreters, which allows them to accept a financial and
resettlement package in Afghanistan or to come to the UK. So far, most
of those who are eligible have opted to come to the UK. The second is
an intimidation package for those who are not eligible for resettlement
in the UK under the redundancy scheme, but who have experienced
intimidation in

the hon. Gentleman talked about our future aid budget. We are committed
to providing £170 million per annum of ongoing Department for

Some of that aid is targeted at projects that seek to protect the

Pakistan is crucial to the security of the United Kingdom. A
significant proportion of the potential terrorist threats to the United

a programme of military support for counter-IED training, which is

that that area on the border is difficult to access. The border is very
porous: action on one side tends to drive people across to safe havens
on the other side, and the reverse happens when action starts on the
other side of the border. It needs collaboration. There has been modest
progress at tactical operational level on Afghanistan/Pakistan
co-operation along the border, and we have seen a considerable
de-escalation of tension along the border since the events of November
2012, which led to a serious stand-off and the closure of the reverse
lines of supply through Pakistan. This will be a long haul, but I
believe that the relatively new Government in Pakistan are committed to
working with regional partners to secure stability in Afghanistan, and
that they have realised that stability in Afghanistan is in
Pakistan’s long-term interest.</hs_Para>

some areas are not controlled by the Government and are under the
control of the Taliban. Where there is such an interface, either it can
be dynamic, with continuous fighting, or there can be some kind of
understanding that allows it to be stable and for the boundary to be
recognised. My interaction with senior Afghan commanders and political
leaders reassures me that they do not recognise any arrangements such
as those he describes, and that they have taken steps to ensure that

that our immediate mission was to deny Afghanistan to terrorists who
would have used it as a 
<?notus-xml column=593?>base to strike at us and our allies and interests. But in the long term,
it was never going to be a credible proposition that foreign forces
could hold this territory. We had to build a stable and capable state
in Afghanistan with a security force of its own that could do that job.
My judgment is that a country that has a basic rule of law and
recognises human rights will be a more stable and sustainable place in
the future. A country that has education, health care and
infrastructure will engage the loyalty of its citizens in a way that
Afghan Governments have not always done in the past. We have to be very
careful about the tone of this debate, however. It is not about
exporting our perfect model of society and imposing it on others who in
many fundamental respects will not accept some of the tenets that we

Gentleman’s remarks in context, all those claims, I think, have
been brought by a single law firm that has not stumbled on these
claimants by accident. The reason we are treating them differently is
because the circumstances are different. After careful consideration of
the differences between the situation in Afghanistan and the situation
that existed in Iraq, we took the decision to make the redundancy
package proposal that we have made. We also have in place in
Afghanistan an intimidation policy that is able to deal with any cases

ethnic minorities are protected and enjoy the same rights. Furthermore,
some of the key players in Afghan society and political circles are
Hazara. Of course, however, we should be mindful of the risks to ethnic
minorities and the risk of ethnic fragmentation, which, after all, is
at the root of many of Afghanistan’s historical problems. The

the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier), I think we should reflect on
the fact that two and a half times as many British servicemen have died
in Afghanistan as died in Iraq and that the proportion of injuries
among us and the Americans is about five times that suffered in Iraq.
It is, therefore, inconceivable that there should not be a full and

any elected Afghan politician to recognise the Durand line, which the
Afghan people do not recognise as a fair definition of the boundary of
their country. Having said that, it is not disputes over the Durand
line that make the border porous; it is the nature of the terrain,
which is just about the most inhospitable it is possible to imagine.

Madam Deputy Speaker. My constituent Margaret McNiffe has been denied
her disability living allowance because her claim was considered 24
hours late, although the Department for Work and Pensions had sent the
paperwork to the wrong address. She is now losing the car on which she
relies to get to work, and is forced to use taxis, at great expense, in
order to get around. Do you know whether the Secretary of State for
Work and Pensions has any plans to come to the House to announce a
review of the callous and unfair way in which his Department is doing

costing the country more than it should? Alternatively, can you offer

start with standardised tobacco packaging. As I told the House on 28
November last year, we have asked Sir Cyril Chantler for an independent
view of the public health evidence on standardised packaging of tobacco
products. Sir Cyril’s report is due in March. During
debates in the House, many hon. Members have told me that the
evidence base for standardised packaging continues to grow. The

we are satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to do so, including
public health benefit.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) has tabled three
amendments on standardised packaging. The first five clauses of the
packaging provisions set out the test that Ministers will need to
consider before bringing forward regulations. The regulation-making
powers in the Bill will allow Ministers to take a reasonable and
balanced view of the available evidence regarding the affect that
regulations as a whole would have on the health and welfare of
children. This approach to ministerial decision making is absolutely
appropriate and these clauses are in keeping with the approach that
Minsters would ordinarily take in decision-making processes of this

hon. Friend’s three amendments seek to remove the ability of
Ministers to take a reasonable and balanced view of the evidence, and
we feel that they would put unnecessary and unwarranted constraints on
Ministers’ consideration of how any proposed regulations would
impact on children’s health or welfare. Constraining
Ministers’ decision making in that way would probably have the
effect of stopping the use of the powers altogether. For that reason, I
do not support my hon. Friend’s amendments. I also remind the

e-cigarettes are novel products, we have very little evidence on the

their use might have on the developing lungs of young people. Public
health experts have expressed concern to me that nicotine products
could act as a gateway into smoking tobacco, as well as undermining
efforts to reshape social norms around tobacco use. Young people can
rapidly develop nicotine dependence, and nicotine products deliver
nicotine and cause addiction. Attempts were made last year to include
an age-of-sale provision applicable throughout the EU in the revised
European tobacco products directive, but that was not achieved.

Ellison:</Member></B> My understanding is that if a nicotine-containing
product is licensed for medicinal use—licensed as a quit-smoking
tool—it can already be prescribed by doctors. Some e-cigarette
manufacturers have already indicated that in order to make a medicinal
claim about their product’s ability to help people quit, they
will seek to use the medicines regulations. If such a product becomes
licensed as a medicine, it will be able to be prescribed as a smoking
cessation aid in the same way that other nicotine-containing products
can be. I hope that answer is helpful.</hs_Para>

proxy purchasing, we believe we must take action to address both the
supply of and demand for tobacco products among young people if we are
to reduce the uptake of smoking. Many retailers over the years have
felt a little left alone to bear the burden of enforcement in this
area, so I welcome both the work of responsible retailers to ensure
that tobacco is not sold to people under the age of 18, and the support
provided to them by retailer bodies such as the Association of
Convenience Stores. There is support in both Houses for creating a
proxy purchase offence for tobacco, and the Government have carefully
reflected on the arguments that have been made. Retailers feel it is
unfair that it is an offence for retailers to sell cigarettes to
children and young people, yet there is no offence of proxy purchasing
on behalf of children and young people. Retailers also feel it
is inconsistent to have a proxy purchase offence for alcohol but not
for tobacco. The Government want to continue to tackle the access that
young people have to tobacco, which is why we have proposed this
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000053">The
provisions would make it an offence for an adult to buy, or attempt to
buy, tobacco for someone under the age of 18. That will be enforced by
local authority trading standards officers, who will be able to issue a
fixed penalty notice if they believe an offence has been committed,
rather than taking prosecution action in the first instance. Local
authorities will not be required to carry out regular programmes of
enforcement in the way they have to on age of sale of tobacco, so we do
not believe that this offence will bring into place any significant new
regulatory burdens. Local authorities know their communities better
than anyone and will know how best to address their public health
priorities. We have devolved wide public health responsibilities and
ring-fenced budgets to local authorities, and this amendment allows
them to take targeted enforcement action on proxy purchasing where they
consider it is needed.</hs_Para>

worthwhile deterrent effects. As I said, in a new public health

Government—and all Members—are clear that children should
not be exposed to second-hand smoke, which can be particularly harmful
to young children, and we know that young people often have little
choice about being in places where they are exposed to smoke.
Nevertheless, there are obviously many ways of trying to achieve that
aim, which takes me on to the point about education raised by

need smokers to protect children not only in the family car, but in any
enclosed environment, including the home. Many argue that legislation
is the answer, and we will debate that today, but social marketing
campaigns to help smokers and parents to understand the risks of
second-hand smoke and strongly to encourage voluntary behaviour change
are also vital. We would all like to think that the vast majority of
parents would not knowingly risk the health of their children. In the
event that legislation is introduced to stop smoking in cars carrying
children, we should measure its success by not the number of
enforcement actions, but by the reduction in exposure to second-hand
smoke<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000079">As
I have said, the Government will listen carefully to what Parliament
has to say about the important principle of whether we should have the
power to legislate to prevent smoking in cars when children are
present. We will then consider what needs to happen next, which is why,
if hon. Members will forgive me, I am not able to talk in great detail
about some of the points that they have raised—they are
questions for the next stage, once the will of Parliament has been
expressed. However, in any event, I have asked Public Health England to
continue its work on behaviour change in this area, including through
social marketing campaigns. I have asked it to carry out targeted work
with local authorities and public health directors in places where we
know that there are problems. When Parliament’s will is known
and we can assess the maximum impact that can be achieved through
education, we will consider putting in place wider public information
campaigns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000080">Arguments

is worth remembering that when the Bill left the House, it did not
contain any of the tobacco measures before us today. Those provisions
are a credit to those in the other place who successfully argued for
them, for which I commend them. The package of measures was passed with
a great deal of agreement in the other place, so I hope that we can
preserve that consensus in this

I shall focus my remarks chiefly on smoking in cars carrying children,
let me first speak to the other measures in the group. I welcome Lords
amendment 124, which deals with the standardised packaging
of tobacco products. It must be said that the Government have taken a
rather long and winding route to get to here, with a few sharp turns
along the way. As we heard from the Minister, the Lords amendment is
only an enabling provision, because while it gives Ministers the power
to introduce standardised packaging, we have no 100% assurance that
that will happen. It is no secret that the Opposition would prefer more
immediate action, but it is good that we finally see legislation in
black and white. Labour Members sincerely hope that, once Sir Cyril has
reported, Ministers will do the right thing and use the power. Will the
Minister update us on when Sir Cyril will report? Will she guarantee
that if he does recommend standardised packaging for tobacco products,
secondary legislation will be brought forward before the general
election<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:15:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:15:34"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14021028000177" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000177">6.15

Members wish to speak and we do not have much time. The Minister and
the hon. Lady have talked about smoking in cars, but Lords amendment
125 refers to smoking in a “private vehicle”, which means
that it will cover any vehicle, including motorised homes. We need to

cars<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:15:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000085"><B><Member ContinuationText="Luciana Berger" PimsId="5574" UID="14021028000227" xid="1124" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000227">Luciana

also welcome Lords amendments 122 and 123, which deal with
nicotine-containing products. I agree with the Minister that it is
sensible to prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s.
E-cigarettes can help smokers who are trying to quit, but they should
not be available to children, especially when there are so many
question marks about the long-term health effects of nicotine and when
concern has been expressed that e-cigs might act as gateway products
that could lead some young people to take up tobacco

am especially pleased to support Lords amendment 121, on proxy
purchasing, which will prevent adults from buying cigarettes on behalf
of children. Labour proposed that policy by tabling amendments in the
other place last year. It is already illegal to buy alcohol on behalf
of under-age children, so it does not make sense that the same offence
does not apply to tobacco products given that, if they are used as
directed, they 
<?notus-xml column=611?>kill half of all lifetime smokers. I am glad that the Government now
agree with us, but I hope that the Minister will be able to
share with hon. Members the Government’s rationale for
introducing a maximum fine of £2,500, given that the equivalent
penalty for the alcohol offence is
£5,000<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:17:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000088">Let

my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, who tabled the original
amendment. Since that amendment was successfully passed, the Government
have laid out how that Labour proposal could be written into law. In
the final analysis, the decision before the House comes down to a
simple question: if we know beyond doubt that passive smoking in an
enclosed space can do serious harm to a person’s health and that
hundreds of thousands of children are being subjected to passive
smoking in a car every single week, and if we know from our experience
of similar laws passed in this country and others that legislation can
have a major impact by changing behaviour and improving public health,

are not talking about a small number of cases. Many people have
contacted me in recent days, some of them suffering from many of the
conditions I have mentioned, including asthma, to say that they wish a
ban had been introduced when they were children. Other people have said
in recent weeks, “Surely no adult smokes in a car with
children.” Unfortunately, according to the British Lung
Foundation, nearly half a million children are exposed to potentially
toxic levels of smoke in cars every single week. That number is based
on children aged between 11 and 15. If we take babies, infants and
primary school children into account as well, the number is likely to
be even higher. According to a study by SmokeFree Sports in Liverpool,
the area I represent, around a quarter of nine and 10-year-olds
reported being exposed to smoking in cars.</hs_Para>

brings to the crux of my argument about why the proposal is justified.
This is about children, who often do not have a choice about how they
travel and cannot speak out. In 2010, a third of children surveyed said
that they were too frightened or embarrassed to ask an adult not to
smoke with them in the car. If we want to protect future generations
from the dangers of smoking, we need a comprehensive
approach.</hs_Para>

agree with the Minister when she says that we need better education and
that we have to improve public awareness. Adults and parents have a
duty to act responsibly, but we know from experience that when
education is accompanied by legislation, it can help bring about
profound changes in behaviour. That is why we already have laws on what
people can and cannot do in cars, from not using mobile phones at the
wheel to compulsory use of car seats for children under the age of
five. It is why our existing smoke-free legislation already makes it
illegal to smoke in the workplace or in public vehicles. The proposal
to protect children from smoking in cars would build on that

that they smoke no tobacco. I agree with the Minister that we should

support the Government and the Opposition on banning smoking in cars
with children. Enforcement is always an issue, and we accept that. When
I first started driving, people had to have seat belts in cars but did
not have to wear them, and only one person in four did so. When the law
was changed, 90% of people started wearing them practically overnight.
This is about changing habits. We could not have a worse situation than
somebody in a confined space like a car smoking cigarettes when
children are there.</hs_Para>

Paisley:</Member></B> Like a number of Members, I am deeply concerned
that this provision means that Parliament will slowly but surely become
a farce. If Parliament wants to start legislating on issues for reasons
of good public relations, this provision is a good idea. However, if we
peel it back and look at the evidence, we will see that it is not
essential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000142">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:43:31"></hs_TimeCode>
should take time to reflect on the evidence in favour of the Lords
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:43:31"></hs_TimeCode>. On
legislating to prevent people from smoking in cars when children are
present, let us be clear that the law, under rule 148 of The Highway
Code, currently prevents a driver from smoking in any vehicle. He or
she should not smoke in any vehicle when driving, so Lords amendment
125 is about the behaviour of passengers and not necessarily that of
the driver. That will make it even more difficult for the
enforcer—the police officer—to determine the actions and
age of those smoking in a vehicle.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:44:29"></hs_TimeCode> should be in
the business of making good, sound and solid legislation, and I do not
believe that this provision has been properly thought out. It should be
taken back to the drawing
board<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:44:34"></hs_TimeCode> and we

issue of enforcement is utterly critical, because the police are
already not properly resourced to do the job they are currently asked
to do in combating real criminals. If we set up another criminal class
in the community, we will have to ask the police to go after them. Some
police officers will take great joy in going after a soft-touch
conviction, but that is missing the point and we have to recognise that
the police would not have sufficient resources to tackle the
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000144">The

tonight. According to tobacco consumption rates in the United Kingdom,
22% of people smoke in the Liverpool district, but according to the
statistic put in front of us tonight, 25% of all children are subject
to being in front of smokers. The number of people smoking is,

decimate an industry. There is not sufficient evidence to show that
they will do what everyone wants them to do, which is to stop people

Labour” or “Vote Conservative” on them. Believe
you me, Mr Deputy Speaker: whenever cigarettes are sold in the future
under this provision, these boxes will be given out freely by certain
companies because they will take away the one warning that we do know
is important, which is that smoking kills. Tonight we are putting in

Members have mentioned the non-wearing of

is a tricky misdemeanour to spot if ever there was one. It needs an
eagle eye, but the police routinely monitor drivers and passengers
alike to ensure compliance with the law. The introduction of
legislation in 2006 to make the use of appropriate child restraints
mandatory for children under the age of 12 were also considered very
complex, and similar concerns were raised at the time. However,
implementation went ahead and has been successfully
enforced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021028000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0002.htm#14021028000165">To<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:55:59"></hs_TimeCode>
argue that it would be too difficult and burdensome for officers to
spot the act of smoking in a car, or to identify whether a child is
being carried at the same time, is therefore no excuse. Indeed, I argue
that such actions are markedly easier to recognise than gauging the
height of a seated child to ascertain whether correct restraints are
used. To suggest that officers would be unable to identify such
instances is to underestimate their competence. I take much comfort
from knowing that when educational campaigns on seatbelts accompanied
the legislation, seatbelt use shot up from 25% to 91%, and from knowing
that Department of Health figures indicate that there was 98%
compliance from the moment the smoke-free legislation was introduced. I
hope that the instances of such rules being flouted would be few and
far between as a result of Britons’ law-abiding nature.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T18:56:27"></hs_TimeCode> remain

every year. That is why I strongly support, and urge hon. Members on
both sides of the House to support, the Lords amendment to provide for
the power to regulate and standardise packaging. I do so not least
because of the evidence from the tobacco industry’s campaign
against it, and from documents released through court cases that have

have listened carefully to the arguments against this proposal, but I
find very little merit in them. The idea that this measure is an
example of the illiberal nanny state is misguided. Law making is often
about striking a balance between competing rights. On what balance of
rights does the right of a smoker to smoke outweigh the right of a
child to grow up healthy? I do not accept that an adult should have the
right to harm a child who is powerless to protect him or herself. An
adult who is in a car with a smoker can get out if they want
to. Often, a child
cannot.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021036000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021036000024">To<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T19:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>

serious about this measure, we should have the courage of our

ban on smoking in private homes. As I said earlier—not entirely
facetiously—we must face the logic that pregnant women who can
do untold damage to their unborn children through smoking and through
foetal alcohol syndrome, which affects one in 100 children with very
serious consequences, should be criminalised for doing the
same thing in principle that this amendment tries to criminalise. Then
there are the implications of not feeding our children healthy food.

believe it should be. It provides an opportunity to protect children in
the way it describes, and it is likely, however difficult it may be to
police, that people will accept that the law has been passed by
Parliament, and that there will be a greater desire to ensure that it
is observed. This measure is worth a try, and anything that can protect

Blackman</B> (Harrow East) (Con):</Member> I speak as the secretary of

available, but the facts and figures have been presented to the House.
The fact is that the younger people start to smoke, the more damage
they do to their health and the shorter their lives as a result. The
key point is that most young people start smoking because of their
parents, siblings, friends or the media marketing of big tobacco. We
need to take away the capability of big tobacco to market to young
people, and I support wholeheartedly the measures on standardised
packaging. Those opposing measures to stop parents smoking in cars
carrying children should understand that a car contains 11 times more
tobacco and nicotine than a smoky pub. Even more importantly, if a
parent is driving a car with all four windows open, the level of
pollution is treble the amount recommended by the US Environmental
Protection Agency or the World Health Organisation. That is extremely
damaging to children’s health, and I support the Lords
amendment.</hs_Para>

continued interest in this important matter. The whole basis of the
amendment is to extend the provisions that already exist, so that
anyone who wants to make further inquiries, about accessing information
or making contact, has to do so through the intermediary services.
There is not a presumption, therefore, in that sense. We are looking to
go beyond the direct line of descendants from the adopted person, who
obviously fall within the prescribed relationship category, and consult
on whether we should widen that to others. The provision certainly does
not work on the basis that if someone does not want to have contact
there is a presumption that that will take

anyone who seeks access does so in a way that does not compromise the
position of the person they are seeking either to gain access to or
make contact with. That is in line with the approach that already
exists, and which works well and successfully. What I can say on the
record to reassure my hon. Friend is that this will not force anybody
to have contact if they do not wish to do so. Clearly, there will be
lots of reasons why people will either want to make contact or have
access to records. For example, someone may want to understand the
genetic history of direct descendants to see whether there is a
prevalent hereditary disease to which they are more prone.</hs_Para>

considered kinship care and decided that it was not the most
appropriate placement. Also in part 1, through amendments 7 to 10, we
have introduced an affirmative resolution procedure in relation to the

noble Lords accepted the principle and purpose of clause 11. However,
we have accepted amendment 12 to clause 11 from the noble and learned

introduces a presumption that a child’s welfare will be
furthered by the involvement of each parent, where this is safe and
subject to the overarching principle that the child’s welfare
must be paramount. Baroness Butler-Sloss’s amendment addresses
concerns raised that the clause could be misinterpreted as giving a
parent a right to a certain amount of time with a child. That was never
the intention, as I have said several times during the Bill’s
passage. The amendment addresses those concerns by clarifying that
“involvement” does not mean a particular amount of
time.</hs_Para>

contact makes it clear what we mean by “contact”. As I
know from my time practising in the family courts, many orders are set

lengths to set out, with the help of parliamentary counsel, exactly how
that would operate. Baroness Butler-Sloss, with her esteemed legal
mind, was happy to accept it in the terms we set out. So I do not see
any conflict. We have been clear from the start that this is about the
right of the child to have a meaningful relationship with both parents,
where it is safe for them to do so and in their best interests, and
their lordships have agreed to that presumption and principle. The only

outside their educational environment. We have taken that into account

that it reflects what we know works on the ground. That will continue

14th time during the passage of this Bill—for her continued
constructive approach to this part of the Bill. I know she has a keen
interest from her own family background in ensuring that we produce a
system that has children and their families at its heart. We had an
interesting and quite long debate in the Commons and another place
about the local offer and minimum standards, as well as—from
memory—a number of Westminster Hall debates.</hs_Para>

is clear from both the regulation on the local offer that we have set
out and the code of practice that having a national framework not only
provides some of the stability in provision that the hon. Lady is
looking for, but allows the local offer to be truly local, so that
people have a genuine reflection of what their local authority expects
to be available and deliverable for children and families in that area.
Therefore, although I hear her continued call—which I think is
for national minimum standards—I think we have got the balance
right between having a national framework and giving parents and young
people the opportunity to be consulted on the local offer and comment
on it as it is developed, and also, given the addition to the Bill and
the code since the Commons stages, ensuring that local authorities
respond to the queries and concerns raised by

The other thing we have done to ensure that implementation is as
successful as it can be across the country is to carry out a local
authority readiness survey. We are working with local authorities that

ensure that they get the best possible outcomes. We have a number of

meaty group of amendments that will strengthen protections and support

relevant health commissioners to arrange appropriate special education

the arrangements whereby local authorities fund early years providers

I think it is very good news. I also welcome what he said about Paul

the Minister say something about the potential for extending the

the Care Bill and elsewhere in this Bill, to move towards looking at it

the decision to recognise the importance of kinship and friends when

we do not want shoddy childminder agencies on the cheap, with little or

<?notus-xml column=649?>did not consult effectively with childminders on this proposal, and it

have gone ahead, so we need to be clear that Ofsted will have
sufficient powers to check the quality of care provided by individuals

agency or individual provision is not up to standard. There is a

are in the right place and the legislation is now in good order.
Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T20:46:21"></hs_TimeCode> us not
forget that the process that got us to this stage predates First
Reading, because there was an extensive consultation process. A
consultation paper was issued in 2011, followed by many months of
proper consultation not only with education providers and the third
sector, but with children and young people themselves, whose views have
been brought to bear in large measure in the

this morning I visited one of the special schools in Swindon, the
Uplands secondary school, where the Uplands Educational Trust was
holding its annual general meeting. It is a new organisation that has
been set up purely to start offering post-19 provision for young people
who have gone through the school system and hit the cliff edge of
transition, which is still a problem that bedevils parents, carers and
young people in the education system and beyond. It is an admirable and
excellent initiative that I fully support. I believe that such
organisations will be the mainstay of enhancing and developing post-19
provision right up to the age of 25 and beyond for many young people
with disabilities and special educational needs.
Without<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T20:49:48"></hs_TimeCode> the
input of such organisations, I worry that the aspirations in the Bill

met.</hs_Para>

period the most difficult one of all, despite the good intentions and
the good work of local authorities, such as Swindon borough council.
The message that they wished me to convey to the House is that in many

through the affirmative procedure in this House in its first iteration,
with subsequent revisions made using the negative procedure, which
should allow for frequent updating. The existing code has not
been updated since 2001—hardly the embodiment of the
living instrument that I and many others expect the code of practice to
become. It is my sincere hope and fervent wish that the Government take
on board the failure of that code to keep up to date with modern

hard with my hon. Friend the Minister for a streamlining of the system.
My worry was that despite the proper attempt to bring health, education

support the provisions that relate to the use of mediation for
parents, because we do not want more of the adversarial combat that has
bedevilled the fight that many families have had to undergo to obtain
SEN provision. It is important that the pilot becomes a reality, that
the intentions in the Bill are not left to lie gathering dust, and that
there is a proper evaluation of the pilot so that, if it proves
necessary, we can go down the road of having a single point of redress
provided by the first-tier

of the most important amendments deal with the extension of the duty on
local authorities to identify not only children and young people with

hugely important concession that goes a long way towards satisfying the
concerns of those of us who were worried about what happens to children
and young people who are, for example, on school action or school
action plus and would not be caught by the provisions.
These<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T20:53:28"></hs_TimeCode>
amendments, which are replicated throughout the Bill, will make a huge
difference to the lives of young people with a disability. They also
give added impetus to the need for early identification of a health
issue. Leaving these matters until full-time education is not good
enough when there is so much more we can do during the early years and,
indeed, the very early years to identify disability so that, way before
the child gets to school, action is taken not only to diagnose the
condition, whatever it may be, but to assist them and their family with
its consequences.</hs_Para>

written is that it might be interpreted as only being a consideration
in a long-standing foster placement, whereas the provision gives young
people the option to stay put with foster parents, even if they have
only been there for a few weeks. It is important that this is seen as
an option for those vulnerable young people who may have left a
children’s home aged 16 and were not able to cope in the
accommodation they were then offered. Foster care would be a good

only weakness I identify is the continued lack of regulation on the
local offer for children and young people mandated by clause

the introduction of minimum standards for the local offer—the

consistently resisted. I appreciate that Ministers have taken steps to
increase the accountability and responsiveness of the offer made by
local authorities, but I ask the Minister to undertake carefully to
monitor the standards set by different local authorities across the

ambitions so that they can succeed in
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:03:33"></hs_TimeCode>. The Bill
should not open a door to local authorities to take that support away,
simply because someone needs longer to complete their education or

want quickly to mention Lords amendment 110. It affects clause 67,
which governs the new code of practice as regards special educational

new SEN code of practice is expected to be published. I am told that it
might not be published until June, which would leave very little time
for the new system to come into force from September. I appreciate that
it will take up to three years to migrate existing statement holders to

am aware of the time, so I shall touch on Lords amendment 128 only
briefly. It will enable young people in foster care to live at home
until the age of 21 if that is right for them and their foster family
agrees. The Select Committee has long been concerned about the position
of children who are fostered or in care, and about the accommodation
and support that is provided for them. We welcome the announcement of
greater support for 16 to 17-year-olds that was made by the Department
last summer. This amendment continues the spirit of that work. It is
both sensible and sensitive to young people’s needs. The comfort
that is derived from having a family home does not end at 18. Allowing
young people who may have had particularly disturbed childhoods to
continue to enjoy the support of their foster family until 21 is quite
simply the right thing to do. The Minister and the Government deserve
to be congratulated on adopting the
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021048000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021048000058">I
was delighted to see Lords amendment 129 included in the Bill. It
inserts a duty to support pupils with medical conditions. Members from

having to leave work to pick up their kids and take them elsewhere. I

amendment 135 represents something of an exception to my generally
positive feelings about the Bill. I want to be clear at the
outset that free school meals are a matter of basic social justice and
I wholeheartedly support them. However, I am wary about extending free
school meals to all pupils in reception and years 1 and 2,
regardless of how well off their parents are. I ask the Minister
whether it would not have been better, at a time of austerity,
to target the extra funding more carefully, either by extending free
school meals to families whose earnings place them just above the
current entitlement threshold or by providing extra funding for
valuable schemes such as breakfast clubs to help the pupils who most
need them. Perhaps the funding could have been used to ensure that
sixth-form colleges and further education colleges are not penalised by
having to pay VAT or through 18-year-olds losing funding because of
pressures elsewhere in the budget.
Like<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:08:00"></hs_TimeCode> any
Government spending, this policy has to be paid for. It might not worry
our coalition partners, but this amendment means that the Government

Last Friday, I visited Walkington primary school in my constituency. It
is a great school. Over the past three years, thanks to the hard work
of its teachers, it has moved from the 52nd to the 12th percentile in
terms of progress. It has achieved that despite receiving £500
less per head than the national median funding for primary schools.
Funding is a constant struggle, not just for Walkington, but for
schools across my home county of the East Riding of Yorkshire, which is
the area that receives the third lowest amount of funding in the
country. In that context, I find it hard to believe that some of the
£600 million that has been allocated to the free school meals
policy could not have been better spent to promote fairer outcomes for
all, wherever they may

prospects for looked-after children always unite the House, and efforts
have been made across the parties and in the other place to progress

briefly to highlight two points this evening. The first is the
extremely positive development in part 5 of the Bill that makes
provision for young people to remain, or, as the phrase goes, to
“stay put”, in foster care until the age of 21. It is
almost impossible for any of us to imagine how, in addition to all the
challenges that young people face when considering their careers and
their journey into adult life, some will have the added uncertainty of
their whole home support network being in possible jeopardy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021048000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021048000068">Too often I
have seen court cases involving older teenage children where, despite
the best efforts of all those involved—the judiciary,
solicitors, social work team and so on—and a care plan that is
always carefully worded and constructed along with the legislation,
there is always a concern that there is only so much the court can do.
Previously, up to the age of 16 or 17 there was that uncertainty, and a
gap in the provision of services. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the
Minister in leading on these measures. The whole House has worked
extremely hard to identify those gaps and to ensure that continued
provision, which is much needed for young people as they move into the
adult world. The Bill will need time to be implemented, and we will
also need time to evaluate and assess the success of what is being
proposed. Nevertheless, I think that all involved will see tonight as a
significant step forward for looked-after children.</hs_Para>

point is about clause 11. The House has had the benefit of the
expertise of Baroness Butler-Sloss who assisted in that section of the
Bill. As the former president of the family division, she may perhaps
offer more expertise than most of us when it comes to understanding how
the drafting of the clause may be interpreted in the family courts. I
have no doubt that the starting point for all courts when considering
contact and residence applications has been, and will continue to be,
that children will always benefit from a relationship with both of
their parents, unless there is a good reason to move away from
that.</hs_Para>

practitioner I have no doubt that contact and residence cases can be
the most emotive and difficult litigation for individuals to commence.
Put simply, it is to do with the relationship that people have with
their own flesh and blood. In advance of such cases, those around the
clients involved, such as the solicitors, not only give legal advice
but often take the on role of friend and confidant as they guide the
parents—or increasingly the grandparents—through such
litigation. That highly emotive aspect to these cases is why the
drafting of the Bill is so crucial—drafting is crucial for all
legislation, but it is a particular issue with this clause.</hs_Para>

entitled, “Welfare of the child: parental involvement”.
That maintains the important balance of children having a meaningful
relationship with both parents, but it does in some ways move away from

<?notus-xml column=658?>suggesting that there is any division in terms of
time, which is different from what some of the other proposed phrases
may have done. That was, of course, never the intention of using a
phrase such as “shared parenting”, but I understand why a

way.</hs_Para>

As a member of the Bill Committee, I
would like to comment on two amendments made by their
honourable lordships. The first could improve the Bill, but I
have some reservations about the second. I thank
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:15:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland) for reminding the House of
the lengthy consultation period ahead of the Bill, which gave all
interest groups the opportunity to contribute to both the Bill
Committee and the Select Committee on
Justice.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14021053000101" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000101">9.15

aspect of interest to me in Committee and on Lords amendments—I
tabled amendments—is special educational needs. Approaching 90%
of SEN children do not benefit from having a statement, making it
harder for them to access the support they need. I was therefore
delighted that a number of proposals in the Bill will improve local
accountability and delivery of services. That has been raised with me
by Scope and Ambitious about Autism, which have campaigned effectively
on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000004">The
Bill seeks to establish the right of parents to have their comments on
the local offer of services published. However, amendment 47 was
introduced to force local authorities to publish not only the comments,
but what action the authority plans to take as a result of them. I
support that amendment because I believe it is important that local
authorities develop workable action plans in conjunction with parents,
who should be part of the process and not simply have a plan imposed
upon them. I therefore hope that the proposal means that we begin to
see parents at the heart of decision making, and that that will become
part of the code of
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000005">It
is important that the Government recognise the difficulties that
families often face in accessing specialist support when that support
is located out of area. I therefore hope that the code of practice
ensures the promotion of specialist services that are accessible and
are provided as locally as possible, perhaps by integrating the
development and provision of specialist services with other local
community services, and not separately, as so often happens at
present.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000006">One
further point raised with me by, among others, the Special Educational
Consortium, is the need for a single point of redress, which the
Minister has mentioned. He recently stated that there is to be a
review, but will he take the opportunity this evening to give the
Government’s position on a single point of redress and the
review, and on the pilot of the complaints and appeals process for
education, health and care plans? Clarity would be very much
appreciated.</hs_Para>

the Bill, I am conscious that I am following
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:17:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Erewash (Jessica Lee), who spoke to the amendment to
clause 11. The noble and learned Baroness Butler-Sloss, who
moved the amendment, is widely acknowledged as the country’s
greatest expert, so it is with some trepidation that I raise the issue.
She sought to clarify what exactly the clause means in practical
application regarding non-resident parents. My fear is that, in so
doing, the clause, which sought to enshrine the right of the child to
have a meaningful ongoing relationship with both parents, is watered
down. I seek reassurance from the Minister on that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000008">The
welfare of the child should be the court’s paramount concern,
but it should not be the court’s only concern. The legal system
must ensure that the child’s welfare comes first, but it should
not ignore the welfare of parents, whether a mother or a father. Few
people consider the emotional and psychological impact that enforced
separation from one’s own flesh and blood can have. The
unintended negative consequence of the paramountcy principle is that
the feelings of separated parents are simply not considered. That
situation must change in the interests of justice for parents. It is
also sound public policy and will lead to children being less damaged
by their parents’
separation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000009">However,
even considering only the benefits of shared parenting from the
perspective of child welfare, volumes of research show that shared
parenting is hugely beneficial to children, especially when a father is
separated from his daughter. Contact is more likely to decline if the
child is female, meaning that young girls pay a heavier price for
divorce and separation than young boys, as Dr Linda
Nielsen’s recent paper sets out. Indeed, the paramountcy
principle applied correctly so that the welfare of the child comes
first means encouraging shared parenting, not discouraging or paying
lip service to it. That is the core of my concern with the amendment.
It appears to erode the positive steps that the clause originally made
towards a culture of shared
parenting<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:19:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000010"><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Bridgen" PimsId="5593" UID="14021053000106" xid="1220" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000106"><B>Andrew

she agree that the major part of the problem is the failure of the

engage in parental alienation and prevent court order access, which

Nokes:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention.
CAFCASS has an incredibly difficult job to do, but too often it fails
to deal with issues such as parental alienation, and it is important
that we consider the problem of poor enforcement of contact orders when
non-resident parents are granted access but resident parents ignore
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000012">The
current situation does not work, and both coalition partners gave
commitments on several areas relating to family law reform. Some of
those issues—mediation and dispute resolution, better
enforcement of contact 
<?notus-xml column=660?>orders and, I hope, reform of court practices—will be genuinely
improved by the Bill, but both coalition partners also gave clear
commitments on the subject of shared parenting or shared contact.
Indeed, my hon. Friend the Minister said that courts are seen as
creating winners and losers, and it is vital that both parents feel
confident that the court will consider fully the benefits of their
involvement.</hs_Para>

Government have worked hard to strike the right balance, called for by
groups such as Families Need Fathers, UK Family Law Reform and the
Association for Shared Parenting. Clearly, the legislative intent of
clause 11 was to bridge the gap between delivering tangible progress on
shared parenting while ensuring the paramount need of the
child’s welfare was preserved through a presumption in favour of
shared contact, providing there was no good reason to oppose
it.</hs_Para>

on a promise to seek a legal presumption in favour of automatic shared
contact, something that the Bill achieved before the amendment was
added, but clause 11, as amended, will not deliver what we promised. I
hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me on that point and
confirm that I am incorrect in that. There is a whole library of
research showing the benefits to a child of a proper, meaningful and
ongoing relationship with the non-resident parent. If, as a society, we
are genuinely interested in tackling the impact of family breakdown, we
must start by encouraging and enabling non-resident parents to remain
active in their children’s
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000015">The
amendment plays into the hands of obstructive resident parents who wish
to prevent a child from having a meaningful, ongoing relationship with
an absent parent, and puts us back into a situation of winners and
losers. Some 10% to 20% of separations—often those that are the
most rancorous and upsetting, and in which winners and losers are
created—come before the courts. It is right that the court
should be bound by the paramountcy principle, but the culture of shared
parenting should be driven home, forcing hitherto hostile and
oppositional parents to work together in the interests of their
child.</hs_Para>

her place but performed her role in Committee with great aplomb. She

shall concentrate on one basic statistic. In 1986, the employment rate
for mothers whose youngest child is under three was 25%. Today, it is
56% and rising. That 
<?notus-xml column=661?>matters because it says everything about how the world has changed. If
so many more women are in work—more than half of all mothers
with children under three—child care is instantly an issue. That
is why I raised the issue of childminders. In my constituency, if a
family is above the benefits threshold but cannot afford £10,000
or so a year for a nursery, it has a real problem. That is why
childminders are so important for that intermediate child
care and why I make the case for the need to consider people in that
salary band. There is a lot of deprivation in my constituency, and many
people in low-skilled, low-paid work are in that
position.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0003.htm#14021053000020">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:29:47"></hs_TimeCode>
also means that, because both partners are in work, parental love,
affection and child care have to be juggled. Involvement in the
child’s life has been transformed in the past 25 years: fathers
are more involved with their children. Both parents are more involved
with their children than ever before because of social change. That is
why I welcome the changes in the Bill that relate to parental leave.
Shared parental leave is a recognition of how the world has changed so
very

have raised the issue of contact many times in this place: the rights
of children to have access to their parents. I thank the shadow
Minister for using that formulation, because it is very important. It
is a damning statistic that, of the 3 million children who live apart
from a parent, 1 million have no contact with a parent three years
after separation. That is really tragic, particularly given the way the
world has changed. One parent, who was heavily involved in a
child’s upbringing, is suddenly no longer there at all. That is
destabilising to the child. That is why, in times past, I brought in a
Bill to this House to enforce contact properly and place a duty on all.
The right is not the right of the parent, but the right of the child to
know and have a relationship with both their parents: the right of the
child to have access to their parents.</hs_Para>

hope that this last heard my earlier praise for his involvement in this

and purpose that the Bill enshrines in law, in conjunction with many
other measures we are taking, both through the Bill and in
non-legislative ways, will help to ensure that more children have the
opportunity to have a relationship with both parents. To enable that to
happen in practice, we have made sure that the Judicial College is
aware of the provision in clause 11 and the Government’s
objective behind it. Although it is for the judiciary to consider its
required training itself, we will continue to work with it to ensure
that there is clear information about the intended effect and operation
of the clause, so that they can be reflected, if need be, in future
training.</hs_Para>

is important to make it clear that this is about the right of the

clause—over many years, both in opposition and now in

families who find themselves at the door of a court: we are interested
in only one thing, which is making sure that any children involved in a
case get the opportunity to have their rights put first and, as a

debate is about this House having its say on proposals from the
European Commission which touch on matters at the very heart of our
country’s justice system. The House has the opportunity to
endorse the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee’s

want to be clear from the outset that this is a matter for the House
and it is not the Government’s decision. The treaties give this
House, and all national chambers, the right to issue reasoned opinions
on the principle of subsidiarity, and that is what this debate is
about: the question of subsidiarity. It is not about the question of
the UK’s
opt-in<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:45:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
happy to assure Members that the Government have offered time
to debate the opt-in separately, ahead of the Government’s final

view directly to the European Union—a right this Government will
defend and facilitate to the
hilt<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:46:24"></hs_TimeCode>. The idea
of subsidiarity is that decision-making should take place as closely as
possible to the citizens whom those decisions affect. Under article 5
of protocol 2 to the treaties, the Commission needs to set
out, among other things, a detailed statement on how its proposal
complies with the principle of subsidiarity. The reasons for concluding
that the objective of the proposal can be achieved at EU level must be
substantiated by qualitative and, where possible, quantitative
indicators<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>. To
underline the importance of this, the treaties provide that national
Parliaments—and chambers within national Parliaments—can
deliver reasoned opinions to the Presidents of the EU institutions
where they consider that the Commission has breached the subsidiarity
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:47:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#14021053000067">The
proposal the Commission has put before us relates to the presumption of
innocence, a fundamental principle of our country’s justice
system, as it is of many other countries’ justice systems. No
one in this House would seriously doubt our commitment to the
principle. It stretches back as far as Roman times and is a central
pillar of our common law system, as well as the common law systems in
other countries. Moreover, it has been enshrined and developed in many
civil law systems on the continent

is set out in the universal declaration of human rights and in the
European convention on human rights. It is contained in the French
declaration of the rights of man, and countless other constitutions
around the globe. The problem, and the issue for debate tonight, is

this is a matter for member

Commission bases its argument for the proposal on the fact that member
states are being effectively barred from co-operating in criminal
matters because of differing standards in this area. Here I can only
endorse the view set out in the European Scrutiny Committee’s
report that the case simply has not been made. The Commission itself
admits that evidence is scanty. It may be true that specific rules
vary, and that specific practices and laws will not be identical across
our different jurisdictions. Indeed, it is worth noting in passing that
specific rules vary even across the United Kingdom, but that has, to my
knowledge, never acted as a barrier to the co-operation of our justice
systems<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:49:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#14021053000070">We

much broader issue at stake. As I said, this matter lies at the very
heart of our justice systems as sovereign countries.</hs_Para>

those accused of committing a crime. That instinctively feels like a
matter on which member states themselves should be making
decisions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T21:51:24"></hs_TimeCode>. In so
far as we can conclude that minimum standards are a legitimate
aim—as it seems the Commission has done here—action needs
to be taken at EU level, but under the terms of the treaties that
permit the setting of minimum standards across the EU, we need to be
wary of the Commission bringing forward totally unnecessary

interpretation of similar rights in the ECHR by the European Court of
Human Rights, and so creates separate standards of procedural safeguard
under EU and ECHR law. A domestic consequence of this is that UK laws
on drawing adverse inferences from a failure to cooperate or from
maintaining the right to silence, which are compliant with the ECHR,
would be in conflict with EU law, and so subject to Commission
infringement proceedings and severe financial penalty if not

commemorating 800 years of Magna Carta, although it is sad that his
alienation of the legal profession means, as we learn today, that there
may be a boycott of his global law summit next year. By the same token
the law, specifically the common law, has developed differently here
from how it has on the continent. There will be significant differences
in our approach from that of Roman law jurisdictions. But that does not
mean we should not try to establish certain minimum standards in areas
as fundamental as the presumption of innocence and the specific

Committee identifies, twofold. First, it is not the difference in
standards or the falling short per se that provokes the draft
directive, but the alleged effect that has on confidence in the
judicial systems in states that are failing. There is anecdotal
evidence to support that; indeed, much of the debate about the European
arrest warrant focused on worries about the criminal justice system in
the extraditing state. However, as the Commission itself concedes,
there is “limited statistical quantifiable evidence”, and
that is not a good basis for such a radical restructuring of European
criminal
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#14021053000089">Radical<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T22:00:05"></hs_TimeCode>
though the draft directive may be—this is the second
problem—it goes beyond what the ECHR demands. For example, under
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and subsequent legislation,
it is permitted in English criminal courts to draw inferences from the
silence of the accused. The burden of proof does not always lie on the
prosecution, and the right to representation, interpretation and
translation varies at different stages of the criminal process. I do
not seek to defend the law in its current form by saying that, but I do
say that the directive is not the means by which to open a wholesale
review of those and other provisions of the criminal
law<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T22:00:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021053000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#14021053000090">The

facet of nationhood and the lines by which we govern ourselves. Ours
has been a very long march to get where we are today. I think it was
with Edward III—I have no doubt I will be corrected if I am
wrong—that we started the separation of the judiciary from the
monarchy, which led to the development of our judicial system. I think
that is how most schoolboys of my generation understood its

right to have a legal form that has withstood that number of centuries
is not a casual thing. It is the most extensive, worldwide system of
justice: one thinks of India, Australia, Canada, the United States and
South Africa. It is a huge range, yet the way in which the Government
have come to their conclusion confronts us with a clear loss of
confidence in the very essence of what this Parliament is about and who
we are. We cannot divorce ourselves from that tradition and one cannot
accept that it will be swept aside by mandates from bureaucrats on the
European continent. This is not an attack on them; it is an argument
for confidence in our own constitution and legal
system<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T22:17:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402112000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402112000029">I

is such a measure and, frankly, it goes to the very heart of the
British legal system—the presumption of innocence. Quite
frankly, it is staggering that the EU should try to lecture this
country. That is what it boils down to: the EU is trying to tell this
country how to run its justice system, and trying to interfere with
what we determine about the innocence of a subject until they are
proven guilty in a court of law. This is just a further building block
that the EU Commission sees as a stepping stone on its way to building
an EU-wide common system of criminal justice, but it is one that we

certainly does fail that test, but like other hon. Members, I am
extremely concerned that it appears that we will once again stand alone
in our opposition to it. My understanding—I look forward to
hearing from the Minister whether it is correct—is that the
deadline for objections from member states is 12 February. If that is
the case, there is very little time for this Parliament or any others
to lodge objections. It therefore seems likely, although I wish it were
not the case, that the measure will

Government will not feel that it is necessary to bow to the will of
Brussels on this measure. Although I am at one and in accord with the
Government on their proposal this evening, I would have to depart from
that course if they tried in future to suggest that we should adopt it
given that the European Commission seems likely to pursue it. Bearing
in mind this country’s proud history of establishing our own
system of common law and the rights of an individual to be regarded as

received almost no coverage in the media, particularly the BBC? Perhaps
they will rectify that as a result of this debate. This is a serious
matter and the British public must know what is going on, but there are
limited opportunities for them to find out about it. If this proposal
were in a Bill that dealt with the abolition of trial by jury, it would
have to go through at least three stages in each House and would be
subject to amendments in both Houses. Because it is in a directive, all
we are left with is putting up a reasoned amendment that will be doomed

Anne McIntosh</B> (Thirsk and Malton) (Con):</Member> I am delighted to
have secured the debate. “The wheels on the bus go round and
round” is a well known expression and I hope our bus service
continues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402114000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402114000004">I
should say something about the history and context of the debate. Free
bus passes were started in the late 1990s under the previous
Government. Initially, they were provided locally for concessionary
fares, but then went national. As many hon. Members will remember, the
problem was that they were not adequately funded. When they were
initially rolled out locally, North Yorkshire county council and other
shire counties could support them, but when the free passes for
concessionary travel were rolled out nationally, there was a problem
for Scarborough borough, including the ward of Filey, which is in my
current constituency, and the Harrogate and Knaresborough constituency.
Notably, they are leisure destinations in their own right and attracted
far more visitors than we had ever bargained
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402114000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402114000005">In my view, North
Yorkshire county council is acting entirely properly and responsibly in
that regard, but it faces a double challenge. The first challenge is
that the bus subsidy is being reduced, and the second is that it faces
the national Government austerity programme. Government Members support
that, but the grant to local councils is being reduced by
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402114000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402114000006">I
should like to come up with a solution to the problem and
put a question to my hon. Friend the Minister, my distinguished
constituency neighbour. Obviously, those to whom I have spoken in the
Ryedale forum for older people, in the Filey and Hertford parts of
Scarborough borough council that I represent, and those living in
Thirsk and Easingwold and the parts of Hambleton district council that
I represent, believe that there is no point having the free bus pass if
there is no bus for them to take. I believe that the way forward is to
put concessionary travel by bus on the same legal footing as travel by
rail. That would allow concessionary travel to continue, but
enable those who wish to avail themselves of the concessionary fares to
pay a
contribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402114000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402114000007">My
understanding is that concessionary rail travellers can and do pay a
contribution towards the fare, whereas bus travellers on concessionary
fares will not be permitted to make a contribution, and we risk losing
the service. The proposed reduction of bus services is causing great
anxiety, particularly among the elderly and less mobile passengers.
Buses provide a lifeline to constituents in rural communities, with
many relying on those essential services to access their
work—people living in rural communities often work in the towns.
The elderly and more vulnerable rely on the bus services to access
vital services such as doctors, hospitals and
shops<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T22:39:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402114000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402114000008"><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Percy" PimsId="5517" UID="1402114000059" xid="1031" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402114000059"><B>Andrew

to services—there have been repeated cuts to the 401 service

unsustainable in the longer term. The Selby to Goole route is important
for local students, but the more services are cut, the less attractive

Cockerill, an independent councillor, is on the record as saying that
he is especially concerned by the proposal to withdraw the existing
Filey town service on both the Sycamore and Wharfedale routes. The
county proposes to have a dial-a-ride service, but the problem with
that is that it is not practical for collecting passengers and dropping
them off around towns like Filey, Harrogate and others. Dial-a-ride
services are far more expensive and are generally meant for trips from
A to B, rather than town tour-type journeys. The operator of that
service, Olympic Coaches, is well liked and respected and goes the
extra mile. If a regular passenger does not turn up, the operator will
dismount from the bus and call on the resident—often
elderly—to check that they have not been taken ill. They also
take time to assist people with their shopping bags when
they board and disembark, even taking the shopping to the
passengers’ front doors if they are not able to carry
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402114000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/debtext/140210-0004.htm#1402114000016">The
routes are used by 3,500 local residents every month, so they have a
substantial uptake. Without the rural bus services serving towns such
as Thirsk, Easingwold, Malton, Pickering, Filey and many other smaller

rural hinterlands.</hs_Para>

that the elderly and less mobile can continue to access the rural bus
network to go to the doctor, the dentist and the hospital. I have been
given a very clear message, particularly by the Ryedale forum for older
people and those I have met in Filey, Thirsk, Easingwold and across the

Goodwill:</Member></B> I recently attended a meeting of my own older
people’s forum in Scarborough, and the very same suggestion was
made. People said, “We’ve got these bus passes, but
what’s the point, if there’s no bus to use. We’d
be prepared to pay a nominal charge to use some of these services, if
we could retain them.” However, that would require a fundamental
change to the way the system works, and it could be the thin end of the
wedge, as services up and down the country—not just the ones
that needed help to survive, but some of the more commercial
ones—might also demand payment. It would change fundamentally
the whole basis of the concessionary scheme. We do not at present have
a scheme of free travel for pensioners on the railways. The discount
available to pensioners or the railcards they can use are something
completely different.</hs_Para>

other services, such as the 118 from Filey to Scarborough via Flixton,
some <hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T22:54:45"></hs_TimeCode>of these
have three or fewer passengers, so even if we charged passengers an
additional £1 to use their passes on those journeys, that would
mean only £3 on some of them. Indeed, some of the services in
North Yorkshire have no passengers at all. We need to be more
intelligent in the way we approach this. For example, the intention is
for the F1 and F2 in Filey to be dial-a-ride services to replace the
buses. Indeed, there is a successful dial-a-ride service in my
constituency which, let us not forget, picks the pensioners up from
their homes and takes them to where they need to go. Many people with
mobility problems therefore find dial-a-ride to be a
superior service to the bus, which requires them to get to a
bus stop and wait, often in inclement weather.</hs_Para>

the 195 from Hovingham to Helmsley via Ampleforth will be reduced to
three days a week, running only on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays,
but again, that service currently carries only three or fewer
passengers on some of its journeys. Interestingly, I had a telephone
call last year from one of my constituents in Sleights—a lady
who was a pensioner—who was concerned that the bus service there
would be changed and would no longer be adequate. I asked how often she
used it and 
<?notus-xml column=685?>she said, “Well, I don’t use the service
myself—I’ve got a car—but the day may come when I
do need a service and I’d like it to be there.” There is
therefore, to a degree, an aspiration or wish to have a service in case
of emergencies or if that person can no longer drive. However, may I
suggest that it is not the job of the taxpayer to subsidise a service
in case people might want to use it one
day<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T22:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>?<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-10T22:52:51"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

been conducting an extensive consultation and also has the ridership
figures. I have looked at some of the figures for some of the services,
and one of the big problems is that services are being provided that
are not being used by large numbers of people. I understand that North
Yorkshire is keen to maintain some sort of service wherever possible,
so there might be alternative routes to use or the frequency of some
services might be reduced. In one or two cases in Ripon, the operator

they can make bus subsidy deliver better value for money by working in

what the five better bus areas are intended to do, and the top-up fund
available to them will give them an additional incentive to innovate.

rural areas of England is increasing. However, the Government accept
that when that is not feasible, local authorities play a vital role in
supporting rural bus services. Indeed, about 28% of bus mileage in
predominately rural authorities is operated under contract to them.

authorities on best practice in the procurement of local bus services
and other types of road passenger transport. While I recognise that
much innovation and hard work is done by councils all over the country,
I believe that there is scope for them to do more, not least by
highlighting and sharing some really good practice on which other
authorities can draw—and I strongly urge them to do

most recent assessment of the cost of the firearms licensing process
was undertaken by the Association of Chief Police Officers in 2009-10.
Their report estimated 
<?notus-xml column=397?>that the gross cost to forces was £23.6 million and the income
received was £6.4 million. Time required to measure the cost
meant that the calculation was based on a sample of
forces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021047000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0001.htm#14021047000056">There
has been no full assessment of the impact on each of the 43 individual
forces, but if the £17.2 million shortfall were applied evenly,
that would suggest an average net cost to each force of £400,000
in 2009-10. I remain committed to addressing this disparity, which is
unsustainable other than in the short term.</hs_Para>

elections and has asked some specific questions on the impact of postal
voting on voter participation. Following the English and Welsh local

voters, in the survey, who said that the availability of postal voting

Commission's 2010 post-election research also found that nearly four in
ten (38%) of non-voters said that they would have been more likely to
vote if it was easier to get a postal vote. These figures should be
treated with caution since there may be a research effect whereby
respondents say they are 'more likely' to do something (vote) that is

Lewis:</Member></B> Allowing local authorities to keep 100% of business
rates on shale gas production sites is part of our long-term economic
plan to build a stronger, more competitive economy, create more jobs
and secure a better future for Britain. We believe communities that
host a shale gas site should see a concrete benefit. The industry has
committed to a package for communities that host a shale gas site which
includes a payment of £100,000 for each hydraulically fractured
well at the exploratory stage, as well as 1% of all revenues from
production. Local councils will also benefit from shale gas production
as well by keeping 100% of business rates from shale gas
production—double the current figure of 50%. This commitment
could be worth up to £1.7 million a year for a typical site. It
will be funded by central Government and will ensure that local
government feels a direct financial incentive, in addition to local
jobs and growth supported by shale gas
development.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14021054000008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0002.htm#14021054000008">Homelessness</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="14021054000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0002.htm#14021054000085"><B><Member PimsId="488" UID="14021054000442" xid="515" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0002.htm#14021054000442">Chris

lighting plays an important role in road safety, as well as ensuring
the personal safety of pedestrians. There may be some roads where
lights could be dimmed 
<?notus-xml column=420?>in the very early hours, saving taxpayers' money.
However, this should be a local decision by elected local councillors,
reflecting local circumstances—especially in relation
to any concerns about crime. Equally, not every
neighbourhood wants street lighting, as some communities, especially in
rural areas, value dark skies. Councils should listen to the views of
their local .residents, and then adopt appropriate local policies based
on the neighbourhood, the precise location and the usage of the
road/street. There is no prescriptive Whitehall
guidance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021054000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0002.htm#14021054000141">Indeed,

launched a public consultation on proposals to reform primary school
assessment and accountability. The consultation proposed that the Early
Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) would remain in place but, to minimise
the assessment burden, the Government would consider making the EYFS
profile non-statutory at the end of reception. The consultation closed
on 11 October. The Department will be publishing the Government
response to the consultation
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021054000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0002.htm#14021054000248">The

Government is determined that the UK economy will benefit from any
shale gas development that might take place through benefits such as
increased tax revenues, greater energy security, growth and jobs. On 13
December last year, we published for consultation, an environmental
report as part of the process of strategic environmental assessment for
further oil and gas licensing onshore. On a high activity scenario, the
report estimates that oil and gas activities which might be carried out
on new licences might create 16,000 to 32,000 new full-time equivalent

commissioned the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to

Nurse Partnership (FNP) is a licensed preventive programme for
vulnerable first-time young mothers. It offers intensive and structured
home visiting, delivered by specially trained nurses, from early
pregnancy until the child is two. FNP uses in-depth methods to work
with young mothers and fathers on attachment, relationships and
psychological preparation for parenthood, as well as supporting
learning and changes in family health, well-being and child health and
development. Family nurses build supportive relationships with families
and guide first-time young parents so they can adopt healthier
lifestyles for themselves and their babies, provide good care for their
babies and plan their own futures. Fathers are actively invited to
participate in FNP from the beginning, as a way of respecting their
important contribution as a parent and
partner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402111000872" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0003.htm#1402111000872">In

Ellison:</Member></B> Public Health England (PHE), and its predecessor
organisation, the Health Protection Agency, has been assessing the
effectiveness of the human papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation programme
in England. PHE has been monitoring the prevalence of type-specific
genital HPV infections through surveys that use specimens from young
women in England. Data analysed in 2012 from specimens collected in
2010 to 2012 from young women included in the catch-up immunisation
programme have shown a reduction in the two HPV types included in the
vaccine, compared to similar data collected prior to the introduction
of the HPV immunisation programme. These findings provide the first
indication that the national HPV immunisation programme is successfully
preventing HPV 16/18 infection in sexually active young women in'
England. In the post-immunisation survey of 16 to 24-year-olds, the
prevalence of the two vaccine types (HPV 16/18) was lowest in the
youngest girls, 16-18 years, who had been vaccinated aged between 12-17
years. This group of girls, who had the highest vaccination coverage,
experienced a reduction in the prevalence of HPV 16/18 from 19.1%
pre-immunisation to 6.5%
post-immunisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402111001443" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0003.htm#1402111001443">The

pay the living wage. However, its prime policy concern is the national
minimum wage for the low paid. This is independently set by the Low Pay
Commission at a level that maximises the wages of the low paid without
reducing their employment prospects. It is for workers and employers to
decide the level of wages above the minimum wage based on current
circumstances. This includes the Government as a procurer and an
employer. Over 95%— around 20 million employees—earn
above the minimum wage and the majority of public sector workers
currently earn above the living wage. Government will always award
contracts oh the basis of the best value for money for the
taxpayers—which includes the low paid.</hs_Para>

clear: Where abortion is permitted, we can consider support for
activities to improve the quality, safety and accessibility of abortion
services. UK development assistance is not used to procure illegal
services. However, where access to safe abortion is highly restricted
and maternal mortality and morbidity are high, which is often the case
in conflict settings, we can help make the consequences of unsafe

Scheme was a difficult one, and over the period of the redundancy
programme we have given very careful consideration to the possibility
of changing the current legislation to address the concerns expressed
by some of our personnel. However, we have concluded that it would be
unfair to make proximity to immediate pension point a selection
criterion for redundancy and we have maintained that approach
throughout all four tranches of the programme. We have looked at the
alternatives and concluded that wherever we draw the line somebody will
always be just over it, and facing the possibility of perceived

pension rights that have been earned will also give them preserved

Hammond:</Member></B> The Department's fraud policy states that
Internal Audit are responsible for carrying out investigations in areas
where fraud has occurred, either independently or in collaboration with
line managers or nominated members of staff. The DfT Fraud and Bribery
Response Plan states that the Head of Internal Audit should ensure that
all investigations are carried out by suitably qualified persons. This
may include internal audit or others, and where necessary the police.
In practice, no internal audit staff have been granted authorisation
for carrying out directed surveillance under Section 28 of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. Similar principles
normally apply in the Department's agencies.</hs_Para>

and Coastguard Agency has used one organisation, Robertson and Co., to
carry out surveillance in one case. RIPA authorisation was not
required, but in order to ensure good practice, a process that mirrored
the RIPA process was used. DVLA investigations relating to crime,
including corruption and fraud, are dealt with in accordance with DVLA
Fraud Policy, by internal investigators, line management or HR as
appropriate. Agreement is sought from the police or other prosecuting
authorities to pursue appropriate investigations to prosecution. DVLA
do not have the authority to carry out directed surveillance within the
agency. The Driving Standards Agency uses Outforce Corporate
Investigations Limited (OCI) to conduct internal investigations of
crime, corruption or fraud. While, under section 28 of the Regulation
of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, their chief executive has statutory
powers to grant authorisation to third parties to conduct limited
directed surveillance on the Agency's behalf, this authorisation has
not been designated to OCI and must be authorised personally by the
chief executive in every case. OCI do carry out limited direct
surveillance on behalf of the former DSA though this practice must be
reviewed and approved by the Office of the Surveillance Commissioner
every two years.</hs_Para>

line” between Southampton and the west midlands, but this is a
key route for rail container traffic from the port of Southampton. As
part of its Rail Investment Strategy for 2014-19 the Government
announced the creation of the ‘Electric spine’, a high
capacity passenger and freight electric corridor running from the south
coast through Oxford, Bedford and via the Midland Main Line to the east
midlands and South Yorkshire, with a link from Oxford to the west
midlands and the north-west. Government is looking to Network Rail to
convert the route from Southampton to Basingstoke to overhead
electrification and to electrify the sections between Basingstoke and
Reading and between Oxford and Coventry via Leamington. The work should
include gauge clearance for large containers and appropriate links to
depots and freight
facilities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402115000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140210/text/140210w0004.htm#1402115000229">In

for older people. Community Learning is also an important part of the
wider learning and skills offer, engaging people who are most
disadvantaged and furthest from learning such as older people. It is
funded through an annual budget of £210 million managed by the
Skills Funding Agency and most provision is delivered or commissioned
by local authority providers, FE colleges, large voluntary
organisations and other providers. As part of our plans for local
growth, all 39 local enterprise partnerships are currently considering
how to drive growth in their local areas as they put together their
strategic economic plans, which are due to be submitted to Government

to update their skills as business needs and technology changes so we

be appropriate for the company to hold less liquid assets for the

sanctions—more properly known as restrictive
measures—have served as anti-western propaganda for the ZANU-PF
party, we believe that asset freezes, as part of the EU's targeted
measures, have been an important tool in promoting democracy and reform
in Zimbabwe. Reforms, such as the new constitution agreed in 2013,
under the Government of National Unity and Global Political Agreement,
highlight some of the progress made. However, we continue to have
concerns over the democratic environment in Zimbabwe, we have
consistently made clear our views about the conduct of 2013 elections,
which we do not judge to have been free, fair or credible, nor to have
met SADC's own guidelines. The EU is currently completing the review of
Zimbabwe's targeted measures and parliamentary scrutiny has been
completed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_10_PT_1/1CF98C9C8590CBC699CD79D2FB774CBEB0ED0E63" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="10 February 2014">Monday

housing payment (DHP) funding will actually be increased by £40
million in 2014-15 to £165 million, from the previously
announced figure of £125 million. This reflects the longer
transitional period many claimants will face and gives local
authorities the confidence they need to make longer-term awards where
people cannot reasonably move home or access other mitigations. The
overall reduction compared with 2013-14 reflects the expectation that
DHPs will be a temporary transitional measure for many, particularly
those affected by the introduction of the benefit cap. As such, the DHP
allocation for the benefit cap reduces from £65 million in
