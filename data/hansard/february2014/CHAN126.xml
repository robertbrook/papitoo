Gentleman’s concerns, and it was clearly a very difficult day
for the families yesterday. As I published in my written ministerial
statement, we believe that around 200 cases were processed through this
scheme. The individuals were sent factual letters indicating whether or
not they were wanted for terrorism offences. It was not an amnesty and
it was never intended to be such. There was always the recognition that
if further evidence of further offences was produced, a prosecution was
then a possibility. The reason for the outcome of the Downey case was
that unfortunately  a grave mistake was made, when Mr Downey
was sent a letter saying he was not wanted for offences when
in  fact he
was.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022677000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0001.htm#14022677000031"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dodds" PimsId="2983" UID="14022677000194" xid="171" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0001.htm#14022677000194">Mr

about this—how an official’s letter can trump due process

this is, not just for the process of law and order, but for the very

for the collusion in the murder of Pat Finucane, which was of course
disgraceful. The review by Desmond Da Silva found, I think, all the

exploded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022692000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0001.htm#14022692000007">The

Simon Tipper, who was aged 19, died at the scene; Lance Corporal
Jeffrey Young, who was aged 19, died the following day; and Squadron

Downey was arrested on 19 May 2013 at Gatwick airport when he was en
route to Greece. On his arrest, he produced a letter stating that he
was free to enter the jurisdiction without fear of arrest. Despite that
letter, he was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service with four
counts of murder. Before he was charged, my consent was sought, as the
law requires, for him to face a charge of causing an explosion, and I
gave that consent. I believed that it was right to do so, and I remain

acknowledged by the judge, the allegations faced by Mr Downey were of
the utmost seriousness. The bombing was an attempt by the Provisional
IRA to bring its terrorist campaign to London and to attack armed
forces personnel who were on ceremonial duties. Whatever the
circumstances in which the letter had been sent, and it is now clear
that its assurances were wrongly given, it was right that the matter
should be tested in court. Neither I nor the CPS were prepared to
accept that the letter and the circumstances in which it had been given
were such as to automatically prevent Mr Downey’s prosecution.
The prosecution of a very serious offence of that kind is plainly in
the public

The judgment given is a detailed and careful assessment of the case and
the circumstances in which Mr Downey received his letter. It is worthy

grounds the judge found for the prosecution.</hs_Para>

if that is the case, why did the judge take the decision that he took?

I also explore how we have arrived at this situation? I was a shadow
Northern Ireland Minister when the Northern Ireland offenders Bill was
withdrawn because it was obviously not going to get through Parliament.
There was no mention at the time of any other deal being likely. Does
the Attorney-General not consider what has happened since then to be a
discourtesy to Parliament? Does he, like me, wonder who authorised the
scheme that seems to have replaced the legislation? That must surely
have been the then Prime Minister. Will the Attorney-General tell us
who wrote the letters to the people who are often referred to as
on-the-runs? What was in the letters? And I am afraid that I have to
ask why the Police Service of Northern Ireland gave an assurance to Mr
Downey that no other police force in the United Kingdom had any
interest in him, when it knew that that was not the case.</hs_Para>

Attorney-General:</Member></B> May I first make the point that it is
clear from the judgment and the supporting material that the
administrative scheme was not, and never could be, an amnesty? That
might have been what the previous Government sought at one time, but an
amnesty could be achieved only through legislation, and no such
legislation was put through the House. Parliament never approved an
amnesty.</hs_Para>

was an administrative scheme that operated independently of the
Government and was intended to identify those individuals who, although
they might believe that they were unable to return to the jurisdiction
without fear of arrest, would in fact face no prosecution or arrest if
they were to return. The PSNI would  check whether individuals
were wanted for arrest or  
<?notus-xml column=267?>for questioning. If the individual had already been considered for
prosecution, the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland would
make a careful assessment of its files to determine whether any
prosecution would follow if the individual were to return. Many of the
offences were historical, and in some cases, with the passage of time,
essential witnesses might have died or forensic evidence might be no
longer available.</hs_Para>

those circumstances would an individual be told that they were free to

some 38 letters have been sent out. I hesitated to comment about what

Gentleman’s final question first. Let me emphasise to him that
of course this is a legitimate matter of 
<?notus-xml column=271?>debate, and he may wish to raise it, but it is not one that I, within my
departmental responsibilities, could address. It would have
to be looked at elsewhere. So far as the stay is
concerned, yes it is indeed a stay, but lifting a stay requires
specific grounds. I know of no basis for thinking at the moment that a
stay is ever likely to be lifted in the future. Obviously, I am not for
any reason pre-empting that. If something were to come to light that
justified applying to have a stay lifted, then that is a matter that

for the other cases and whether they will be pursued, I would like to
make the position absolutely clear. My responsibilities as far as
criminal justice is concerned lie within England and Wales; Northern
Ireland is now devolved. If cases are brought to the Crown Prosecution
Service suggesting the commission of very serious crimes by individuals
who can be apprehended and brought to justice, then what I said earlier
must be the case. It would generally be in the public
interest—it would be very rare to think of where it would not be
in the public interest—for such a prosecution to be pursued.

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T13:16:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
makes perhaps an important point. It is right to say that the letters
were sent on the basis of decisions taken by both the Public
Prosecution Service and the PSNI, in the context of Northern Ireland,
and if domestic matters elsewhere in the UK were concerned, by their
prosecutorial authorities. To that extent, it was an administrative
system independently conducted of Ministers; I want to make that quite
clear. However, it is also right that, at the end of the process, it
was ministerial letters, or letters from officials, that constituted
the giving of the information.</hs_Para>

I said, the absence of an offence of coercive control is a contributing
factor to the low rates of reporting, arrests and convictions in

focused on the physical evidence of violent crimes committed against a
victim. Coercive control, on the other hand, does not leave scars or
bruises, but is every bit as debilitating.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T13:40:40"></hs_TimeCode> is why I am
concerned with securing greater redress for the predominantly female
victims of domestic violence; they can be male as well, of course. From
2011 to 2012, I had the privilege of chairing an independent
parliamentary inquiry into reforming the law on stalking, which
resulted in new offences of stalking being introduced in March 2012.
Inasmuch as it focuses on the psychological impact of a non-physical
crime on a victim, the new section 4A offence of stalking involves
putting someone in serious alarm or distress. That was pioneering, and
it has formed the basis of my recommendations in the Bill surrounding
the criminalising of coercive control.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022692000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0001.htm#14022692000129">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T13:41:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T13:41:44"></hs_TimeCode>
would suggest that defining a crime in respect of its impact on its
victim is the pattern that should be followed in this regard. However,
anecdotal evidence suggests that several police forces are choosing not
to make use of the more serious section 4A offence of stalking.
Regrettably, the vast majority of police forces have yet to implement
training in the new stalking laws for all officers.
Having<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T13:41:48"></hs_TimeCode> said
that, I am pleased to note that the latest figures are more
encouraging. In the year ending in December 2013, 566 alleged
perpetrators reached the first stage in court, of whom 144 were charged
with the more serious section 4A offence. Were any new offences
relating to domestic violence introduced, it would of course be crucial
that the police and the Crown Prosecution Service were made to undergo
training in the realities of domestic violence cases and, crucially,
the dynamics of abuse. That is why the Bill would place a duty on the
Secretary of State to ensure that training is given to criminal justice
professionals in any new legislation covering domestic violence. Police
would also have a duty to develop and implement domestic violence
policies that encouraged the arrest and charging of perpetrators and
made investigation of complaints a
priority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022692000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0002.htm#14022692000130">In
recent months,
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T13:42:50"></hs_TimeCode> has been a
great deal of discussion about the need for a more victims-focused
justice system, and that is right. Indeed, Keir Starmer has called for
a victims’ law—a call that I and many others in this
House, I am sure, wholeheartedly support. I believe that any new
legislation would need to be informed by the experience of victims.
Next week, a 
<?notus-xml column=285?>coalition of organisations in the domestic violence sector, including
Paladin, Women’s Aid and the Sara Charlton Charitable
Foundation, will launch, as part of a wider campaign, a sector survey

to ensure that perpetrators of this offence are made to answer properly
for their behaviour. I extend my thanks to the Justice Unions

me set out our reasons for calling this debate and forcing this vote

trying to close a loophole in the bedroom tax legislation without even
understanding how many people are affected by these changes. Instead of
trying to close this loophole, the Government should finally try to do
the right thing and scrap the bedroom tax altogether. This Government
promised that they would not balance the books on the backs of the
poorest and most vulnerable, but that is exactly what they are doing,
and in such a careless, clumsy and cack-handed way that we see chaos,
confusion and uncounted costs piling up around us as they compound the

affected, many of whom are already below the poverty line and forced,

problem that we face is a huge shortage of housing. We have 1.85
million people on council waiting lists, up 800,000 since 1997. That
should be no surprise, given that the previous Government allowed the

no addition to the housing

symptom of such a shortage is overcrowding—a word which did not
pass the lips of the Opposition spokesman in her speech. During my

Overwhelmingly, they have been people living in overcrowded
accommodation who want a bigger property and seek to move out of a one
or two-bedroom property. I have therefore been surprised by the general
approach of Opposition Members and by some of the media in saying that
no one wants to move out of small properties into big ones and that
there are therefore no small properties to be moved into by those
affected by the removal of the spare room

have—it would be wonderful if we had an excess of cheaply
available property, so that everyone who wanted an extra room could
have it, subsidised and free, from the taxpayer—but we are not

about Oldham. In Birmingham, by mid-January roughly a quarter of people
in council properties had ceased paying extra rent for a spare room due
to changed circumstances—they might have found family members to
join them or have downsized. Some 521 households wanted to transfer,
but sadly, 380 had arrears, and for some reason the council was
blocking them from transferring. I think that that is appalling. Let us
suppose somebody is happy to downsize to a flat such as the one I
mentioned a moment ago. There may be a four-person family in a
one-bedroom flat, and 380 people who want to downsize because of having
to pay for the spare room, but the council is blocking that because of
arrears. I am told that it is sorting that out, but I still see loads
of people in overcrowded situations. I am sure that the situation is
similar in Oldham, although I obviously do not have the same figures. I

reason why this cruel tax does disproportionate damage to the disabled

this and related kinds cannot be categorised by the over-simplistic

lives in a shorthold tenancy, but has been given notice to move at the
beginning of April. Not only can she not find any accommodation for
herself and her two children, but the freehold owners have sent her the
ground rent bill, which is the liability of the landlord, who is
evicting her. That is real life in the Gorton constituency. When
somebody does manage to get rehoused—such as a constituent who
was a victim of the bedroom tax who came to see me the week

able to speak relatively soon after
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:44:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South Derbyshire (Heather Wheeler), because there was a sense of
breathlessness when we were listening to the complacency and, frankly,
arrogance of her comments about the kinds of people I see in my
surgeries day in, day out. Those people are suffering partly because
there is not enough affordable housing. Nobody is saying that there is
enough affordable housing, and all Governments in recent years should
have done a lot more. However, the idea that pushing people out of
their homes into properties that do not exist is in any way helpful,
either in economic terms or for the housing crisis, is deeply
misguided.</hs_Para>

the start of this month I tabled early-day motion 1057 to pray against
the statutory instrument that we are opposing in today’s debate.
When the Leader of the Opposition came and asked whether he could put
his name at the top of the prayer to push the debate forward, I was of
course happy to agree. I welcome his support and the continued strong
opposition to the 
<?notus-xml column=303?>bedroom tax from colleagues across the smaller parties and, indeed, some
senior Liberal Democrats. Many Members of the House are joined in
opposition to the Government’s bedroom tax and their attempt to
undo a drafting mistake they made when they pushed through this nasty
legislation. We know that the legislation is cruel and
counter-productive.</hs_Para>

others have said, the Government’s drafting mistake means that
some people are exempt from the charge and should not be made to pay
it, but now the Government want to ensure that from March all those
people will finally be trapped by the bedroom tax. I hope that
Ministers will listen today, because it is not just rhetoric. The
strong cross-party opposition to the policy comes from our listening to
the people we see in our surgeries. We are not talking about a
“spare room subsidy”, or about the taxpayer subsidising
the unnecessary luxury of an extra room. In case after case, we see
that the rooms are not spare, but essential. As we have heard many
times, DWP statistics show that more than two thirds of those affected
are likely to be people with disabilities. The tax is pushing disabled
people from adapted properties. It is sending people to alien places,
away from the support networks they have relied on all their
lives.</hs_Para>

effect of the policy is to turf out the person with severe mental
health problems who has been settled for years and is deeply distressed
by change, but who perhaps has a tiny box room in their home. They
cannot take a lodger because of their unpredictable episodes and they
cannot afford the rent because the box room means that their rent has
gone up, yet there is no smaller property available locally. I asked
Ministers a year ago what was supposed to happen to those people. They
did not answer then and they are not answering now.</hs_Para>

that takes no account of people’s real circumstances. In
Brighton and Hove, the minority Green administration is doing
everything it can with the tiny amount of money given to it to protect
people from this Government’s pernicious policy but, as
predicted, people are massively struggling. Without even counting
housing association tenants, there are 286 council tenants newly in
arrears because of the bedroom tax, 199 of whom have a
disability.</hs_Para>

well as being callous and cruel, the bedroom tax is counter-productive.
There are simply insufficient smaller properties for people to move to,
as the Government have repeatedly been told. People are faced with
poverty and debt or with moving into the expensive clutches of the
private rented sector, where their housing benefit bills will be even
higher. Pushing people from their homes is not saving money and it is
not solving the housing crisis either.</hs_Para>

bottom line is that we have nowhere near enough affordable
homes—I would certainly agree with the Government about that.
Successive Governments have caused the housing crisis, not the poor
people who are now struggling to cope with it. It is not the fault of
people who cannot get a job, or of disabled people or people who need
overnight care. The crucial problem—this is where the fault
lies—is the epic failure of both this coalition and the previous
new Labour Administration to build sufficient council housing. The
Tories pushed the decimation of the stock with the right to buy,
ignoring the right to rent; new Labour tweaked the 
<?notus-xml column=304?>enormous discounts but did not grasp the nettle and build council
housing. In 2007-08, for example, only 350 new council homes were built
across the country.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:48:20"></hs_TimeCode>However, it is
deeply unjust to penalise people who are struggling at the bottom of a
deeply distorted housing market, over which they have little or no
control, for the omissions of previous Governments.</hs_Para>

do the Government say? Lord Freud called the exemption that we are
trying to preserve today an “anomaly” and says that the
number of people affected is “small”. That detached
language shows how out of touch the Government are. We have heard
already from the Opposition Front Bench that the figures are vastly
higher than that—at least 20,000 and probably much more, because
that figure is based on only council returns so far. What precisely
will Ministers do to rectify the injustice done to individuals who have
been denied their full benefit entitlement? What about the people who,
as a result of the error, have newly fallen into rent arrears, which
have negatively affected their credit rating, for example? What about
those who have left their homes in response to the tax and given up
their security of tenure, when they did not have to pay the tax in the
first place? How will they be
compensated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:49:16"></hs_TimeCode>? The
mess made by this mistake is surely yet another reason to scrap this

conclusion, the tax comes from an aloof Government, some of whose
members are detached from reality, who simply do not know
what is going on and moreover do not care. I hope
the regulations are stopped today, because any hon. Member who walks
through the Lobby to extend the reach of the bedroom tax will be
harming even more people with disabilities, with even more people
pushed into debt, forcing more people away from their
communities. The only way to clean up this mess is to scrap the entire
bedroom tax once and for all.</hs_Para>

nonsense. People who are in arrears often face tenancy restrictions

homes for them to move to. In my constituency there are just 16

harming disadvantaged tenants but damaging councils and local housing
associations, undermining social cohesion in our communities, and
harming the social fabric as a whole. Under the terms of the Scotland
Act 1998 this area of policy is reserved to Westminster, so we have
been stuck with Ministers whom we did not elect, imposing a policy for

clear evidence that the bedroom tax is costing taxpayers more than it

the cost of implementing the policy in relation to its projected

£50 million a year in Scotland is actually costing about
£60 million a year to implement. Detailed research undertaken by
COSLA with six councils also revealed disturbing trends in the patterns
of arrears accruing in the social rented sector. In the first six
months of the policy, an additional 31% of tenants affected by the tax
were in rent arrears, and many of them had never been in debt before.
Squeezing the bedroom tax from people on very low incomes who just
cannot afford it is causing huge distress and worry to tenants,
including those who are managing to pay, but it also has serious
implications for social landlords and for the solvency of housing
associations in particular.</hs_Para>

Whiteford:</Member></B> I agree that the lack of affordable housing is
a core issue, but there is also a chronic mismatch between the needs of
prospective social tenants and the available housing stock. I have made
the point many times in the House that, across Scotland, over 60% of
tenants need a one-bedroom property, yet only 23% of the housing stock
is one-bedroom size. Even if everyone were to be allocated a home of
the requisite size, there are just not enough smaller houses to go
around.</hs_Para>

has been a lot of talk today about the shortage of housing. The
Scottish Government have managed to deliver more social housing than
any other Administration in the UK, even on a fixed budget—a
diminishing budget. It is a matter of political priority. If we
understand there is a housing shortage, we need to fix it. There is no

authorities, housing associations and the Scottish Government have all
had to take action to minimise the unwanted side effects of the bedroom
tax, not least by topping up the budgets for discretionary housing
payments by £20 million in the last year, which is the maximum
amount allowed under section 70 of the Child Support, Pensions and
Social Security Act 2000, and by this year making available £35
million for discretionary housing payments, which would, in effect,
enable councils to mitigate the entire impact of the bedroom tax for
everyone 
<?notus-xml column=308?>affected. However, as I have said, this remains a reserved matter, and
the Scottish Government have had to request permission from UK
Ministers to increase the DHP budget. As far as I am aware, the Deputy
First Minister is still awaiting a reply to her letter of January to
Lord Freud making that request, so can I press Ministers today to
listen to the Scottish Parliament’s view on this matter—a
view supported by four parties, including their own coalition partners,
the Liberal Democrats—and impress upon their ministerial
colleague in the other place to crack on and signal his consent?
Frankly, it is a travesty in the 21st century that a democratically

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> There is a fundamental
incoherence at the heart of this whole policy. We have heard
impassioned pleas from some members on the Government Benches about how
much they care for people in overcrowded housing and that this is a
policy to help with that situation, but at the same time it is clear
from the Government’s own financial projections that they
expected to make savings from people not being able to move and having
to pay the extra. That is the fundamental inconsistency. The savings
are going to be outweighed not just by discretionary housing payments
but by the cost of administering them, of giving people additional
advice and support and of employing more staff to do so. All that is
being shouldered by local authorities and housing associations, and it
has to be taken into account when looking at overall public

The instrument amends paragraph 4 of schedule 3 to the Housing Benefit

which provides for transitional protection for certain housing benefit
claimants. The amendment removes the transitional protection from
social sector tenants such that their housing benefit will be

2006, which sets out the maximum rent in the social sector.</hs_Para>

amendment is required to close a loophole that derives from a very

local reference rent rules only applied to those renting in the private
rented sector, so the transitional protection was only ever intended to
support them—the vast majority of them pensioners—not
social sector tenants who were unaffected. With hindsight, this
protection could have been time limited. Because it was not, 17 years
later the protection is now being applied in a way that was never
intended but is possible, which is resulting in claimants being
exempted from the spare room subsidy. Thankfully, my right hon. Friend

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:12:15"></hs_TimeCode>Why are we
bringing forward this policy? We are looking at how to make the best
use of social housing. We know that more than 400,000 people are living
in overcrowded accommodation, and that 2 million people are on waiting
lists. At the same time, there is overcapacity equating to
approximately 1 million spare rooms in other houses. How do we deal
with this? It is not an easy issue that we have been left with, and we
are having to make difficult decisions in order to get it right.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:13:13"></hs_TimeCode>We know what we
cannot do: we cannot have a housing bill that doubles over 10 years,
and we cannot have more and more people on waiting lists and living in
overcrowded accommodation.</hs_Para>

this side of the House seemed to care about the people who are
struggling and are on a housing waiting list.
T<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:14:07"></hs_TimeCode>he reason that
we are putting these measures in place is that we want to ensure we
make the best use of our social housing. At the same time, we are
building more affordable housing: there will be 177,000 more affordable
homes by 2015, with £4.5 billion being spent.</hs_Para>

right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden talked about
home exchanges. He said that there were 56,000 one-bedroom homes and
147,000 two-bedroom homes available on HomeSwapper, and that 66% of the
233,000 homes available for home exchange were one and two-bedroom
properties. Of course we are not expecting homes to be vacant at the
moment, waiting for people to move in We need to find out who wants to
move, how they are going to move, and how we do the swaps.</hs_Para>

unfortunate is that when we knew this policy was coming into
being—that was four years ago and it has been in place for a
year—the Opposition did absolutely nothing. In the year between
2012 and 2013, £11 million was handed back to the Government.
The 
<?notus-xml column=312?>Opposition should have been asking, “How can we help people to
move? How can we use that money to reduce rent arrears? How can we use
that money to help people move into other accommodation?” They
did absolutely nothing, digging their heels in; they were not helping
those who most needed their support and were ignoring what was coming
through. That is shameful, but this is the Opposition who led this
country into serious debt and made sure that private debt for
individuals went up to £1.5 trillion. Rather than help people
out of debt, and help them move to homes they could afford and live
within their means, the Labour party allowed
them—</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="140226113001340" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0002.htm#140226113001340">3.16

two and a half months, Britain has faced some of the most extreme
weather since records began. We have experienced the wettest start to a
year, the biggest tidal surges and the highest waves ever recorded. As
a consequence, 6,480 homes have been flooded, farms have disappeared
under water and businesses have been forced to close. For those who
have been forced from their homes or seen their houses stripped of
ruined carpets, furniture and possessions, this has been an horrendous
experience. The stress of finding alternative accommodation and
ensuring that the kids can get to school and that jobs are held down,
while cleaning up and battling with insurance companies, will have been
the nightmare start to the year that has faced many families.</hs_Para>

cannot control the weather, and what the country has experienced in
recent weeks has been exceptional. However, communities expect their
Government to be prepared for the consequences of severe weather, and
when it occurs, they expect a rapid response from the Government and
help to arrive swiftly. Sadly, this was not the experience of many
communities over Christmas and new year. The Government’s
initial response to the floods was too slow and unco-ordinated. For too
long, there appeared to be a complete failure to understand the full
scale of the situation that was unfolding. I am afraid that that was
typified by the belated visit of the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to the Somerset levels at the end
of January. More than a month after the waters rose and homes and
farmland were flooded, he took the decisive step of ordering a report
to be on his desk within six weeks.</hs_Para>

My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. The contracts are now out,

that we cannot pump north of Burrowbridge because of the capacity level
of the river—it is 40% below capacity. We will only be able to

Holland can take out an enormous amount of water, but we clearly have
to ensure that their pattern of use does not lead to a degree of
scouring that would threaten the banks’ stability. We are going
about that in a very reasoned way: it may take weeks longer than is
ideal, but it is important that it is done in a safe

sceptics and zealots, but the conclusions should not be. We know that
Britain’s weather and climate is fickle. If Britain was to have
a national symbol, it would undoubtedly be the umbrella. Any

Flynn</B> (Newport West) (Lab):</Member> If we are able to answer one
question, it will give us the key to what I believe are the long-term
practical solutions to the problems of Somerset and elsewhere. Why did
the Somerset levels flood and the Gwent levels not flood?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226113000948" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113000948">Having
represented part of the Gwent levels continuously as an elected person
since 1972, I know them well, and members of my family live in
Somerset. The areas are almost identical. They share 2,000 years of
history, and their topographies and geographies are identical. The
Gwent levels were drained by the Romans, and the sea wall was built by
the 20th Augustan legion 2,000 years ago. During that long period, the
levels have been treated very much the same. Drainage has been put into
both. They have recently shared exactly the same weather—they
are only a short distance apart—and exactly the same tides.
There is no dredging on either side. So why on earth was there flooding
on one side of the Severn estuary and not on the other? I believe that
the answer lies in farming
techniques.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113000949" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113000949">As
has been said, dredging is not a panacea. In 1928 there was a flood
here, on this spot. The terraced houses opposite, in Page street and
Millbank, were flooded, and people died. That flood was caused by
dredging, which was carried out in the lower reaches of the Thames to
increase access for ships. Yes, water did flow out more quickly as a
result, but it also flowed in more quickly. It was easy for the tide to
come in. In the dredged areas, the tide came in and met the water
coming down from the hills. If dredging is seen as the answer in
Somerset and is proceeded with, the lower reaches of the Parrett will
be exposed to the extraordinary characteristics of the Severn, which
holds more sediment in suspension than almost any other river in the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113000950" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113000950"><Member ContinuationText="Mr David Heath" PimsId="911" UID="140226113002135" xid="265" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113002135"><B>Mr
David Heath</B> (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</Member> I am sorry, but I
think that the hon. Gentleman is completely mistaken. The River Parrett
is tidal for 18.3 miles of its length from the Severn estuary. It is
precisely because of the tidal surge from the Parrett that we cannot
move the water away from the Mendips, the Quantocks and the other
hills. That is not comparable to the situation in the Gwent levels,
where the topography is
different.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113000951" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113000951"><B><Member ContinuationText="Paul Flynn" PimsId="3266" UID="140226113002136" xid="205" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113002136">Paul
Flynn:</Member></B> If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, on the
characteristics of the Severn we know that on both sides of the river
we have the second highest rising and falling tides in the world, but
the issue is the amount of sediment because of the length of the river.
In the Severn estuary and on the beaches, sometimes the rocks are clean
and nothing has been deposited, but on another tide 1 foot of mud may
be deposited there. Given the 18 tidal miles of the Parrett, it will be
easy for the sediment to come in. However, the sediment is not just
coming in from the tidal reaches of the river; it is also coming down
from the hills. That is key. Dredging would create an open door to
allow the sediment to move in from the Severn in greater quantities, as
it did with the Thames in 1928.</hs_Para>

is the difference between the two areas? The difference lies in the
Quantocks, the Mendips, around the Welsh hills and the Wentwood. There
is a difference in farming in the two areas. That is made clear in a
report in <I>Soil Use and Management</I>. It contained a warning, six
weeks before the floods moved into Somerset, 
<?notus-xml column=337?>that a disaster was brewing. It said that surface water run-off in the
south-west of England, where the Somerset levels are, was reaching a
critical point—it said that six weeks beforehand. It added that

percolating into the ground the water was pouring off the

of the main reasons was the increase in the growth of maize. There are
other reasons, but when I was first elected the maize grown in this
country occupied 1,400 acres. It now occupies 160,000 acres. What are
the characteristics of that? It breaks up the soil and allows the water
to run off. Maize is being grown in Britain not for food for humans but
for animal food and biodiesel. One could ask whether, in trying to

Government of the
time—<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:42:48"></hs_TimeCode>this
is crucial—made it a condition of receiving some £3
billion in subsidies that farmers took action against that. The
Government argued that ground cover crops should be sown, as a
condition of receiving the subsidies, under maize and the land should
be ploughed, then resown with winter cover plants within 10 days of
harvesting to prevent water from sheeting off.
W<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:44:33"></hs_TimeCode>hy is that not
happening in Somerset? The reason is that the current Government have
dropped that condition. That is one of the main causes of the extent of

That will help, but in the town that I represent, there were regular
floods 20 or 30 years ago. Now there are areas where fields are
designed to flood and to take the excess water, and they have not been
flooded for decades. There are plans. If we go ahead with some of the
instant solutions being suggested in Somerset, we will decrease the
flood threat to farmlands but we will greatly increase the threat to
urban areas. One field flooded is far less damaging than having
100 houses flooded. We have to look realistically at the
changes that are taking place. Of course the weather was thoroughly
exceptional, but there are whole areas of Somerset that have been
flooding for centuries. The “ey” suffix on the names of
many of the villages there means “island”, and
historically they were islands—little mounds standing up among
the flat areas.</hs_Para>

account the changes in farming on our hillsides. The land there is no
longer retaining the water and allowing it to percolate through slowly;
the water is now rushing rapidly down and causing these freak flooding
incidents. Thank goodness we have also come back to the realisation of
the seriousness of global warming, which the motion also mentions. For

is absolutely covered in water—it is at Longford, in an area

been given for a lot of houses in both Bishop’s Cleeve and
Brockworth, but those, too, have not yet been built. I say to my right

this need for housing which is being expressed; this need is being

raise one or two other points about building in flood-risk areas.
First, this issue comes down to what we define as a “flood-risk
area”. I understand that the Environment Agency will assess an
area as being at flood risk only if it is at risk from river flooding
and not if it is at risk of surface water flooding. I would be happy to
be corrected on that, but that is the situation as I understand it.
Someone whose home is flooded 
<?notus-xml column=340?>does not really care what kind of water it is or where it has come from,
because the situation is bad and they do not want it to happen. Perhaps
the Government need to give different advice to the Environment Agency

the cost-benefit ratio of flood prevention schemes. I raised this in a
written question and I was told, “As long as it is greater than
a level ratio, that is okay. They can go ahead and carry out those
schemes.” But that is not what the Environment Agency is saying

these points back to the Environment Agency to see what we can do to

big issue is funding. I mentioned it in a question the other week to
the Secretary of State, when he called me a lady. According to the
Environment Agency, for every pound invested in flood defence, there is
an £8 return. Which of us would not bet on a horse if
we were getting £8 back for a pound down? The Government are not
doing that. They are not putting the investment in place. I have tabled
questions on this. The answer to parliamentary question 132249 revealed
that in Labour’s last budget, the amount spent on flood defences
overall was £664 million. The following year, it was cut to
£573 million, then £560 million, then
£574 million and then £612 million by 2015. Whichever way
we look at it, those are cuts compared with the Labour years.</hs_Para>

£4 million there and £3 million over there, it

Friend the Member for Newport West (Paul

importance of not only putting in place these big £7 million
concrete defences but looking at softer, more sustainable ways to
improve flood defences. I point to an excellent recent article by
George Monbiot in <I>The Guardian</I>. There is huffing and puffing in
the Chamber, but he made many excellent points, and I flushed out the
issues that he addressed with about 20 parliamentary questions. I will

the article, Monbiot referred to Pontbren in Wales, where farmers have
engaged in linear contour planting of trees, to provide some shade and
shelter for their sheep. What they noticed, after they had provided
that shelter, is that flooding in the flood plain was down by 29%.
Planting trees on just 5% of the hillside led to a 29% reduction in
flooding in the flood plain; even if trees were planted on 100% of the
hillside, there would only be a 50% reduction in
flooding.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:05:58"></hs_TimeCode> We
need specific targeted measures for such linear contour planting in the
catchment areas of our big rivers, and even our little rivers. It would
be a sound investment. A line of trees that has been planted is 67
times more effective in getting rainwater into the ground than grass
alone.</hs_Para>

funding is there. The funding for the common agricultural policy needs
to be looked at. We need to be a strong voice in Europe, arguing that
CAP funding can be used for afforestation in upland areas. We are
creaming off 10% in England for this purpose, and we should be allowed
to use that money to say to farmers and relevant bodies, “Plant
these trees in these catchment areas and stop this water coming down

two main problems as a result of the terrible weather—flooding

has occurred in rural areas of the island, in some cases fairly
regularly, but, as in other parts of the country, it has been far more
severe this year. There is no instant solution, but the rivers, such as
the eastern Yar, have been neglected. There has been a lack of
desilting—desilting, not dredging—and bushes and trees
have been allowed to grow on the riverbanks. These mistakes must be
corrected on an annual basis.</hs_Para>

urban areas, however, there have been quite new experiences. The
unprecedented rainfall has led to more than 120 homes and businesses

some cases, problems were exacerbated by narrow pipework, which was

Bayley</B> (York Central) (Lab):</Member> It is right to begin with the
human cost of flooding. My constituency is no stranger to flooding, and
the devastation to home owners and businesses is incredible, which is
why we need a clear policy, supported and understood by Members on both
sides of the House, whichever party is in government, that gives the
public confidence that the Government will provide the investment in
flood protection that is necessary to minimise the
risks.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:14:55"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

a substantial number of Government Back Benchers got up to thank him

advanced the argument that many people were grateful for flood
protection measures. So, too, am I. We had a hiatus with one particular
scheme in York after the new Government came in, but it is now going
ahead, thanks to funding from the Environment Agency and our local City
of York council.
But<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:15:36"></hs_TimeCode> the budget

David Heath</B> (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</Member> Sadly, in Somerset
we are used to flooding. After last year’s floods, which we
thought were a one-in-100-year event, it is dismaying—that is an
understatement—to see even worse flooding this year. We can cope
with three feet of water for three weeks, but not 10 feet of water for
10 weeks. To put it in context, if we flooded the City of
London, the City of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and
Islington, that would still be smaller than the area currently flooded
in my county. Although we have now managed to open Monks Leaze Clyse,
the River Sowy is flowing and some of the biggest pumps we have ever
seen in Somerset are working, it will nevertheless be weeks before we

about Somerset, often by armchair experts who suddenly know all about
the hydrology of the levels. Some of those myths have been pernicious.
Some have been made in contrary directions. For example, some people
have said that everything will be all right if we dredge, but it will
not, as the Secretary of State said earlier. Dredging will not suddenly
empty the levels or prevent flooding in future. Equally, those who say
that dredging makes no different are talking nonsense, in my view. The
fact that our rivers—the Parrett and the Tone, in
particular—are at 60% of capacity means that we cannot turn on
the pumps in large parts of my constituency because there is nowhere
for the water to go. It means that the flooding starts earlier, stays
longer and covers a greater area.</hs_Para>

Europe. It drops 1 foot every mile; it is not going to turn into an
uncontrollable torrent. We have also heard that the silting problems on
the Parrett come from upstream, when in fact most of the silt is
deposited by the very large tidal flow on the 18 miles or so of the
river that is tidal. Although there is a contribution from upstream,
that is where the main problem

are we in this position? It is not because of purposeful negligence on

that for two reasons. The first reason, which is perfectly valid in
Treasury terms, is the cost-benefit return on investment that favours
the protection of big cities and towns. I understand that, but, as a
Somerset man, I do not see why we should be left out. The other reason
is the heresy that sees the rivers as the area of environmental focus
rather than the very precious ecology of the levels between the rivers.

dredging year on year. In that regard, we will need some significant
changes to the revenue stream for local authorities and the internal
drainage boards to enable them to do the job. We also need to deal with
whole-river catchment. We need upstream measures, for which I hope we
will use pillar 2 money within the common agricultural policy in order

floods and scenes we have seen have been devastating and
awful, as is the cost to individuals, families, homes and businesses.
My first experience of really bad floods in my constituency was due to
a burst pipe last October, which led to 14 homes on Ville road in the
centre of Scunthorpe being very badly flooded. I visited those homes to
see the devastation and they illustrated how bad floods are: they turn
people’s homes upside

pay tribute to the response of the Humberside fire authority, which
came out in the middle of the night, got the situation fast under
control and made a real difference, because there could have been much
more damage. Anglian Water has responded well and is working hard with
the people affected to try to ensure proper and appropriate support
through these difficult times. Although there are still, even now,
compensation issues, I believe they are being worked through properly.
I am pleased that North Lincolnshire council and Anglian Water are
working together, along with Severn Trent Water, to ensure that that is
less likely to be a problem in

have done a lot of work on the industrial river that runs through the
heart of my constituency. Bottesford Beck might not sound like a river,
but it is a big one and in recent years its levels have risen
significantly and become a threat to farmland—it was not flooded
previously, but has been consistently flooded over the past two
years—and to households. As a result of an initiative by the
Friends of Bottesford Beck to draw people together, Tata, the
Environment Agency, North Lincolnshire council, Holme Hall golf club
and local farmers are working together to bring pressure to bear. I am
pleased that last month the Environment Agency agreed that there should
be a pilot project to de-silt Bottesford Beck. That needs to happen in
order to prevent some of the problems faced by the local community,

it looks as if it might be delayed because processes need to be

multi-agency working has been brilliant and responsive at all times.
The Environment Agency has received a lot of criticism over the past
few weeks. Some of it has been deserved in other parts of the country,
but that is for other Members to touch on. In my area, the Environment
Agency has more than risen to the challenge. Mike O’Neill
deserves a mention. He even went door-to-door with me in parts of
central Winchester to talk to and reassure residents. He deserves great
credit for that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:42:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
At one point, water was flowing down the appropriately named Water lane
in Winchester, which the River Itchen runs past, at 12,000 litres per
second—very fast—towards the ancient city mill. That was
terrifying for residents. However, the multi-agency working and the
good thinking of the Environment Agency prevented flooding in hundreds
of homes. It deserves our thanks.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:43:09"></hs_TimeCode> agencies

from Winchester, the Royal Engineers lowered several hundred 1-tonne
bags of gravel into the River Itchen from the bridge of the M3 motorway
to restrict its flow. That has not been done before. It slowed the
Itchen and held it back. It flooded some farmland in the village of
Easton in the Itchen valley, but farmers were happy to allow that to
help save Winchester. It worked. That was a roll of the dice by the
Environment Agency. When Chris Smith came to Winchester yesterday, he
went to the River Itchen and saw the work that had been done. I know

closing, I am concerned about the bids that the Environment Agency has
asked Hampshire county council, as the risk management authority in my

is good that a long-term plan is being put in place, but the process is
incredibly rushed. The council is under incredible pressure to put it
together. Just today, two parish councillors in my area have told me

the response to the flooding

Williamson</B> (Derby North) (Lab):</Member> I start by concurring with
everything said by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport West (Paul
Flynn). He was entirely right when he drew a comparison between his
constituency and what was happening in Somerset. As I think the hon.
Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath) acknowledged, to some extent
farming practices are responsible for the extent of the flooding we
have seen. In addition, however, the Government’s own
ideological obsession with deregulation is responsible, and I will tell
the House why. As hon. Members may know, maize cultivation is now a
significant feature of the British countryside in many areas, and it is
used for animal feed and—as my hon. Friend the Member for
Newport West pointed out—for biofuel.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226113001074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113001074">The problem
with maize cultivation, however, is that it has a significant impact on
land’s capacity to hold water. When Labour was in office we
recognised that, and back in the mid-2000s, I think, we implemented
soil conservation measures to take account of that, linking subsidies
to farmers to that sort of conservation necessity. When this Government
came to power, with their obsession with deregulation, they
specifically exempted maize cultivation from all soil conservation
measures. That seems absolutely crazy. That crop causes the most floods
and does the most damage, yet it is completely unregulated—it is
a crazy example of barmy deregulation. As well as investment in flood
defences and dredging in certain circumstances, it is vital that the
Government make clear the importance of that issue, and take the
necessary steps to ensure that sustainable land use is a feature of
ensuring—as the Prime Minister said—that the Government
secure a sustainable country for the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113001075">Let
me say a little about my constituency, which thankfully was spared the
floods on this occasion. According to recent data, 3,372 homes in my
constituency are at risk of flooding, and 1,370 are at significant
risk. It was really just luck that the rain fell where it did, because
had it fallen on the River Derwent catchment area, my constituents
would be counting the cost of flooding to their homes. I remember back
in the 1960s when around Christmas the homes at risk in my constituency
sustained the sort of flooding that we are seeing in other parts of the
country today.</hs_Para>

funding for the “Our City Our River” flood defence scheme
in Derby was substantially cut by this Government when they came to
office. That has caused considerable anxiety for my constituents,
and made it difficult for many of them
to obtain flood insurance. The Prime Minister said that
money was no object and that the Government would invest in
securing a sustainable country for the future, so I hope that the funds
necessary for flood defences in my constituency will be made
available. It is no good simply saying, “Well, they can be
completed by relying on the private sector and using the funds that it
will put 
<?notus-xml column=355?>in place”. We need to get the private sector to the table, and
meanwhile the rain might fall and the floods may arrive.</hs_Para>

there are a number of climate change deniers on the Government Benches

Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is a climate change

is important to acknowledge the heroic and innovative work undertaken
by our fire and rescue services. The Secretary of State for Communities
and Local Government has referred to some of that excellent work and
other hon. Members have mentioned it in their contributions too.
Firefighters have been tireless in their efforts to rescue people and
to protect certain areas from being inundated. Without their efforts,
residents in areas afflicted by these awful floods would have
experienced even more devastation. The Pitt review, which was published
some time ago, called clearly for a statutory duty to be imposed on
fire authorities to tackle flooding and to be the lead bodies in these

addition to adapting to the growing problem of severe weather events

way. We also need to reduce demand for energy, as that would have the
twin benefit of tackling fuel poverty. Investing in an energy
efficiency regime to tackle fuel poverty would make an important
contribution to reducing demand for energy. Finally, in addition to
reducing development on floodplains, the Government ought to consider
making developers responsible for any damage caused to flooded

Nokes</B> (Romsey and Southampton North) (Con):</Member> Romsey is
located on the banks of the River Test, a world-renowned chalk stream.
Too many times in the past few months the river has been an unwelcome
visitor in too many people’s homes. Our problem is not just the
river, which is ground fed, but the springs that have popped up in many
places; the ingress of groundwater into the foul drainage systems,
causing the drains to fail and rivers of sewage to flow through the
streets of villages like Chilbolton and Longparish; and surface water
flooding, which we experienced in Romsey from Christmas eve until well
into the new year.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:52:55"></hs_TimeCode> householders
along the Causeway in Romsey, there have been weeks of misery: homes
being permanently pumped out, an access road undermined by the sheer
weight of water, and the fear that access to the crucial pumping
station for the town would not be maintained.</hs_Para>

There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:53:09"></hs_TimeCode> have been
phenomenal examples of community 
<?notus-xml column=356?>spirit and pulling together in a crisis. I have praised them before, but
I will do so again: Romsey’s amazing retained firefighters gave
up much of their Christmas and were among the first to be out there
again when the February floods hit. They were indefatigably cheerful,
even when their road closures signs were ignored and
damaged<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:53:34"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Army and the Navy arrived in Romsey the week before last and designed
the most amazing device—colloquially known as the “cat
flap”—to divert water from Fishlake stream back into the
main body of the River Test, and to lay 40,000 sandbags at strategic
points around the town. They worked seamlessly with the borough and
county councils, the Environment Agency and the emergency services, and
were greeted with relief wherever they
went.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113001084">However
much I wax lyrical on how things were pulled together to aid Romsey and
the surrounding villages in their hour of need, there are crucial
lessons that we must learn. Little was known about the bank of the
Fishlake stream until it was at crisis point, so work to identify
at-risk areas has to happen and it has to happen now. There are some
great local examples across Hampshire of communities with flood action
plans and flood wardens where greater damage was averted. We now have
to replicate that work
everywhere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113001085"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>People<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:54:18"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>
have spoken at length of the dangers of building on floodplains, and I
agree. However, in many instances the houses are already there, so
although we must avoid adding to that housing stock, we simply cannot
abandon the houses already there. Protection is needed, and although I
do not pretend to be an engineer or a drainage expert, when the water
has subsided, we must work out what can best be done to avoid this
happening again. Sadly, in many parts of my constituency the water is
still rising, particularly the groundwater, unlike around the River
Itchen where the water levels are falling.</hs_Para>

the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), who is no longer in his
place, but we cannot look just at floodplains. We have to look at the
catchment areas, which can also make a contribution. Where there has
been development at Abbotswood on the edge of Romsey—a
significant distance and uphill from the natural
floodplain—there is a clear problem with surface water drainage
flooding existing properties that are further down the hill. Over
Christmas and new year there were huge problems in Winchester road in
Romsey, with a combined drainage system simply overwhelmed by the
amount of water, causing foul drainage flooding of homes. That might be
regarded as totally separate to the subsequent flooding caused by the
River Test, but the misery for residents is no

would like to put on record my thanks to Lieutenant Colonel Fossey and
his team, who worked phenomenally hard to protect the town from further
flooding. As one would expect, conversation inevitably turned to the
future and what needs to be done to safeguard Romsey in the long term. 
<?notus-xml column=357?>I am the first to say that now is not the time for a knee-jerk reaction

reasonable time scales in which to do it.</hs_Para>

are certainly some thoughts already on whether land needs to be found
that can be safely flooded without damage to housing. Attention needs
to be turned to development and where new houses can best be placed
away from floodplains in a way that will not impact on already creaking
infrastructure. If necessary, we need to revisit housing numbers and
perhaps take a view that some areas simply cannot accommodate more
building. The water courses and drainage systems further up the Test
valley from Romsey also need to be considered. I do not know whether
extra capacity or deepening and widening the stream through
King’s Somborne or the Wallop brook would help. Presumably that
would run the risk of sending water further downstream to Romsey even
faster and exacerbating the problems there.</hs_Para>

that has been done over the past two months to the rail network. Great
Western services have been severed south of Exeter since
Brunel’s sea wall at Dawlish was washed away. Flooding has
disrupted services in Wales. Crewe station was evacuated after
suffering damage, and landslips have led to cancellations and delays in
the south of England. At Bridgwater, in the Somerset levels, the line
from Taunton to Bristol is still under several feet of water. Almost

collapse. Many such earthworks date from the Victorian era and not
enough research has been done on their stability. There have been
50 landslips in Kent alone over recent weeks. My

such reassurances need to be put on the record because of the lack of
transparency on the Government’s part, particularly in regard to
the funding provided. Following the extreme weather in late 2012 and
early 2013, the Government announced that they would fund the greater
part of a Network Rail package of improvements in the Exeter area: they
would provide £26 million, and Network Rail £5 million.
However, that funding disappeared in the autumn statement. The

best, Ministers have failed to communicate their intentions to local
authorities, causing anxiety to those who have to plan locally for
improvements in the south-west’s flood resilience; but if this

is already clear that Network Rail has been left with an extensive
bill. The south-west’s local authorities estimate that last
winter’s weather caused about £140 million
worth of damage; this year’s storms have cost Network Rail about
£170 million, and that figure may yet rise. As Network Rail must
find 20% efficiency savings over the next five years, it will not be
easy for it to absorb a further loss of nearly £200
million—and that does not include the cost of the additional
resilience studies that the Government have ordered or further
resilience measures in
Dawlish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113001098">The

going to give him another chance. First, can he assure the House that
projects will not be cancelled or pushed back beyond 2019 as a result
of the additional expenditure? Secondly, if Network Rail concludes that
a new line is needed, or that substantial improvement works should be
carried out on the Dawlish sea wall, will those works be funded by
central Government, or will they be paid for out of Network
Rail’s already pressured
budget?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113001099">Of
course, local authorities whose budgets have already been severely cut
have had to commit emergency funding, much of which is not reclaimable
under the Bellwin scheme. We have been told by the Prime Minister that
“money is no object” when it comes to meeting the cost of
the floods, but two weeks after he made that statement, we are little
closer to knowing what he meant. For all 
<?notus-xml column=359?>the claims that investment in flood defences has increased during the
current Parliament, that is correct only if inflation and local
authority funding are ignored, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the

based on long-term planning and proper regard for the scientific

living with the reality of climate change, and the flooding over the
past two months has brought the scale of that challenge into sharp

the radical right of his party, he has allowed the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to become a voice for scepticism
within the Government. Preparing for and managing flood risk has been
dropped as one of DEFRA’s priorities, and, as I mentioned
earlier, the Government’s draft national policy statement on
roads and railways contains no reference to ensuring that our transport
network is resilient. Budgets have been slashed, staff cuts planned,
and scientific advice ignored. Progress reports on the Pitt
Review’s recommendations have been scrapped, and exaggerated
claims have been made in Parliament about spending on flood
defences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0003.htm#140226113001101">All

people who run a bed and breakfast from their home. Landlords are not
covered, even where there is a jointly owned freehold with each flat
owner as a leaseholder. It is not clear whether tenants wanting
contents insurance will be covered. There is no answer from the
Government on the position 
<?notus-xml column=363?>of home owners or builders who acted in good faith, following all
relevant planning guidelines and Environment Agency advice, but find
themselves with homes that will now not attract home insurance cover
under the Flood Re scheme because they have been built since 2009.
Under Flood Re, a home built on 31 December 2008 will be covered
whereas a house next door that was built on 1 January 2009 will not be.
The scheme seems very arbitrary, and it is also not clear whether Flood
Re covers the surface water flooding which we had a problem with in
Hull in 2007.</hs_Para>

2000, which affected a large part of my constituency, the Government at

Percy:</Member></B> No, I will not give way, because there are others
who wish to speak. The flood defence funding issue in my constituency
was not related to cancelled schemes. In fact, the improvements that
were expected in my area were not scheduled until 2023, and 2028 in
many cases. Our flooding was down to a significant tidal surge, which
flooded 350 homes in my constituency. As I have said on numerous
occasions, that incident coincided with the death of President Nelson
Mandela, so it was not top of the six o’clock news. None the
less, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural 
<?notus-xml column=365?>Affairs visited, as did the chairman of the Environment Agency. Eleven
communities in my constituency were flooded. Some of them, such as
Burringham and Keadby, received warnings, but others in South Ferriby
and Reedness did not and many people found themselves in quite
dangerous situations with water in some cases as high as their waists,
and in one case up to their chests. A number of residents were stuck in
their properties because they had not been provided with proper
warnings.</hs_Para>

had a public meeting in South Ferriby last Monday night; a couple of
hundred people turned out. It was a really well attended and good
spirited meeting. One thing residents asked me to take back is the
issue of flood warnings. A lot of people are elderly and not on the
internet. Large parts of my constituency have internet speeds of about
one megabit a fortnight, so it is not possible to get the updates. They
did not know a warning had been issued in the morning. We did not have
a severe warning, and people were not evacuated. The first thing people
knew of the problems was when the Humber started pouring through their
front doors, which was a frightening experience for elderly people
living in bungalows. No one was there to help them, because the
flooding was not expected in that community. Had it not been for the
parish council and younger, fitter neighbours, a number of residents
could have found themselves in an even more distressing
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001139">Following
that flooding I visited all the communities, but it took me three days
to get round them all, given the scale of the flooding across east
Yorkshire and north Lincolnshire. At that time I was struck by the
response of the emergency services, and of the Environment Agency,
which has come in for a lot of stick, but whose dedicated personnel
were out there on the front line—maybe not at the time that some
residents would have liked them, but in the days afterwards and since
then, informing and protecting
residents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001140">I

morning, of £300 to every home that was flooded and a

Percy:</Member></B> That is absolutely correct. It ties in with the
point I am making, which is that in 2007 the river catchment plans for
the Trent, the Ouse and the Aire were all issued, and those plans at
that time suggested reducing defences. That was at the time of the last
Labour Government. I, as a local councillor and a prospective
parliamentary candidate, did not go around saying that the Labour
Government wanted to flood our areas, but the catchment flood plans
that we faced at that time would have reduced our defences
substantially. We fought them very hard. Largely because of the
information and skill of the drainage boards and local farmers, we were
able to disprove the Environment Agency’s argument for its
proposal and to win a change in the policy, so now our defences will be
maintained and improved in line with rising sea
levels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001146">That
is all now subsumed by the River Humber flood strategy. This is where
we really need some action. That strategy was adopted in 2008 for the
Humber. It highlights large parts of my constituency as in need of
improved defences, but at some time in the future—15 years
hence. That is not good enough, bearing in mind what we have seen in
the past few weeks. We need the funding for that, and we need to know
what that strategy actually means. At a public meeting in South
Ferriby, and in the previous public meeting we held at Reedness,
residents were saying, “It is fine for our areas to have been
identified in 2008 as needing improvement, but it is not good enough
for us not to know when that will happen.” That is why I am
pleased that last night the Conservative group on North Lincs council
passed a budget that is bringing forward £5 million of funding,

to unlock that match funding, as it has from North Lincs

million pounds of that funding is scheduled for this financial year,
specifically for defences on the Humber and the Trent, and the
remainder in the forthcoming years. My plea to Ministers would be to
ensure that where that match funding is being offered, the EA’s

would like to raise one issue with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:29:54"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the
hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson); I would welcome a
ministerial meeting, or a meeting with officials, about it. In 2010,
there was a proposal for what was called the Arklyn Kennels scheme in
West Drayton, for investment to build up concrete and earth-bank
defences by 2014-15. Originally, that was a £2.8 million scheme,
which subsequently, I am told, was reduced to a £1 million
scheme and delayed until at least 2018-19. I hope that, in the light of
the events of recent weeks, that scheme will be reviewed and we can
look at it again. I would welcome a meeting with Ministers or officials
to talk it through, and to bring in the relevant local authority
representatives as well, because the area affected is one of those on
the Thames floodplain that has demonstrated that we need to do much
more.</hs_Para>

second constituency issue that I want to raise is about Heathrow. I am
not trying to be opportunistic; I am just making a relevant point. At
the terminal 5 inquiry, detailed submissions were put forward with
regard to expanding Heathrow on what is, in effect, the Thames
floodplain. The argument put forward in favour of Heathrow expansion
then was that rivers would be diverted and culverted, which I do not
think has been successful. The Howard Davies review is looking at the
various options for runways across the south-east, including at
Heathrow, and it is important that his attention is focused on the
implications for flooding on the Thames floodplain. Any further
expansion at Heathrow—any additional runway—will
effectively build up a dam, which will cause flooding further
on.</hs_Para>

I will return to the issue about the Pitt review. Recommendation 39 of
the review was that a statutory duty should be placed upon fire
authorities with regard to flooding. In opposition, the Conservative
party and the Liberal Democrats supported that recommendation, and a
number of us went to see Labour Government Ministers to urge them to
implement it. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee also
recommended that it should be implemented; the Chair of the Committee,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:32:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh), raised the issue in debate after
debate. There were delays and we were then told that there would be
Operation Watermark, which would eventually determine whether that
statutory responsibility would be given to fire authorities. That took
place and there were recommendations that the issue should now be
addressed. The chief fire officers have come out in favour of the
proposal. The Government’s new system of an ideas bank, which I
support, has also recommended that the Government act on this matter. I
urge the Government to consider it seriously.</hs_Para>

the coalition agreement, there was an agreement that the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:32:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for 
<?notus-xml column=368?>Worcester (Mr Walker) who said that there have been improvements in
recent years in the supply of equipment and so on. Those improvements
came as a result of learning the lessons of past disasters, when
firefighters had turned up and there was inadequate equipment. We
realised that for decades there had not been sufficient investment
because no one took responsibility. Placing a statutory responsibility
on fire authorities protects their budgets, ensures that someone takes
responsibility, and in the long term cumulatively ensures that the
lessons of past disasters are learned.</hs_Para>

Spelthorne, who have created a thriving community, that there was so
much resilience. Time and again, I spoke to people who were not
expecting massive amounts of aid or of intervention. They appreciated

think that there is a very fair question to be asked about that. What
was the plan locally? If help did not arrive to ensure that elderly
people got the assistance they needed, to help folk move furniture and
valuables upstairs to stop them being wrecked by the water, and to
evacuate people in a timely way, why did it not arrive, especially in
places where there had been flooding previously? The Government have a
responsibility nationally, but local government and the local community
also have a responsibility. We need plans that are not only good on
paper, but can be implemented when the time
comes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001181"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:45:35"></hs_TimeCode>Given
the number of families who have been forced out of their homes, I am
grateful for the swift response—Downing street took about 20
minutes to respond—to my call for families not to have to worry
about paying council tax on a home they cannot live in. I would be
grateful if the Minister could be absolutely clear that what the Prime
Minister said when he was in Wales—that local authorities will
be fully funded for the cost of offering a council tax
rebate—will happen. The Secretary of State said that the
Government have talked about there being enough funding for at least
three months, but we know from evidence from the insurance industry, in
particular, and the experience in 2007 that people can be out of their
homes for a lot longer, perhaps for six or nine months, and sadly in
some cases for more than a year.</hs_Para>

Minister also indicate whether the Government are proposing to look
again at the rules? To answer the Secretary of State, of course
councils should be able to charge more council tax when properties are
left empty deliberately, but there was previously an automatic
exemption in cases of flooding, for example if someone could not live
in their home because it needed repair to make it habitable. That was
taken away in the 2012 changes and instead made subject to the
discretion of councils. To provide reassurance in the years ahead, I
think that it should be automatic in cases of flooding.</hs_Para>

reinforced in my conversation with the leader of Plymouth city council,
Tudor Evans. As that and other storm damage reminds us, the complex 
<?notus-xml column=372?>ecosystem of modern life and infrastructure can be very vulnerable,
which is why we need to take it into account not just in repairing but
in building for the future.</hs_Para>

heard from my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:47:39"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friends the Members for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) and for
Newport West (Paul Flynn), we need to plant trees near rivers and look
at farming practice and land use helping the water soak away and
slowing its rush. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:47:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath) explained, we need to look at where
dredging can and cannot help. We must ensure that when there are huge
downpours in towns and cities, the water does not meet a wall of paving
slabs, concrete and tarmac, because that is why Sheffield and Hull
flooded in 2007. We also need to recognise that although sandbags can
help in some cases, it is dedicated flood protection that makes the
difference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001185"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:48:19"></hs_TimeCode>I
hope that the Minister will agree to the cross-party talks referred to
in the motion, because whoever is in government will have to continue
to deal with this problem. There is no doubt that the world’s
climate is changing and that humankind’s actions are causing it.
The climate impact projections, based on the best science we have,
suggest that in the years ahead we will see hotter and drier summers
and wetter winters with more flooding.</hs_Para>

us just reflect on the past decade. In 2003 a heat wave led to 2,000
excess deaths in this country, even though temperatures were just
2° higher than normal. In 2006 we had a severe drought. Around 8
million people in the south-east of Britain depend on rivers for their
water supply. In 2007 we saw widespread flooding across the country,
and Great Yarmouth came within 10 cm of being overcome. In 2009 the
High street in Cockermouth turned into a raging torrent. This January
was the wettest winter month for almost 250 years. The result—we
have heard it powerfully expressed today—is that yet more
communities in our country are coming face to face with the
consequences of a changing climate, in this case as the waters invade
their
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001187">We
know what happens when these events occur—the drama unfolds, the
cameras arrive, the stories are told, the statements are made, and for
a while the nation’s attention is focused on what we can see
before our very eyes. But we also know that when the waters recede and
the weeks and months pass, the long, slow, hard process of recovery
continues away from the public gaze. We should come together for the
families and communities so that we adapt to what we cannot change and
protect what we can, and so that others people do not suffer what so

Thames valley, Wiltshire and the Somerset levels, with this last, in
particular, seeing unprecedented water levels. Groundwater levels

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:51:53"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Member for
Garston and Halewood (Maria Eagle) in her opening remarks. While it is
not yet possible to attribute a single instance of extreme weather to
climate change, the recent winter storminess is in line with what we
expect to see under climate change scenarios. We expect an increase in
the frequency and severity of these types of weather events. The
UK’s first climate change risk assessment, published in 2012,
assessed this trend and informed the report on the national adaptation
programme that we published last year. This sets out a wide range of
actions by Government, business, councils and civil society to address
the most significant climate risks we face as a country.</hs_Para>

of response, and the spirit of it, has been staggering. I appreciate
how hard everyone has been working and just how hard it is for the
people whose homes and businesses have been affected. All levels of
Government and the emergency services are fully engaged in dealing with

latest flood event. During this Parliament the Government are spending
more in cash terms—in real terms—than ever before. The

work of communities, the Environment Agency, the Armed Forces, the
emergency services and local councils in assisting those affected;
calls on the insurance industry to ensure pay-outs are made as quickly
as possible; recognises that continued support will be needed for the
communities and businesses affected in the months ahead as homes and
infrastructure are repaired; acknowledges the clear scientific evidence
that climate change is contributing to the increased frequency of
severe weather and the consequent risk of flooding; notes the advice
from the Committee on Climate Change that current and planned levels of
investment are insufficient to manage future flood risk given the
increased threat from climate change; calls for further reports on the
implementation of the recommendations contained in Sir Michael
Pitt’s report into the 2007 floods to be made to Parliament; and
supports cross-party talks on the impact of climate change and the
funding and policy decisions necessary to mitigate the consequences of
more frequent severe weather on communities and the

Phillips</B> (Sleaford and North Hykeham) (Con):</Member> I am grateful
to have secured this important debate. I tried to do so having learned
the tragic story of Emily Challen, a 17-year-old constituent of mine
who was killed in a car accident this time last year. Her death has
left a void in the lives of her parents and family that few of us can
begin to imagine. I pay tribute to her parents, Keith and Jennifer, for
their bravery and dignity in telling Emily’s story and in trying
to ensure that some good comes of what their family have been
through.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001244">On<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:05:13"></hs_TimeCode>
15 February 2013, Emily was travelling to school as one of three
passengers in a car driven by an 18-year-old friend, when the car ran
into the back of a stationary lorry on a slip road. Emily was
pronounced dead at the scene. In a few short moments, her promising
young life, and the happiness of many whose lives she touched and
enriched, were
extinguished.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001245">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:05:39"></hs_TimeCode>
cannot, of course, undo what happened that day. What we can do, and
what we should be doing, is to try to reduce the chances of what
happened to the Challen family happening to anyone else. In short, how
can driving be made safer for young drivers? What lessons can we learn
from other jurisdictions where young drivers cannot simply pass their
test and enjoy the same access to the road network as those who have
been driving for years? How can we minimise the chance of other
families having to suffer what the Challen family have been
through?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001246">Road<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:06:15"></hs_TimeCode>
crashes are one of the biggest unnatural causes of death for young
people in the UK. The figures are appalling and they speak for
themselves. Young drivers are involved in one in four fatal and serious
crashes, despite making up only one in eight holders of driving
licences. One in five new drivers has a crash within six months of
passing their test, and we all know that young male drivers have much
higher crash rates than young female
drivers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001247">Why<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>
is that so? The reasons are not, perhaps, obscure, but they deserve
restatement. As anyone who has been driving for a while knows, young
people are more likely to take a number of the deadliest risks on our
roads, including speeding, overtaking blind and not wearing a seat
belt. Young drivers, especially young men, are more likely to seek
thrills from driving fast and cornering at high speed than their older
counterparts. Although young people quickly pick up the physical skills
of driving and, as a result, feel they have mastered the art and are
very confident about their abilities, that is simply an illusion. Young
drivers drive unsafely, but they do so believing that they are in
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001248">Young
drivers do all that when, as anyone who has been driving for years
knows, although some hazards on the road are easy to identify, many are
not. It often takes experience to notice the hidden hazards, and owing
to inexperience, young people may be poor at noticing them and reacting
in time to avoid them. The research indicates that, since driving is a
new experience for young people, they tend to use most of their mental
energy on the immediate tasks, such as gear-changing and steering,
rather than on general observation of the 
<?notus-xml column=380?>potential hazards ahead. Inexperience means that they have a poorer
ability to spot such hazards; youth means that they are particularly
likely to take
risks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001249">As
hon. Members will know, that is not the end of the story. Perhaps most
worryingly, young drivers are more likely to drive while under the
influence of alcohol or drugs. So it is that drivers under the age of
25 have the highest incidence of failing a breath test after a crash.
Any amount of alcohol in the bloodstream can affect a person’s
ability to drive safely, as it impairs reaction times and affects the
ability to judge speed and distance accurately. Alcohol or drugs,
combined with a lack of experience on the roads, is therefore a
particularly dangerous
mixture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001250">Of
particular concern to Mr and Mrs Challen, given the circumstances of
Emily’s death, is the research that shows that having passengers
in the car can cause even higher crash rates among young drivers. Peer
pressure can encourage bad driving and result in drivers showing off to
their passengers, as well as cause distraction. Research in the United
States has shown that the already high crash rate for teenagers when
driving alone is greatly increased when passengers are present. With
two or more passengers, the fatal crash risk for 16 to 19-year-old
drivers is more than five times greater than when they are driving
alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001251"><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="140226113002219" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113002219"><B>Jim

neither this Government nor their predecessors have taken the action
necessary to ensure the safety of young drivers on our roads, as well

not know. I want to hear tonight that the Minister and the Department
for Transport will take a fresh look at the issue before more young

can be done to make things safer? Although I accept there is a balance
to be struck with social and work mobility for young people, the fact
remains that we have to do something. I, and others such as the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon), have been extremely concerned that
the Department has delayed its Green Paper on young driver safety,
apparently indefinitely. Let me make clear to my hon. Friend the
Minister that not only is that not good enough, but he needs to tell
the House why that decision has been taken and, frankly, either reverse
it or face the consequences of not doing so, and what that will mean
for death and serious injury to young drivers in the future.</hs_Para>

driver licensing exists in many other countries, and at present I see
no good reason for why it does not exist here. Exact requirements vary
slightly, but the 
<?notus-xml column=381?>main aim, which any licensing system ought to share, remains the same:
to build up the ability and experience of young drivers in stages on a
structured basis, to minimise the risks that they face. That means
limiting the exposure of new drivers to the dangerous situations I have
mentioned. Novice drivers going through graduated driver licensing
could be subjected to certain restrictions and conditions, including
restrictions on the numbers of passengers they can carry, driving at
night and alcohol consumption. A graduated licence system would also go
hand in hand with road safety as a compulsory part of the national
curriculum in schools, where we should be teaching young people about
the risks that they face as novice drivers or young passengers and how
to minimise them.</hs_Para>

six months’ driving experience. That gives them very little time

I have raised a similar case with the Minister. One of the solutions

solutions?</hs_Para>

that could be introduced is a minimum learning period—for

from other countries that have introduced some form of graduated driver

oh why, are we not learning from those figures and experiences, and
saving hundreds of young drivers in the UK from serious injury and
death every year? It is not as though calls for something to be done
are new. In 2007, the Transport Committee reviewed the evidence
available and called for the introduction of a graduated driver
licensing system, including a minimum 12-month learner period; raising
the age of unaccompanied driving to 18; a maximum blood alcohol limit
of 20 mg per 100 ml of blood for up to 12 months after

Direct Line found that 87% of drivers thought that learners should be
required to achieve a minimum level of experience before taking their
driving test and that 81% thought that there should be restrictions on
drivers’ licences for a period of time after they first passed
their test. If and when the Department publishes a Green Paper, those

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Mr Robert

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:17:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Stephen
Phillips) on securing this debate on the safety of young drivers. I am
always glad to have the opportunity to discuss an important subject
such as improving the safety of our young drivers. I was extremely
sorry to hear of the tragic death last year of his constituent, Emily
Challen, and I am saddened by the continuing toll of fatal accidents on
our roads. Every one of them is a
tragedy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:17:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

are very few of us who have not been touched by such a tragedy. In my
locality, there was a recent road collision involving an 18-year-old
friend of my son. His car crashed into a tree and, sadly, he was
killed. That shocked the whole year group at Malton school. We cannot
be complacent about our road safety record, and we must continue to
seek improvements and identify the changes that can make our roads
safer for all. This is why it is vital that the Government strike the
right balance, so that young drivers remain safe on our roads, but, at
the same time, their freedom is not restricted. We 
<?notus-xml column=383?>feel that it is important that all views are considered and the right
decisions are made. We will issue a paper when we have considered the
matter

roads are among the safest in the world. We are proud of that record,
but we know that there is more we can do to make our roads safer. The
latest figures for 2012 show another drop in the number of people
killed on our roads. In fact, it was the lowest figure since national
records began in 1926. It is a testament to the hard work and
dedication of road safety professionals that we are able to make
consistent progress year on year. However, I suspect that, like me, all
hon. Members feel a mixture of emotions whenever such statistics are
published, because every single one of them is
preventable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:18:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001269"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Stewart Jackson" PimsId="4789" UID="140226113002224" xid="873" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113002224"><B>Mr

learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Stephen
Phillips) on his powerful speech. Does the Minister agree that it is
imperative, not least for their own self-interest, that insurance
companies are involved in the process of guiding behaviour, given that
most young drivers will be driving legally and that fixing insurance
premiums to guide behaviour is an important part of changing behaviour
in the long

because they cannot afford the insurance. However, I will come to some
exciting developments in the field of telematics, which insurance

is knowing that deaths are preventable that gives us such a strong
incentive to carry on trying to improve what we do. For me, as road
safety Minister, that means providing support to road safety
professionals such as the police, the fire service and many other road
safety organisations. That support may come through funding, policy or
raising awareness of important
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001272">As
we have heard, young people are involved in about a fifth of all road
crashes, but only about 5% of all the miles driven in Britain each year
are driven by them. That worries us, and we know it worries parents and
young people too. We know that young men cause more crashes than young
women and that more collisions occur at night, when young people have
their friends in the car or are on roads in the countryside. We also
know that drivers of all ages are most at risk of causing a collision
in the first six months after they take their practical test.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226113001273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001273">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>
are also conscious that this unfortunate safety record gives our young
people some of the highest insurance premiums. As budgets in many
households are tight, we want to do what we can to bring those
insurance costs down. Estimates provided by the insurance industry
suggest that drivers could expect discounts on a telematics policy of
between 25% to 33%, with the highest being 50%, and that some young
drivers have saved over £1,000 by using such policies. Such
policies are cheaper because the claims history of the drivers using
them is so much better. It is also worth mentioning that some studies
suggest that parental viewing of feedback from telematics devices can
improve young people’s driving
further<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:21:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001274">For
those who are not conversant with the concept of telematics, I would
liken it to having the electronic equivalent of a glass of water on the
dashboard. Every 
<?notus-xml column=384?>time the water spills because of severe braking or cornering, the policy
cost is loaded up. Indeed, there are currently 296,000 live telematics
policies from a number of companies in this country. Only recently I
met the insurance industry to discuss how we might consider
commissioning research into how telematics can change the behaviour and
attitudes of learner drivers. Like many things in life, the more
someone practises, the better they become. We know that more practice
before taking a practical test improves hazard perception and
understanding of risk, and results in a lower collision
rate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:22:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001275">The
driving test has been steadily refined since it was introduced in the
1930s. We have recently made changes to the theory test, so that it is
harder to learn the answers by rote, and we have introduced an element
of independent driving—driving without instruction or
direction—during the test to help to prepare for the real-life
driving environment. The Government recognise that there are many
voices calling for a graduated driving licence to be considered or
introduced in Britain. We recognise that there is a significant body of
evidence to suggest that a GDL regime would have a beneficial effect on
British road safety. However, against that we need to weigh carefully
the implications for the freedom of our young people, as any such
change to the law would result in some difficult cases—for
instance, where a young person is stranded, unable to drive home
legally—or would limit the ability of young people to offer each
other lifts and thereby reduce transport
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:23:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001276">Caution
also needs to be exercised before making quick comparisons between
Britain and other countries with GDL regimes. British roads are among
the safest in the world and Britain’s road safety record is
considerably better than all the countries that have already introduced
GDLs, with the exception of Sweden, whose record is similar to
ours<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:23:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001277">We
are in the process of undertaking some face-to-face research with
parents and young people to get a better understanding of the issues
from their perspective. As I hope the House can appreciate, this is a
difficult topic, as I have mentioned, and it is important that we get
this right. Once we are confident that we have struck the right balance
between driver safety and restricting the freedom of our young people,
we will come forward with our proposals. In the meantime, there are
other things we can look to improve.</hs_Para>

want to improve the quality and accessibility of resources to support
road safety. There is a range of resources to support the process
involved in gaining a licence, but relatively little information
targeted at parents, at those who accompany learner drivers or even at
young people themselves on the risks faced by inexperienced drivers
after they pass their driving test. There are also initiatives like
Bikeability, which operates in the cycling sector, that could be used
at an early age to instil road safety behaviours.</hs_Para>

are technologies that could potentially reduce the crash and casualty
risk among novice drivers, and we want to provide incentives for their
take-up. Because young and inexperienced drivers’ decisions
about the vehicles that they buy are influenced by their overall
budgets and by the cost of insurance, new vehicles, which are safer but
more expensive, are less likely to be driven by the drivers who are
most at risk and who 
<?notus-xml column=385?>would benefit most from the technology. I expect that that will change
over time as today’s new cars become tomorrow’s cheap
bangers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001280">We
recognise that if we tighten the processes of learning to drive and
licensing, an unintended consequence may be that more young people
choose to ride motorbikes or mopeds. We also know that powered
two-wheelers are involved in a significant number of crashes, many more
than cars. We therefore think it important to consider ways of
improving the process of compulsory basic training so that that, too,
is as safe as we can make
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226113001281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/debtext/140226-0004.htm#140226113001281">We

a topic of discussion among the road safety and insurance communities.

would like to start by outlining the current situation, because
although the national media and visiting politicians have moved on, we
in the south-west are still feeling the impact of the recent storms and
floods. The main and only railway route beyond Exeter to the rest of
Devon, Plymouth and Cornwall is still severed at Dawlish; the main line
providing cross-country services from our region to Bristol, south
Wales, the midlands and the north is still under 18 inches of water for
more than a mile of its stretch near Bridgwater in Somerset; and, of
course, much of the Somerset levels still look as if they have been
reclaimed by the
sea.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000008">We
must also take note of the impact of the rail closures on our roads.
First Great Western alone is running 166 coaches a day to replace rail
services lost due to the flooding in the Somerset levels and Dawlish.
The urgent priority is to get both important railway connections
reopened as quickly as possible. I am sure that Network Rail is doing
its best in Dawlish and on the Somerset levels, but I am also sure that
both it and the Minister will be aware of the importance of the Easter
holidays to our tourist industry. Everything possible must be done to
ensure that both lines are reopened in time for the school holidays. We
have heard encouraging words from Ministers and Network Rail about the
need for an additional alternative route that avoids the vulnerable
Dawlish section. We have had words in the past, but what the west
country wants and expects now is
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000009">The
Government have given the commitment that Network Rail will report back
by the summer on its initial feasibility study into a Dawlish-avoiding
route. Will the Minister reassure me that Network Rail will take advice
from outside experts, including the Met Office, on the likely impact of
rising sea levels and more extreme weather events due to climate
change? When Network Rail reviewed the Dawlish line for the Labour
Government in 2004, it deemed it viable for the foreseeable future and
rejected the need for an alternative. That advice was hopelessly
over-optimistic. In fact, Network Rail has been criticised in the past
for opening its eyes too slowly to the resilience challenges posed by
climate change. Will the Minister assure us that Network Rail has now
opened its eyes and will not make the same mistake
again?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000010">As
the four transport authorities in the south-west pointed out in a
letter to the Secretary of State for Transport in January—before
we lost the line at Dawlish—the re-announced £31.3
million for rail flood resilience in the south-west was actually
promised a year ago, 
<?notus-xml column=106?>after last winter’s floods when we also lost our rail connection
for several weeks. The money was not delivered then—will the
Minister tell us whether it has been now? If not, why not, and when
will it be
paid?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000011">On
the wider issue of flood defence, the Minister will be aware that
several important schemes in the south-west were abandoned or delayed
after his Government cut investment in flood defences on taking office.
The UK Statistics Authority confirmed again today that investment in
flood defences has fallen by £250 million under this Government
compared with the previous one. The Environment Agency’s flood
maintenance budget has fallen from more than £100 million a year
in 2010 to just £60 million this year. At the time when such
changes were announced, many of us warned that they would be a false
economy, because, as the Minister knows, for every pound invested in
flood defences, at least eight are saved in the long run. Indeed, those
are the Treasury rules—the EA is not allowed to spend money on
new flood defences unless it can guarantee that level of
return.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000012">When
the Government took office, there was also a very good argument for
sustaining or even increasing capital investment in infrastructure. For
the first three years under this Government, our economy flat-lined.
Organisations such as the IMF and CBI argued repeatedly for more
capital investment to boost jobs and growth, but that did not happen.
The Government did not listen and we are now paying the price. Will the
Minister assure us that the schemes that were in the pipeline in 2010
will now go ahead on a renewed, accelerated time
scale?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000013">Two
weeks ago, in response to the floods, the Prime Minister said,
“Money is no object”. He also kept repeating, in his now
infamous press conference, the words “we are a wealthy
country”, but I cannot see that any of the announcements made in
the past few weeks represent any new money or increased investment.
Indeed, there is still confusion about whether the Prime Minister was
talking about resources to deal with the immediate crisis or long-term
investment, in spite of the fact that he seemed to say quite clearly
that we need to do everything we can to improve our resilience as a
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000014">What
is the Minister’s understanding of what the Prime Minister was
talking about? For example, there has still not been a firm pledge on
the investment that would be needed for the Dawlish-avoiding route.
Yet, whichever route is chosen, or even if the recommendation is
somehow to maintain and better defend the current route, the cost will
be a tiny fraction of the tens of billions of pounds that the
Government have already committed to HS2. I am not against HS2, but why
are the Government incapable of committing to ensuring that we in the

below  that of all other English regions and the devolved

have already lost so many people that they not only do not have the
staff to work on the new flood defence schemes that are under way, but
they cannot adequately maintain current flood defences. It would be

context, let me draw the Minister’s attention to a study by
Exeter university, in collaboration with his Department and South West
Water, on land management and water management on Exmoor. That
four-year project, led by Professor Richard Brazier, essentially
involves blocking up ditches and other drainage courses over a
2,000-hectare area of the moor to help to restore the peatland that
predates the drainage that has happened for grazing during the past 200
years or so.</hs_Para>

preliminary results, published last week, are dramatic. Because of the
restored land’s improved ability to retain and absorb water, the
project has reduced by one third the volume of water leaving Exmoor and
entering the River Exe. That is the equivalent of nearly 7,000
Olympic-sized swimming pools. It has significantly reduced the volume
of storm and therefore flood surges all along the Exe. It has had the
added benefit of improving significantly the quality of the water
arriving at South West Water’s treatment works, thereby reducing
costs for that company and ultimately, it is hoped, for those of us who
pay water rates<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T09:42:07"></hs_TimeCode>.

I turn briefly to flood insurance? Many householders and businesses in

56 families had to be evacuated late at night. The police had to knock
in windows to get residents out. Countless businesses lost trade and,
although that was partly due to sodden buildings, it was also because
the train was not running. The cafés that usually got the
business from the tourist footfall simply did not do business. The
district and county councils were brilliant in all that they did, doing
much more than might otherwise have been expected. Volunteers were
fantastic. There was a lot of action during the night. Tea was
available 24 hours a day, served by a wonderful lady, and the Network
Rail team, in their orange jackets, have now become almost iconic in
Dawlish. The local community love them to bits and see them as local

need to remember that the impact of everything that has happened was
not only physical, but emotional and economic. For my constituency, the

got off the train, walked over the rocks and got on another train on

must look seriously at what can be done to support the railway line. I
hope the Minister addresses that in his remarks. There is new
technology that will allow a secondary wall to be put on the external
front, with wave-breaking technologies that will reduce any damage.
There is also the potential for a breakwater to be put further out. I
believe that has been done in Sidmouth and Plymouth. I see no reason
why it should not be considered in Dawlish. Indeed, from conversations
I had with Network Rail last year, I understand that it was already
under review. However, I thought 2019 was too late and simply not an

Dawlish station footfall, believe it or not, is 480,564 people per

past 10 years, the footfall through Dawlish has risen by 81%. The
footfall for Teignmouth is 566,528 individuals a year—again,
that is the 2012 figure—and that has seen growth of 98%. If we
add the footfall in Newton Abbot, the number is similar to that in
Exeter St Davids or Plymouth, so this is not a small rural area. It is
a significant part of the south-west, with a significant local economy,
much of which is driven by tourism, and it is absolutely crucial that

some proper open discussion about what money is needed and what money

Government’s coffers. They have some big issues to deal with,
and I am afraid I am going to be a bit controversial here. Almost
without exception, constituents have come up to me and said,
“Why have we got so much money in the international trade
budget?” In many ways, that budget is absolutely right, but what
about our own people? Does not charity begin at home? I am conscious
that that budget is not big and would not cover all the flood
prevention work that is needed. Although it is laudable to have a fund

all those things. When my constituents and the council ring the

indeed, when people speak to Devon county council—they find that
they do not know either. We need some clarity about exactly what the

we are talking about weather, the main focus of our attention today is
rail resilience. Network Rail has responded quickly and I pay tribute
to it. On the very day of the Dawlish breach, it attended a meeting
with the Secretary of State for Transport, here at Westminster, and it
was obvious that it was going to grip the situation. It gave a six-week
timetable, which has slightly slipped because of further storms, and is
getting on with it. I understand that it has 100 people working 24/7 to
fill up this wonderful hole, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newton

service to the far south-west. There is another debate to be
had—it is not a matter for this Minister—about the future
of the franchise and how, with only two and a  
<?notus-xml column=116?>half years to run, the company lacks the ability to invest in upgrading
its rolling stock, and so on. That needs to be tackled, but that is for

real challenge will be not getting the Dawlish breach restored and the
trains running again before Easter—I am confident that will
happen—but, as my hon. Friend said, the report to the Government
on alternative or additional routes that I understand will be made by
July. That is when the fun will begin, because there will be myriad
views on the right
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:08:51"></hs_TimeCode>. Let me
say, first, that I agree that the existing route has to be reinforced
and kept open. We should consider alternative routes from Newton Abbot
to Exeter that would be faster and straighter, because that would make
the link from the far south-west to London much quicker and more
acceptable, to business people in particular. That needs to be fully
explored. However, I agree that the existing line must be kept open.
All we may really need is an additional line to be used in extremis,
but which can be used for freight and local traffic. Then if there
should be another breach in years to come, traffic can be switched to
that alternate route. It would be wise to wait until we see the report,
but it will be important for those of us in the west country to try to
reach a consensus on the right way forward. I am afraid that at the
moment there are probably as many views as there are Members of
Parliament in Devon and Cornwall, which is not helpful. We need to try
to reach a
consensus<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000076">That
issue is eclipsed by the far greater issue of funding. I agree with
many of my constituents who ask me, “How on earth can you
support HS2?” There is already tremendously impressive
infrastructure from London to Birmingham and further north, while in
the west country we have a Victorian line that is unfortunately looking
more and more vulnerable. I have come to the conclusion that it is very
difficult to answer that question, except by saying—as I have
already said to Ministers—that it will be impossible for me to
support the Government on the Second Reading of the hybrid High Speed
Rail (London – West Midlands) Bill unless there is a firm
commitment on the table for a fully funded package for an agreed
alternative route. That has to be new money. There is a lot of money in
the five-year budget, but a lot of things have to be done with it; it
has to be new money. We are probably talking about hundreds of millions
of

sign up to something like that because different agendas are running,
but I agree that, in theory, there are enough Members of Parliament for
Devon, Cornwall, Somerset and further afield that we could make an
impact if we were to act collectively. HS2 is a decision not just for
this Government but for the next Government. This is not a
party-political point, and I understand that HS2 has cross-party
support on the Front Benches, so it is important that we send a message
from the west country that, unless there is a commitment to fully fund 
<?notus-xml column=117?>an alternative or additional route, we will not support the Bill on
Second Reading. Although we are talking about hundreds of millions of
pounds, it is crumbs off the table compared with the money anticipated
for the HS2 project. I am not against HS2, but now is the time for the
far south-west to have a slice of the action. We have been putting up
with a second-class rail service for far too

also have to consider a complementary line that would potentially make
it much faster to get from Plymouth and Cornwall up to London. We
already have a second line that comes from Exeter up to Waterloo; it

a loop at Honiton, which would help. We also ought to consider
twin-tracking the railway all the way down from London to Exeter
because that would give us a line to
Exeter<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:14:32"></hs_TimeCode>.

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:18:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
is right about the need for good repairs. The county councils naturally
argue that a major repair is much more expensive than just filling a
pothole, but she is right that it is a pointless exercise if all the

also welcome the Prime Minister’s pledge of £5,000 grants

detail on how people can claim that money? It is always great when the

the Somerset levels, it has been said that raising the railway line
across the moors would cost £200 million. There is
one solution to ensure that that railway line does not flood, and that
is a sluice at the end of the river Parrett to stop the sea from coming
in. At the moment, the sea comes in and drives the fresh water back,
and that is what keeps the moors flooded. I cannot guarantee that the
sluice would mean that the moors never flooded again, but a tidal
sluice on the end of the Parrett, north of Bridgwater, could mean that
the depth of water on the moors would not be enough to flood the
railway line.</hs_Para>

arithmetic, it would cost £200 million to raise the railway line
and that will never happen. I reckon that a sluice across the Parrett
would cost some £50 million and if hydroelectric power was put
there as well, the project would start to show its worth. It would 
<?notus-xml column=119?>help farmers, properties and nature conservation. When there is water
over the whole Somerset levels for six to eight weeks, there is nothing
left when the water recedes. There will not be the lovely flora and
fauna or reeds and rushes that everybody wants,
because it will all have rotted. Then there is the farmland, what has
happened to people’s property and the stock that has had to be
moved across the moors. We have to look at the situation
seriously.</hs_Para>

great benefit of having a sluice across the River Parrett is that the
water could be penned in during the summer and the area could be made
like a mini Norfolk broads. That would bring the benefits of  a
huge tourist attraction. Devon and Cornwall need a railway line, but we
have to cross Somerset to get there, and we need to consider that. I
know that the right hon. Member for Exeter does not like dredging and
all those things, but they must be part of the armoury. We can hold
water in certain places and further upstream, but in the end rivers
such as the Parrett and Tone silt up, and without dredging we will not
get the water away fast enough.</hs_Para>

management of those waterways has to be much more local, and that is
where inland drainage boards can do a lot more. We might need more
drainage boards. Will the Minister consider that? We might, dare I say
it, have to get people living in houses further up the catchment area
to pay a small amount, because their water is flowing down and flooding
the lowland areas. There are ways of raising money, which will help.
Local management would be so much
better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000095"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Bradshaw" PimsId="2260" UID="14022675000134" xid="62" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000134">Mr

reduced flood risk on the Somerset levels and elsewhere in low-lying
areas would massively outweigh that expenditure. Is it not better to
pay farmers to do that, rather than to graze the uplands intensively,
which is sadly sometimes the
case?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022675000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000096"><B><Member ContinuationText="Neil Parish" PimsId="4943" UID="14022675000135" xid="1159" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022675000135">Neil
Parish:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman raises an interesting
point. It is part of the solution, and we have to look at how land is
managed and how farmers are paid. At the moment, farmers are paid for
loss of income. We should say, “If you are going to hold that
water and that will reduce flooding, you should be paid to manage that
water.” In the end, that would probably be a much cheaper
option.</hs_Para>

including road and rail, and let us look at maintaining our coastline.
Let us look at having, in the Somerset moors, the south-west and the
country, pads and pipes where we could put in these massive mobile
pumps that the Dutch have. We could have Dutch pumps in Sedgemoor and
they could be 
<?notus-xml column=120?>moved around the country. Rather than having millions and millions of
pounds invested in one pumping station, let us spend a few million
pounds on portable pumps and the necessary infrastructure to connect
those pumps wherever they are. We can import the pumps from Holland and
have them ourselves. That is key.</hs_Para>

learn lessons. A lowland area has to be pumped fast. We should stop the
tide from going up the Parrett so that we can fill it with fresh water.
Then, when the tide goes down, we can let it out. There are lots of
practical solutions. We have suffered and people still are suffering.
We can never guarantee that flooding will never happen again, but we
can reduce it. I will stop there, because I know that my hon. Friend

on the island of Portland. It is still there, I am glad to report, but
there were moments when people considered abandoning some of the homes,
because the sea had risen by some 60 feet, I would guess. If one goes
to the Cove House inn—the pub faces the storm—and looks
at the sea when it is benign, it is hard to imagine that it can come in
through the pub’s top window. The two wonderful landladies,
Jackie Breakspear and Amanda Broughton-South, withstood and held firm,
despite the best that the sea could throw at
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000004">Before

to the Environment Agency and the local authorities, which did a
wonderful job, but I pay particular tribute to the Royal Engineers. The
sea came over the top of Chesil beach and deposited about 16
tonnes of pebbles by the Little Ship pub. The question that every MP
dreads asking when we go into these situations is, “Can I
help?” The landlady, Lynda Davis, said, “Yes, Richard,
you can actually. You can remove 16 tonnes of pebbles.” I had
this horrific image of spending the rest of my time before the general

him, “You have got all this kit. I would be most grateful if you

“Sir! No problem. We will get that done.” Within two
days, 16 tonnes of pebbles had been removed. What was even more
astonishing was that that young officer told me that his grandfather

her name is Storm Wallace. The 
<?notus-xml column=121?>young lady went on the internet and within days she had 300 people on a

concentration has been to a large extent on people and their homes, and
rightly so, as well as on the farmers who have lost acres and acres

living at sea. I am indebted to Andy Alcock, who is the secretary of
the Weymouth and Portland Licensed Fishermen’s and
Boatmen’s Association. He has armed me with a lot of the

himself, with two boats and six employees in the high season. He told

this time of year, the milder conditions in Weymouth’s
microclimate might allow bass fishing to continue throughout Christmas
and even new year. Netting for sole, cod and plaice continues
throughout the winter months. On average, a Weymouth fisherman can
count on being able to put to sea for three in every 10 days in
December, January and February. This winter, since December 14, they
have been able to fish for only five days. On other occasions, after
spending three and a half hours getting to the fishing grounds, the
appalling conditions have forced them to return. The result: no fish
and no
income.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000012">On
a good day, a fisherman might earn between £100 and
£150. On a bad day, the take is much lower, and of course on
many of the days it is nil. However, it is extremely rare that two
entire months should pass without any earnings at all. Inevitably, the
consequent loss of earnings has eaten into fishermen’s savings
and is causing great
difficulties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000013">The
loss and destruction of expensive equipment has made recovering from
such a dip in income even more difficult. Static gear such as lobster
pots, crab pots, whelk pots and fixed nets have been particularly
vulnerable because owners have been unable to reach them. Last week,
fishermen were finally able to go out and count their losses. Gary
Chard, skipper and owner of the “Gordeano Star”, has
spent the six days he has been to sea since December 18 finding and
repairing his equipment. He told me that of the 36 strings that he
fishes, only 21 have been found. Some have moved more than a
mile, and finding them has necessitated huge sweeps of possible
locations. Each string is valued at £2,000, making Mr
Chard’s equipment losses alone about
£30,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000014">Mr
Alcock told me of another of his members who makes a living by tending
18 strings of lobster pots, using a small 18-foot Plymouth pilot boat
in the inshore 
<?notus-xml column=122?>waters around Weymouth. Following the recent storms, the lobsterman
found only five of his strings in place. Two more are stuck under the
Lulworth ledges and need a diver to retrieve. The rest have gone. Most
will be found, eventually, but that could take months, and it is likely
that many of the strings will be wound around other nets and lines.
Most will be
unusable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000015">Yet,
in the interim, that man must earn a living. Self-employed, the
fishermen are not covered by the usual welfare safety nets. Mr Chard
told me that British fishermen will soon be an endangered group. He
asked whether the Government could consider loan grants, using the
valuable fishing licences attached to British registered fishing boats
as security—a question I pose to the Minister.</hs_Para>

would urge the Minister to look kindly on applications from fishermen
to the business hardship funds, which I understand are to be
administered by local authorities. However, it is not clear where the
money is, who is going to dish it out physically, how someone gets
it—do they write or telephone in?—and how much they are
going to get. I think I saw in one press release that the average
amount would be £2,500, which clearly will not cover the vast
costs that the people in the charter and fishing business have
incurred. I would be most grateful if the Minister clarified exactly
what the situation is.</hs_Para>

money is tight, but £10 million is nothing—really
nothing—to cover the vast costs that the businesses have
incurred. When businesses are allowed to apply for the funds, exactly
who will qualify? I can see that farmers will; they have been in all
the press releases. The Liberal Democrat leader, having been down to
the south-west, issued a press release that included fishermen, which I
was relieved to see. I have not seen charter boat crews included, but I
assume—perhaps the Minister will confirm this—that they
will be, because they have to go out and make a living but have not
been able to. Some clarity on that important point would be most
appreciated.</hs_Para>

Swanage beach is crucial for our town. The whole of our tourism
industry is to a large extent based around the beach, because it
attracts hundreds of thousands of people down to a beautiful part of
the world. The town council has spent £2 million to recover the
beach and prepare it for the summer. Will the Government consider
helping us here? That is a vast sum of money, which the town council
simply cannot afford, despite the low interest rates. I would be
grateful if the Minister imparted some information
today.</hs_Para>

that the Government have failed to take  the risk of flooding
in the UK seriously—right from the moment they first came into
office, when they cut the flood defence budget in 2010. The Labour
Government had left a budget of £670 million. After the
election, the coalition partners agreed to reduce the 2010-11 budget to
just £573 million. The figures for each year since then have
been £576 million for 2012-13 and £577 million for
2013-14. The Government have budgeted for £615 million for
2014-15. Over the four-year spending period, this Government will have
spent just £2.34 billion on flood defences, compared with the

figures are not the ones that the Prime Minister used two weeks ago at
Prime Minister’s Question Time, but they are the ones set out
clearly by the independent Committee on Climate Change in its policy
note. They are also the ones used by the House of Commons Library in
its briefing on flood defence spending in England, and the ones set out
just yesterday by the UK Statistics Authority, which says that the
Government have cut £247 million in real terms from the floods
budget. Those figures can be corroborated on the Department’s

course, the Prime Minister has now said that he will spend whatever it
takes, but the people of the south-west of England will think that it
might have been better to spend whatever it took to prevent the
tragedy, rather than to pay to mop up the mess afterwards. It is
important to be clear that the additional funding is expected to be a
temporary boost from the Department’s contingency reserves and
will primarily be spent on repairing and reinstating defences damaged

damaged defences will not protect more homes and businesses. Ministers
must be clear on that. Those who have seen their homes and businesses
flooded and cut off over the past few months deserve clarity from

urgent repairs, but Ministers must not suggest that that alters the

hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), the shadow

to the south-west in 2013, failed to materialise in the autumn
statement. More importantly, why was it subsequently re-announced this
year as if it were new funding? That seems to be another example of
deliberate obfuscation by the Government, who again and again put
rhetoric before reality.
Will<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:43:32"></hs_TimeCode> the
Minister update the House on what consideration the Government have
given to the Opposition proposals for easing overcrowding in the
south-west and ensuring that more passengers reach their destination?
The Government should require all train operators to declassify
first-class carriages in the event of delays or cancellations due to
severe weather. When will that be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:43:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000033">Perhaps
the most worrying thing of all is the Government’s apparent
reluctance to accept and act on climate science. The Met Office has
made it clear that such extreme weather events as there have been are
likely only to become more severe and more frequent. Has the Secretary
of State still refused to entertain a briefing from his chief
scientific adviser on climate science?</hs_Para>

own views on the record? Does he accept the climate change risk
analysis prepared by his own officials, which estimates that 1 million
properties may be at serious risk of flooding by 2020? That is an
increase on the current figure of 370,000. The 1 million estimate
includes 800,000 homes. If he accepts it, will he tell us whether his
Department’s flood insurance proposals under Flood Re take
account of the additional properties? The Committee on Climate Change

is the Minister doing to ensure that the Environment Agency is notified
of the decisions made in all planning applications where it has lodged
an objection on the grounds of flood risk? At the moment, he will be
aware that in one third of all such cases the local authority fails to
notify the EA of the outcome. The suspicion is that local authorities
that refuse an application are happy to notify the agency that they
have taken its advice, but are less keen to report back to it when they
have ignored it. The Minister cannot expect the EA to prepare adequate
flood defences if it is not notified when properties are built in a
flood risk area against its express
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:45:51"></hs_TimeCode>. It

what is the Minister doing with his colleagues in DEFRA to ensure that
proper catchment management plans and shoreline management plans make
better use of natural processes? Land management plays a vital 
<?notus-xml column=126?>role, and the retention of flood water upstream through woodland and
ground cover in the uplands is every  bit as important as
dredging in the lower levels of the catchment. Landowners
will always seek to dredge the river as it passes through their land.
That is the quickest way to try to ensure that their own land is not
flooded and the problem is passed downstream, but under a proper
catchment management plan it may be considered better to flood
agricultural land upstream than to endanger an entire village at lower
levels.  That integrated approach was recommended in the
Pitt  review under recommendation 27. When will that most
important element of flood risk management be properly
implemented<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T10:47:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000038">I

storms on communities in our part of the world. I sympathise with
residents who face serious difficulties. As we have heard, businesses,
farms and fishing have been severely affected, and so, crucially, have
transport links. As the country starts to recover from a lengthy
onslaught of stormy weather, I express my condolences to those who have

the start of December 2013, the UK has experienced a prolonged period
of very bad weather. In England and Wales it was the wettest January
since 1766. Met Office statistics suggest that for the south of England
it has been one of the most exceptional periods for winter
rainfall—if not the most exceptional—in at least 248
years. The latest estimates suggest that more than 6,800 properties
have been flooded in England since the beginning of December 2013,
including more than 2,000 since the most recent event began in early
February. In addition, more than 48,000 hectares of farmland are
thought to have been
affected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000042">In
the south-west, about 550 properties flooded and, in particular, there
is continued flooding on the Somerset levels and significant damage to
vital railway infrastructure. Investment by Government and improvements
to the way in which we respond to incidents, however, mean that we have
been able to protect about 1.3 million properties since the start of
December, of which 93,000 are in the south-west. That reinforces the
importance of continuing our investment in flood defence schemes and
forecasting capability.</hs_Para>

right hon. Gentleman made an important point on capital investment. As
a Liberal Democrat, I am supportive of the coalition
Government’s investment in infrastructure across a whole range
of areas, including rail investment. I am a supporter of High Speed 2,
as well as of the investment we are getting on the sleeper service in
the south-west, among other things—I am always a fan of more
investment of the south-west. The Government have invested huge amounts
of capital in infrastructure. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh South
West (Mr Darling), who led on such matters as Chancellor going into the
previous general election, set out what would have happened if a Labour
Government had been re-elected. He spoke of 50% reductions in capital
investment in the following years. Therefore, as my hon. Friend the
Member for South West Devon (Mr Streeter) said, we should
not set against what this Government have done any idea that there
would have been a huge increase in spending under Labour—there
simply would not have
been.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000048">On
maintenance, there is an idea that the efficiencies implemented by the
Environment Agency might have affected the readiness of the defences.
Those defences, in which we and all Governments have invested over many
years, were in a condition that enabled them to defend those
properties, but obviously we need to look at where further flood
defences could provide protection on a cost-benefit basis so that we
can get the best value for such investment. That is why I am pleased we
could announce £344 million in the coming financial year in
investment in new defences, as well as the £130 million
announced to ensure that we get our existing defences back up to where
they need to be following recent
events.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lilian Greenwood" PimsId="5568" UID="14022676000114" xid="1117" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000114">Lilian

difficult to draw direct links as a result of particular events, but we
can look at trends and the changes that are happening, the advice from
the Met Office in recent weeks about weather patterns over the Atlantic
and so on, and what has driven them. That gives us cause for concern
and I am personally convinced that there is a man-made element to such

We have heard the concerns of the National Farmers Union. We do not

take seriously the huge potential to do more to retain water through
land management, but, on dredging, the Somerset levels is a man-made
environment. Those rivers do not function in the same way as many other
catchments, because they have been raised above the level of the
surrounding land, as well as redirected and rerouted. We are looking at
maintenance and I am chairing the action group on the Somerset levels,
which the Secretary of State has challenged to come up with the action
plan. Some will be long-term issues, but others will be for the short
term. We have already announced that dredging will take place this year
to deal with this. The point about the barrier for the River Parrett is
a good one. The barrier will allow better management for the Tone and
the Parrett and that whole catchment. That work is under

elected, my first priority was the future of the Jaguar plant, which
was doomed to close. I worked with Tata Motors and the new management,

Jaguar Land Rover become a world-class success story, with the Jaguar

needs to expand, so Jaguar bought the land on which the Dunlop factory
is located. Dunlop could have bought that land but declined so to do. A
year ago, therefore, we swung into action and engaged with the company,
with Birmingham city council and with the Homes and Communities Agency.
I thank Sir Albert Bore, the leader of the council, and the Homes and

July Sir Albert Bore wrote to Dunlop, saying that there was sufficient
land available at a competitive price and that the council would assist
with a package to aid relocation of the factory. There was no answer.
In parallel, I met senior management of the company three times over a
nine-month period, together with the unions representing the work
force, the GMB and Unite. On each occasion I asked whether the company
would agree to look at alternatives in Birmingham. There was no
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000069">In
November I wrote to the global chief executive of Goodyear, Rich
Kramer, who is based in Ohio in the United States of America, and
asked, “Would you look at alternatives for remaining in
Birmingham?” There was no answer. I then approached Jaguar Land
Rover, and asked whether it would be prepared to extend Dunlop’s
lease to allow Dunlop time to build a new factory and relocate. Jaguar
Land Rover said to me, “Jack, we can’t get an

three months. There was still no answer from Dunlop.</hs_Para>

the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills to
intervene, and he did so. I cannot praise him too highly for the steps
that he took. He convened an urgent meeting with the chair of Goodyear
Dunlop in Britain and Ireland, Erich Fric, on 30 January. Seven times I
had to ask, “Will you look at options to remain in
Birmingham?” The first six times, there was no answer.
Eventually, on the seventh occasion, the chief executive said,
“Yes, we will.” The Business Secretary pushed the button
straight away for a meeting, which took place the following day,
between civil servants from the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills, Birmingham city council, the Homes and
Communities Agency and UK Trade &amp; Investment. The people at that
meeting identified three proposals for Dunlop to relocate in
Birmingham, and said that they would put together a package to assist
that relocation.</hs_Para>

scheduled with Dunlop for the following Friday. We thought that at last
it was going to do the decent thing and look at alternatives. However,
but four days after that meeting, on 3 February Goodyear Dunlop
announced its intention to cease manufacturing in Birmingham. In my 40
years in the world of work, I cannot remember any employer acting with
such cavalier contempt towards a loyal and long-standing work force. A
decision had been made 3,600 miles away, in Ohio, when the factory
could have moved but 3 miles and remained in Birmingham.</hs_Para>

also been expressed by the reputable Dunlop, Dunlop Aircraft Tyres. Its
factory is also  in my constituency, and is mercifully no
longer owned by Goodyear. It has issued a press statement, and its
chairman, Ian Edmondson, could not be clearer: whatever Goodyear does
with the motorsport factory, Dunlop Aircraft Tyres is committed to
Birmingham, will invest in Birmingham and will grow its business in
Birmingham—what a contrast with Goodyear Dunlop motorsports. I
thank him for what he has said and done. I also thank the <I>Birmingham

has been expressed in those ways, but what has been particularly
heartbreaking is the dismay expressed by the work force. I will quote

cast aside like a spare penny is heartbreaking and gut wrenching. I
feel physically sick writing this, but feel our voices and our
perspective of the situation have not been heard. I drove home today
and pulled up on my driveway not even remembering how I got here. My
brain is doing somersaults, not sure I’ll sleep tonight knowing
I’ve got to get up at 5:00 and somehow drag myself back to the
place that used to feed and clothe my family. A place I used to be
proud to say I worked. A place that no longer

have had so many other approaches of that kind, including one from a
daughter who was absolutely distraught about her father. He is in his

speak briefly about Dunlop’s relationship and importance to
Britain’s motor sport industry. It is an industry in which we
lead the world with eight of the 11 Formula 1 teams based in the UK,
and Dunlop has been part of that industry. The premier motor racing
championship in the UK is the British touring car championship, which
is sponsored by Dunlop. It is a proud partner and we are proud to have
it as a partner in that championship. However, although Formula 1 
<?notus-xml column=133?>and the British touring car championship are at the top of the motor
sport tree in the UK, no tree is healthy if its roots are not healthy.
Dunlop has been and is important to the grass roots of motor sport
because the specialist tyres that are produced in Birmingham are vital
to that series
continuing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000085">In
a former life, I did some motor sport with the 750 motor
club, which was typical of the grass-roots motor sport scene in the UK.
Its championships often rely on Dunlop tyres. If Dunlop leaves the UK,
will those specialist tyres that are manufactured on a small scale
continue to be manufactured here? I hope they will, but there is doubt
about that, and I am not the  only one to have that doubt.
Steve Neal, managing director of Rimstock plc, a winning team in the
British touring car championship—the Honda works team—has
voiced precisely those fears if Dunlop departs from
Birmingham.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022676000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#14022676000086">Echoing
my hon. Friend, I too appeal to Dunlop and Goodyear. If they continue
to support the motor sport industry, which has been good for their
company and  its profile, as well as its tyres being important
to the industry, why are they leaving Birmingham? Alternative sites
have been offered, and three have been developed in detail. There is
even a site at Longbridge in my constituency if they prefer that. There
are all sorts of options for Dunlop, so why leave the epicentre of the

automotive sector is a big opportunity for a future with great

24 November last year, the world woke up to the news that a deal had
been reached between the permanent five members of the UN Security
Council plus one—the UK, the US, France, China, Russia and
Germany—and Iran. A joint plan of action was the outcome of
weeks of hard negotiation. The deal was revealed to be the fruit of
years of US-Iran secret negotiations, alongside a decade of public
Iranian diplomacy following the revelation of a wide-scale uranium
enrichment programme. The P5 plus 1 countries and Iran concluded an
interim six-month agreement, known as a joint plan of action, to
restrain Iran’s nuclear programme, in exchange for limited
sanctions
relief<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>. The deal
is the interim first step towards a full agreement within six months to
address comprehensively the international community’s long-held
concerns that Iran’s nuclear programme is intended for military
purposes. The agreement will be in effect for six
months—it started on 20 January this year—during which
time the P5 plus 1 powers will attempt to forge a conclusive,
final-status agreement that will end the nuclear
impasse<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#140226104000007">We—or
certainly I—have concerns about the agreement. I should start by
saying that the interim nuclear agreement does not resolve
international suspicions. It merely suspends some of the most
immediately concerning aspects of Iran’s programme, pending a
more comprehensive agreement. However, there are further serious
concerns about the agreement. Some believe that it grants Iran exactly
what it wanted—both a significant easing of sanctions and
preservation of the most significant parts of its nuclear programme,
including those with a military
aspect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:32:19"></hs_TimeCode>. The
agreement allows Iran to continue enriching uranium and retain all the
centrifuges, and it is not required to dismantle the uncompleted heavy
water research reactor at Arak, which has the potential to produce
plutonium when completed. In effect, the agreement allows a plan B
route for nuclear weapons in that

the pressure on Iran’s economy in return for minimal concessions

the number of executions in Tehran and Iran in January last year was

me return to the Foreign Secretary’s statement on Monday. What

summing up the debate, can answer at least three specific concerns,
including, first, how Iran’s nuclear programme, which includes a
military dimension, will be addressed, as the interim agreement fails
to address it. Secondly, I would be interested to learn what
reassurances he can give that the final agreement will address the
technical aspects of Iran’s nuclear programme, including the
dismantling of all existing advanced centrifuges that accelerate
breakout time; whether the International Atomic Energy Agency
inspectors will be granted unfettered access to all Iran’s
nuclear facilities, including those that are being operated secretly;
and what will happen to Iran’s existing stockpile of 3.5%
enriched
uranium<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#140226104000023">Thirdly,
what assurances can the Government give that the interim agreement will
not simply unravel the international sanctions that have been imposed
and that took years to be introduced, giving rise to a perception in
the country that Iran is being rewarded for coming to the negotiating
table while continuing to inflame tensions in the whole middle east,
specifically in Lebanon, Syria and Israel, and while procrastinating on
the fundamental issue of advances in its nuclear
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:39:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#140226104000024">Before
we get to that point, I want to take a few moments to outline
Iran’s nuclear programme and the problems I anticipate. It is
widely believed that Iran’s nuclear programme has significantly
advanced in the past five years. Continuing to defy international
pressure and binding UN Security Council resolutions, Iran has actively
enriched uranium to 20% fissile purity—a level that has no
credible civilian purpose. Without any additional sanctions being
imposed, Iran has been able to continue producing uranium enriched to
90% purity, which brings it closer to weapons grade. The most difficult
and 
<?notus-xml column=138?>time-consuming part of the nuclear process is, therefore, already
complete. The IAEA estimates that Iran now has 9,000 kg of low-enriched
uranium, an amount that experts say could be enough for four bombs if
it was refined to 90% fissile
concentration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#140226104000025">Iran<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T14:49:41"></hs_TimeCode>
also possesses as many as 18,000 centrifuges, including more than 1,000
new models—the IR2m—which are far more efficient and can
provide bomb-grade uranium two and a half times faster than the
previous model. A heavy water reactor has been constructed outside the
city of Arak, which offers the possibility of a new pathway to a bomb
using plutonium once it goes online. That is in addition to the Natanz
uranium enrichment facility, which was built in secret and discovered

Iran’s agreement to freeze the enrichment and halt the

inspections at Natanz, Arak and Fordow. I acknowledge that the regime
has granted the international community some concessions. We must be
aware, however, that in return, the P5 plus 1 agreed to provide
£6 billion to £7 billion in sanctions relief, of which
roughly £4.2 billion would be oil revenue frozen in foreign

disproportionate sanctions relief in exchange for cosmetic concessions
that it can do away with in a matter of weeks. It has been rewarded
with sanctions relief despite remaining unbowed in its demand to
continue uranium enrichment, which is the root of the international
community’s concern. Most importantly, the deal fails to
dismantle many of the military aspects of Iran’s nuclear

January, Iran’s Parliament introduced a Bill to step up

would put Iran on the technical verge of 90% fissile purity, which is
enough for the core of a nuclear bomb. At least 218 of the Iranian
Parliament’s 290 members have expressed support for the measure.
The Bill’s supporters say that uranium refined to 60%
concentration would be used to fuel nuclear-powered submarines. Some
analysts have speculated that the Iranian Government might be using
Parliament as a bargaining tool in nuclear talks with the P5 plus 1,
because they would have no choice but to obey such a Bill if the

advanced IR2m centrifuges, which can speed up break-out times using
3.5% enriched uranium. This month, Iran revealed that it had developed
a new generation of centrifuges that are 15 times more powerful than
those currently in use, and Iranian officials have stated that the
centrifuges do not violate the joint plan of action. Although
enrichment using those machines has not started, the vast majority of
them are fully installed and under vacuum, which means that Iran could

there is limited peaceful civilian purpose. When it is operational,
that facility at Arak will be able to produce plutonium, which is one

heavy water to the site. It also agreed not to produce or test
additional fuel or install remaining components. The interim deal does
not explicitly prevent Iran from manufacturing components offsite for
Arak’s nuclear reactor that could then be installed later. Iran
claims that its purpose is only to make medical isotopes and conduct
research, but western countries believe that it could also produce
plutonium, which is the plan B route to producing a full nuclear

one mechanism we held over Iran was the sanctions, but the interim deal
has unravelled the internationally imposed sanction regime that has
taken years to enforce. Sanctions were having the desired effect, so
why did we 
<?notus-xml column=141?>take a step back from a method that was working and put trust in a state
that has given us no reason to assume that that trust will be guarded?
However limited, the relaxation of sanctions will relieve the pressure
that has brought Iran to seek an agreement, by giving direct financial
relief and indirectly restoring confidence in the Iranian
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#140226104000044">Many
nations and companies—as well as the Iranians
themselves—have interpreted the recent agreement as the
beginning of the end of the sanctions regime. It is likely that a
number of countries will apply pressure to resume trade with Iran,
including its former key trade partners, such as South Korea, Japan,
India and China. Within weeks of the interim deal, Iran’s
petrochemical sector alone had appreciated by $9 billion—that is
a capital gain of almost 40%, generated entirely by a new market
psychology that bets on the end of sanctions. On top of that, Iran is
already making efforts to recapture its dominant role in
OPEC.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#140226104000045">All
of that goes to ensure that the agreement is rewarding Iran despite the
fact that its long history of clandestine nuclear activities, support
for international terrorism and repeat calls for the destruction of
Israel are cause for legitimate trepidation and scepticism over its
intentions. Although President Rouhani’s negotiating team has
reportedly been more constructive in talks, supreme leader Ayatollah
Khamenei has the final say on major issues, including national security
and Iran’s nuclear programme. Most worryingly, Iran continues to
support terrorism in the region. It is a leading sponsor of state
terrorism, providing financial and material support to extremist
Islamist terrorist groups across the middle east, including Hamas,
Hezbollah and insurgencies against allied forces in Iraq and
Afghanistan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0001.htm#140226104000046">Iran
agreed to the deal as part of a long history of exploiting
international talks to buy time and further advance its nuclear

extended by a further six months by mutual consent. President Rouhani

required to provide unfettered access to its full portfolio of nuclear

activities to which my hon. Friend just referred. It has successfully
test-fired two new domestically made missiles, including a long-range
ballistic missile with radar-evading capabilities and a fragmentation
warhead. It also test fired a laser-guided air-to-surface and
surface-to-surface missile known as a Bina. The country already has
long-range surface-to-surface Shahab missiles with a range of about
1,250 miles that are capable of reaching Israel

structures appear to be in place should Iran walk away from
negotiations with the P5 plus 1 before a permanent nuclear deal is

procrastination over its nuclear programme, would the Minister agree

the Minister understand why many of us think Israel should be concerned
about the agreement? There are also concerns that the joint plan of
action has green-lighted Iran’s right to enrich, or at least
that it has done so according to Iranian interpretations. Iranian state
media carried boasts by President Rouhani and his Foreign Minister that
the international community had caved in. What assessment has the

do not suggest that it is complying fully with the spirit of the joint

centrifuges, which further reduce break-out times, raises questions as

full portfolio of centrifuges. Would the Minister agree that any final
agreement must seek to dismantle the bulk of Iran’s nuclear
infrastructure? The interim agreement is undoubtedly asymmetrical in
structure, with Iran merely freezing its programme while the
international community chips away at sanctions. Does the Minister
agree that that might influence whether Iran decides to abandon
negotiations for a comprehensive deal over the next six months?
Finally, does the Minister share my concern that the joint plan of
action will result in billions of pounds of financial relief for Iran,

fear and persecution, Rouhani sent good-will messages to Iranian
Christians via Twitter and greetings to the Roman Catholic pope.
However, those overtures came against reports of arrests, raids on

persecution—I want to highlight them today—as well as
Protestant evangelicals. There is relatively less pressure on the
historical ethnic Armenian and Assyrian Christian minority, as long as
they do not evangelise to Muslims. Therefore, if people just worship
and do nothing else, they will be left alone, but if they want to tell
others about the gospel, which is what it means to be evangelical and
to be a Christian, they are threatened for that. Ethnic Persians are by
definition Muslim, according to the state. Evangelism, Bible training
and publishing the scriptures in Farsi are all illegal. What a contrast
that is from our society and the freedom of religious individual
thought that we have in this

Muslim who leaves Islam faces the death penalty. The regime’s
focus is on those reaching out to converts, and even well established
Christian denominations are not safe from harassment. Church activities
are closely monitored, their members identified and taken note of.
Often, action is taken as well. Again, the words that say, “Yes,
you are safe. You can worship your God and go to church” have to

my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, is so concerned in exporting
terrorism and aggression throughout the region. It has a history of
doing that in many parts of the region—most of all, at the
moment, in the Syrian conflict. The Iranian regime is a key linchpin of
Bashar al-Assad in his efforts to fight back against the Syrian
opposition. The Iranian regime is the pillar for Bashar al-Assad as he
goes into action and counter-attacks the Iranian opposition. We know
that during the four years of the conflict, thousands of Iranian,
Lebanese and Iraqi Shi’a militiamen have been sent into Syria to
help Bashar al-Assad, and Iran has been helping to send them there.
There is no doubt about it. It is widely believed that the Iranian
regime has been responsible for the successes that Syria has had,

was reported at the weekend that Iran is stepping up its support for
Bashar al-Assad, providing elite teams to gather intelligence and train

Assad feels no need to make concessions at the currently deadlocked
talks in Geneva, because he thinks that things are going his way with
the support that he is receiving from Iran. It therefore looks slightly
strange for Baroness Ashton to be going to Iran to fly the flag when
talks with Iran about its nuclear position are taking place in Vienna,

terrible persecution. They are thrown into prison, their homes are

situation would change with the election of President Rouhani, but, for
whatever reason—whether he is sending mixed messages or whether
he is being undercut by conflict within the regime—there is no
relaxation as far as the Christians are concerned. They are still
languishing in prison for their faith, and in recent times we have
heard terrible reports of four Christians being sentenced to 80 lashes

one, but there can be little doubt that Iran is seeking to acquire such
a capability. The rest of the international community think that. Why

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:30:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hendon (Dr Offord) on securing this debate. Iran is a
topic that often needs a good airing. At this critical time, it is
important that we give strong scrutiny to the Geneva accord agreed at
the end of last

may I declare my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial
Interests? I am chairman of the all-party group on Iran and have been
for the past eight years. I have twice visited Iran—including
recently, three or four weeks ago. I have also visited on a number of
occasions the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna at the
United
Nations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:30:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000093">We
always have to go back to the beginning on Iran. We have to remember
that the nuclear programme for Iran did not start last Tuesday or last
year; in fact, it started in the mid-1960s, when the Shah was in
charge—funded by the United States, ironically. General Electric
came to its aid, to develop the first reactor in the heart of Tehran.
Iran has had nuclear ambitions, whether civil or military, for decades.
They have been part of its psyche. It lives in a rough neighbourhood;
it has rivalries that we can, perhaps, only understand as having
similar aspects to those in the cold war and with the Soviet Union; and
it is surrounded by ethnically and religiously different economic and
military rivals. That has often driven some of its
insecurities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:31:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000094">The
history of the nuclear programme is long and sporadic and it has
jumped, depending on which country has helped Iran. The Russians helped
it build a reactor in the past, the United States has done so and I
suspect that the North Koreans have, too. Certainly, other members of
the international community have stuck their oars in. That is why there
is a rather illogical, sporadic and often bizarre civil nuclear
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:32:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000095">Iran
is not the only country in that region to have a civil nuclear
programme. The United Arab Emirates is developing one right now, as we
speak. Many middle east countries have sought to acquire nuclear
technology. The most striking examples are India and Pakistan, which
developed in total secrecy a nuclear weapons programme that ended up in
actual nuclear weapons. We in the west either chose not to know or did
not seem to
know<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:32:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000096">The
process goes on. It is not new. It has, unfortunately, become entwined
with the Iranian psyche and its view of itself in the world. However,
let us remember that middle east politics is often as much about
rhetoric as about action. Throughout the 1980s, for example, at the
height of Ayatollah Khomeini’s rhetoric against the 
<?notus-xml column=149?>country of Israel, Israel sold Iran nearly half a
billion dollars’ worth of arms. In fact, Israel broke the UN
sanctions on arms embargo to Iran and Iraq in that period. It suited
Israel at that stage to ignore the rhetoric and to side with Iran
against Iraq, while the west was unfortunately supporting Iraq, by
supplying it with some pretty dubious
methods<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:33:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000097">We
have to go forward. In 2001, Iran helped the west bring down the
Taliban. We might remember the Lion of Panjshir, Ahmad Shah Massoud,
who was the west’s favoured leader of the Northern
Alliance—the man who was going to liberate
Afghanistan on our behalf. The irony was that he was Iran’s man
in Afghanistan. The Northern Alliance helped America and Britain in
their targeting and intelligence gathering against the
Taliban.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000098">Throughout
these processes, Iran has stepped forward, sometimes against its
nature, but sometimes for its own self-interest, and it has often been
rewarded by immediate rejection. The “axis of evil”
phrase was used in relation to Iran, despite its assistance to the
British and Americans in getting rid of the
Taliban<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:34:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000099">Trust
is the problem in much of this, whether in respect of the nuclear
programme, human rights or exporting terrorism. The Iranians’
knowledge of Britain’s poor behaviour towards it in the last
centuries is better than mine. The Iranians understand that we
supported the constitutional revolution in 1906 and then undermined it,
when we removed the democratic constitutional revolution, to put in a
Shah, and then we moved that Shah when he became too friendly with the
Nazis. Then we moved their Prime Minister in the 50s and put in another
Shah. They understand that we—the United Kingdom—play
power games and that we are not to be trusted, in the same way that we,
quite rightly, have every reason not to trust Iran in the near
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:34:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000100">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>
have not trusted Iran on its nuclear programme. It has hidden things
and has certainly done its best. There is proof that, in 2003 and 2002,
it acquired from the AQ Khan network—not funded by Iran, but by
one of its regional rivals—military plans for a weapons
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000101">Trust<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:35:22"></hs_TimeCode>
is failing on both sides. That has been the real issue. I do not argue
with my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:35:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Hendon that, really, at the heart of the Geneva
accord, the issue is about trying to fix this trust and to see what
steps we can take to build together. We will have to stick our neck out
to build that trust. That is the problem. I understand; if I was living
in Israel right now, I would be worried about that. It is not me under
direct threat from Iran.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:36:01"></hs_TimeCode> fact, British
national interests and British security are not threatened by
Shi’a Islam, but by Salafist Sunnis emanating from al-Qaeda.
They are the people who will blow up our trains and tube stations. That
is nothing to do with Iran; that is to do with other major players in
the region, who are either tacit or have yet to deal with that
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:36:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000102">If
I was in Israel, of course I would be worried and rightly so. But I
also recognise that, within Israel, there is a split about the extent
to which the Iranians are rational and irrational and how much Iran
really wants to do nuclear damage or blow up Israel. Meir Dagan, the
ex-head of Mossad—not a boy scout organisation—said on
the record that Iran is rational and that he does not think it intends
to go to that next
step.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000103">Nevertheless,
the situation is real and we should look at the facts and the evidence
as they are presented. The first things that I look at are the national
intelligence 
<?notus-xml column=150?>estimates of the United States, the first of which,
in 2007, was made under George Bush. The estimates are put together by
the National Security Council, the CIA and the Pentagon. President Bush
was not known as a dove on any areas in the middle east, but the
national intelligence estimate produced at the time said, “We do
not believe—we believe they did previously—that they are
now on the verge of a break-out”. That is an important
document<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:37:10"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
dismissed at the time by the hawks, but in 2012, under President Obama,
another one appeared that effectively reaffirmed that national
intelligence

Offord:</Member></B> I appreciate my hon. Friend’s counter-view
on some of these issues. It is easy to talk about organisations
presenting reports. I have found the 2012 Institute for Science and
International Security report, containing information from former
weapons inspectors, who disagreed with Binyamin Netanyahu at the UN
General Assembly in 2012 and felt that Iran would have a nuclear
capability within months. It is okay to say that certain organisations
say that is not possible. Equally, it is valid to say that other
organisations contradict that point of
view<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:37:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000105"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Wallace" PimsId="4502" UID="140226104000280" xid="860" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000280">Mr
Wallace:</Member></B> I register the point, but these are not national
institutes. This is the CIA and the Pentagon—okay, they do not
have the best track record on intelligence, but they never gave the
benefit of the doubt to the doves; they always gave it to the hawks.
These are major national institutions—Government
organisations—that share intelligence with Israel and all the
other allies that we have, so they are certainly
serious<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:38:28"></hs_TimeCode>. It is

should not pass over the grand bargain offered by Iran in 2003. The
grand bargain was something that every hon. Member in this Chamber
would have signed up to tomorrow. It was an offer by Iran to suspend
enrichment; to join the additional protocol, with further and more
intrusive inspection than even Britain has under the non-proliferation
treaty; and to demilitarise Hezbollah. It was even to have gone as far
as to recognise Israel, which many countries in the middle east, which
may be against Iran but are not necessarily allies, still do not
recognise. They may help Israel, but they still have not taken the next
step. That grand bargain was rejected out of hand by the White

is still going on in Iran between hardliners and reformers. The
reformers are trying to say to the population, “Look, Iran can
be successful, but we need to concede certain things. We need to slow
the nuclear programme”—or cancel it if there is a
military aspect—“and we need to come into the
international community. We will address human rights, too.” I

very profitable. We have to say, “Here is a chance.” As

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:44:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hendon (Dr Offord), my north London near neighbour, on securing the
debate, which has been a useful opportunity to assess recent events in
Iran including, among other important issues, the joint plan of action.
He rightly said that the joint plan of action does not resolve
international suspicions about Iran’s intentions and merely
suspends some of those suspicions for some people. He is right to
continue to be concerned about Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism
and other harmful activity in the region. He, along with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:45:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison), rightly underlines that the sense of
threat from Iran is still felt particularly acutely in

highlighting some of the history of the relationship between the west

our debates on future relations with

a range of views and the need for nuance is perhaps reflected in the
region itself. I am struck that there is clearly an intense debate on
the joint plan of action in Israel. In that context, it is worth noting
the comments made yesterday by the Israeli Labour party leader Isaac
Herzog, who challenged some of the comments by Israel’s Prime
Minister, Mr Netanyahu, on the Iranian nuclear
deal:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="140226104000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000242">“This

hon. Member for Hendon, in response to an intervention, alluded to
Iran’s role in Syria and elsewhere in the region. Perhaps
inevitably, it is always a critical time in the middle east, but it
feels particularly so at the moment. Iran clearly plays an important
role, and its activities in the region have implications for the wider
relationship between Iran and the west. The international community,
including the UK Government, must continue to do all it can to
encourage all the parties in Syria to end the fighting and, in that
context, to persuade Iran to influence the Assad regime at every
opportunity to cease the use of violence against its own
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:48:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Iran’s dismal human rights record has rightly been raised by a
couple of hon. Members. There are serious ongoing concerns. If the new
regime in Iran takes steps to improve the country’s human rights
record, it would send a strong signal on the importance that the
Iranian Government attach to co-operation and engagement with the
international community. Although President Rouhani has not openly
expressed anti-gay rhetoric, unlike his predecessor, Iran’s
Islamic penal code still lists homosexuality as an offence punishable
by
death.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000125">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:49:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) rightly highlighted concerns
about the attitude to other religions and ethnic minorities. It is far

that political prisoners are being released in the way that the regime

claimed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000126">There
has long been recognition in the House and across the international
community that we need to grasp the serious opportunities that
occasionally come along—they are certainly presenting themselves
to us now—to improve relations between Iran and the UK and the
west in general. The hon. Member for Wyre and Preston North highlighted
a number of the missed opportunities to do just that. President Rouhani
is offering the prospect of seriously improving the relationship
between the UK and Iran. In recent months, his Administration’s
new approach to negotiations suggests that we should be open to
continuing serious engagement with his regime. I pay tribute to the
EU’s High Representative, Cathy Ashton, not only for her role in
the negotiations but for her willingness to continue to follow through
on the prospects for better
engagement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000127">On
ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is and remains peaceful,
Members will be aware that the first step agreement with Iran commenced
on 20 January and continues to be implemented. We are between talks and
the E3 plus 3 are meeting again in March for the next round. We should
be encouraged that the previous talks were of a constructive
nature.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000128">The
hon. Member for Hendon rightly raised concerns about Iran’s
attitude to, for example, the critical issue of centrifuges. There has
been concern that Iran has installed new centrifuges. As the shadow
Foreign Secretary expressed in his response to the Foreign
Secretary’s statement on Monday, there is concern that Iran is
still operating more than 10,000 centrifuges when the interim deal set
out a much lower target. What is the Minister’s view on that?
There has also been concern about the Arak heavy water research centre.
As he has previously said, under the joint plan of action Iran is
supposed to fully resolve concerns about that reactor and confirm that
no reprocessing will take place there. What is his view on progress in
that
area?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000129">The
deal that has been agreed is a necessary step precisely because Iran
has developed an enrichment programme over recent years, despite calls
by the international community to stop. That is why the existing
substantial sanctions must be enforced and why the comprehensive
solution must address all the proliferation concerns on Iran’s
nuclear programme. Does the Minister believe that the IAEA has the
necessary resources to be responsible for the verification of the
nuclear-related measures to which Iran has committed? Will he explain
more about the monitoring and validating processes that the IAEA will
go through? Maintaining confidence in those processes will be important
in helping address 
<?notus-xml column=154?>the suspicion about the Iranians’ activities. In that way, the
necessary trust can be built to achieve the comprehensive solution that
will ultimately be in everyone’s
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000130">Will
the Minister set out what the role of the joint commission of the E3
plus 3 and Iran will be? What stage are we at in the development of the
joint commission? Will he set out, as the shadow Foreign Secretary
asked the Foreign Secretary to do on Monday, the impact that the
sanctions relief has had so far on the Iranian economy? Will the
Minister set out the most recent estimate of the benefits that the
limited sanctions relief has so far brought to the Iranian economy?
Similarly, what impact has the limited sanctions relief had on
Iran’s petrochemical exports and the imports of goods and
services for its automotive manufacturing
sector?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000131">Finally,
on a related but nevertheless separate issue, the UK and Iran brought
protecting power arrangements to an end last week, which is an
encouraging sign of increasing confidence that bilateral business can
be conducted directly between capitals, rather than through
intermediaries. Iran’s non-resident chargé
d’affaires visited the UK this week. Can the Minister provide at
least some update on the progress in those discussions? All of
us wish the Government and the E3 plus 3 well in seeking to deliver on
the comprehensive solution. I hope the Minister will continue to
provide regular updates to the House to offer assurance on the progress
of
negotiations.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="140226104000251" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000251">3.55

Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Hugh
Robertson):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Hendon (Dr Offord) on securing the debate and thank all hon. Members
for their contributions. Given that this has been something of a
question fest, I suspect that my best approach in summing up is not to
read through the beautifully drafted piece of English that has been
supplied to me, but to try to pick out the questions that have been
asked and to go through them as swiftly as I can in the 10 minutes
remaining.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000133">In
a sense, the debate has highlighted the issue. It would be a bit
simplistic to call it a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty debate, but
in a sense everyone is occupying the same piece of ground. My hon.
Friend the Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace) gave us a
wonderful historical tour de force of relations with Iran. There are
ample reasons to be extremely cautious and very suspicious. On the
other hand, once every so often an opportunity comes around. The
question is whether to make that leap of faith and test it, being well
aware of all the past problems, the history and the dangers, in the
hope of getting to a better place eventually. Alternatively, we can be
extremely cautious at every stage to the extent that it impacts on the
ability to conclude that final deal. Those are difficult and complex
judgments, and there are no right or wrong
answers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000134">The
last time the international community had a go at this was when the
right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) was Foreign Secretary. It
got to a stage where all the suspicions present in today’s
debate were aired, and a combination of the hard-liners in Tehran and
Washington derailed the deal. The consequence of that was that the
steps towards nuclear production simply continued. Arguably, as a
result of not being able to take those bold steps, the situation got
worse, 
<?notus-xml column=155?>not better—I know it is difficult to second-guess these things
now. It is absolutely right to be cautious and sensible and to have an
eye to history, but we should see on this occasion whether we can test
the feelings and sentiment in
Iran.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000135">I
will try to answer the various questions that my hon. Friend the Member
for Hendon asked. He is absolutely correct to say that the interim
agreement does not resolve international suspicions. As he will have
guessed from my opening remarks, I absolutely agree that it does not.
It is merely a first step that buys us the time to move towards further
discussions on the issues, of which he raised a great many. A
comprehensive agreement will absolutely need to address the
proliferation concerns that he set out. Let me be clear: we will not
sign a deal if it does not address those concerns. Secondly, he made
the point that, through the sanctions relief regime, we have eased the
pressure on Iran’s economy for very limited concessions in
return.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_26_PT_1/827D94A314E40E8D7FCE0C74B339E0ECA643E05D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="26 February 2014">Wednesday

is worth saying that the interim deal addresses some of the nuclear
programme’s most concerning elements: the eradication of the
stockpile of 20% enriched uranium; and Iran being forbidden from
installing further centrifuges, which is different from developing
them. It also eases the monitoring regime carried out by the IAEA. We
and the US estimate the sanctions relief given to Iran to be about $7
billion over the six-month period. That is a relatively small fraction
of the $60 billion to $100 billion of restricted Iranian oil
funds held abroad and of the $60 billion to $70 billion it needs to
finance its foreign imports. I understand my hon. Friend’s
concerns, but there is a sense of proportion in
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000137">My
hon. Friend asked about what are called in the parlance the
PMDs—possible military dimensions—of Iran’s
nuclear programme. That is very much a concern. He is right to say that
they are not addressed in the interim agreement, but they are a key
part of the final negotiations that will take place so they will be
addressed. Indeed, the joint plan of action makes it clear that the
joint commission, composed of the E3 plus 3 and Iran, will work with
the IAEA to facilitate the resolution of all those issues.</hs_Para>

I have got the order right—my hon. Friend asked about the
sanctions relief enabling the Iranians to fund terrorism, which touches
on a point made by several other Members. There is no doubt that
Iran’s support of terrorism throughout the region is a malignant
force. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison)
mentioned, were there need for evidence, considerable evidence is
available—it is a statement of fact—that Iranian support
for Hezbollah and directly through the Qods Force has played a
considerable part in the conflict in Syria. That is not the only
example by any means of Iran’s malign influence in the area; it
has been seen recently in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and right around the
Arabian peninsula. That will have to be addressed if relations with
Iran are to be normalised in any meaningful
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000139">I
guess that the question about the granting of access to the IAEA was
driven by the Parchin military facility issue. My hon. Friend the
Member for Hendon is right that the interim agreement does not allow
the IAEA access to Parchin. However, following Iran’s agreement
with the IAEA on 8 February about the exploding 
<?notus-xml column=156?>bridgewire detonators, we hope that we can make progress. Indeed, that
will have to be addressed as part of any final and comprehensive
agreement.</hs_Para>

Friend asked, perfectly reasonably, about our assessment of whether the
Iranian actions at the moment are within the spirit of the JPA
agreement. The hon. Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas) asked in
particular about the continued production of advanced centrifuges with
reduced break-out times and whether that poses questions about Iranian
intentions. There is no doubt that we would much rather that Iran had
not done that. The IAEA, however, has looked at what it has done thus
far and confirmed that it is currently complying with the JPA’s
strict terms. As part of the 24 November agreement, Iran has
committed not to install or bring into operation any new centrifuges in
the main enrichment facilities.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000141">That,
however, does not help with confidence-building measures and, as we
touched on earlier, there will be a real trust issue if the Iranian
Government continue to act in this way. Again, that will have to be
addressed as part of the comprehensive agreement.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend asked about the concerns that Iran could simply pocket the
benefits and walk away from the negotiations. Indeed it could, but, if
so, it has a great deal to lose. The Iranian economy is going through
the floor and there is real hardship in Tehran. Anyone who looks at
this—intelligence agency or otherwise —realises that the
Iranian economy is in a very bad place indeed, and the key electoral
promise of the Government was to restore the economy, so they have a
considerable incentive. Without such an agreement, they can do
absolutely nothing to bump-start their
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000143">If
the deal falls to pieces, no doubt international reaction will be tough
and Iran will wear the blame for that. The full sanctions regime will
simply be reinstated and it will move backwards very quickly. In an
environment in which Iran had toyed with the international community
and let it down, it would be difficult to restart talks for some time.
My hon. Friend is right that, in theory, Iran could pocket what it has
got at the moment and walk away, but that might not be wise on its
part. There is no intention whatever to offer further sanctions relief

to some of the other questions asked in various contributions. It is
always a pleasure to hear from the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim
Shannon). He talked about the power struggle in Iran and he is
absolutely right. At the moment, the indication is that the supreme
leader backs the regime in the talks being conducted: indeed, the
substantive concessions made thus far would not have been possible
without his support. However, as we all know, hard-liners who do not
wish the process well are operating in the background. The hon.
Gentleman asked a good question about whether Rouhani can deliver. Our
assessment is that he can, but if we push him too hard, it probably
will not take a great deal for that to change. If he cannot show real
benefit from the process, that assessment must be called into
doubt.</hs_Para>

Gentleman asked about human rights abuses in the country and he is
right to highlight them. I have the figures here and the situation is
appalling—there are no two ways about it. There have been
reports of at least 400 executions in 2013. Iran has the second highest

<?notus-xml column=157?>number of journalists in prison in the world. Opposition leaders have
been detained for more than two years. Arrests of human rights
defenders and journalists continue, as does persecution of religious
and ethnic minorities. The Government will continue to hold Iran to
account. We are not being soft: more than 80 EU sanctions are
designated on individual Iranians and entities responsible for human
rights violations.</hs_Para>

regularly by Members throughout the House was the fate of Christians in
the middle east. In the various visits I have made around the region, I
have tried to make a specific point of seeking out Christian leaders to
talk to them about what is happening. I had a fascinating couple of

Friend the Member for Hertsmere made the very good point that it is
important not to get ahead of ourselves. I agree absolutely. The
Foreign Secretary put it well in the early autumn of last year when he
came back from New York. He explained that there had been a change in
the atmospherics, but that nothing substantive on the ground has
changed at all. That is a good way of putting it and a good way of
approaching what we are doing at the moment. There is a clear
opportunity but it makes abundant good sense to move forward

Friend correctly drew our attention to the lack of progress in Geneva.
I sat through the whole of the first day of contributions there, and
our assessment was that the key driver behind that lack of progress was
the regime’s unwillingness to address the question of regime
change. It is a red line that the regime will not cross, and at the
moment it is the great barrier. The regime wants to talk only about
terrorism, whereas the opposition wants to talk about transitional

broadband coverage is not just important for those of us who want to
download films and TV shows, do internet shopping or keep up to date
with the latest news; it is truly vital for those who work from home
and those who run their own businesses. Broadband is a superb
investment, which is projected to boost local growth across the

however, the emphasis is on getting good coverage for towns and cities.
I want to make the case that good broadband coverage in rural areas is
every bit as important. My constituency, South Northamptonshire, covers
92 parishes—many of them rural—two market towns and a
decent chunk of Northampton, our county town. In 2012, Northamptonshire
county council undertook an open market review to determine the level
of broadband coverage in the district of South Northamptonshire. The
council surveyed over 38,000 premises in the district; of those, it
discovered that 27,000 were identified as unserved. In 2012, then,
about 70% of all premises in the district of South Northamptonshire had
no broadband coverage at all.</hs_Para>

am delighted with the steps that both the Government and
Northamptonshire county council are taking. The Government are already
investing £1.2 billion to supply people across the UK
with access to superfast broadband. The target set is for 95% of the UK
to have access to superfast broadband coverage by 2017. The Government
have acknowledged the importance of good broadband infrastructure in
creating more jobs and ensuring small businesses have they support they
need. I am encouraged that 10,000 homes and businesses are getting
superfast upgrades each week, with that figure set to rise to 40,000
premises a week by the summer. Finally, I was delighted by the
announcement, made only yesterday by my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for Culture, Media and Sport, of the allocation of an extra
£250 million to ensure that all areas of the UK are able to hit
the 2017 target. I certainly welcome the £3.64 million
additional allocation for
Northamptonshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000163">The
backing is there. Closer to home, I am glad that Northamptonshire
county council has its own excellent plans for roll-out to deliver 90%
coverage in the county by 2015. Over 50,000 premises will gain access
as a result of the just over £4 million allocated by the county
council, together with over £4 million from Broadband Delivery
UK and an investment of £3.2 million from BT. The council
reports that it now intends to go further than its initial 2015 target
and is already talking to commercial providers to revisit the extent of
commercial plans. The council has put aside an extra £2 million,
and I am sure it will welcome the additional sum of just over
£3.5 million allocated yesterday by the Secretary of
State.</hs_Para>

county council has one of the most detailed “when and
where” maps in the country. Although residents are aware that
plans could change, that map provides the best information available on
the extent of coverage, by when the coverage will be in place 
<?notus-xml column=160?>and how the council expects plans to come forward. Of the 27,000
properties in my constituency that were identified as unserved, the
council expects that 18,500 will receive access to superfast broadband
through its investment, and that of BDUK and BT. The Superfast
Northamptonshire project will see another 4,175 premises in South
Northamptonshire receive coverage. It is the council’s aim to

all that good news, full access is still a terribly long way off. I
regularly receive reports from annoyed and frustrated residents in my

should rightly be the domain of the private sector, so there are clear
rules about how and where the public sector can intervene, but Grange
Park in my constituency is a good example of an area where broadband is
a major issue. The majority of the area falls within the commercial
plans of BT’s provision. As it has declared a commercial
interest, the county council cannot intervene with a solution as that
would be in breach of state aid regulations. The county council, parish
council and Grange Park residents are pressing BT to deliver on its
commercial proposals and to set out a clear timetable. I understand
that there will soon be a meeting with BT’s regional director
for the east midlands, and I hope that they will be able to move things
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000167">The
problem in Grange Park is that it is a significant distance from the
exchange and around a quarter of properties are served by telephony
over passive optical networks—T-PON—which will not
support superfast fibre-based services. A solution must be found, but
it may not be simple and may be expensive. Residents believe that BT
has an obligation, and that it must not step back from its proposed
commercial response and transfer the problem back to the county
council. A delay in securing good broadband coverage to the area and
finding the additional funding, which would be needed if the problem
were given back to the council, would be
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000168">One
resident wrote to me recently explaining the issue. He fears that BT
will conclude that it is not commercially viable to change T-PON to
fibre to the cabinet—FTTC—which is the infrastructure
that is so desperately needed. My constituent concludes that the
problem is the lack of competition as BT is the only commercial
provider. If Virgin, for example, had existing infrastructure in Grange
Park, BT would be fighting to retain business instead of receiving the
same revenue for line rental and current broadband services without
having to provide any investment.</hs_Para>

constituent also explained that many residents have their own
businesses and work from home, and that the problem is so serious for
many that they may have no alternative other than to move away if it

commitments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000170">I

Eric Malcomson, initially brought a satellite-based service to Abthorpe

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:26:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom) on securing this
important debate. She is an assiduous champion of her constituents and
their interests, and it does not surprise me that she seeks to draw my
attention to the importance of broadband to her
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000179">Before
responding to the specific issues that my hon. Friend raised, I
will<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:27:17"></hs_TimeCode> give a
brief overview of the broadband project as it is developing. Having
commissioned research, the Government know that investment in broadband
pays enormous dividends in economic growth. A recent study that we
commissioned showed that over the next decade every pound invested in
broadband will deliver a £20 return investment. That sounds an
unusually high return, but it is realistic because broadband is a
general-purpose technology, which has an increasingly critical role in
the day-to-day running of businesses large and small.</hs_Para>

that economic impact will come from improvements in business
productivity and will safeguard employment in areas that might
otherwise be at a disadvantage. There will be a time saving for people
who will no longer have to commute, and opportunities for people to
participate in the work force. The gross value added attributable to
our current programme is about £6.3 billion a year by 2024, with
about 20,000 jobs attributable to the programme. I have been
told that increased teleworking will save around 10 million hours of
leisure time every year, as well as reducing commuting
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000181">We
invested some £500 million in our original programme to bring
superfast broadband to areas where it was not commercially viable, and
that money was matched by local authorities. The total sum was around
£1.2 billion. As my hon. Friend said, the Government gave
Northamptonshire some £4 million, which was matched by the
county council and topped up by the telecoms provider
BT.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000182">The
programme in Northamptonshire, before we announced our superfast
extension programme, was designed to achieve 89.2% fibre coverage,
which meant that 87.4% of all premises in Northamptonshire county
council’s area would receive speeds of 24 megabits and above.
Some 228,000 premises in the Northamptonshire county council area will
be covered by BT commercially and almost 50,000
premises—48,600-odd to be exact—will be covered by the
intervention of the Government and the county council.

am pleased to say that, according to my understanding, the programme in
Northamptonshire is now two months ahead of schedule. It may or may not
have escaped your notice, Mr Williams, that the Government were
criticised some months back for the programme’s being delayed.
In fact, the more one sees the programme getting under way, the more
one sees that it is now beginning to exceed its targets. In
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:36:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend’s constituency, we have so far reached 3,300 premises

programme is very successful, not only in Northamptonshire, including
South Northamptonshire, but across the country. We are covering more

hope then to be covering some 40,000 premises a week.</hs_Para>

me echo the tribute paid by my hon. Friend to her county
council—Northamptonshire county council. From the very beginning
of the project, we wanted to partner with local councils and
Northamptonshire county council has stood tall as an exemplar of a
county council to partner with. Not only has it match-funded the
Government money, but it has proved effective in ensuring that planning
barriers were removed and in co-ordinating all the different elements
that need to go into a smooth roll-out of superfast broadband. It does
not surprise me at all that the programme is already ahead of schedule;
a lot of the credit for that has to go to the county council.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend also mentioned the Tove valley community
broadband project in the south of Northamptonshire. I
echo her comments. That is a hugely successful project, as she said,
with more than 50% of the households in its target area having signed
up for the superfast service, making the project financially viable. I
am pleased to say that Broadband Delivery UK and the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have, in principle, approved
£118,000 for the project through the rural community broadband
fund. It is good to see how the local communities have worked so
closely to put together the project, which will bring superfast
broadband to Tove valley.</hs_Para>

am delighted with the excellent progress that we have seen in
Northamptonshire and I look forward to the continued success of the
county roll-out, which will see a further 18,000 premises passed. I am
pleased that we were able to find the additional
money—£3.64 million —to go to Northamptonshire as
part of the superfast extension programme.</hs_Para>

ever perfect and I take on board my hon. Friend’s points about
some of the issues that she is having to deal with in her constituency.
I have to say that I have found BT to be a very good partner in terms
of broadband delivery roll-out, but I hear what her constituents in
Grange Park say, which is that perhaps, in her words, they are being
held to ransom by BT, as BT is the only supplier.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=164?><hs_Para UID="140226104000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000189">However, it
is probably worth pointing out that BT often finds itself as the only
supplier in areas where other commercial suppliers simply will not
compete because it is not necessarily commercially viable. She will not
find Virgin Media there because it may not be commercially viable for
it to compete in Grange Park. Although one finds a plethora of
commercial suppliers competing for the business market, the residential
market is less competitive, because, to put it bluntly, it can be less
profitable.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000190"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:34:18"></hs_TimeCode>My
understanding is that in Grange Park, some 650 premises already
have superfast broadband as part of BT’s commercial roll-out. A
further 193 premises will get it in 2014 as part of BT’s
commercial roll-out, and 77 premises in Grange Park will get it as a
result of the rural broadband initiative. That still leaves
some 700 to 900 premises looking for a solution, so my hon.
Friend is absolutely right to raise the issue, and to do so in this
Chamber. I promise her now, in this forum, that I will get back to BT,
BDUK, and the county council, and work with her to see whether we can
make progress on a solution.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000191">I was also
pleased to hear my hon. Friend mention mobile coverage. She rightly
expected me to solve a number of problems for her in the Chamber this
afternoon, so let me see whether I can oblige. I am delighted that we
are now seeing the roll-out of 4G—fourth-generation technology
for mobile phones. It was a fraught process to get to a position in
which we were ready to auction the spectrum, but the spectrum auction
went very well and we are now seeing the roll-out of 4G nationwide.
That roll-out itself is set to conclude some two years ahead of
schedule; the licences require 98% coverage for one licensee by the end
of 2017, and my understanding is that all four main operators plan to
reach that figure by the end of 2015.</hs_Para>

to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:36:21"></hs_TimeCode> say to my
hon. Friend that, according to my understanding, from discussions with
the operators when they give indications for specific areas or
constituencies of the country, we will see a significant uplift in
terms of mobile coverage. Not only will 4G coverage extend mobile
coverage significantly, but the roll-out of 4G will also see, as a
knock-on effect and knock-on benefit, a significant increase in
coverage of 3G.</hs_Para>

coverage, alongside fixed broadband coverage, is an issue of
significant concern to the Government. We are actively looking at that
to consider ways in which to improve it, because
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:37:20"></hs_TimeCode>what sums up the
whole debate, and why it is so appropriate for my hon. Friend to have
secured it, is the recognition over the past few years that good,
superfast, digital communication, whether mobile or fixed, is becoming
an essential aspect for almost every business and an essential part of
our leisure life as well. That is why I am so pleased that the fixed
broadband project is going well.</hs_Para>

that we are delivering in my hon. Friend’s constituency. Nothing
is ever perfect and she is right to point out where there are gaps in
coverage. I repeat my pledge to work with her, the county council, BT

McClymont</B> (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East)
(Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr
Williams. Most people will be familiar with CE marking. Some goods have
had it for years, from kids’ toys to kitchen appliances, from
bike helmets to our hot water boilers, among other things. CE marking
was introduced as a means to create a level playing field in the
internal European market, starting way back in 1988. It is, of course,
a consumer protection device to ensure that manufactured goods are made
to standards that are harmonised across the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000196">Recognising
the challenges involved in providing a standard certification mark on
manufactured goods, it was decided to phase in the introduction over a
long period. That has led to different dates set for various goods
since 1988 and it is still continuing to this day. The most recent
incarnation of the mark was in 1995 and it continues in most product
areas without a major problem. However, there is a problem for the
Government and steel fabrication industry with the requirement for CE
marking on all fabricated steelwork and construction in civil
engineering to be in place by 1 July 2014. I want today to draw the
Government’s attention to the implications of that
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000197">Let
me give some background. The Government have championed the idea that
they are a friend of small business, and that is indeed a sensible

was in that context that I was first contacted by a firm local to my

Cruickshanks, a third-generation family-run business established in

business that the Government hold up as an example of an enterprise
that they are setting out to support and that we all need to succeed.
It is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:40:48"></hs_TimeCode> in the
spirit of cross-party support for small businesses of that kind and
others that I bring this issue to Parliament. Mr Cruickshank is
absolutely clear about the impact on his business. Businesses that do
not comply with the new CE marking certification by 1 July 2014 will be
trading illegally, and Mr Cruickshank is very clear that certifying
products involves significant costs for a small business such as the

focus on the lack of awareness in the fabrication industry of the
necessity of meeting the new certification standard has been echoed by
another business in my constituency, Highland Galvanizers, based in
Cumbernauld. Geoff Crowley, the managing director, is very clear that
upwards of 700 companies just in Scotland are unlikely to be compliant
by 1 July. Geoff has been at the forefront of efforts to warn of the
impending introduction of CE marking on fabricated steelwork in
construction and civil engineering, and to make firms and the
Government aware of it—it is coming up very fast.</hs_Para>

Anecdotal evidence from Scottish steel fabricators who have already
implemented CE marking is that implementation costs of £20,000
are not unusual for larger businesses, and that quotes from consultants
to help smaller fabricators to meet the new standard range from
£5,000 to
£10,000<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:45:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000205">Further
to that, the impact assessment, at paragraph 29, removes half of those
who might be affected by the new certification standard,
because—this is the impact assessment’s own
description—half of those who would be affected will have
voluntarily become CE mark certified on the basis that they might want
to do business abroad. We have to be aware of the impact assessment in
that context. Does the fact that business might be certified for
another reason mean that that cost should be removed from the impact
assessment? Are those calculations accurate enough for hon. Members to

disproportionately. We are talking about small businesses that only
sell locally and that are not exporters. There is little benefit for
them in CE marking in itself. Of course, they are already at a
disadvantage compared with larger suppliers in the industry, which can
easily afford to absorb the costs of meeting the new standard. That
creates obvious financial and compliance challenges for small steel
fabricators such as Cruickshanks in
Kirkintilloch<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:47:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000207">There
was clearly some recognition of the potential problems with the new CE
standard—an impact assessment was undertaken in 2009—but,
five years later, it appears 
<?notus-xml column=167?>that not much has happened to ensure that small steel fabricators are
aware of the requirement, which has to be met by 1 July, and aware of
any support that can be given to meet

paragraph 61, the impact assessment asks those consulted how they think
the certification standard will impact on competition. Larger companies
thought that the impact would be positive, whereas small businesses saw
it as negative and thought that the measure would reduce choice and
drive smaller businesses out of the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:48:10"></hs_TimeCode>place.
Paragraph 65 recognised that smaller businesses, particularly those
that are not members of trade bodies, would suffer from poorer
communications—it is much more difficult to get the message out
to small businesses. From the discussions I have had with the Scottish
part of the steel fabrication industry in particular, but not
exclusively, I think the problem is that many of the small fabricators
are simply unaware that the requirement is coming. Some just do not
believe it. Some have heard and are hoping they will be
unaffected<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:48:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000209">I
say again that the British Constructional Steelwork Association is
doing sterling work in trying to shed light on the requirement and has

However, those few bodies in the UK that are authorised to assess and
certify companies seeking CE accreditation, such as the Steel

under-resourced and already booked up beyond the 1 July

I secured the debate, I have been contacted by a number of small
businesses—steel fabricators, welders and the like—across
the UK. Organisations that procure large quantities of steel, such as
those behind large-scale construction projects, are already beginning
to demand that smaller suppliers be CE accredited. There is a real
issue in that the vast majority of Scottish fabrication businesses will
not be eligible to tender for that kind of work after 1 July, because
they will not have met the certification deadline. Local authorities
are starting to wake up to that, and I hope the Minister will tell us
what action his Department is taking to ensure that local authorities
are acting, and what Government guidance and help has been
given.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000211">Businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:59:48"></hs_TimeCode>

that there seems to be a lack of available resource. There are few
trainers and fewer assessors, and they are booked up beyond 1 July. My
understanding is that trading standards has to be responsible for the
enforcement of the CE marking standard. What action has trading
standards taken to inform those in the industry that the standard must
be met? Has trading standards taken it upon itself to offer
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:51:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000212">I
look forward to the Government grasping the matter. There is a
significant problem for small businesses—smaller fabricators
lack awareness of the requirement to meet the standard by 1 July. The
Government have a role to play, and if they believe that small
businesses are the engine room of the economy, I hope they engage in a
positive and constructive spirit. I am sure the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=168?>will agree that it is a serious matter.
Businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:52:15"></hs_TimeCode> may

Government (Stephen Williams):</Member></B>
Diolch, Mr Williams. Prynhawn da—good
afternoon to you. I congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:52:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Gregg McClymont) on
securing the debate. We were not entirely sure what points he was going
to raise. I gather from his introductory remarks that he was speaking
on behalf of at least two construction steel producers in his
constituency: T &amp; D Cruickshanks from Kirkintilloch and Highland
Galvanizers from Cumbernauld. We almost had the full set; we did not
get a company from Kilsyth, but the fact that two of the three
communities in the hon. Gentleman’s constituency contacted him
about the matter demonstrates its importance to the firms that he
represents.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000214"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:53:37"></hs_TimeCode>I
have a comprehensive brief to get through, and I believe that it
anticipates all the points that the hon. Gentleman made. The area is
complex, as I am sure that he realised when he briefed himself up on
it. The construction products regulation is European Union legislation,
which came into force across the European Union on 1 July 2013 except
in the construction steel industry, which has until 1 July 2014. That
legislation is applicable across all member states. It is a free trade
measure that requires construction products covered by a harmonised
product standard to carry the CE marking. The regulation also requires
manufacturers to provide robust and reliable information in a
consistent way, which benefits industry and reduces potential barriers
to trade.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000215">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:54:39"></hs_TimeCode>
are four main elements in the regime, which I will outline briefly.
First, there is a suite of harmonised technical specifications that
exist to establish a common approach across Europe to product
standards. Industry is responsible for developing those standards, and
business and the British Standards Institution play an active part in
their development. Secondly, there is a requirement to affix CE marking
and to provide a declaration of performance to accompany the product,
setting out how it performs against the essential performance
characteristics in the standard.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000216">Thirdly,
there are agreed systems to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the
performance set out in the declaration of performance, which are called
the assessment and verification of constancy of performance—I
said that this was a complicated area. Those systems reflect the level
of risk associated with the product and the potential for performance
to vary. Finally, there is a framework of notified bodies, which are
independent third-party organisations involved in the assessment and
verification of performance. That package is designed to provide
certainty for industry and remove barriers to trade while ensuring that
proper safeguards are in place relating to safety.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000217"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:55:53"></hs_TimeCode>There
are more than 400 harmonised standards relating to construction
products. All those, apart from in the area of construction steel, came
into force on 1 July 2013. Some in the industry expressed
concern about the 
<?notus-xml column=169?>introduction of those regulations last year. However, we have since
discovered that there were significantly fewer practical problems than
were feared in the other 399 areas last year.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000218"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:56:40"></hs_TimeCode>The
standard on structural steelwork is covered by BS EN 1090-1, which
deals with products such as piles, columns, beams and stairs. Unlike
most other construction products, the CE marking of fabricated
structural steel products is not required until July 2014. That means
that the industry will have had three and a half years since the
publication of that standard to prepare for its implementation. The
European Commission gave the industry that additional 12 months’
leeway because it recognised that there were a large number of small
steelwork fabricators who would benefit from the extra time. It was
anticipated that the sector might need a little more time to adapt and
prepare.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000219"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>The
hon. Gentleman asked several questions about how prepared industry
should be and whether the changes had been publicised. My Department,
which leads across the UK for this area, has been working with a wide
range of organisations to ensure that industry is aware and prepared.
Both my Department and the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills have produced a range of information about what is required
under the regulations, and there is further information and guidance on
the planning
portal<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:58:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000220">However,
industry is also responsible for raising awareness, and trade
associations have been at the forefront of that work. I have with me
the brochure produced by the British Constructional Steel Association,
with assistance from Tata Steel, in July 2013—just as all the
other construction standards were being introduced—to publicise
further the changes that would be required this year. Larger firms in
the industry, such as Tata, have played an active role in raising
awareness right across their supply chain. I gather from the hon.
Gentleman’s remarks that T &amp; D Cruickshanks and Highland
Galvanizers will be involved in the supply chain for larger users of
their
product<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:59:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000221">Trading
standards in England, Wales and Scotland will be responsible for
providing advice at a local level to businesses, and they will police
the regime once it is in place. In answer to a specific question asked
by the hon. Gentleman, not only have officials from my Department
arranged events for trading standards departments in English councils,
but we have done the same for Scottish councils in general. An event
was held in Motherwell in April last year to enable Scottish councils
to prepare in plenty of time for the changes that will take place this
year.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140226104000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000222">The hon.
Gentleman also made some points about costings. I understand that the
industry has expressed concerns about the costs of implementation,
which principally result from the need to involve a third-party
notified body to establish the performance of the product and ensure
that systems are in place to maintain performance. The extent of the
costs depends on the product type and generally reflects the
fabricators’ existing quality systems, how involved the notified
body is in establishing performance, and the on-going monitoring of
production.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000223">For
structural steelwork firms, the safety-critical nature of the product
means that there is not only an initial inspection by the notified
body, but subsequent routine checking of the factory production
control. Many larger 
<?notus-xml column=170?>firms will already incur similar costs through their voluntary adoption
of third-party quality control schemes. Nevertheless, we recognise that
for small firms, such as those in the hon. Gentleman’s
constituency, incurring such a cost could be a more significant
additional burden. However, the costs arise as a result of the
standards that have been developed by the industry itself and
determined as proportionate to the level of risk involved. Of course,
some costs may be offset against future efficiency savings resulting
from quality improvement—for example, by avoiding mistakes
because compliance processes are in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000224">Small
businesses have clearly made representations about assistance. I can
speak for the situation in England, where BIS funds the manufacturing
advisory service, which has been running workshops with small
manufacturers. It has not only been raising awareness but providing
financial assistance in the form of grants of up to £1,000 for
consultancy support to help small manufacturers to comply. We
understand from the Welsh Government that similar help is available in
Wales—in fact, according to the figures I have found, it looks
more generous. I believe that no such assistance has been provided by
the Scottish Government, so I suggest that the hon. Gentleman raises
the issue with his constituency counterpart in Scotland who will no
doubt want to raise it in
Holyrood.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000225">The
other key issue raised by the hon. Gentleman was about whether there is
enough time for companies to comply with the new standard. As I have
already mentioned, come July there will have been three and a half
years for companies to prepare. I understand that there are also
concerns about the number of bodies that can provide certification.
Currently, six notified bodies are able to carry out the third-party
tasks for checking the factory production control systems of structural
steelwork fabricators. Officials in my Department are fast-tracking
another notified body and will do the same for any other notified body
that comes forward—provided, of course, that there is no risk of
standards slipping as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000226">The
hon. Gentleman said that Cruickshanks and Highland Galvanisers were
worried that if they did not comply by 1 July 2014, business would
effectively cease and operations would be suspended. There is nothing
that any EU member state can do to change that date—that would
be unfair to firms in the United Kingdom that have complied with it,
and also to the other member states of the European Union single
market. However, the policing of the regime from 1 July will be down to
local authority trading standards bodies. If they discover that a firm
has not complied by that date, or, indeed, if they have been notified
already as a result of this debate that some firms anticipate not being
able to comply, in the first instance we would expect trading standards
to work with such firms and seek an explanation of the problems they
are
encountering.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000227">At
this point in the process, we can safely say that rumours that firms
will be closed down are scaremongering. Perhaps this debate will give
more publicity to the situation than would otherwise be the case. There
is still plenty of time for conversations with trading standards to
ensure that compliance problems and sanctions do not arise.
Nevertheless, the important point that I want to get across is that all
firms must get on with the process. There has been plenty of time for
the rest of the 
<?notus-xml column=171?>construction products sector—the deadline passed last year, since
when compliance problems have not been reported to us. We would urge
structural steel manufacturers to adopt the same
approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000228">Regulations
are part of an approach that seeks to promote trade and benefit
business while ensuring that we have safe construction products. I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman and I would be united on that, as well 
<?notus-xml column=172?>as on ensuring that small firms in his constituency and elsewhere in the
United Kingdom do not find themselves unable to comply. There is still
time for conversations with local authority trading standards officers,
and with the British Constructional Steel Association itself, to find a
clear way
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226104000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/halltext/140226h0002.htm#140226104000229"><I>Question

turning to the detail of the proposals, I would like to remind the
House of the background to the administration process at Mid Staffs.
Monitor appointed an independent contingency planning team (CPT) to the
trust in October 2012. In January 2013, the CPT concluded in a report
for Monitor that Mid Staffs was neither clinically nor financially
sustainable in its current form. In a subsequent report the CPT advised
that neither the trust nor local commissioners would be able to deliver
the changes required, and consequently recommended the appointment of
administrators. On the basis of the CPT’s conclusions. Monitor
appointed TSAs to Mid Staffs with effect from 16 April 2013. Since
taking up their role, the TSAs have found no reason to dispute the
CPT’s conclusions regarding the trust’s sustainability,
and their analysis has only strengthened the case for
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022685000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/wmstext/140226m0001.htm#14022685000033"></hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022685000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/wmstext/140226m0001.htm#14022685000034">Since
April the TSAs have been working with the trust, local commissioners
and providers, and a wide range of other stakeholders, in order to
develop a solution for the services at Mid Staffs. The TSAs’

on 16
January.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022685000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/wmstext/140226m0001.htm#14022685000035">The
TSAs’ report recommends that Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation
Trust is dissolved, and that Stafford and Cannock Chase hospitals are
operated by other local providers. It is vital that this structural
change is made as soon as possible to stabilise local health services.
The TSAs have also proposed a clinical model for the services currently
provided by the trust, which their independent clinical advisory group
(made up of leading clinicians from the Royal Colleges) has confirmed
will be clinically safe. I am pleased that under this model the
majority of patient visits, approximately 90%, will continue to take
place at Stafford and Cannock hospitals. I also welcome the
enhancements proposed for a number of current services, for example,
the inclusion of specialist frail and elderly support within the
Medical Assessment Unit at Stafford. All of this will contribute to a
much improved offer for local
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022685000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/wmstext/140226m0001.htm#14022685000036">However,
to ensure this improved offer, it is clearly not possible for all of
Mid Staffs’ services to go on as they are, and therefore the
TSAs’ recommendations will mean moving a small minority of
services away from 
<?notus-xml column=23?>Stafford hospital. Local people can be reassured that local
commissioners would need to be satisfied that there
is sufficient capacity available elsewhere before moving services. In
parallel, I am asking NHS England to identify whether consultant-led
obstetrics could be sustained at Mid Staffs in a safe way in the
future. In doing this, NHS England will work with local commissioners
as part of their wider review of the local health
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022685000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/wmstext/140226m0001.htm#14022685000037"></hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022685000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/wmstext/140226m0001.htm#14022685000038">The
TSAs’ report also identifies the funding required to support
this model and I am satisfied that, in the light of intervention from
the NHS Commissioning Board (also known as NHS England) in the form of
time limited funding, and a commitment from commissioners to deliver
further savings during and following implementation, the recommended
clinical model is affordable in the medium term and, subject to the
actions of local commissioners, can be a financially sustainable one.

commissioners have in this process, and in particular their
commissioning freedom to build upon the TSAs’ recommendations,
such as in maternity, where they consider this is to be sustainable and
in the interests of patients. Local commissioners will also oversee and

is a technique which can be used in the process of extraction of oil or
gas. Fracking takes place hundreds of metres below ground and would
have no effect on the likelihood of flooding. For the surface
installations required for borehole construction and hydraulic
fracturing, the Environment Agency is a statutory adviser in the

assessments and may object to developments if flood risk is
unacceptable or require conditions on how the site is constructed and

Penning:</Member></B> Entitlement to, and payment of, attendance
allowance (AA) is unaffected by the receipt of other social security
benefits. Claimants in receipt of AA who enter residential care and
receive public or local funding under specified enactments towards
their stay lose payment of the benefit after 28 days so as to prevent
the duplication of funding to meet the same needs. Care home residents
who claim AA when already in a care home and are receiving public or
local funding towards their stay can establish entitlement to AA but
cannot be paid it until they leave the care home. Care home residents
continue to be paid AA if they are entirely funding their stay from
their own funds or are treated as such because they are receiving
funding, in whole or in part, from another person or
charity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140226128000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140226/text/140226w0002.htm#140226128000287">Claimants

The preferred measure of low income for pensioners is based on incomes
measured After Housing Costs, as around three quarters of pensioners
own their own home. Considering pensioners' incomes compared to others
after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of
income between working-age people and pensioners, and for pensioners
over
time.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a
degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution

In Households Below Average Income, a household is defined as a single
person or group of people living at the same address as their only or
main residence, who either share one meal together or share the living
accommodation. This differs from a benefit unit (family), which is
defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple, plus any
dependent children. From January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners
and cohabitees) are also included in the same benefit unit. A household
will consist of one or more benefit units. This means that for the
figures above there may be more than one family within each
household.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">8.

Population Projections on an annual basis. Each publication looks at
the projected populations of men's and women's prisons for the
following six years. The latest projection was published on 7 November
2013. The following table has been extracted from it and shows the
prison population projections for females aged 18 and over up to June
2019. The scenarios track the impact of three different sentencing
trends on custodial convictions, custodial sentence length and hence on
the resulting prison population.</hs_Para>

report, published in October 2013, made a range of recommendations that
included increasing closeness to home for those currently held in the
open estate and providing all female prisoners with access to
employment regimes that will aim to get them into jobs on release
through improved skills and local contacts. We are also introducing a
slightly different operating model for women's prisons under the
Transforming Rehabilitation reforms. The operating model for women's
prisons will allow multiple providers access to most establishments.
The majority of female prisoners will be provided with resettlement
services by the same provider who will also provide statutory
rehabilitation support upon release.</hs_Para>

members of the public about this issue. Some have described the
financial impact that squatting can have on commercial property owners,
including the costs they might incur through loss of revenue, legal
fees and building repairs. Others have expressed concern about the
impact criminalisation could have on people who squat in dilapidated
commercial buildings to avoid rough sleeping. We are considering these

criminalise squatting in commercial

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) do not publish a breakdown of refugee
numbers by religion and we have no reliable alternative source. Almost
2.5 million Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries
while 6.5 million are internally displaced. This means that well over a
third of Syria's population have-been driven from their homes. The
ongoing crisis has clearly had a devastating impact on Christians, and
on all of Syria's communities. We believe that President Assad's
actions include a deliberate attempt to stir up sectarian tensions in
his effort to hold on to power. The National Coalition, who we
recognise as the sole legitimate representatives of the Syrian people,
has responded to these reports, emphasising that they are contrary to
the Coalition's vision of a future, pluralist Syria that protects the
rights of all its
