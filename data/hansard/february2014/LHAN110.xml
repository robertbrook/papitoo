Government are committed to doing all they can to maximise
registration, including among young people. The innovation project,
which the Cabinet Office announced today that it will support,
reinforces the aim of National Voter Registration Day. For example, the
funding awarded to the Scottish Youth Parliament will help it to
develop peer education training and outreach programmes to increase
democratic engagement and registering to vote. The Government also fund
UK Youth, which will help to develop online tools for engaging young
people in the democratic process, including registering to

as I do, the dedication and the sometimes sacrificial

one in four young people votes in this country that they are having a
National Voter Registration Day tomorrow, to try to encourage thousands
more—hundreds of thousands, if possible—to register and
become part of the democratic process here in the UK. Will the Minister

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, National Voter Registration
Day is an independent initiative to which the Government give their
full support, but it is not a 
<?notus-xml column=86?>governmental initiative. We are all aware, as we
move towards individual elector registration and deal with the problems
of underregistration, particularly among young people, that the
Government cannot do it all on their own and do not have all the
answers, so we enormously welcome the engagement of as many voluntary
groups of this sort as possible.</hs_para>

Lord will be aware that Bite the Ballot has developed a schools
programme, Rock Enrol!, which is now also on the gov.uk website. We are
encouraging schools to play that with 16 and 17 year-olds. We are also
encouraging schools to continue the citizenship education programme;
there will be a new element of that for the national curriculum this
September. We are all conscious that PSHE has never been quite as good

bodies you can never be entirely sure that they will do exactly what it
was that you wanted. There are five organisations for which the
Government have today announced funding. In addition to those two which
I have mentioned the Hansard Society, in partnership with Homeless
Link, Gingerbread, which works with young people, single parents and
social housing tenants, and Mencap, which works with people with
learning disabilities, have also received

Lord Bishop of St Albans:</Member></B> My Lords, the Church of England
is involved in the education of more than 1 million young people and we
want to play our part in supporting this. Will Her Majesty’s
Government talk with the department to see if, in future, they will
write not only to schools but to the 43 statutory diocesan boards of
education, many of which employ full-time schools workers, and to
dioceses? My diocese has an average of 30 to 40 full-time paid youth
workers and many volunteer ones. We would be delighted to use our

that they alone cannot do everything in this regard. We welcome
conversations with all other organisations. I wondered whether the
right reverend Prelate was going to promise that the Church of England
would give sermons on the subject. Once, when I was a parliamentary
candidate, I was taken by a young woman called Liz Barker—the
noble Baroness, Lady Barker, as she is now—to the Methodist
church 
<?notus-xml column=87?>in which her father had been a minister. The sermon

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, that is a huge question
which engages—or should engage—all of us in political
parties and beyond. We recognise that alienation, of the younger
generation in particular, from conventional politics is a problem which
has developed over the last 25 years or more and it will take 25 years
or more to reverse that trend. It will take a whole host of initiatives

the problems of teaching citizenship in schools. According to the

Lord Bishop of Wakefield:</Member></B> My Lords, last year, I was
fortunate to spend a couple of nights with a Muslim family in Batumi,
and the next morning I met the president of the semi-autonomous region
there, Mr Archil Khabadze. I pressed the question to him of why there
was only one mosque for something like 110,000 out of the 150,000
people, that being the number of Muslims in the city. He said that at
that time they would take immediate steps to find more land made
available for Muslims in that city. I said that I would be coming back
in the next three months to open the mosque with other religious
groups. Would Her Majesty’s Government please press the
authorities to make sure that the local administration there is asked
to fulfil the promise that they made; otherwise, these very open
Muslims will soon become
radicalised<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:51:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="14020486000363" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000363">Baroness
Warsi:</Member></B> The right reverend Prelate raises a really
important issue. His Question prompted me to go away and do some
research, and I was quite intrigued to find out that just over 10% of
Georgia’s population are indeed Muslim—a much larger
percentage than in our own communities. The right reverend Prelate will
be aware that one of the challenges in Georgia is that the Muslim
community is not particularly well engaged politically and therefore
does not really put its head above the parapet. I have become aware of
low-level discrimination and tensions towards the Muslim community
there, but as Georgia moves towards closer EU integration part of its
requirement is to fulfil its obligation to bring in anti-discrimination
laws<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:52:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000022"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Berridge" PimsId="5916" UID="14020486000364" xid="2126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000364">Baroness

by actual violent hostility towards Muslims in some areas, but a gay

the authorities. Would the Government continue gently to press the

Warsi:</Member></B> The noble and right reverend Lord makes an
important point. Indeed, we raised concerns about the violence at the
IDAHO rally in May of last year, for example. LGBT rights, along with
the rights of religious minorities, are a cause for concern. They stem
from the concern in parts of the Georgian Orthodox Church about a
conflict of values—a conflict between Georgian values, which are
laid out in a very orthodox way, and what they see as European values,
and the kind of anti sentiment towards
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000026"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:54:24"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hussein-Ece" PimsId="5766" UID="14020486000368" xid="2040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000368">Baroness
Hussein-Ece (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend the
Minister agree that this is part of a wider problem, not just in
Georgia but in Moldova, Belarus and Russia, in that there is a lack of
legislation that outlaws this type of inequality, and the ostracism of
people from minority groups, which keeps them out of employment,
education and political participation? The problem is not just in
Georgia. Can my noble friend say what can be done to address
it—and indeed homophobia—across the region in a more

Warsi:</Member></B> This is one of the underlying themes of the Eastern
Partnership. Georgia is one of six countries that are part of it. At
the Vilnius conference at the end of last year there was a process of
trying to encourage these countries to look towards Europe and go
forward to signing association agreements, and deep and comprehensive
fair trade agreements. This was all about trying to bring these
countries to a place where the values that we hold dear become part of
the norm. Our concern is that even where legislation is introduced it
is not properly implemented. Sometimes legislation can have an
alienating effect, as it had in Georgia when specific legislation
passed in 2011 meant that Georgian Muslims were regulated by the
Georgian Muslim department—which felt to the Muslim community
there like a sad return to the Soviet
era<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T14:55:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

my first debate on the question of an English Parliament at a
conference in Edinburgh in 1968. It is not a new question for any of us
here. The problem is that while you can begin to carve up parts of
northern England into recognisable regions, once

the Barnett formula, the Welsh people are unjustly deprived of about
£300 million per annum. Looking at it in the wider context, is

hours of the documents coming to light, the Prime Minister instructed
the Cabinet Secretary to carry out an urgent investigation in four
critical areas: why advice was provided to the Indian authorities, what
the nature of that advice was, what impact it had on Operation Blue
Star, and whether Parliament was misled. The Cabinet Secretary was not
asked to investigate Operation Blue Star itself, or the actions of the
Indian Government, or other events relating to the Sikh community in
India. While the Cabinet Secretary has investigated these specific
matters, I can make clear that during his investigation no
circumstantial evidence has been offered, or has surfaced, of UK
involvement in any subsequent military operations in the
Punjab.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000064">This
investigation has been rigorous and thorough. The Cabinet Secretary and

have examined <I>Hansard</I> records from 1984 to the present day, and
they have carried out an extensive and thorough search of the files
held by all relevant departments and agencies from December 1983 to

destroyed in November 2009 as part of a routine process undertaken by
the Ministry of Defence at the 25-year review point. This included one
file on the provision of military advice to the Indian authorities on
their contingency plans for Sri Harmandir Sahib. However, copies of at

Cabinet Secretary’s investigation is now complete. Copies of the
report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and it is now
being published on the government website. The report includes the
publication of the relevant sections of five extra documents that 
<?notus-xml column=96?>shed light on this period, but which would not
normally have been published. We have taken this step because the whole
investigation has been based on a commitment to the maximum possible
transparency. We want to be as open as possible with the British
public, in so far as that does not undermine the principle upheld by
successive British Governments of not revealing any information
relating to intelligence or Special
Forces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000067">The
main findings of the Cabinet Secretary’s report are as follows.
First, on why the UK provided advice to the Indian Government, the
Cabinet Secretary has established that in early February 1984, the then
Government received an urgent request to provide operational advice on
Indian contingency plans for action to regain control of the temple
complex. The British high commission in India recommended that the
Government respond positively to the request for bilateral assistance
from a country with which we had an important relationship. This advice
was accepted by the then
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000068">Secondly,
the Cabinet Secretary then examined the nature of the advice that was
provided to India following that decision. He has established that a
single British military adviser travelled to India between 8 and
17 February 1984 to advise the Indian intelligence services
and special group on contingency plans they were drawing up for
operations against armed dissidents in the temple complex, including
ground reconnaissance of the site. The adviser’s assessment made
clear that a military operation should be put into effect only as a
last resort, when all attempts at negotiation had failed. It
recommended including in any operation an element of surprise and the
use of helicopter-borne forces, in the interests of reducing casualties
and bringing about a swift
resolution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000069">This
giving of military advice was not repeated. The documents show that the
decision to provide advice was based on an explicit recommendation to
Ministers that the Government should not contemplate assistance beyond
the visit of the military adviser, and this was reflected in his
instructions. The Cabinet Secretary found no evidence in the files or
from discussion with officials involved that any other form of UK
military assistance—such as equipment or training—was
given to the Indian authorities. The Cabinet Secretary’s report
therefore concludes that the nature of the UK’s assistance was
purely advisory, limited and provided to the Indian Government at an
early stage in their
planning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000070">Thirdly,
the report examines what actual impact UK advice had on the Indian
operation, which took place between 5 and 7 June 1984, over three
months later. The report establishes that during that
period the planning by the Indian authorities had changed
significantly. The number of dissident forces was considerably larger
by that time, and the fortifications inside the site were more
extensive<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T15:16:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
documents also record information provided by the Indian intelligence
co-ordinator that after the UK military adviser’s visit in
February, the Indian army took over lead responsibility for the
operation and the main concept behind the operation
changed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000071">The
Cabinet Secretary’s report includes an analysis by current
military staff of the extent to which the actual operation in June 1984
differed from the approach 
<?notus-xml column=97?>recommended in February by the UK military adviser.
Operation Blue Star was a ground assault, without the element of
surprise, and without a helicopter-borne element. The Cabinet
Secretary’s report therefore concludes that the UK military
officer’s advice had limited impact on Operation Blue Star. This
is consistent with the public statement on 15 January 2014 by the
operation commander, Lieutenant-General Brar, who said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14020486000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000304">“no
one helped us in our planning or in the execution of the
planning”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="14020486000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000072">It
is also consistent with an exchange of letters between Mrs Gandhi and
Mrs Thatcher on 14 and 29 June 1984 discussing the
operation, which made no reference to any UK assistance. Those parts of
the letter relevant to Operation Blue Star are published with the
Cabinet Secretary’s report
today.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14020486000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000073">The
Cabinet Secretary has also examined two other concerns raised in this
House and by the Sikh community; namely, that Parliament may have been
misled, or that the decision to provide advice may have been linked to
UK commercial interests. The report finds no evidence to substantiate
either of these allegations. The investigation did not find any
evidence in the files or from officials of the provision of UK military
advice being linked to potential defence or helicopter sales, or to any
other policy or commercial issue. There is no evidence that the UK, at
any level, attempted to use the fact that military advice had been
given on request to advance any commercial objective. The only UK
request of the Indian Government, made following the visit, was for
prior warning of any actual operation, so that UK authorities could
make appropriate security arrangements in London. In the event, the UK
received no warning from the Indian authorities before the operation
was launched.</hs_para>

Cabinet Secretary also concludes that there is no evidence of
Parliament being misled. There is no record of a specific question to
Ministers about practical British support for Operation Blue Star, and
he concludes that the one instance of a Written Question to Ministers
related to discussions with the Indian Government on behalf of the Sikh
community after the
operation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000075">In
sum, the Cabinet Secretary’s report finds the nature of the
UK’s assistance was purely advisory, limited and provided to the
Indian Government at an early stage; that it had limited impact on the
tragic events that unfolded at the temple months later; that there was
no link between the provision of this advice and defence sales; and
that there is no record of the Government receiving advance notice of
the operation. Nonetheless, we are keen to discuss concerns
raised by the Sikh community. The Minister responsible for
relations with India, my right honourable friend the Member for East
Devon, will discuss this with Sikh organisations when he meets them
later today. This reflects the strong, positive relationship this
Government have with the British Sikh community, which plays such a
positive role in so many areas of our national
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000076">We are
also determined to look at the wider issues raised by these events
about the management and release of information held by Government.
Under the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010, the 30-year
rule has been superseded by a 20-year rule, 
<?notus-xml column=98?>so that from 2022 all annual releases will be after 20 years.
However, it is not clear at the moment that this change is being
approached in a uniform fashion by all departments. The Prime Minister
has therefore decided to commission a review to establish the position
across government on the annual release of papers and the ability and
readiness of departments to meet the requirements of moving from a 30
to a 20-year rule, including the processes for withholding information.
This review will be carried out by the Prime Minister’s

can undo the loss of life and the suffering caused by the tragic events
at Sri Harmandir Sahib. It is quite right that the concerns that were
raised about UK involvement have been investigated. It is a strength of
our democracy that we are always prepared to take an unflinching look
at the past. But I hope this investigation and the open manner in which
it has been conducted will provide reassurance to the Sikh community,

the Prime Minister of India, later that same year. We welcome what

Lords are of course aware of the continuing pain felt by the Sikh
community around the world—not least in this country—at
those events and the deaths and destruction that they caused, but also
at the anti-Sikh violence following the assassination of Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi and the emergency period 
<?notus-xml column=100?>that followed which saw arbitrary arrests and
accusations of torture, rape and disappearances, some still unresolved
today. While of course there are differences within the Sikh community
over the issue of a separate Sikh state, there is unanimity in their
horror at these events. For British Sikhs particularly perhaps over
recent years, there has been the added burden that their own Government
may—may—have been involved in these actions. We believe
that the Government have a continuing responsibility to address the
widespread concerns and fears that still exist. Do they agree? If they

about the terms of reference which applied to the investigation. The
terms of reference were set out by the Prime Minister in the other
place during PMQs on 15 January. He focused on establishing the facts
about the UK’s involvement. They were: to look at why the
Government provided advice to the Indian authorities, the nature of the
UK assistance and the impact of that assistance. The terms of reference
of the review were not narrowed in any way; indeed, they were widened
to take account of some of the areas of concern that were raised. These
included ensuring that all further concerns were addressed. There was
no delay in publishing the terms of reference. We were not committed to
publishing them from the

feeling within the British Sikh community and indeed in the Sikh
community across the wider world. These events are still raw and form
part of a discussion among young Sikhs who were not even born at the
time the tragedy occurred. Of course, as we approach the 30th

the British Government to be involved in matters which I am sure noble

repeating the Statement, and I ask her to extend those thanks to the
Cabinet Secretary for the open and transparent way in which he has
carried out the investigation. No matter where we stood at the time of
the attack on Sri Harmandir Sahib, the Golden Temple, it is clear that
the revelations have been a shock to almost all the Sikh community, not

Golden Temple, the holiest temple, which many of us have visited, is a
place of tranquillity and peace. It is of the deepest significance to
the Sikh community, and as has rightly been pointed out, this matter is
being discussed all over the world. The Prime Minister has visited the
Golden Temple at Amritsar, and he then also visited the site of the
Jallianwala Bagh where, as colleagues will recollect, the massacre of a
large number of Indians was committed on the orders of General Dyer.
The Prime Minister was good enough to offer an apology at that stage.

involvement in this episode at that

to the subject of discussion here. The reason for what the Prime

that there was a terrible, tragic massacre in which the United Kingdom

involved Indian forces. The question that I had to address at the

Amrik Singh is part of the delegation of individual organisations and
individuals who are meeting with Minister Swire, but if that is not the
case and he is not part of that meeting, I will certainly see whether
appropriate contact could be made. As I said, I will be making contact
myself with members of the Sikh community in the coming weeks and
months. There is a wide range of opinion. I had the opportunity to
discuss the matter at some length with the noble Lord, Lord Singh, and
my honourable friend Paul Uppal, who is the only Member of Parliament
of Sikh origin in the House of Commons. Quite a breadth of opinion has
come back from the Sikh community about how far the British Government
are expected to go to satisfy certain elements of that community. I
completely take on board how raw this issue is—and how raw
Operation Blue Star is—and to what extent certain elements of
the community wish there to be a truth and reconciliation process.

outlined that the processes regarding the non-disclosure of information
are going to be the subject of a further inquiry. Looking at the
Statement from the Government, it appears that it was fortuitous that
certain documents were copied into other departmental files, as the
whole file was destroyed at the Ministry of Defence’s 25-year
review. We are grateful for what appears to be that fortuitous copying
of documents, but is the correct inference that, without it, a
comprehensive file would not have been retained for this inquiry to
base its conclusions on? How is that going to be part of the ongoing
inquiry when that review, presumably, will be done now by the Ministry
of Defence at 15 years for a 20-year release of information? Could that

bit more speed can help the reconciliation process. Secondly, is one of
the lessons that understanding religious sensitivities is something the

go beyond the remit of the Statement today. I go back to what I said
before; I had an opportunity to visit Jallianwala Bagh. In many ways,
this is much more personal to me than it may be to other noble Lords in
the House as I am deeply connected to it in terms of my own family
connections back to the Punjab. What the Prime Minister did in both
visiting Jallianwala Bagh and saying what he said meant a lot to
people—and certainly to my grandmother, who is still alive.
History always judges matters in a different way but the Prime Minister
has certainly tried to put the record

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, compared with some of the
amendments before us this afternoon, this one is pretty straightforward
and also pretty fundamental. We on this side of the House support the
principle of extending competition in the non-residential retail sector
of water, partly because we have been impressed by the progress made
and experience in Scotland. There, not only have businesses and public
bodies benefited from competition within the sector but also there
appears to be benefit for the household sector from improved efficiency
driven by that competition. That is a good model but of course history
does not always repeat itself. We have a very different structure here
in England and Wales, and markets are funny things. You cannot predict
how the knock-on effects of introducing competition will work out in
either the short or medium
term.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000120">The
Government have made it clear that they do not at this juncture wish to
give powers to extend competition into the household sector directly.
The logic of competition in the non-domestic sector may well lead to
improved efficiency but could equally lead to much tighter margins in
the incumbent companies. Ideally, there would be other ways of
compensating for those tighter margins but there would be a temptation
for companies to restore their margins effectively through higher costs
or less good customer service to the 
<?notus-xml column=107?>household sector. We know that that is not the
intention of the Government, nor of the Opposition in supporting the
Government in the principle of the move in this respect. We also know
that Ofwat will use codes and charging regimes to try to prevent such a
thing happening to the disadvantage of the household sector. However,
would it not be sensible for this essential principle to be embedded
right up front in the
Bill?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000121">I am
sure that the Government will argue that this is probably not the right
place for it but, because of the way the Bill is constructed and the
slightly obscure way that retail competition comes in the redraft
of 20 year-old legislation, the introduction of retail
competition does not exactly leap off the pages of the Bill. Therefore,
it would be sensible to put the qualification in
early.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000122">Accepting
Amendment 1 would ensure that there is no ambiguity and that the
intention of the Bill is to introduce retail competition in the
non-domestic sector, but with no disadvantage in either price or in
kind to the domestic sector. In addition to Amendment 1, Amendment 121
in this group would require Ofwat to keep an eye on the relativity
between non-household and household charges. Amendment 45 reflects the
need not to disadvantage the household sector by either price or lower
service in relation to setting charges and establishing codes, which
Ofwat is required to do under the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000123">Amendment

setting different retail price caps for household and non-household in
the current price review will ensure that households do not subsidise

be certain that household customers will not cross-subsidise retail
competition because there are separate wholesale and retail price
limits. The costs of implementation for upstream reforms will be
shared, as will the benefits. It is not desirable to prevent that, as
this would also isolate household customers from the benefits of this
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000129">We

Crickhowell (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I might take this
opportunity right at the start of the Committee to make two general
observations. First, I cannot think of any complicated Bill which has
been so admirably handled as this one has, so far, by my noble friend
Lord De Mauley. He has had a series of briefing meetings trying to
explain the complexities of the Bill and has taken infinite trouble to
write to those of us who expressed anxieties at Second Reading or
on other occasions and give us reassurance.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020486000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000134">Having said that, this
is an extraordinarily complex Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
indicated in moving his amendment. I am told that there are competitors
but in my 43 years in both Houses, I do not believe that I have ever
had to follow a more incomprehensible Bill. That is because it takes
two major pieces of legislation, and one or two other less relevant
pieces of it, and amends them in a series of complex ways. It then
introduces a whole string of regulations, some of which are not yet
defined and made. Simply finding your way through the Bill to find the
clauses is extraordinarily difficult. When I thought that I might put
down probing amendments to bring out one or two points, I abandoned the
task as I could not begin to see where I could do it.</hs_para>

one other observation. When we are confronted with this kind of
legislation, I wonder whether it would not be better simply to
start 
<?notus-xml column=109?>with a clause which says, “This Bill cancels
and replaces”—or whatever the word might
be—“the following Bills”, so that it presents the
legislation affecting the industry in one comprehensive new Bill which
everyone can follow. What worries me is that once we have completed our
proceedings in this House and the Bill becomes an Act, how on earth are
the general public and those who have to operate it going to discover
easily what the Bill’s contents mean for them? I wonder whether
the Government have yet given any thought to having a clear way in
which they could present things to the public, and indeed to the water
authorities and the new people who we hope will be brought into the
industry. Perhaps they could build on the kind of papers that my noble
friend has so helpfully presented. There is a real problem and I hope
that, as we go through these proceedings, the Government will give
careful thought as to how we tell the British public and those who have
to implement the proceedings what is actually in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:03:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

De Mauley:</Member></B> Perhaps I might quickly respond to that. First,
what I should have done when I spoke first was to thank those noble
Lords who have come to discuss their concerns with the Bill with me.
That has been an extremely informative and helpful process. I am
grateful to my noble friend for his point; he is not the first to say
it. As he kindly says, we have been doing our best to help noble Lords
with the Bill and I will continue to do that. I also take his point

of the whole legislative programme and procedures in both Houses but
his intimate knowledge of the water sector, there is precious
little hope for the rest of us. As for the general public or even those
people who are to operate it within the industry and its regulation,
there are some serious
difficulties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000138">The

mentioned at Second Reading, that the Minister and his officials have
been extremely generous with their time and effort. A lot of those

Bill’s complexity and the difficulty of reflecting it in simple
terms for those who are operating it, let alone the average consumer or

simpler to put something quite straightforward, like my amendment,
right at the beginning of the Bill, so that everybody could understand
it? The Minister has not taken this point fully.</hs_para>

Bill sufficiently to see that there are checks and balances in relation
to the charging system. It is difficult to see how the domestic sector
would, literally, come to subsidise the non-domestic sector as a result
of competition being introduced in 
<?notus-xml column=110?>the latter. However, it is not just about pricing.
If the incumbent is faced with squeezed margins it is not just a
question of banging the price up a bit because that is, by and large,
set for five years and Ofwat would be pretty stringent in ensuring that
it stays. However, you can save money by diminution of service and this
is why I use the word “disadvantage” rather than
referring to cross-subsidy. The sector could suffer from non-price
effects of this if it went wrong and competition, instead of driving
efficiency across the board, as we are told it has done in Scotland,
did not have that effect on the supply to the domestic
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000141">I

of the intricacies of the Bill. This is a probing amendment, designed
to throw some light on the arrangements regarding the so-called market
operator. An electronic search of the Bill fails to reveal a single
instance of the words “market operator”. We have been
alerted to the intention to create this entity by an organisational
flowchart entitled “How Will it All Work?”. This was
provided by Defra officials in the course of a seminar that preceded
the introduction of the Bill to this House. The words are to be found
within a centrally located box that is connected to boxes labelled
“the regulator”, “the retailers” and
“the wholesalers”. I tend to view such charts from the
perspective of the circuit diagrams of electrical engineering, hence I
have anxieties about the dangers of short-circuiting or worse. This
flowchart contravenes all the rules of electrical safety.</hs_para>

the responsibility of the regulator, working

becomes the responsibility of the industry, supported of course by the
oversight of the regulator, which provides the framework. This approach
helps to ensure that the regulator and the industry work together; the
industry will need to adapt to innovation and new circumstances. We
recognise that in this Bill we are promoting innovation and we have to
ensure that the regulation adapts accordingly. The industry will need
to adapt to innovation and these new circumstances, and it is for the
regulator and industry to ensure that working practices are aligned in
the regulatory framework that we are establishing in the Bill. I simply

and the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, for drawing our attention to
this aspect of the reform. 
<?notus-xml column=113?>It is passing strange that, in one of the very nice charts that the
department produced and on which we have been congratulating it, it is
clear that this market operator is the key to how the situation will
play out in practice. We are setting up a market that does not exist,
and we are trying to create and sustain it in a way that on the one
hand gives the Secretary of State certain powers and on the other Ofwat
certain powers, building on its existing
ones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000154">Nowhere
in this legislation are there any specifics about this market operator.
As my noble friend has found out—I did not know this and I am
not sure if any other noble Lord knew—there is a 61-page
document on Open Water’s website telling us what it is doing.
Having tried to fight my way through that document I am not
sure that I am any better informed. Nevertheless, it is clearly
an important body. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, may be right that the
Secretary of State should not be laying down precisely how it
operates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000155">The
Minister owes it to the House at least to put on the record what the
Government expect of this organisation. It has very wide functions. It
is crucial to how the market is going to operate, and has fairly
substantial powers in terms of dealing with relations between existing
companies and with the regulator. This is absent from the legislation,
in even the mildest form. That is a bit bizarre. Its objectives include
registration and switching; financial settlements; market governance;
slightly ambiguously, the enforcement of codes—certainly their
operation and administration—and the operation of the industry
database. It is owned not as a separate, independent stand-alone
company, but by the operators in the industry, which are nine regional
monopolies, or eight if Wales is not involved; I am not entirely sure
about that. It will allow new entrants to come in, which is jolly good
of it. It is not entirely sure whether potential new entrants also have
a role in this in relation to the market operating
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000156">The
organisation’s relationship with Ofwat is not clear. It is not
owned by Ofwat, which it says explicitly. It is not a subdivision of
Ofwat, but is it a contract from Ofwat? Is Ofwat giving these
responsibilities to that organisation that is then run by the industry,
in the way that the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, describes? If so, are
that responsibility and contract ever contestable? There are a lot of
questions here. In some ways, the powers and responsibilities that it
has, and the governance that it appears to have, would have been
familiar to 18th-century economists. They would probably have called it
an institutionalised cartel. I am sure that is not what the
Government intend, but the way it is described in these documents tends
to suggest that it is a fixed market and not as open as the
Government like to

operator. As noble Lords will know, Ofwat is accountable to Parliament
and has a primary statutory duty to protect customers as well as powers
to take action against anti-competitive behaviour under the Competition
Act. Ofwat will oversee the overall operation of the market and ensure
that it is working in the interests of customers, with powers to
intervene if the market operator were acting in any way that was
anti-competitive. For example, Ofwat could take action against the
market operator under the Competition Act 1998 if its activities were
disadvantaging
customers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000161">I
should make it very clear that the market operator is solely a
facilitator with an entirely administrative role. Despite what the
noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, said, it is not a regulator. The market
operator will hold a register of premises eligible to switch. It will
also facilitate switching and financial settlement between incumbent
water companies and licensees. Ofwat will be involved in developing the
licence conditions that will set out how licensees and incumbent water
companies must interact with the market operator. Market codes may also
be used to set out some aspects of these arrangements. The market

somewhat wider than the Bill—I see that the noble Viscount, Lord
Hanworth, looks perplexed—I hope that the following remarks may
be helpful. There are other examples of such companies set up in retail

Perhaps the noble Viscount needs to look at some other 60-page
documents in relation to other utilities. The Metering Point
Administration Service company administers switching in the UK
electricity market and Xoserve does the same for gas. These are not
exactly household names because they do not come into contact with the
public. They are private companies set up for and by participants in
regulated markets to operate silently in the background. None of these
companies was established under statute and none has had its respective

the Companies Act 2006 and will have to prepare accounts and reports in
accordance with that Act. Decisions will have to be made in the future
on whether the retail market operator or another body should operate in
the upstream market. If there were to be an upstream market operator it
would not have roles around the inputting of water or withdrawals of
sewage that would properly fall to the Drinking Water Inspectorate or
the Environment Agency. The market operator’s role is likely to
be limited to registering arrangements and verifying quantities of
water input and consumed to facilitate financial settlement

Whitty:</Member></B> Amendment 3 is the first of a number of amendments
that we will propose from the Opposition Front Bench on engagement with
the Consumer Council for Water. It is important to recognise that one
of the main players in the water sector has been the Consumer Council
for Water. The Minister referred to me bringing in the 2003 Bill, which
was when we took the Consumer Council for Water out of Ofwat and made
it an independent, self-standing, statutory consumer body. While there
has been a lot of change in statutory consumer bodies over the years,
the consumer council has played an important role. While it has
supported the regulator’s focus on the consumer, it has also
challenged it. There has been a reasonable relationship between Ofwat
and the consumer council. In recent years, Ofwat has encouraged some
greater sense of responsibility on the part of the water companies and
set up consumer challenge groups, which have fed into the boards of
those companies. The Consumer Council for Water has helped to
facilitate that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:30:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
It is therefore important that that relationship is fully
institutionalised.</hs_para>

many ways, given that water is an essential part of our lives,
including for individuals, families and businesses, the consumer end
should be fully represented in all processes. The Consumer Council for
Water is in a good position to do that and its role should be reflected
in the Bill. At some points it is reflected in the Bill, but not at
others—or not fully. The Minister may say that the amendment is
flawed because it refers to the Consumer Council for Water, whereas the
rest of the Bill refers simply to “the council”, which in
the glossary of terms means the Consumer Council for Water. I have used
the formulation in the amendment in case of any change in the statutory
status of the consumer council because there are fairly rapid changes
in that area, as I well
know<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:31:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

council is not involved, and in which it is not listed as a consultee,
is the granting of licences to the water undertaker in the first place,
which is covered by this clause. I am not in any sense suggesting that
the Consumer Council for Water should have a veto over the granting of
a licence, but it should be one of the consultees before a licence is
given, renewed or modified. For that reason, I tabled the amendment. I
hope that the Minister will see the logic of what I am saying. It is
part of the need for a much wider consumer dialogue within the water
sector so 
<?notus-xml column=117?>that consumers understand the enormous and complex
needs of the industry, and the management and regulation of the
industry takes full account of the consumer voice. I beg to

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,

amendments concern the licence authorisations that relate to inputting
water to the network, and the noble Lord is clearly well aware of that
point. This means that they relate solely to the relationship between
water supply licensees and the incumbent water companies, rather than
that between licensees and customers. Before issuing a wholesale or
supplementary authorisation, Ofwat must consult the Environment Agency,
Natural Resources Wales and the Drinking Water Inspectorate. This is
not least because they can provide intelligence on any prospective
licensees that are trying to operate in this area. The purpose of this
is to ensure that these parties are fit and proper persons for the
purpose of operating in the new
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000173">We
would like CCWater to continue carrying out its valuable work of
protecting customers and handling customer complaints. It is worth
noting that Ofwat already publishes a notice on its website asking for
comments from interested parties before it issues a licence with either
a retail or restricted retail authorisation. CCWater therefore has the
opportunity to respond on any issues that might affect customers at
this point. I hope that any concerns, as identified by the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, can be addressed in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:34:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope that
he is reassured by this and is willing to withdraw the

Whitty:</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness for those comments. She
is right that these clauses deal with the relationship between
new bulk suppliers and the incumbents, but that has a significant
effect on the nature of the market beyond that. If the purpose of this
consultation is to establish whether the newcomers negotiating a
relationship with the incumbent are fit and proper persons, one issue
is the effect on consumers down the line. I accept that Ofwat is open
to people writing in, but why is the statutory consumer organisation
not one of those listed to give a view in the first place? We are
changing the market, and there should be a consumer view on how that
market is changing and who is entering that market. I am looking not
for a veto, but for an input. I hope that the Government will think
slightly more. It would not cost them that much to add a new paragraph
(e) to this subsection, and it would be consistent with what is done
later in the Bill—admittedly on parts closer to the
consumer—and with the established legislation and
regulations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:36:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I

Earl of Selborne:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to, I
think, 32 amendments in this group. I am conscious of the fact that my
noble friend Lord Crickhowell said that this Bill started hopelessly
complicated, and I suspect that I stand charged by him with trying to
make it ever more complicated—and I do so. This is because I am
asking the Minister to ensure that the threat of moving towards
de-averaging—something neither the Government nor any of us
want—is not going to be advanced by the fundamental concept
incorporated in the competition aspects of the Bill. That concept is
the provision of a direct link between an upstream service provider,
whether water or sewerage, and a retailer to non-household
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000176">The
position under the Bill is that the customer can contract directly with
a resource provider. This may well bring lower charges to
some customers, if, for example, a new entrant is able to offer a water
supply at a price lower than the average price that the incumbent water
company is able to charge. In a negotiated market, there
will be a range of attributes that will favour one supplier over
another. That is desirable and helpful. Price is one such key factor.
If, as is possible here, large, non-household customers successfully
negotiate on price alone—without respect to the other services
that we are expecting to be provided in terms of environmentally
friendly services, water savings and much else—that will favour
one supplier over another. Eventually, this will result in a situation
in which we will drift inexorably towards a two-tier market
with the principle of average prices for all customers
abandoned. It follows that smaller non-household customers and anyone
located in remoter rural areas will face increased
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000177">If
we think that this is a remote possibility, we should bear in mind that
it has actually happened already. In Wales, the Shotton case set a
precedent that local costs were required to be used in a ruling in
setting prices under bilateral deals. I am told that this was a one-off
and that it will not happen anywhere else. However, when I hear that it
has happened, and that there is a threat, I say that this is the
opportunity to make sure that it does not happen again. I am sure that
we shall look at other proposals as we go through the Bill to ward off
the threat of
de-averaging.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000178">This

The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to remove the direct link
between the provider of resource services and the retailer. It would
remove any opportunity for a large corporation to act in a way that was
detrimental to all other
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000179">Under

I am not entirely clear that this is the case, and I hope that the

really be expected to manage the impact of de-averaging to prevent any
unfairness between customers, especially rural customers, when

that the Minister clarify the extent of this issue. We have received
advice from Scotland—the economics consultancy Oxera and
Scottish Water undertook analysis into the impact on customers, were
de-averaging to have taken place in Scotland. Under the Scottish
Government’s rules, the policy is to rule it out. However, Oxera
found that even on very conservative assumptions, many businesses could
see their charges rising by at least 25% and, in a fully de-averaged
scenario, some customers in Scotland could end up paying up to 10 times
their current bill. That is evidence that we have received on one
hand.</hs_para>

on the other hand, the Bill focuses on choice. Retail services account
for something like 10% of the non-household bill—which accounts
for something like 20% of the total bill—so approximately 2% of
the amount would be in this sector. I would be grateful if the Minister
could highlight the seriousness and impact of this issue in terms of
its scale. Does he agree with the figures of Oxera put forward by our
friends north of the Border, who have done some outstanding work in
generating competition in this sector? If so, and if that is to be

introduced highly successful arrangements from 2008. It is very clear

our view the prudent course of action would be to remove the direct
link between the provider of resource services and the

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments, tabled by my noble
friends Lord Selborne and Lord Moynihan, seek to introduce a
fundamental change which would narrow the approach to upstream
competition in this Bill by removing the link between upstream
arrangements and retail arrangements with customers. They would mean
that licensees would be able to make arrangements with incumbent water
companies to provide water and sewerage services without needing to
have a specific customer to consume the water or use the sewerage
services through the retail market. The implication is therefore that
the market might be established through incumbents tendering for new
resources under a so-called single buyer model. This would be a
significant change from the regime that has been in place since the
Water Act 2003 and which we propose to extend through this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:50:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

provides common carriage rights to licensees who want to provide their
customers with water resources or sewerage treatment services using
incumbents’ networks. Common carriage is the term used when new
entrants are given rights to use incumbents’ networks to provide
services to their customers. A single buyer approach is a very
different model with decisions on tendering for water supplies or
sewerage services resting with the incumbent. It provides fewer rights
and less flexibility for new
entrants<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:50:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

brought in a specific common carriage regime for new entrants to access
the public supply system by making water supply a licensable activity.
Under this regime, the same licensee that puts the water into the
system must supply the retail services to the customer. The Bill
reforms the existing regime by allowing different licensees to input
water and provide retail services to eligible customers, but still
requires there to be a specific customer. There is nothing in existing
legislation that prevents incumbent water companies from making
arrangements with third-party water suppliers or sewerage service
providers to input water into the system or deal with sewerage
disposal. Indeed, we are pleased to see that Thames Water has gone to
the market to see which third parties could provide it with water in
order for it to meet future water resource needs. Potential suppliers
to Thames Water do not need a water supply licence to be able to make
an input under this tendering process. There is no need to amend the
Bill to make it possible for third-party suppliers to sell water to
incumbents, should we feel this is the right way to go in the future.
Clause 12 is designed to enable
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:52:17"></hs_TimeCode>. The Bill
also provides for licensees to withdraw waste water and sludge from the
sewerage system through the disposal authorisation in the sewerage
licence. This could be used by Ofwat to introduce a similar model to a
single buyer arrangement in the sewerage market if it feels that this
would be
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:52:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are seeking to bring in new resources and introduce more innovation
into the sector. My noble friends’ amendments would allow 
<?notus-xml column=122?>incumbents to dictate the future direction of
upstream markets. This would reduce pressure on those incumbents to
introduce efficiencies that will benefit customers and the environment
because only those licensees that are able to bid for and win contracts

indicated that the main objective of the amendments is to remove risks
connected with the de-averaging of water charges. As the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, said, that is something which we will come to in a little
more detail in the next group of amendments, but I hope that your
Lordships will allow me to say a few words on it now in response to the
contributions that have been made. There is a crystal clear steer from
the Government in our charging principles that Ofwat must not allow
de-averaging that is harmful to customers. Ofwat has all the necessary
regulatory tools to enable it to limit the effect of de-averaging on
customer charges. Ofwat has clearly stated that it believes that these
tools are sufficient. The Government’s charging principles make
it plain that Ofwat must use these tools to ensure that any
de-averaging or cost reflectivity is in the overall interests of
customers. Two independent experts have reviewed the issue of
de-averaging: Professor George Yarrow for Ofwat and Professor Martin
Cave for the Consumer Council for Water. Both experts confirmed that
Ofwat can facilitate upstream competition without any de-averaging.
De-averaging has not happened in other regulated utility sectors, even
though greater proportions of those markets are open to competition,
and it is no more likely to happen in the water
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000196">I
stress again that the Bill puts in place a framework that enables
household customers to be protected against any changes to their bills

customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:55:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Selborne raised the case of Shotton as a legal precedent to support the
case that de-averaging is a real risk. It is a complex and long-running
case, but I hope I can persuade him that it is a misunderstanding to
describe it as a case of de-averaging. Shotton was a very unusual case
and it is not appropriate to extrapolate from it more widely. For
example, it concerned a discrete system that served only two customers,
one of which was served by Albion Water. This is very rare. To give
some context, the case only represented 0.01% of Welsh Water’s
turnover. At the time of the dispute, this agreement was not subject to
regulation by Ofwat. The Bill includes measures that will bring all
such transfers within the scope of the regulatory regime. Ministerial
guidance and Ofwat’s charging rules will therefore set out how
charges between water companies and inset appointees such as Albion
Water should be determined in
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000198">My
noble friend raised the concern that EU competition law might require
that indiscriminate de-averaging takes place, affecting both business

In fact, it is common practice in both regulated and unregulated
sectors. The obvious examples are the gas, electricity and telecoms
sectors.

almost irrelevant. When we have an example of a court case which has

price between two willing parties, only if the undertaker can
demonstrate that it will strand some of his assets, so that overheads
impact unfavourably on other people served in that area? That is why
you cannot allow cherry picking of this sort on a sufficient

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, some of the issues covered by Amendment
9 have been discussed in the previous group. I do not entirely disagree
with the Minister’s response on common carriage, in terms of how
water gets delivered and having as broad a range of potential new
retailers as possible. However, the outcome seems to be that if you
have de-averaged prices, you have discrimination between users. Whether
all the structural amendments—some in this group and some in the
previous group with the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord
Selborne—would be necessary to prevent that, the Bill ought to
enunciate that principle. At the end of the day, we do not want a
market where the easiest route leads to suppliers cherry picking and to
a two- or three-tier market for the final delivery of water to
businesses, public authorities and so forth—the non-domestic
retail
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000207">In
one sense, Scotland shows us what the benefit to business, and the
knock-on effect to the domestic side, has been. It has been not in
differentiated prices but in better service, in driving water
efficiency both in the delivery and use of water, in better means of
dealing with waste water, in better water treatment in specialist cases
and in disposal of water and waste. If you put competition wholly on
the price side, you will not get those advantages. It will be easy for
a supplier, on the supply side, to have a more accessible or more
cheaply accessible source of water at the upstream level to bring to
its business consumers or, on the demand side, to have a group of
businesses and other institutions taking advantage of its terms because
they are all fairly close together and all have similar requirements,
and therefore there are economies of scale in actually supplying that
institution.</hs_para>

not think that the Government envisaged—and nor did we on this
side—the increasing competition in the retail sector as being
primarily about wholesale price. Reassuring noises have been made about
Ofwat having the ability to ensure that de-averaging does not take

quite attractive. Unless Ofwat has a clear line, which this amendment
would give them, that the wholesale price and therefore the
retail price of wholesale water would not be differentiated by
location, we will get some differentiation of outcome. We will get
cherry picking and we will get distortion. It will hit
particularly the more remote rural areas and rural businesses in those
areas; it will hit particularly businesses in rundown parts of the
inner city, where not many of them are inclined to negotiate deals with
the company; and it will hit businesses where it is difficult to see
how a new arrangement would

there is an overall presumption that there should be no de-averaging
then it is quite easy to see how the market would end up with that. It
may be that Ofwat’s powers would be exerted to prevent
that, but this Bill does not require Ofwat to do so. The terminology
that de-averaging would exist only if there was an “overall
benefit” to consumers makes it quite difficult to assess. You
have an example of de-averaging which clearly might benefit the
immediate consumers who are benefiting from that de-averaged price, but
how do you then assess its effect in the short and medium
term on consumers as a whole? It is quite a difficult judgment for
Ofwat. If the outcome the Government want is that which has been
delivered in other quasi-utility markets—largely it has
been—why not actually tell Ofwat to deliver that? Surely it
would be easier.</hs_para>

hope that the Government take this slightly more seriously. It will not
necessarily unravel their whole approach to competition in this Bill.
It is simply giving Ofwat an explicit duty that will deliver an outcome
the Government say they want. The Government should not fundamentally
object to this amendment. It may require a bit of back-up along the
lines the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, has suggested already, but it
requires at least the principle to be reflected in the Bill. Otherwise,
we will get cherry picking and we will get discrimination, which is
unlikely to drive the kind of efficiencies that we have been praising
the Scottish system for delivering. I beg to

I do not see competition as incompatible with de-averaging. It is
possible to invest efficiently in the overall infrastructure and still
charge your customers competitively, based on an average cost per

water adequate for the demand. That obviously means we must manage the

all sorts of snares and pitfalls in the way of Ofwat’s best

of amendments, I thank noble Lords for some articulate speeches about a
complicated issue. It is one that we take very seriously. As noble
Lords said in earlier debates, this is not an easy area to get
one’s head around. Specifically on de-averaging, when we
talk about averaging or de-averaging of costs, we are discussing how
best to share the costs of sourcing and disposing of water between
customers. Most providers of goods and services average their costs to
some extent.</hs_para>

my view, it makes sense to share the costs of maintaining the network
on which all customers rely across all customers, regardless of their
location. The 
<?notus-xml column=128?>network makes up about 90% of a water
company’s assets, so when we discuss de-averaging in the context
of the Bill, we are talking only about charges in the competitive part
of the market, which accounts for about 10% of the companies’
activity<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:18:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I
think that many noble Lords agree that there could be real benefits
from increasing the cost-reflectivity of charges for different sources
of water to reflect the environmental costs of supply. That is
especially important in water-stressed areas or for business users that
use large volumes of water.</hs_para>

as it may seem, at present, there are almost no economic incentives for
businesses that use large volumes of water to seek out the least
environmentally damaging source of water. Nor are there any economic
incentives to encourage incumbent water companies or new entrants to
the market to help businesses to identify the most environmentally
efficient sources of
water<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:19:02"></hs_TimeCode>. The Bill
is intended to change that. Our upstream reforms will encourage
competition for business customers and incentivise more efficient use

customers and good for the

discussed earlier the measures in place to ensure that householders are
protected. In regard to de-averaging, as I said in the debate on the
previous group, we are clear in our charging principles that
de-averaging must occur only where it is in the best interests of
customers. In answer to my noble friend Lord Moynihan, when we issue
the charging guidance we will make it clear that there must be robust
boundaries on the scope of any de-averaging. In particular, Ofwat will
be expected to exert control to prevent the de-averaging of network
costs and any negative bill impacts that could arise from this. Any
moves to enable greater cost reflectivity will be targeted squarely on
water resource costs in the competitive parts of the market.
This is where there may be social and environmental benefits from
encouraging sharper price signals. The Government are completely
committed to maintaining bill stability. Customers have made it clear
repeatedly that stability is important to them. We will not permit
anything that undermines that
stability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000226">The
charging rules that Ofwat makes, within the framework set by the
Government’s charging guidance, will be flexible. As the
situation changes over time, our guidance and the rules that Ofwat sets

signal that reflects important decisions about our precious water
resources. Using the Bill to ban any kind of price signal would, I
suggest, be disproportionate. At the same time, we want to ensure that
customer bills remain stable and reasonable. The flexible framework of

in the debate that customers could end up paying for stranded assets.
This is a regulated sector and the important question of what costs
should be borne by customers is one for the regulator. In fact, this
point is less about de-averaging than about whether the investment made
by incumbent water and sewerage companies is made efficiently and in
the interests of customers. No one here, I suggest, would think it
right that customers should have to foot

Selborne asked how Ofwat can enforce rules on de-averaging. The

incumbents apportion the costs of the network and distribution. In
making these decisions, it will need to take account of its duties,
which include having regard to rural customers. It will also have to

whether rural customers might lose out. Ofwat will continue to have a
statutory duty to have particular regard to rural customers and the

the protections that will remain for rural customers. They require
Ofwat to ensure that any greater cost reflectivity must provide
benefits to customers. No customers should be unfairly disadvantaged by
the way that reform impacts on water charges. The noble Lord, Lord

agree. Water companies are under a statutory duty to supply and the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:29:23"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
thank noble Lords who have spoken in support of this principle. On this
occasion, I found the Minister’s reply slightly confusing. I
thought that there were some novel parts and a few red herrings in
there. He says he is in favour of robust boundaries to de-averaging
then claims in aid Professor Cave and Professor Yarrow who say Ofwat
have the powers. However, all the amendment asks is that we make those
powers explicit and that we require Ofwat not to discriminate on the
basis of location. There might be certain areas where they could
discriminate but not in relation to location of either source or
customer.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020486000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0001.htm#14020486000232">If
the Minister is saying that that will happen because Ofwat already has
all these duties to ensure everybody is treated fairly, including rural
and remote consumers and so forth, why not stipulate what they are
trying to do in the Bill, rather than through the interaction of
several parts of different codes? The noble Lord’s argument
about discouraging the use of the least environmentally efficient
sources of water was a little unclear. Any individual source of water
from a new provider is a very small part of the totality of the
incumbent company’s activities. Discouraging environmentally
inefficient or damaging sources of water will, and should, be tackled
through the abstraction regime well before the Minister introduces
upstream competition. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, 
<?notus-xml column=130?>and I have amendments to that effect later on. That is, surely, the
direct way to discourage environmentally damaging and inefficient
sourcing of water at the top end.</hs_para>

requirement of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, that water should be
universally delivered is not only a matter of delivering it but doing
so at approximately the same cost wherever you live. That has happened,
under various Acts of Parliament, with water regimes going way back to
private and municipal companies, through nationalisation and every
stage of privatisation. It would be a pity if this legislation, with
all its benefits in improving efficiency at the far end of the water
chain, were to move away from that basic principle. The Minister has
not yet established that there is a good reason for moving away from
that, nor that Ofwat’s existing powers, important though they
are, would necessarily deliver that outcome. We shall probably return
to this subject at a later point. For the moment, I withdraw the

be connected to the neighbouring incumbent water company because it is
located nearer to the latter’s infrastructure. Where this is the

challenge any of the Government’s amendments, even those that I
understand. However, I would ask one question of the Minister. I had
expected to see in this group of amendments, although maybe it will
come later on Report, a response one way or the other to paragraph 12
of the report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee,
where the dehybridisation procedure—or the procedure to remove
the hybridisation procedure—is adopted. It drew the
House’s attention to that and to how it is being dealt with by
the Government. If the Minister is saying that it may come up in a

balance between regulation and negotiation in the water industry is
crucial to this set of amendments. At the heart of the Bill is the
intention to create a market where access is regulated—in other
words, the rules of entry are set out very clearly, and must be adhered
to by all market participants. I am concerned that in some places the
Bill leaves too much too open; it appears to be based on the premise
that the parties within the retail market should negotiate between
themselves on service and price. In my view, that negotiation could
substantially limit the effectiveness of the retail market. Allowing
individual parties to negotiate in this way opens the door to current
incumbents to discriminate against new retailers by offering them
higher prices, less preferable terms or poorer service levels.
Alternatively, and perhaps more worryingly, current incumbents could
simply be slow in responding to requests for information or services
from new entrants; this would be difficult to
police<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:33:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020486000241">As
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, suggested, in speaking to Amendment 1,
some companies may change their allocations of retail costs to ensure
that as little revenue as possible is at risk under the new market
arrangements. The result of those changes is to reduce the amount of
revenue that is open to competition and, potentially, to reduce the
margin available to any new entrant. If allowed to stand, that move by
the companies may reduce the level of entry into the new retail market.
That would be a very serious issue indeed and, I hope, will not result
from this

is interesting to note the experience and views of the Water Industry
Commission for Scotland, which opines that it could be difficult for
Ofwat to put a framework in place that will allow the regulator to
ensure that there is an effective level playing field for all
market participants. It is likely to require relatively
draconian rules to be drafted and policed. Notwithstanding those rules,
some companies may choose to seek to frustrate the operation of the
market or seek to get round the rules or even break them to maximise
profit, which could be to the substantial detriment of all customers
and, indeed, the environment. Having to negotiate on too many issues
could also increase the upfront costs for new entrants, which may deter
them from entering the market—or, if the new entrant does enter
the market, will increase the costs that have to be passed on to
customers. To be effective, a retail market, rather than relying on
negotiation, needs all participants to have access to clear and
accessible prices and to standard terms and conditions. In regulatory
economics, I would describe this kind of access to the market as being
regulated rather than
negotiated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:35:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020486000243">In
Scotland, the retail market is specifically designed to ensure that
there is a level playing field. Scottish Water was required to separate
its retail arm on a functional basis but chose to create an
arm’s-length subsidiary. This has meant that the required
governance

compete on their merits with the incumbent retailer, could be less
onerous than it would otherwise have been. However, the governance code
still requires Business Stream to operate profitably as a standalone
entity; the code also requires it to limit the access of Scottish
Water’s management to its financial and operational information.
Scottish Water is not allowed to know about Business Stream’s
strategy for the competitive market in Scotland. Finally, under the

have equal access to all tariffs, even those that are a result of

the light of that, Clause 23 would impose a new general duty on Ofwat
to exercise its powers and perform its duties in a way that helps to
ensure that no undue preference or discrimination is shown by water and
sewerage companies, including against water and sewerage supply
licensees. As is usual in industry reform legislation, Clause 43 would
also give Ofwat a time-limited power to drive changes to existing
licences, including to companies’ conditions of appointment,
when it considers that those changes are necessary or expedient in
consequence of the new statutory provisions. Ofwat has published
discussion papers that recognise the important role that such licence
conditions play in ensuring a level playing field between existing and
new entrant retailers. However, many believe that there is a deficiency
in Clause 43 as currently drafted which could be exploited by companies
seeking to resist any efforts by Ofwat to make changes to their

are also real risks in leaving such a vital part of a successful market
to be developed and possibly challenged through secondary regulation.
The burden on Ofwat could be lifted by imposing the non-preference,
non-discrimination duty directly on to companies. While general
competition law arguably already prohibits such discrimination,
enforcing such competition law duties has been shown to be a costly and
prolonged process. I am therefore suggesting amendments that, while not
requiring functional separation, would make companies’
non-discrimination duties directly enforceable by Ofwat, using its
existing powers under Section 18 of the Water Industry Act 1991. This
would help reduce the cost of implementing the market reform and
policing and of enforcing effective competition in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020486000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020486000249">The

regulated access with clarity and less emphasis on bilateral
negotiations, and that that regulated access is for everybody. At that
point, anyone entering the market can plug in and play. There should be
no prohibitions put in place as a result of bilateral negotiation. It

has been some confusion as to the wording of some parts of Schedules 2

66DA states that codes may include provisions about procedures in

We need some flexibility about allowing a certain level of negotiation
in some cases, particularly for the upstream markets; negotiations
might address water quality and environmental conditions specific to a
locality in a water company’s area. We also want licensees to
have some flexibility to negotiate innovative new ways of doing things.

participating in this exchange of views. I particularly thank my noble
friend Lord Selborne for his apposite comments. As he is aware, the
Bill anticipates 
<?notus-xml column=137?>a relatively large number of codes. The experience of other industries,
such as the electricity industry, shows the importance of keeping codes
as simple as possible. For example, a single market code could help
ensure that any central market system works by applying the same rules
to all companies and retailers. Similarly, to help create a level
playing field, I very much hope that retailers have a single point of
contact with each water or sewerage company. Each company should have a
code which every retailer must follow. To me that is an essential
prerequisite for operating a successful

thrust of these amendments is to ensure that Ofwat is under a clear

offering them less profitable terms, poorer service levels or simply
being slow to respond to their requests. There are many and insidious
ways in which you can see off competition and Ofwat must have the
powers to enable it to regulate and monitor these special agreements
very carefully. I am confident that the Minister will say that this is
already adequately covered in the Bill. However, in so far as these
amendments would further strengthen the legislation and Ofwat’s
hand—we have all agreed throughout our deliberations this

114 is the so-called no-detriment amendment. It seeks to put on Ofwat a
specific duty to ensure that no detriment is caused to wholesale
business as a result of retail activities. The amendment ensures that
the wholesaler, for example, has no incentive to discriminate unfairly
in favour of retailers who are less active in providing environmentally
desirable services. I referred to that in an earlier amendment. We can
see that if a retailer is actually managing to reduce the demand for
water it might no longer necessarily be to the wholesaler’s
advantage to give that particular retailer the same sort of service as
somebody who was less assiduous in selling such
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:59:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

no-detriment provision ensures that the wholesaler is indifferent to
the efforts of retailers to improve water efficiency or
provide other value-adding environmental services. The operation codes
will go some way to setting out the rules of engagement between
wholesalers and all retailers. The no-detriment provision will give
added protection as it will remove all incentive to discriminate.
Extending the duty of non-discrimination to Ofwat, which I accept is
already there under the terms of the Bill, will ensure that no undue
preference or discrimination takes place. It should help to establish
that Ofwat indeed has all the duties that we would require to
facilitate competition directly. I beg to

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, my name is also on the amendment to
which the noble Earl, Lord Selborne, has just referred. My reason for
putting my name to it was very much the point he was underlining. Only
by some form of no-detriment clause—some of the amendments go
slightly wider—can we protect what is intended to be an
outcome of retail competition, which is more focus on energy and
environmental improvements at the retail-user end and final delivery.
Historically, Ofwat has not been particularly good at being prepared to
finance—if that is the word—through the price review, or
to give priority in the price review to water efficiency schemes. I
think that Ofwat improved a little in the previous price review and it
shows intention to do so again in the next one, but the reality is that
we have not done very well on that front. The introduction of upstream
and, to some extent, retail competition could, if it is not contained,
have an effect on improvements in water efficiency at the retail end,
and the positive move by Ofwat in recent years to focus on water
efficiency could be reversed. I strongly support what the noble Earl,
Lord Selborne, has said on the

am not sure how a no-detriment duty would sit alongside the general

Ministers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:03:13"></hs_TimeCode>. Ofwat
is under a general duty to ensure that incumbents are able to
finance their statutory functions. This duty enables Ofwat to create
the right incentives to ensure that incumbents can benefit from
investments that deliver improved water efficiency in their respective
areas. It is suggested that incumbents may show preference to licensees
that do not concentrate on water efficiency activities. This is
addressed through Clause 23, which requires Ofwat to ensure that
incumbent water companies do not discriminate in the provision of
services. Ofwat is also able to address such issues through its
Competition Act power, which incidentally is a power that WICS does not
have in Scotland.  
<?notus-xml column=140?>In England and Wales, both incumbents and licensees are subject to a
duty under the Water Industry Act 1991 to help their

the licensees’ water efficiency activities could also put them
at a competitive disadvantage if a similar duty was not placed on the
retail side of the incumbent’s business. Why should licensees be
kept under a duty which potentially curbs their water efficiency
activities, while an incumbent’s retail business is allowed to
operate without this barrier? Amendments 46 and 53, in particular, may
be a barrier to licensees working with customers to become more
water-efficient because they impose a condition that any new

any more costs on incumbent water companies. This same requirement is

there is a duty on incumbents to notify Ofwat if they make an
individual charging agreement with a customer that is not covered by a

103 requires any future special agreement to be allowed only if a

increases the costs incurred by an undertaker. Such agreement would
have to receive the consent of Ofwat. In other words, there cannot be a

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend would introduce
changes to the way in which incumbent water companies’ special
charging arrangements for customers operate in the reformed market.
Special charging arrangements come about when incumbent water companies
depart from published charges schemes to allow discounts on the
wholesale element of a water charge where a customer, for example,
agrees to do something to reduce pressure on a network or has made a
contribution to a capital project carried out by an
incumbent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000018">Amendment
103 would require Ofwat to approve special charging arrangements for
licensees before they are put in place. Amendments 44 and 48 remove
powers for Ofwat to introduce charging rules under Schedules 2 and 4
that would allow customers who receive discounts to switch to a
licensee without losing those discounts. Amendments 106, 131, 166 and
169 will initially require incumbents, within one month of Royal
Assent, to notify Ofwat of all existing special charging arrangements
that are in place. However, Ofwat already collects and publishes
information on special charging arrangements on an annual basis, which
means that it is not necessary for the Bill to be changed for Ofwat to
obtain details of historical agreements. The amendments would also
require Ofwat to make and publish a determination about the
appropriateness of these historical charges, publish details of its
determination, and control the charges between the incumbent and the
licensee as well as the price that the licensee can charge the customer
from then on.</hs_para>

of price limits for 2015 to 2020, Ofwat requires incumbent water
companies to separate out the retail and wholesale components
of the charges. Ofwat will be able to assess the appropriateness 
<?notus-xml column=142?>of such charges during this process and introduce
charging rules under Schedules 2 and 4 to ensure that licensees will be
able to access wholesale charges at a competitive rate and compete with
incumbents on the retail element of the special charges. For example,
rules can ensure that costs are properly allocated between the retail
and wholesale elements of the special charge. Ministers will also be
able to give their views on the content of charging
rules.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000020">Importantly,
the change introduced by Clause 33 will place incumbents under an
enforceable duty to report new special charging arrangements to Ofwat
as soon as they are made. Clause 33 comes into force two months after
Royal Assent. This provision also requires Ofwat to publish details of
these arrangements in its register, which is available on its website.
Taken together, Clause 33 and Schedules 2 and 4 deliver most of what my
noble friend wants to achieve through his amendments. Like my noble
friend, we want to increase transparency around the setting of new
special charges to enable the beneficiaries to be able to switch to a
licensee and still retain their discounts on wholesale charges, if
appropriate. As part of the price review process for April 2015, when
new price limits are introduced, Ofwat will be able to assess the
appropriateness of existing special charges ahead of the retail market
opening. With these assurances, I hope that my noble friend will feel
able to withdraw his

noble friend’s response. I think we all agree that special
charges represent a potential Trojan horse and are not to be
encouraged. In so far as they can be transparent, reduced or even
eliminated, that would surely be helpful. I should like to think that
Ofwat would trenchantly make it clear that it is not in favour of
special agreements, and that any special agreements would be published
in a transparent and open way annually, as I understand the Minister
says Ofwat does and will do. Above all, Ofwat should make it clear to
the industry that it does not expect special agreements to be common
practice, and should be countenanced only under exceptional
circumstances. With that assurance from the Minister, I am happy to beg

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendment 97. I am
asking the Committee to consider a rather more radical approach to the
structure of this industry. In earlier debates today, there was
reference to unravelling some of the accounting structures of
companies. Indeed, the Minister referred to the requirement on separate
indication of charging by the retail and wholesale
ends<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:16:20"></hs_TimeCode>. We have to
remember what was said by several of us at Second Reading. This is a
very odd industry. In England, it consists, effectively, of eight
regional monopolies, all of which are totally vertically integrated,
with high profitability over the years since privatisation.
There has also been high investment but there has nevertheless been
high profitability for their owners and high dividends have been paid
out. There has also been a high level of gearing in order to meet those
investments by going to the money markets. Most of them are now owned
by international investment funds although in many cases they have had
a sequence of owners. However, they retain a close resemblance to the
pre-privatisation water
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:17:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has been some degree of breaking up of monopolies in other industries,
including vertical splits, to encourage a more effective form of
competition. The recent report by Martin Cave and Ofwat’s own
assessment of the situation give rise to suggestions that Ofwat, too,
ought to be able to require separation of the wholesale and retail ends
of the currently vertically integrated water companies. When we move to
retail competition, its major feature is likely to be that the retail
arms of other incumbent companies will begin to compete in the areas
that are dominated by the historic incumbent companies. To some extent,
that has happened in Scotland, where English-based companies provide
some of the competition in the non-domestic retail
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:18:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

companies to continue, one way or another, to dominate the scene, even
if they are in more direct competition with each other. As other noble
Lords have said, that means that we have to separate out how those
companies operate on the retail side and consider what the relationship
between the wholesale water undertaker operation and the retail
operation will be. One can do some of that by ring-fencing, separate
accounting, Chinese walling or 
<?notus-xml column=144?>whatever, but we need to consider separation as
legal entities or even disinvestment from one company to another. That
option is not available to Ofwat or, indeed, the CMA, whatever the
performance of companies, the competitive flaws of the market or the
outcome for consumers may be. This argument about where to separate
quasi-monopolies has applied. We have had many debates over recent
years about banking, we have had the situation of the railways and the
issue arose at some length during the debates on the Energy Bill. It is
horses for courses, but the fact that there is no power to require
this, even in a situation which is still pretty well dominated by
regional monopolies, seems to be an
omission<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:20:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000025">There
are reasons why Ofwat and successive Governments have not gone down
this road, one of the main ones being that it might well frighten off
investment. This is a pretty good investment. It has provided a very
substantial return to those people who have invested in the English
water industry over the past 20 or so years. They have had a pretty
good and reliable return. Over the past two price review periods some
would say that, particularly because of the over-allowance by Ofwat for
the costs of capital, they have had an exceptionally good return on
prices which have been designated by the regulator. That is not to say
that a change in the circumstances would not cause some
hesitation on the part of investors, but the reality is that on
whatever basis we operate it will continue to provide a good, safe,
consistent return to international investors. For that reason we should
discount some of the scare stories that surround the issue of enforced
separation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:21:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000026">These
two proposals give the Government an option. Amendment 49 would give
Ofwat, and by extension the CMA in certain circumstances, the power to
mandate separation either for one company, or, following a market
review, for all companies operating in that sector. That is a pretty
substantial increase in their powers, although it is not very different
from what the CMA can do in most markets if it finds that there is a
breach of general competition law. The rather softer alternative which
I think the Government might well consider more is Amendment 97. That
would allow for voluntary separation in certain circumstances or
negotiated separation if Ofwat were to intervene in order to
enforce better competition and better
performance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:22:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000027">Amendment
97 therefore is a minimalist form of separation. Amendment 49 is more
draconian. The Minister can probably guess which I should prefer, but
in this context I would be happy to see the Government take up either.
At some point down the line, the current structure of the water sector
is going to have to be challenged more fundamentally than is done by
the Bill. If we were to give the contingency power to Ofwat now, or
make it easier for the companies themselves or for Ofwat to negotiate
and suggest to companies that they should split, that would give us the
ability to reshape the industry following the introduction of retail
competition even to the degree provided for in the

suspect that the Government are going to be deeply resistant to either
option, but they are wrong. The structure of the industry is not one
which can be

requires significant investment and we do not want to frighten the
investors. On the other hand, we have to face up to the reality that
proper competition, meeting both business and household consumer needs

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, for tabling Amendments 49 and 97, which are about an important
subject, that of separation, whether legal or functional. Legal
separation is what Amendment 49 deals with. The amendment would require
the eight licensed water suppliers currently operating under the
existing water supply licensing regime—so not the incumbent
water companies—to set up legally separated entities for the
retail and wholesale parts of their business. It is unnecessary to
require these licensees to undergo legal separation. In the current
market, such licensees can already choose to offer retail services
only. In fact all of them do. In the new market, licensees will be able
to offer both retail and upstream services separately.</hs_para>

amendment would not require the legal separation of incumbent water
companies, but I understand that that is the intention behind it. Legal
separation of the incumbent water companies is usually perceived as a
way of preventing them from discriminating against new licensees
entering the market in favour of their own retail businesses. This
discrimination could be either through the prices they charge or by
other non-price forms of anti-competitive behaviour. However, legal
separation would not eliminate the risk of discrimination in
competitive markets, nor is it the only way to deal with
discrimination. Ofwat has a range of tools it could use, for example by
making licence changes to govern the relationship between the retail
and wholesale parts of the companies. These could go as far as
requiring effective functional separation. The Bill also gives Ofwat
stronger powers to ensure that it can take action to tackle
discrimination and ensure a level playing field for all market
participants.</hs_para>

made it clear that we would not drive fundamental structural change to
the industry, such as forcing the legal separation of incumbent water
companies. We were persuaded by the arguments of water companies and
investors in the sector that doing so would reduce the regulatory
stability of the sector and put future investment at risk, something to
which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, referred. We must not take risks
with a successful model given the challenges we face in building the
resilience of the sector and the importance of keeping customer bills
affordable.</hs_para>

Ofwat and other competition authorities to take firm action to prevent
discriminatory pricing or behaviour. This could include requiring
undertakings from market participants to address anti-competitive
behaviour, for example by introducing functional separation.
Furthermore, under Clause 23, the Government have also introduced a
duty on the 
<?notus-xml column=146?>Secretary of State, Welsh Ministers and Ofwat to ensure that incumbent
water companies do not exercise undue preference to their own retail
businesses, associated licensees or other incumbent water companies on
non-price matters. Ofwat therefore has sufficient powers to reduce
discriminatory behaviour without there being legal separation of
incumbent water
companies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000034">As
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, explained, Amendment 97 would enable
licensed water suppliers to choose to specialise in either retail or
wholesale services. Clause 1 and Schedule 1 to the Bill already enable
this by removing the requirements in existing legislation for suppliers
of upstream services also to provide retail services. This amendment is
therefore unnecessary to achieve the objective the noble Lord
seeks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000035">Forcing
separation would not simply be about costs to investors, it would
impact on costs to customers. If the sector becomes less attractive,
the cost of capital increases, and increases of as little as 1% can
lead to £20 on a bill. We must remember the need to ensure that

However, the subject is worthy of further consideration.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:30:18"></hs_TimeCode> is true that
Ofwat has a power of functional separation in Schedule 1 but it is only
one way round. The amendment would provide for it to be both
ways round. It would give some flexibility to Ofwat, but
only on functional separation.</hs_para>

ownership separation, this is such an odd market that at some point
some Government will have to consider this. The proposed clause, as
drafted and as intended, did not say that we would do it, but it would
give Ofwat reserve powers to do it in relation to either one company
which was engaged in anti-competitive behaviour—which is wider
than simply the relationship between its own wholesale and retail
internal pricing system—or across the board.</hs_para>

power exists and is used by both the European and British competition
authorities in almost every other sector—we have required
breweries to give up their pubs and banks to give up their retail
branches—but water is more protected because it has a
sector-specific structure of regulation which has built up, for
understandable reasons, from the old nationalised structure into a
regionally based oligopoly. It has attracted a serious amount of
investment, but at a cost. Part of the cost is inflexible and the Bill
seeks to introduce a greater degree of flexibility. I accept that, but,
ultimately, you would not necessarily want the structure for all
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T18:32:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000039">Therefore,
although I do not advocate wholesale intervention at this point, Ofwat,
as the sector-specific competition authority, needs stronger powers
than it currently has. My proposed new clause clearly would not give it
those powers, and even if it did the Minister would not accept it. We
have a problem with the nature of the industry. It has had some fairly
bad 
<?notus-xml column=147?>publicity recently in terms of its levels of
profitability, its method of gearing and the way that it treats its
customers. There is considerable room for improvement. One potential
stick for that would be to give Ofwat wider powers. Indeed, a future
White Paper may well address this issue more radically than we are
doing today. In the mean time, I shall withdraw my
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14020498000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000221">Amendment

existing licence holders to sell their water to water companies even

amended the Bill to require applicants for new water supply licences to
consult with the Environment Agency as well as with Ofwat. It is on the

amendments which, as I said earlier, I have refrained from tabling
partly because I found the Bill so complex that I was not sure I was
going to get it in the right place. I am not sure that the noble
Baroness has got it in the right place, because here we are debating, I
thought, Clause 8, and she has referred specifically and entirely to
Clause 12. I can understand why the amendment she tabled was
appropriate for Clause 12; I am not entirely sure it is right for
Clause 8. However, it enables me to address some of the
points about which I expressed concern at Second Reading.</hs_para>

the Bill that I had serious anxieties about. I think that these
anxieties are almost certainly unfounded. My noble friend’s

operate a series of tests regarding an application for a licence.
First, is there proof of legitimate need? If people apply for a licence
on a speculative basis, they are locking up resources that could be
used for economic growth or other aspects, so that is quite important.
Is it efficient, in terms of the efficient and proper use of water,
which is part of our duties under the Water Resources Act 1991? Would
it have a negative effect on any other abstractor and is it sustainable

noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, has just said, but it does not deal with
the totality of the noble Baroness’s amendment, which I broadly
support. Amendment 74 deals with bulk transfers which may well be
within the context of an existing abstraction licence—it is only
change of use if it is used for some other purpose. The Environment
Agency does not have a licence control except in terms of change of
use. It is an Ofwat responsibility, in increasing upstream competition,
to arrange for these bulk transfers. It is complicated but it seems to
me that if there is a serious environmental problem, the Environment
Agency and its Welsh counterpart need some powers over and above
consultation—which already exists—to stop those transfers
taking place. I think that is really where the noble Baroness’s
amendment is aimed.</hs_para>

Parminter for tabling these amendments. Clause 8 plays an important
role in achieving a more resilient water industry by encouraging the
bulk transfers of water, or bulk supply agreements, between incumbent
water companies and between incumbent water companies and inset
appointees. We recognise my noble friend’s concern that an
increase in bulk supply agreements might lead to unsustainable
abstraction, particularly in advance of broader reform of the
abstraction regime. We are therefore grateful for the opportunity to
explore these issues in further detail today.</hs_para>

the current abstraction system so that it is fit to face future

are committed to putting in place an effective system that better

consultation in December. My noble friend Lord De Mauley will talk
about our approach to abstraction reform in more detail shortly, as my
noble friend Lady Parminter noted; as my noble friend Lord Crickhowell
noted, Clause 12 may also appear to be relevant here.</hs_para>

govern these agreements. By enabling incumbent water companies to use
water resources more flexibly and efficiently, increased water trading
can both build resilience and increase the sustainable use of water
resources. It can be particularly useful for water stressed areas and
in times of drought. My noble friend Lady Parminter is right that we
need to avoid any damage from unsustainable abstraction happening in
the first place. Tackling damage after it has occurred can be a slow,
difficult and expensive process. We therefore want to ensure that
adequate safeguards are in place in introducing this reform to the bulk

that the focus is not the new licences, which are covered by effective

Parminter:</Member></B> My Lords, we now touch on the issue of the
absence in the Bill of any abstraction reform proposals. Amendment 96
seeks to address the issue of the non-alignment of the proposals for
upstream competition, which are within the Bill, and those for
abstraction reform, which are not. Without the proposals for
abstraction reform running in parallel with those that create a market
for trading water, there is a significant risk to our scarce water
resources. I will not repeat what I said at Second Reading, but suffice
it to say that the House of Lords EU Sub-Committee on
Agriculture, Fisheries, Environment and Energy and the Environment
Agency both concur with the Government’s own view that at

competition briefing paper which the Government have helpfully provided
for us states that they are aiming to legislate for abstraction reform
early in the next Parliament. My amendment would merely give statutory
backing to that commitment by this Government and would tie future
Governments to abide by it. Requiring the Minister to draft public
legislation to reform water abstraction will give clarity to
parliamentarians about the shape of the abstraction reform proposals
prior to their scrutiny of the regulations that will govern the new
market in upstream competition, which the Government say could come
into force by 2019. I hope that the Minister will agree that
this amendment is one way—I accept that it is only one
way—of reflecting the Government’s stated commitment to
delivering reform in a timely and coherent way. That can be secured
only by aligning the proposals for upstream reform, which are in the

Cameron of Dillington:</Member></B> My Lords, it seems strange to be
talking about possible water shortages and abstraction reform in one of
the wettest Januarys since records began. I remind noble Lords that
January is named after the Roman double-headed god, Janus. If one head
is pointing to the climate change extreme of floods, the other is
undoubtedly pointing to drought.</hs_para>

either this group of amendments or the previous group totally grip the
issue of likely water shortages and the much needed reform of the
abstraction regime, which should be put in place as soon as possible.
One of the lessons of the disaster of the Somerset Levels is that we
should not wait until disaster strikes before taking action and rushing
through reforms. At one of the side meetings last week, which many
noble Lords attended, we heard that improvements in water supply and
demand take a long time. We heard, for instance, how the mere extension
of a reservoir in Essex took 20 years to arrange—10 years to
prove the case and 10 years to get the planning through. Equally,
universal metering, on the demand side—which of course is worth
several reservoirs and is not dependent on rain—would also take
a very long time to achieve, particularly if we are to bring consumers
along with us, which is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

situation that we will have in the future, we should use the Water Bill
to ensure that disaster does not strike some time in the future. The
dire situations relate to population increases, more demand for
energy—energy is a huge user of water, as I am sure many noble
Lords know—and more droughts, which are very likely. All these
factors require greater flexibility in the management of our
abstraction
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020498000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#14020498000066">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:02:04"></hs_TimeCode>
are parallels with the energy industry. Some of us were dealing with
the Energy Bill at the end of last year and tried to ensure that in the
next 10 or 20 years’ time there would be a sufficient
balance of supply to demand within the energy industry. All the time,
we were aware that 10 years ago no one had looked carefully at this
balance of supply and demand. We are quite likely to face power cuts in
the next couple of years—as many noble Lords are
aware—because of this lack of forethought in the past
decade.</hs_para>

immediately followed by a flood. It was an almost invariable rule, so I

However, they have pointed out that the issue is extremely complicated
and cannot be rushed. While I, perhaps on the basis of experience, have
always been one of the first to criticise the timescale on which some
government departments operate, I have a good deal of sympathy with the
need to take adequate time on this. This view was reinforced by the
fact that at one of the briefing meetings, the representative
of—I think—Anglia Water told us that it was undertaking
fairly basic research into the resources available in the region. It
was suddenly brought home to me that we do not know a great deal about
the availability of ground water resources in many of our regions. We
know how much water is going down the rivers, but we still need quite a

older licences are still allowed to abstract, regardless of whether
water is abundant or scarce, but there are restrictions on newer
licences. The hands-off flow condition allows the Environment Agency to
reduce or stop abstraction altogether if river and ground
water levels fall, but this does not apply to the older licence
holders—the vast majority of total abstractions. This puts newer
licence holders and, indeed, the environment at a disadvantage. Surely,
the first step should be to bring all licences up to date with modern
requirements, especially the hands-off flow condition and, indeed, any
other condition deemed necessary. I would like to see a provision in

next thing is abstraction charges. I looked at the Environment Agency
website, which lists eight charging regions in England and one in
Wales. There are two charges: the standard charge and the environmental
improvement charge. The environmental improvement charge is different
for water companies and for non-water companies, which I presume
includes energy companies. The standard charges are not standard at
all—they vary region to region. Of the eight regions in England,
the Anglian and Northumbrian regions are charged the most, at about
£28 per 1,000 cubic metres of water, while the north-west region
is only charged about £12.50 per 1,000 cubic metres of
water—less than half. Why is there this variation when it is
called a standard charge? The Minister might say that the Anglian
region, being in an environmentally sensitive area, attracts the
highest charge in the country to cover the costs of managing the
resources available. However, here I got muddled, because that is
surely an environmental issue, and any extra charge ought to be levied
under the environmental improvement charge, not the standard charge.

move on to the environmental improvement charge for non-water

is 62p, for the Yorkshire region, while two regions—the Midlands
and Northumbrian regions—pay no environmental improvement charge

think we are missing a trick here. If the Bill is about better
management of our water resources and the protection of the
environment, why does the environmental charge not reflect this? For
instance, when there is an abundance of water, the charge could be
relatively low, but as water in each catchment area becomes scarcer,
the charge could be ratcheted up, thus making it more financially
prohibitive to abstract when it might harm the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I have Amendment 104 in this group,
which touches on exactly the issue that the noble Earl referred to
right at the beginning of his remarks. The essential problem here is
that we have two issues: the introduction of upstream competition and
the deficiencies in the present abstraction regime. Logically, it would
be sensible to have accomplished, or at least set in train, the
abstraction reform before we introduce upstream competition. In fact,
the Bill gets it entirely the other way
round<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000002">The
inadequacy of the abstraction regime has been fairly
long-standing. I can remember having arguments within Defra when we
brought in the 2003 Bill that we ought to have been more radical at
that point. Indeed, ever since, the situation in several catchment
areas has seriously deteriorated. Although the noble Lord, Lord
Cameron, is right that it sounds odd for us to be talking about it in
light of the recent inclement weather in most of the country, the
reality in the long term is that a lot of our catchments are not in
very good condition, either in terms of water resources or of their
environmental flow. Abstraction levels and potential abstraction levels
have had a serious effect on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000003">The
Government know this and have undertaken a review of the
abstraction regime. It has been rather a long time coming, but they
have nevertheless got to the point where they issued a very good
consultation paper only last month, which gives two options
as to how we could conduct the framework of reform. They could
have gone a little further—issues such as charging, which the
noble Earl also referred to, ought to be part of this. However, if we
are unable to introduce that reform until into the 2020s, and meanwhile
we have triggered upstream competition, we are aggravating the
position. Once there are new suppliers, they will be looking at new
sources. They will be looking at trading licences. In reality, it is
not only the abstraction that is taking place that is damaging to a lot
of our catchments, but the potential abstraction under existing
licences. Many of these existing licences, which we talk about being
introduced in the 1960s, are grandfathered rights, which probably
existed centuries 
<?notus-xml column=160?>previously when the demand for water was less and
the precipitation was probably even more than we recently
experienced<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000004">We
have catchment areas that are subject to increased demand at the far
end, to increased environmental deterioration and to climate change,
and present potential problems for water quality as well as water
supply. That problem needs
addressing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>. If
existing licences provide for twice the level that is actually
abstracted—in other words, less than 50% of the potential
abstraction actually occurs—and more people are trying to get
their hands, figuratively speaking, on the water to put it back into
the system and to enhance competition, then we have got a perfect
storm. What, however, if we do it the other way around—if we
speed up the introduction of abstraction reform and get the legislation
we need? Some of it can be done without legislation, but probably not
all of it. For example, the issue of compensation was a major inhibitor
on the Environment Agency, as it comes out of the Environment
Agency’s budget and the Treasury makes absolutely certain that
it comes out of your budget. This inhibits the degree to which you can
introduce modifications of termination of abstraction agreements.
Probably, because it is a property right, that needs primary
legislation. We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:25:29"></hs_TimeCode>
need to move to primary legislation fast. We need to introduce it and
you cannot introduce it all at once. It will take a bit of time to
introduce it, but we need to start as rapidly as possible.</hs_para>

we have an abstraction regime that puts a cap, catchment by catchment,
on the amount of water in aggregate that people can extract, and
defines that in terms of the flow of the river, the demand on that
river, and the potential environmental damage or benefit to which that
river contributes, then we can relatively easily within that framework
introduce competition, trading, sophisticated agreements of swapping
water between one entrepreneur and another and indeed across boundaries
of the water company areas. If you do it the other way around, however,
you will affect the environment and the supply of water. You will make
it much more difficult later to introduce rules in relation to the
competition which affect the abstraction licences which exist, let
alone new
ones<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:22:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000006">The
Environment Agency is not without some powers in this respect. As we
said in relation to the previous group of amendments, at the point of
change of use, the Environment Agency can effectively introduce new
provisions. However, not all of these will be change of use and if you
have an abstraction licence currently, which would allow you to take
out twice as much water as you actually need, then only part of that
licence would be used for the public water supply system and the rest
would remain. In effect, instead of taking 40% of the abstraction you
would be taking 100% and only half of that would go into the public
supply to provide for additional
competition<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:23:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000007">Although
there are powers for the Environment Agency, they need to be
strengthened. The sequence of events needs to be a rapid conclusion of
the current consultation on abstraction, and introduction of the
primary legislation and other regulations that we need as rapidly as
possible over the next few years If we sped it up we could probably do
that by 2020, which the department says is probably the earliest date
that 
<?notus-xml column=161?>we could introduce upstream reform in any case. If
we do not have that legislative sequence, we will get to 2020 without
abstraction reform being properly implemented, and have all the
problems of suddenly introducing upstream
competition<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000008">All
we are asking in these amendments is to put the order right, put both
elements in the Bill, and recognise that we will still need another
Bill to do the abstraction reform in detail. I am suggesting that the
division between the primary legislation for abstraction reform and the
introduction triggering the provisions on upstream competition should
be five years. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, queries whether that
actually made matters worse, but that is more or less the timescale the
Government are working on for upstream competition in any case, so it
does fit. If necessary we can alter that five years, but we need some
clear sequence. At the moment the Government are dealing with only half
of it in this Bill. The department have started the other half but we
need to do them the other way around. I hope that the Government at
least accept that principle, even if they are not prepared to accept
the noble Baroness’s or my amendment

Amendment 96 would delay regulations under Clause 12 and the
market for private water sales to water companies from coming into

caused by the Bill. In order to sell water into public supply,
abstractors will need to apply to the Environment Agency or Natural

abstraction licence. The Environment Agency can refuse such a request
if it will lead to unsustainable abstraction. It can also refuse if it
would cause deterioration in the catchment, or apply conditions to

their concerns and finalise our proposals. We aim to legislate for
abstraction reform early in the next Parliament. During Second Reading,
I highlighted just how complex those reforms would be. We must make

have committed—I do so again—to ensuring that the
implementation of our upstream and abstraction reforms is carefully
co-ordinated. The expansion of upstream water resource markets and the
transition to a new abstraction regime will take place on broadly
similar timescales. This will enable abstractors to take decisions
about managing their water use with good information about how future
regulation will operate and the role markets might play in enabling
them to meet their water needs. My noble friend Lord Cathcart asked
about time-limiting licences. The changes proposed for old-style
abstraction licences would be part of the abstraction reform.
Significant changes to licences like this would usually involve payment
of compensation. The Bill helps with that but there is no shortcut to
fundamental reform.</hs_para>

about unsustainable abstraction. Indeed, that was behind what a number

to developing reform proposals, we are ramping up our efforts to reduce
damaging abstraction now by making better use of our existing tools. We
continue to work with licence holders to reduce abstractions through
the Environment Agency’s Restoring Sustainable Abstraction
programme. It takes time to do that. We might know that a particular
extraction damages the environment but if, for example, that water
supplies a major conurbation we cannot just switch it off overnight.
Ways of reducing that damage must be considered and alternative sources
of water investigated. The Environment Agency will soon use its powers
to revoke or vary abstraction licences without compensation where they
are causing serious damage to the environment. That follows our recent
consultation on how to assess serious
damage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000019">My
noble friend also raised an important point about abstraction charges
reflecting the value of water. As he suggested, I will write to him
explaining the charging system in more detail. However, in
brief, the standard charge is the mechanism through which the
Environment Agency recovers its costs for managing and regulating water
abstractions. The environmental improvement unit charge is used to
cover the costs of compensating abstractors where the Environment
Agency compulsorily varies or revokes abstraction licences to reduce
the risk of environmental damage. The charges differ across regions for
a range of historical reasons, including the location of sites in the
Environment Agency’s Restoring Sustainable Abstraction
programme. The Government seek to send better signals about the value
of water through the Bill. Our proposals for abstraction reform develop
these signals further and aim to introduce a reformed abstraction
system that is more flexible and resilient to future pressures. Our
proposals also cover abstraction charges and the future use of the

Parminter:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend the Minister for his
detailed comments and the numerous colleagues around the House who
joined in this debate. We face an inadequate abstraction regime that
will be reformed at some point in the future and a Bill here and now
that will introduce upstream competition proposals that could
exacerbate the problems of abstraction. While I thank the Minister for
his comments, I do not feel he adequately answered why the Government
are not prepared to put wording in the Bill reflecting our concern that
there is insufficient clarity at the moment about the timetabling of
this issue. My noble friend Lord Crickhowell was kind enough to say he
had great sympathy with that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000021">I
accept that the wording I proposed might not be right. We certainly do
not wish to put any barriers on the proposal for reforming the retail

ahead with that now. However, in the relationship between the
abstraction reform proposals and the 
<?notus-xml column=164?>upstream competition there needs to be clearer timetabling within the
Bill. I say to the Minister that we will return to this issue on
Report, and in the absence of a sequencing being put in the Bill we
will look again at further safeguards that will be required to prevent
more deterioration to the environment. Those safeguards will be along
the lines mentioned in my previous proposed amendments, which my noble
friend Lord Cathcart was kind enough to say that we should look at more
seriously, particularly paragraph (c) in Amendment 74. As I said, we
will come back to this matter but on that basis I beg leave to withdraw

Bew (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the Committee on Standards in Public
Life is an independent committee that provides advice to the Prime
Minister. Its remit is to promote high ethical standards across the
public sphere, not just Parliament. Its first ever report, in 1994,
recommended seven principles to guide the behaviour of those who serve
the public in any way: selflessness, integrity, objectivity,
accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. Those principles are
popularly known, after the first chairman, as the Nolan
principles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000024">The
committee published its fifth general survey of public attitudes last
autumn. The committee has conducted the survey every two years since
2004. It is a unique long-term, independent study and source of
information about what the public think about standards in public life.
The issue here is general probity. It is important to check our
perception of the standards that the public expect of public servants
and organisations, and the extent to which those are being met, against
reality. We cannot afford to assume that we know what the public really
think about these issues.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=165?><hs_para UID="140204102000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000025">The
survey was published at a time when a variety of research showed an
increasing disengagement from the political system and some national
institutions seemed to be engulfed in a series of scandals.
The apparently—and I stress apparently—engulfing nature
of scandals is a particular problem of the modern era. At least in some
media discussion the impression exists not just of a few bad apples but
that entire institutions lack probity: the BBC, Parliament, the police,
etc.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000026">The
survey draws on all four previous surveys to chart changes in attitudes
over the past 10 years. All surveys have consistently demonstrated what
members of the public expect from people in public office. It is: to be
committed to public rather than private ends; selflessness and
integrity, as in the Nolan principles; to be honest and open in
decision-making; to make decisions in the light of the best evidence;
objectivity; to be held accountable; and for some senior public figures
to lead in some respect exemplary lives—the principle of
leadership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000027">Over
the lifetime of the survey, there has been a continuous and substantial
decline in the number of respondents rating standards as quite high or
very high. In the latest survey, 28% of respondents rated conduct as
either quite low or very low. There was also an increase in the
proportion of people thinking that standards had got a lot worse. In
relationship to Westminster MPs, the public broadly share a set of
expectations that are in line with the seven principles of public life.
However, they have consistently lower levels of confidence that MPs
meet those standards. In the latest survey, pessimism was less marked
than in 2010, when attitudes were sharply affected by the then recent
events of the expenses scandal, but levels of confidence have not
returned to their 2008
levels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000028">Although
absolute levels of confidence are low in particular types of national
public officeholders and professions—for example, Ministers, MPs
and tabloid journalists—that should be contrasted with higher
and rising confidence in institutions, processes and those
administering the process. For example, as in most countries that have
low and falling levels of confidence in politicians, there is,
paradoxically, higher confidence in national institutions such as
Parliament itself and much higher confidence in the legal system. For
Parliament, it might be argued that there was something that looked
like the possible beginnings of a crisis of legitimacy in the 1970s,
but there is no sign of such a crisis today</hs_para>

valuable tracking devices for changes, but there are dangers that we
should be alert to in generalising about the public perception of
probity. For example, we are sometimes a bit disappointed that only the
broad, negative perceptions of MPs are reported in the media. There is
a great deal of complex, sometimes counterintuitive material in the
research which has messages for those working in public life. For
instance, our survey showed a widespread belief that respondents would
receive fair treatment from a wide range of front-line public services.
Less than 15% of those surveyed expressed concern that they would be
treated worse than others, and there are clear messages that the public
expressed more confidence in the probity of those working in the public
sector as against those working in private
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:42:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

picture of those groups who are most likely to feel sceptical and, to
some degree, alienated. That is particularly the case for those lower
social grades from white British or white Irish backgrounds,
middle-aged or older, and who have little engagement with the political
system. The growth in the size of that group presents a challenge to
all of us involved in public
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000031">The
Committee on Standards in Public Life recognises that it is important
to place those findings in a wider context, and it is now doing further
research and assessing the results from our British survey compared
with those in other countries, to see if results are potentially
affected by domestic factors or reflect citizens’ attitudes
across western democracies in general. We also appreciate that
perceptions of trust and public confidence can include a range of
issues which have nothing to do with integrity and genuine
trustworthiness and are much more to do with the policy process and the
process of
delivery<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000032">It
is important that the public have confidence in the integrity of public
institutions and that those who work in them are alert to a certain
level of public malaise and, where necessary, willing to challenge the
status quo. At a recent committee meeting with academics, there was a
wide-ranging discussion about some issues which might address some of
those perceptions: whether or not a less adversarial style of politics
might help; or whether or not a better level of political reporting
would help. An interesting point was made that MPs in the Netherlands
considered that they have a role as a public educator. It is not quite
as clear that MPs in United Kingdom consider that to be an important
part of their role. There were a number of other interesting ideas for
discussion and
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:43:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000033">The
broad context is clear enough. Modern politics became less ideological
when the era opened up by the Russian revolutions closed in 1989.
Politics became, it is often said, more about values and individuals
and ideologies, but we still have a gladiatorial style, seen most
spectacularly at PMQs, inherited from a more ideological age. The
result is a displacement of inevitable popular resentment, which used
to have a more ideological form of expression, to individuals in a more
modern version of Brecht’s socialism of
fools<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:44:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000034">My
committee believes that there is scope to improve and maintain levels
of public confidence and trust by public officeholders and
institutions by improving their own trustworthiness; by consistently
and reliably exemplifying high standards of ethical behaviour, openness
and accountability, as our recent report, <I>Strengthening Transparency
</I><I>A</I><I>round Lobbying</I>, discussed; being more attentive to
and active in addressing emerging ethical standards issues as they
arise, rather than waiting for pressure for reform; establishing and
promulgating robust mechanisms to detect and deal with wrongdoing; and

a recommendation of the committee’s recent triennial review and
understandable budget cuts across the public sector, that was the last
such survey produced by the committee. I must say that since my arrival
in the chair in September, the importance of 
<?notus-xml column=167?>the survey has been borne in on me in a way that was not the case
before, and I began to appreciate its value in a way that I had not
before. To have that steady survey over a period of changes and
transitions in public mood is, I think, of great value. We regret
losing in-depth analysis of the public view, especially when there are
signs of disconnect between the public and the political
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000036">The
focus of my committee’s immediate work programme will be on
working collaboratively with public sector officeholders and
organisations to promote and reinforce ethics and practice. We need to
increase our understanding of the factors at play in building and
maintaining public confidence. I believe that the committee and its
research has a role to play in trying to move the debate on from the

Patten (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I have long admired the noble
Lord, Lord Bew, for his ability to tease out of sometimes very dense
language extremely important points, and he has just done so in his
speech. Indeed, it was he who inspired me to read the whole of the
report, which is dense and curious, sometimes, in its language. The
noble Lord referred to the phrase, “the lower social
grades”—a slightly grating phrase. I think that Aldous
Huxley would have recognised that phrase, with his standard gammas,
unvarying deltas and the
rest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000038">That
said, as I ploughed through the report, which the noble Lord, Lord Bew,
inspired me to read, I became surprised—so I searched the
harder—to find no specific mentions of your Lordships’
House in a longitudinal study, which strikes me as a major lacuna.
There are mentions of all sorts of people—police, judges, and
those in the front line giving out advice—but no mention of your
Lordships’ House. I think that that needs to be addressed in
future reports of this sort if we are to have the full value that we
should get from

only make assertions, because there is nothing in this report which
will stand up what I am about to say, but does the Minister share the
concern expressed by some people in my hearing that there are things
wrong with this place which need to be addressed? For example, some
people feel that it has got terribly large and therefore is not very
effective in what it does. I think that, had questions been asked in

importantly, I am convinced—anecdotally; perhaps I listen to the
wrong kind of taxi drivers—that the impression of your
Lordships’ House has gone down sharply in recent years. If there
is one thing that has affected that perception it is that a revolving
door is still possible between someone becoming a lawmaker, then
becoming a lawbreaker and leaving the service of your Lordships’
House, and then, having served whatever sentence was given, coming back
into your Lordships’ House, having been a lawbreaker, to be a
lawmaker. You do not have to be a taxi driver to think that there is

something should be done and be done quickly. It always used to be said
that nothing could be done quickly about changing the laws of
succession so that men and women could be in the right order of birth
to become head of state in this country. The blessed Norman St
John-Stevas used to stand up and say that it was quite impossible to
do. Suddenly, the Zeitgeist changed and it was done. We need to make

Donaghy (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Bew, for initiating this short debate. I was acting chair of the
Committee on Standards in Public Life during most of 2007 and a member
of the committee when Sir Nigel Wicks was in the chair and the public
attitudes survey was inaugurated. I remember clearly how excited we
were about the significance of the survey, particularly its long-term
tracking of standards in public life.</hs_para>

contribution is to ask the Government to think again about the
withdrawal of funding for the public attitudes survey. I have been in
contact with Sir Nigel Wicks and he has permitted me to communicate his
“great disappointment” that the Government are
withdrawing funding for future surveys. They provide an authoritative
and transparently impartial method for tracking public perceptions and
expectations of standards in public life. They give all concerned with
standards in public life feedback on how the British people
view a fundamental element in the working of our democracy. Sir Nigel
is firm in the belief that the value of the public attitudes survey
could not be replaced by a series of ad hoc surveys, conducted by
bodies other than the committee. Such surveys would lack the authority
derived from the committee’s own authority and knowledge, as
well as the continuity provided by the regularity and consistency of
the committee’s surveys. This would make it virtually impossible
to identify trends and changing
attitudes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000045">I
can only echo Sir Nigel’s words and ask the Minister to consider
the long-term implications of the Government’s decision to cease
funding. The work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life is
admired by the rest of the world for its independence and robust
defence of standards. It will appear very strange for politicians, who
admittedly are not too high on the popularity poll, to take the
decision to weaken fundamentally the authority of these
surveys.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:52:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T19:52:31"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

so many who are all too ready to highlight those who do the wrong
thing.</hs_para>

go to the fact that we have thousands of men and women up and down the
United Kingdom, including in Northern Ireland, who have chosen to serve
in local government for very little 
<?notus-xml column=169?>reward. Those men and women hold down their jobs and
go to meetings of the council. At night, they attend the public
meetings that we have with the housing associations or the
tenants’ associations. They also deal with what some people
would consider to be the little things, such as repairs to the sinks or
drainpipes, or cleaning up the play area. A Speaker in the United
States, Tip O’Neill, once said that all politics is local. We
might call what these men and women in local government do “the
little things” but it is important to remember that those things
are important to the elderly, the mothers who want a play area to be
cleaned up and all the other people who are worried about their
community. As those men and women are not here at Westminster,
sometimes constituents come to their door and disturb them even when
they are having a family meal.</hs_para>

remember that we often tut-tut when we are in conversation about
non-traditional housing: the corridor houses and multi-storey flats in
our cities. Not all of those places are bad to live in but because of
the climate we have in this country the local authority gets the blame.
In the 1960s and 1970s, when those men and women who were in local
government wanted to clear the slums away and give people decent homes,
it was central government who said to them, “You will not get
government funding unless you build non-traditional houses”.
When the problems arose, the blame lay with local government and the
Government distanced themselves from the difficulties.</hs_para>

the other place is that there are those who have brought the Commons to

Tyler (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in view of the time constraints I
want to focus on just one part of this excellent report. Figure 4.1 on
page 22 shows that 26% of the respondents to the survey feel that MPs
can legitimately take into account what big donors to their parties
want when they cast a vote in the Commons. The committee found in
another of its surveys, in 2010, that 81% of the public thought that
the most common reason for donating to a political party was either in
the hope of receiving some special favours in
return—perhaps appointment to your Lordships’
House—or gaining access to those taking decisions. This
perception that influence and access may be auctioned to the highest
bidder is corrosive of our politics and corrosive of public perceptions
of standards in public life.</hs_para>

language in which we conduct our national political conversation.
George Orwell argued, in his classic 1946 essay, <I>Politics and the
English Language</I>, that if the main instrument of political exchange
and argument—language—became stale, clichéd and
debased, we would be seriously impoverished. Nearly 70 years on, in our
deeply sound-bitten political culture, we have much more to worry about
than did Orwell. Between now and the general election of May 2015, can
our political class raise its game? Can our politicians find the tone,
the pitch and the vocabulary to break through the indifference,
especially of those 18 to 24-year-olds? I live in
hope.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000057">I have
one final thought for the noble Lord, Lord Bew, and his

That is a question of standards, too. Doing an Orwell on White Papers

Harries of Pentregarth (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, before turning to
the survey in more detail, I would like to make some brief points of a
more general nature about the seven principles of public life. First,
these principles are absolutely fundamental to the healthy functioning
of any society. Without them, a society can only be regarded as sick
and it certainly would not function as it ought. Secondly they exist in
their own right, valid in themselves, with a claim upon us. They cannot
simply be read off or derived from any scientific or economic
description of society. That is why, if I am honest, I think the word
principle is a somewhat weak term. We could, for example, say things
such as, “I am going go run the organisation along the following
principles”, as though these were guidelines I had chosen, when
I could have chosen others. However, the qualities that we need for
public life are not items in a bag that we decide to choose. They are a
sine qua non of any ordered society. For example, if a Minister lies in
his private life, he will have to sort it out with his family as best
he can but if he lies to Parliament, he rightly has to resign.
Truthfulness, trustworthiness, integrity and a concern for the wider
good are not principles that we just happen to choose. They are the
fundamental values which make possible any ordered life
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000059">So
it is very good to know, as the noble Lord, Lord Hennessy, emphasised,
from the introduction of the report, that the public have consistently
prioritised these principles across the five surveys. It is clear that
the public have continuing high expectations of those in public office
and that is very healthy. As the survey indicates, there is an overall
decline in standards since the survey in 2008 and this stands in marked
contrast to an overall continuous rise from 2004 to 2008. The report
was correct to point out that the decline since 2008 had much to do
with the financial sector, particularly 
<?notus-xml column=172?>the banks in bringing about the economic crisis, and
the newspaper hacking scandal. So, as they point out, if trust can be
lost, it can also be regained, as it rose in some areas in the years
from 2004 to 2008. That is an important point and we must respond to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000060">Nevertheless
we cannot get away from the fact that the overall rating of standards
has declined very sharply. In 2004, 46% rated them quite high or very
high but by 2012 this has fallen to 35%. The noble Lord, Lord Bew,
emphasised the importance of educating public office-holders. I suggest
that the Government have a responsibility, both through the Department
for Education—in citizenship education in schools in
particular—and the Department for Communities and Local
Government, through its cohesion programme, to try to educate religious
communities and, not least, their leaders. Religious communities now
have a key role in thickening the moral fabric of our society.
Communities of all faiths have a particular opportunity to feed into
and strengthen the moral bonds that hold us together and which enable
public life to truly serve the common
good<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:05:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140204102000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000211">8.05

Norton of Louth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I too congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Bew, on initiating this important debate. I wish to
make three short points. The first is that maintaining standards, as
embodied in the Code of Conduct, is necessary, but it is not sufficient
to establish high levels of trust in our political system. As is clear
from the survey, we have some way to go to meet the necessary
standards. However, ensuring compliance with the code should be seen as
only part of the solution. What flows from the survey, and the Hansard
Society’s annual <I>Audits of Political Engagement</I>, is that
we should be pursuing both a bottom-up and a top-down approach to
restoring
trust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000062">The
bottom-up approach is captured by one of the final sentences of the

is lack of understanding of the political process. Like the noble and
right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, I believe it is necessary to bolster
citizenship education. It is in the national curriculum, but there are
no incentives for head teachers to take it seriously. We need to be
ensuring that there are incentives, and resources, for schools to
deliver it effectively. It is essential to the health of our political
system.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="140204102000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000064">However,
ensuring that people are more informed about the system is no guarantee
that it will enhance support for it. That will come when people
recognise that politicians are acting in good faith to deliver on their
promises. There is thus a major challenge for politicians in terms of
behaviour. We need political parties to move away from empty
partisanship and to get out of the Downsian cycle of outbidding one
another. We need politicians to show leadership—the top-down
approach—to lead from the front and not follow focus groups or
the latest passing bandwagon. Margaret Thatcher pursued policies that
were contentious, but her leadership style resonated. We need to be
addressing these issues. It is easy to advocate constitutional 
<?notus-xml column=173?>reform, but that is a form of displacement activity. It is to suggest
that the structure, rather than those who occupy it, is the problem.
The problem is the people who occupy it. Once we accept that we are
part of the problem— indeed, a central part—we can then
start to tackle
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000065">My

Earl of Lytton (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I too congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Bew, on securing this very timely debate. The attempt
to yoke standards in public life with public engagement is commendable
but it is no easy task. The noble Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, covered a
point which I was going to make and I would like to reinforce it. There
is a lack of knowledge about the systems on which interviewees are
being asked to comment. It is not just about the political scene, it is
about all manner of things. Things such as crime statistics, in which I
am interested, or medical incompetence may be important to a few but
are not often a wider consumer experience. This report shows there is
no room to be complacent but it also show there is an endless need to
try to dig a little deeper.</hs_para>

that there is no individual to blame and, with it, no real focused
leadership. There is protection of the status quo—the system for
its own sake. With the rank and file, not to be too segregationist
here, there is a silo mentality. People say, “It’s not my
job, not my responsibility”. There is a demarcation with other
people’s roles and a philosophy of “Don’t grass on

Colville of Culross (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble

as a producer at the BBC. As a journalist, I want to concentrate on
what the report tells us about the public trust in the media and their
ability to hold those in public office to
account<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>. In
Chapter 5, the noble Lord, Lord Bew, reports on the decline in public
confidence in the media to do this. It seems a small fall from 80% 10
years ago to 70% in 2012, but the decline reflects a public awareness
of the ability of the media to investigate and check public
figures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000072">Local
media in particular have been devastated by the move of advertisers to
alternative providers on the internet. My noble friend Lord Martin
mentioned local authorities; across the country, the work of local
authorities is being ignored by journalists and receives little public
attention, as local newspapers close down or become freesheets. We see
the same process in our national newspapers, as newsrooms are pared to
the bone. Of course, there are still investigations, like the exposure
by the <I>Telegraph</I> of the MPs’ expenses scandal, but
increasingly news is filled with PR, as product placement and unchecked
political spin become more prominent. The internet is an extraordinary
source of news stories, as the new tools of social media make us all
citizen journalists. But when there are so many voices out there and so
many with hidden positions and private axes to grind, it is hard to
know which voices to
trust<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:13:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:12:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000073">That
brings me to the findings of Chapter 2 of the report, showing a
surprising increase in trust in journalists across the board; I wonder
whether that would still hold up, after the last year of phone-hacking
revelations. As my noble friend Lady O’Neill of Bengarve pointed
out in her TED talk, the generic question of whether we trust a
particular group is flawed. We do not ask whether we trust fishmongers;
we trust some fishmongers and not others. Likewise, we trust some
politicians and not others, and some journalists and not others. There
are some journalists and some media outlets, such as the BBC and ITN,
which we do
trust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000074">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:14:15"></hs_TimeCode>
has never been more important for us to have professional journalists
whom we trust to sift through evidence, painstakingly check its
reliability and present us with a report that we can believe. They need
to be supported by editors, prepared to take on an investigation even
when it might fail. I cite the sterling work of my former colleague,
Michael Crick, on “Channel 4 News”, in getting to the
bottom of the “Plebgate” scandal, as he tenaciously
investigated the two competing versions of the truth offered by
competing holders of public office. Eventually, he discovered the lies

investigation of that

report confirmed for me a number of things that I had suspected about
public attitudes to standards in public life. While some of these
perceptions might not always be fair, as politicians and people in
public life we often do not do ourselves any favours. I noted that in
2012 MPs and Ministers were evaluated less favourably than all other
categories, with the exception of tabloid journalists. The expenses
scandal in 2010 certainly affected in a negative way public attitudes
towards politicians, and levels of trust and confidence have not
returned to the levels seen before

the opinion that people who go into public life and who seek elected
office, at whatever level, do so with the best intentions, and that in
this House, in the other place, in other parliaments and assemblies,

generally uncover wrongdoing. It was pleasing to read that people
generally felt they would be treated fairly by people providing public
services. There are high standards in the public sector and we are well
served by people who work there. We also have remedies to deal with
issues when things go wrong. Being able to correct things and provide

struck by the level of public alienation from conventional politics,
which we find most of all among the young. I find it deeply frustrating
that we are in this situation, partly because I spent some time as a
member of the Government’s World War One advisory board, reading
political literature on the first 15 years of the previous century. I
reflect that we have a much less corrupt political system than we had
then. Standards of personal morality among our politicians are far
higher than they were then, but respect and deference have gone
down.</hs_para>

are many reasons for that. We are in the middle of a media war with
politicians. The Leveson inquiry has not settled things down into a new
relationship yet. A major trial is under way that will impact on our
perceptions of the media, as well as the relationship between the media
and politicians. We have some real problems to face. When I read in the
report where politicians stood, I was cheerfully reminded of a
conversation at a party in Saltaire the winter before last. A friend of
one of my wife’s cousins asked me what I did. I said that I
didn’t think that she wanted to know. She said,
“You’re not a banker, are you?”. I thought: good,
there are people who rank below politicians in public
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000088">However,
we know that there is a crisis in our institutions and in confidence in
our elites—not just our political elite. The standing of the
police will no doubt be much lower in the next survey than it was in
the latest one. This is a general problem for all of us; it is a
problem of trust. The question of how we re-establish trust in our
institutions is enormous. There is also a sense that people have lost
local community. They have lost the church as part of local community
and that gives them a sense of loss of control. They have lost local
democracy. I am struck in our big cities, such as Bradford, Leeds and
Birmingham, that there are wards of 12,000 to 15,000 people where you
cannot have a sense of contact between elected politician and the
community that he or she
serves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000089">Globalisation—the
extent to which multinational companies come and go, and a sense that
international organisations, be they the European Union for us or the
United Nations for Americans, are somehow interfering in our

we deal with this ought to be one of our major shared concerns. It
cannot be dealt with by the Government or political parties alone; it
has to be dealt with by all of us, including the media, judges, the
police and
others<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:24:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000090">I
liked the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Bew, that Dutch MPs see
public education as part of their role. That is something we all ought
to think about in more detail. I also liked his remark about the
gladiatorial style of our party politics being a major part of the
public’s switch-off. Lots of other politicians watch Prime
Minister’s Questions because they think it is fun but not very
constructive. The way that we approach political and constitutional
reform is pretty awful. We ought to bear in mind that, unless we see
the process of political and constitutional reform as a way of

noble Lord, Lord Patten, asked about the House of Lords and how that
fits in. I am not sure how people see the House of Lords—I think
through a glass darkly on the whole. Yes, we are too large; so is the
House of Commons, but that is partly because the Government are too
large. We are the largest collection of government appointees of any
advanced industrial democracy, and perhaps that is something else that
we need to contemplate. However, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Patten,
that the Private Member’s Bill—the Steel Bill mark 5, or
whatever it now is—which is now called the Byles Bill, will
begin to correct the problem of lawbreakers subsequently returning to

Lady Donaghy, asked the Government to review the decision to end this
survey and I will take that comment back. I, too, read the Hansard
Society survey on attitudes to those in public life. Part of the reason
for deciding to end the survey of the Committee on Standards in Public
Life was that a number of other similar surveys reach the same worrying
conclusions, and the Hansard Society survey is clearly very much part

noble Lord, Lord Martin, talked of the importance of politicians being
seen as serving their communities. One of the things that we have to
combat is the sense that everyone, whatever they do, is doing it for
their own benefit. That is part of the attitude that has grown up in
the past 20 years. Economists bear a certain amount of responsibility
for that with the growth of public choice economics, which argues that
everyone is self-interested and no one has any altruistic feelings, as
do the spread of libertarianism across the Atlantic and the disciples
of Ayn Rand, who forget that the concept of public
service—contributing to the life of the community—does
motivate people. We need to reward those who are motivated by that.
That is very much part of what we need to reintroduce in our public
life because the cynicism of those who say, “You’re all
in it for what you can get out of it”, is part of what has
eroded popular respect for all our elite
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:27:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000094">My
noble friend Lord Tyler talked about the power of money in politics as
being part of that erosion. The power of money has always been there;
it was just that previously it was disguised by deference. The extent
to which we had mass political parties meant that they could claim to
be funded by a very large number of people. I was rather shaken when I
discovered, about two years ago, that in the previous year there had
been more individual donors to the Liberal Democrats than there had
been individual small donors to the Labour Party. The Labour Party had
retreated to a position where it depended very heavily on union
donations. That is a problem for all of us, and is one we all share.
Why has our membership shrunk? Why have political parties ceased to be
able to persuade people to share in contributing to political life at
all levels, which is what we attempt to
do?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0002.htm#140204102000095">The noble
Lord, Lord Hennessy, talked about the need to reconsider the language
of politics. That is very much a problem for all our public educators,
journalists and others. The war between the BBC and the written media
is part of the problem that we currently face, as the noble Lord well
knows. There is the sense that the BBC is trying to address public
service broadcasting and is being attacked; that it is an inherently
left-wing concept for the <I>Daily Mail </I>and the <I>Telegraph</I> is
part of what has gone wrong. How we gain that sense of a shared

the limits of what is possible. I come from a party that, much against

not; we needed to spend the money on early years and education. It was
a mistake. Politicians in some parties 
<?notus-xml column=179?>are now trying to persuade people that we can tell
the world that we want to get off and go back to national sovereignty.
We cannot. There are things that people want that politicians cannot
provide. We cannot put up pensions, provide everything free on the

democracy together. We also recognise that to some extent the
professionalisation of politics has undermined that. We have a problem
with political recruitment and getting people into politics who will
want to serve. In many ways it is sad that David Cameron’s
efforts to bring a number of people from outside politics into the
Commons through his A list has not been more successful. He was trying
to find people from outside political life who would contribute to
politics. We need a broad common effort by all political elites to
rebuild public trust. That has to come from parties, Parliament the
media and others—heaven knows, business and bankers. Until
bankers begin to make their own proper efforts to reconstruct the trust
of the common public in the financial system, there is a limit to what
we can do to rebuild public trust as well. Most of all, we need to
explain to and educate our public about what is possible and what is
not, and to accept that we are not just politicians but, as the noble
Lord, Lord Bew, said, we have to be public

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, at Second Reading there was
bemusement on all sides of the House as to why the Government were
being resistant to the concept of exit in the new retail market. I am
not sure that the Minister’s words, either on that occasion or
in any briefing since, have convinced me as to why, uniquely in this
market—or almost uniquely—we should not allow
exit.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140204102000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000100">It is
a funny market in which we are trying to encourage new entrants by
designating the area in which they should operate, and designating the
terms and regulations under which they should operate. We envisage
benefits to business and other non-domestic consumers within that
market as a result of that competition, and we are assuming that it
will bring benefits to a wider part of the whole water structure and
water consumers. However, to maximise the effect of a market, there
have to be winners and losers; and we are talking about competition and
different companies with different forms of
experience<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140204102000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000101">There is not only
bemusement around the House about why the Government were resistant to
the concept of exit. Out there, many bodies—including Ofwat
itself, which I would have thought is fairly significant—are
saying that we should allow exit. Although some of the incumbent
companies are opposed to it—Water UK has said that, on balance,
it is not really convinced by it—some of the major companies are
in favour. I have not declared many interests so far, but my current
interests are that I am a consumer of two water companies, Thames and
Wessex, both of which have written to me and said that they are in
favour of providing an exit
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000102">Why
would you allow a situation to continue in which somebody is supplying
part of the non-household retail market but not doing well at it?
Remember that there is an obligation on the regulator to ensure that
everybody who wishes to be connected to the water supply will be
connected to the water supply, so nobody is going to be stranded
despite some of the things that have been said. Why should a supplier
who is losing customers and presumably losing money, or certainly not
making as much money as they had hoped, be prevented from leaving when
Ofwat can arrange for somebody else to take over those assets and that
market? I do not know of a serious precedent in any other field. We are
trying to encourage a degree of churn, with new entrants, new
competition and new drive for reducing costs, yet failing companies, or
relatively failing companies, are not allowed to pull
out<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:40:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000103">This
is odd, but even odder is what seems to be the Government’s main
objection. The Government were kind enough to send us a further
explanation, and although there are some other points in it that we do 
<?notus-xml column=181?>need to take seriously, the main point was that providing for exit would
create uncertainty and put off investors. I tried to downplay investor
panic when speaking to the last but one amendment, but there are
arguments about that. Investors are getting a good return, but why
would they want to persevere in an area in which they were not getting
a good return, where they were failing, and where on their own internal
economic analysis they were being advised to get out? Investors see the
UK water market as a pretty good return, a steady return and one that
will last a long time. However, there may be a part of that market they
are supplying and where they are failing. Customers may be pulling away
from them and going to rivals or they may be getting a high level of
complaints—one way or another they are failing, and that will
show up in their balance sheet eventually. Why would international
investors say we absolutely will not invest in England unless we are
forced to remain in an unprofitable
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:45:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000104">There
seems a fair degree of absurdity in the explanation. That argument for
the Government falls. Maybe some strange investor has told somebody in
the department or a government adviser that that is the case, but
logically, that cannot possibly be the reason. The problem is that the
department have got stuck on this. The reality is that it was a bit
untidy to allow for exit. New rules and procedures would have to be
invented and safeguards built in, and that was not the priority. The
priority was to get new people in, not to get people
out<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:43:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000105">Fair
enough, but we have moved on, because a range of people have, as I have
said, raised this issue. The Government now have to think again. There
are some objections to providing for exit and some concerns about it,
but those concerns are covered by the safeguards that are built into
the amendment. The Government may want to elaborate on it, but it
provides that for exit, Ofwat have to approve it, ensure that there is
a substitute supply and make sure that there is no disruption as far
the business consumer is concerned, and Secretary of State approval is
also needed. That might appear a bit draconian to some investor who
desperately wanted to get out. However, it provides a safeguard to
counter for example the objection that comes—rather quietly, but
nevertheless it does come—from the Consumer Council for Water,
which is a bit worried that they would have people left literally high
and dry. That could not happen under this system: Ofwat must supply. In
a strange situation, the Secretary of State could block it if there was
a real reason for thinking consumers might be in danger, whether they
are consumers in a competitive market or other consumers affected by
the knock-on
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:44:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:46:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140204102000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000219">8.45

not understand why the Government say that this is not appropriate.
There has been a subtle change in the latest leaflet they have sent
round. They do not say that they are against it but that it is
premature, which is always a good way for the Civil Service to say,
“We cannot be bothered with it just now”. However, if it
is premature to do it, why do the Government not provide for some
contingency and say that they will put it into the Bill that after two
years they will allow for exit. In that way, any immediate 
<?notus-xml column=182?>disruption, uncertainty or whatever could be
overcome and people would know what the rules were. They could build
that in<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:45:37"></hs_TimeCode>. I do
not think that we even need that, but if we do, the Government could
table an amendment to that effect on Report. It is yet another
safeguard which can be built into the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:45:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000107">As
it stands, it is bizarre and does not gel with any concept of a market
that most of us understand. I believe that if the safeguards are there,
the Government will eventually come round to doing this. I hope that
they come round to it during the course of the Bill, rather than
finding themselves in a situation in a year or two where it becomes
obvious that some of the players in the market ought to get out and
that the consumer experience would be better if they did
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government should think again. I hope that the Minister will have
better news for us on this. I beg to

is welcomed north of the border and it has been welcomed by the Defra

first and most fundamental point is that for an effective market there
needs to be an ability for new entrants to enter and for existing
market players to exit. Customers benefit from more effective and
efficient suppliers replacing poorer performing businesses. Allowing
incumbent water and sewerage companies to exit from retail services
would help ensure successful development of the new retail services
market and thus benefit customers. Successful entrants could more
quickly acquire critical mass by buying the customers of the less
successful or committed incumbent retailers. There appears to be plenty
of scope for customer benefit if high-performing companies were to take
on the customers of other
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000112">Ofwat
data have suggested that one water and sewerage company can spend up to
twice as much as another providing retail services to each domestic
customer. Ofwat reports significant variations between
companies’ customer service standards. Simon Less, the senior
visiting fellow on regulatory policy, has done some outstanding work.
He has clearly made the case at the Policy Exchange that where a
company 
<?notus-xml column=183?>considers its strength is in wholesale water activities, allowing it to
sell its retail business would enable its management to focus on
wholesale. Water wholesaling and retailing have quite different sets of
risks. Exiting retail services would reduce a wholesaling
company’s risks from, from example, bad debt. The sector would,
overall, be able to access investors with a wider range of risk
appetites. Allowing exit from retail services would enable mergers
between retail businesses, with benefits from increasing scale and
scope.</hs_para>

only is the group that I have outlined in favour of exit; let us also
reflect for a moment on the Bill. This Bill principally came from
Martin Cave’s review—80% to 90% of the Bill was based on
this review. He, too, is supportive of this principle. It does not go
as far as separation, which does concern many noble Lords. It allows,
as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has stated, no compulsion, simply an
option to exit the retail market. I mentioned that the market itself is
supportive of this proposal. It is interesting that Moody’s has
come out in support of the proposal. Not only Moody’s, but
Macquarie Equities Research has recently published a telling and
impressive review of retail exit, in which it
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="140204102000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000182">“We

would my amendments do? They would enable incumbent water and sewerage
companies to transfer their retail businesses to third parties. They
would also secure the benefits of such transfers by ensuring a level
playing field and consequently maximising the benefits that could flow
to non-household customers. It is important to repeat that this
approach does not require or compel incumbents to transfer any or all
of their non-household customers. It is an option and, as the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, said, it would be subject to the approval of the
Secretary of State and a restriction on its use by the competition
authorities, and nothing
more<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:55:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I would try to answer the issues which, as I understand it,
underpin the Government’s position at present. The first was
referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty: allowing retail exit could
unsettle the investment climate. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, and I have demonstrated from both sides of the Committee that
that is not a strong argument when investors and companies are actively
seeking this change, suggesting that they are far from unsettled by it.
As I mentioned, the rating agency Moody’s had previously
suggested that this would be a positive change, and the Australian bank
Macquarie, as I have quoted, also supports the change. Similarly, a
recent research study report entitled “Ready for Retail?”
published in <I>Utility Week</I>, which I have gone back to—it
was quite wrongly maligned by my noble friend the Minister in his
summing up at Second Reading—is a good assessment and is worth
looking at closely. It highlights that of those companies that were
approached, 76% supported amending the Bill to allow retail exit, so I
am not convinced that allowing retail exit is going to unsettle the
investment
climate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:56:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140204102000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000117">The second point put
forward by the Government is that allowing only non-households to exit
the retail market would create a two-tier market where householders
could be left stranded with a water company that has signalled a lack
of interest in providing customer service. To the extent that there is
a concern here, it would be addressed entirely by allowing retail exit
for all customers rather than just the non-household element. However,
even if only non-household retail exit was facilitated, again this
appears to be a weak argument when companies have been forced to
provide these services in any event since privatisation. Since
companies have no choice but to provide retail services because the
licence they signed up to at privatisation requires them to provide an
end-to-end, source-to-tap service, we really have no idea about whether
they are interested, or not, in providing them now—absent retail
exit. Indeed, there is a wide variation in the quality of customer
service provided by companies, with some of
them improving but still some significant gaps at 
<?notus-xml column=185?>the moment. This argument is really an argument
against the status quo. If we have been comfortable with the current
arrangements for the past 20-plus years, it seems odd to start
criticising it
now<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:58:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140204102000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000118">The third point is
that if the Government were to go further and allow retail exit for all
customers, households could be passed to a new retailer about which
they knew nothing and, unlike business customers, they would have no
option to switch if they were unhappy with the quality of the service
they received. This point, which has been made by the Government, is
true on the face of it, but it is rather a xenophobic one. First,
customers have never had any choice over who provides these services
because they have simply inherited their local monopoly provider.
Again, why is this a concern now? Secondly, while the local branding of
companies—Thames Water, Severn Trent Water and so
on—gives us a warm sense of local provision by local companies,
of course they are not local at all. Most of the companies are owned by
Canadian or Australian pension funds, and that ownership changes hands
regularly with customers none the wiser about the process. Generally
the process is very positive for customers because competition in
capital markets brings new investment into the sector, and investors
put pressure on the management of these companies to keep costs, and
therefore bills, down for customers. Surely the key point is that
customers want the lowest prices and the best service, and allowing
retail exit provides that most effectively. Poor performers are moved
out of the market and good performers can grow their market share, even
if they are not the “local
incumbent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T20:59:36"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

mentioned by the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T21:04:27"></hs_TimeCode> is
that introducing retail exit would require a change or create problems
with Ofwat’s price controls. I hesitate to say it, but I think
that is a redundant argument. The current price control arrangements
apply to regionally specific companies and licences. Ofwat is setting
both household retail and non-household retail price control. Allowing
this change would be easily accommodated within Ofwat’s price
control arrangements; in fact they have been designed for that
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T21:00:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the argument is that we should wait to see how the market develops and
make the change later, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said. The
reality is that the water supply licensing regime was introduced as
long ago as 2005 to give business customers choice. That regime has, by
any standards, been a failure. Fewer than 10 customers have switched
suppliers since the market opened because the legislation was
inadequate and inadequately set out and, in many eyes,
overprescriptive. For example, setting out the excess pricing
arrangements in the law—the costs principle—was not a
good idea, another point recognised by Professor Martin Cave and much
prayed in aid by the Minister this
evening<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T21:01:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000121">Business
customers are sceptical about the new legislation because many were
disappointed in 2005. After the false start of 2005, we have an
obligation to get the legislation right and to ensure that the market
works well for business customers. We should not take any risks to
create a second false start. Coming back 
<?notus-xml column=186?>again in 2020-plus to have a third go at making this work should not be
an option. I strongly support the case for
exit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T21:01:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T21:01:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000122"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Selborne" PimsId="637" UID="140204102000244" xid="1426" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000244">The
Earl of Selborne (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, after those two
speeches, there is not much more to be said. For 24 minutes, we have
had a very powerful exposé of the astonishing contradictions of
a Bill which is here to promote competition and which is trying to
implement Professor Martin Cave’s recommendations. The OFT said

this specific market everyone, including the EFRA Select Committee, has
taken a very firm view, which has been forcefully put by the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, and my noble friend Lord Moynihan. The only argument
that I have read that puts the contrary view has been the
Government’s response to the EFRA Select Committee. That
response has been so efficiently demolished that I do not think I need

drew a crumb of comfort from the Minister’s response at Second
Reading. He slightly opened the door when he said that it was just
possible that the Government might wish to think further on this. We
need the ability in the Bill to allow exit at a future date, sooner
rather than later. It needs to be in the Bill, because there will not
be another water Bill for some time. I hope the Minister will look with
approval on these amendments. I do not mind which of the two is

Crickhowell (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a remarkable
brief debate. I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, introduced
the amendment in a very low key, charitably commenting on the
Government’s position. That powerful speech was followed by what
I was going to say was a lecture, but certainly a speech, that ought to
be read by every civil servant in the department, because it was one of
the most impressive speeches—lectures—about market

know my noble friend on the Front Bench knows something about business
and will have listened with care. I beg him on this occasion to listen
to the realities of the market rather than the detached views of civil

deal with market realities as my noble friend Lord Moynihan clearly
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000127">It was
only really when I heard the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and
even more so when I heard my noble friend Lord Moynihan’s
speech, that it seemed we were going to deal with this point about
uncertainty. I simply cannot believe that people advance that as a
serious argument. All the evidence suggests that if you want to have
market confidence—the confidence of investors and of the people
who advise them—you need to have a clause of this kind. Far from
an uncertainty, it is an absolutely essential requirement in order to
give the market confidence. On that ground alone, I believe that this
amendment simply has to be taken seriously by the Government. I
hope that, rather than advancing any arguments that
have been put in his papers before the debate, my 
<?notus-xml column=187?>noble friend makes a very cautious response, takes
away my noble friend Lord Moynihan’s speech and demands that his
department consider it adequately and fully before we come back again

98, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and Amendments 107 and 132,
tabled by my noble friends Lord Selborne and Lord Moynihan, take two
different approaches to enabling incumbent water companies to exit the
non-household water and sewerage retail markets. Amendment 98 would
provide for such exits through regulations produced by the Secretary of
State, and Amendments 107 and 132 through transfer schemes produced by
incumbent water companies and approved by the Secretary of

completeness, I should be clear from the outset that new entrant
licensees may enter and exit both the retail and upstream markets
whenever and however they wish. It could be as simple as surrendering
their licences to Ofwat, and their customers could then be distributed
to other licensees through the supplier of last resort regime
introduced by Clauses 31 and 32. Alternatively, they could sell their
customers or their infrastructure to other licensees ahead of
surrendering their licences. These companies operate only in the
competitive part of the market, serving non-household customers who
will be able to switch to another retailer if they are unhappy with the
service they
receive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000131">However,
these amendments deal with the thorny issue of retail exits by
incumbent water companies, the quasi-monopolies appointed in each area
of England and Wales. We have heard a range of arguments for retail
exits at Second Reading, during the passage of the Bill in another
place and now this evening. This is a complex issue with far-reaching
ramifications for both customers and investors. It is clear that the
intention, at least of Amendment 98, is to allow exit only from the
non-household market, leaving household customers with the incumbent
companies. However, this partial form of exit would leave many
questions unanswered about the future relationship between the
incumbent water companies and their customers in both the household and
non-household sectors. We want our market reforms to lead to real
improvements in services for all customers, including of course
household customers, and we do not consider that making such a change
at this time would be in the overall interest of customers. Before
making potentially far-reaching changes to the relationship between all
customers and their water companies, we would need to ensure that they
were effectively engaged. The Consumer Council for Water, the
independent organisation responsible for making sure that the customer
voice is heard, supports the Government’s approach to retail
exits.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140204102000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000132">We
want to see a successful non-household retail market. The Bill sets a
framework for new-entrant retailers to enter the market on an equal
footing with 
<?notus-xml column=188?>the retailers of the incumbent water companies. We expect Ofwat to use
its regulatory powers to make sure new entrants can be confident they
are competing on a level playing field. Clause 23 introduces a shared
obligation between the Secretary of State, Welsh Ministers and Ofwat to
take steps to reduce the likelihood of incumbents discriminating in
favour of their own retail businesses or associate licensees. However,
retail exits are not about delivering a level playing field. They are
about some incumbents wanting to exit because they do not want to
participate in a competitive retail market and would prefer to stop
offering services to any non-household customers in their area. While
we might expect there to be a more active market in England from 2017,
a scenario in which incumbent companies lose most or all of their
customers is highly improbable. Incumbents sitting around while
customers disappear is, in our view, an unlikely
scenario.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000133">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T21:10:36"></hs_TimeCode>
point we are making is that this is evolution not revolution. Many
non-household customers may choose to stick with the incumbent supplier
because the incumbent supplier improves its services as a result of
these reforms. Where customers choose to switch, we anticipate a growth
market where innovation and competition lead to benefits, both
environmentally and in customers’ bills.</hs_para>

water and sewerage companies are given clear responsibilities for a
reason. Their unique status as virtual monopolies requires some
commitments from them in return. This means that following a retail
exit, the incumbent might still be required to provide retail services
to any non-household customers that move into the area, or when new
non-household developments are completed, or if the market failed.
Incumbents are the default supplier of first and last resort regardless
of whether they are able to hive off their existing non-household
customers to a licensee. Allowing partial retail exits would also open
the door to forced separation. We have already discussed the risks
relating to separation.</hs_para>

was incumbent water companies themselves and their investors that
persuaded us of the risks to future investment should separation be

increase risk to investment and push up costs to customers if they had
to renegotiate their finance packages as a result of restructuring
their businesses. Neither companies nor their investors have told us

noble Lords all around the Committee have knocked down. I am very
grateful for their interventions, particularly the forensic analysis
by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, of why this is a
misunderstanding of
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000144">I
tried to do a relatively simple thing. We are creating a
market in the non-household retail sector and my amendment addresses
only that. We are encouraging entry and improvements, and we surely
have to recognise that that will drive some people out in normal
circumstances. I cannot see what the creation of a market means if you
cannot have that churn. The Government seem fairly stuck on this. Some
of the things 
<?notus-xml column=190?>the Minister said really relate to wider considerations and there is
nothing in these amendments—certainly not in my
amendment—that means forced separation. This is voluntary
withdrawal by incumbents from a relatively small part of the market.
Their new rivals coming in already have that right so it is not a level
playing field. Really, what does this market mean? I know it is small
and that we are making changes that are quite new within the water
sector, but surely we ought just to be bold enough to allow this. I
hope the Minister will recognise that there is a lot of experience in
this Committee and in the industry with a consensus for allowing this,
subject to the kind of safeguards written into my amendment, which give
Ofwat and the Secretary of State huge powers to prevent any
catastrophic effect on consumers of any
sort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000145">Just
before I stood up, I tried to find the quote from Cathryn Ross of Ofwat
that the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, used. I will just end on that
point. If we took the Government’s line—I have lost the
quote again now—we would effectively provide for failing
companies and bake in cost. The Government do not really want to do
that, do they? I hope they will think again. Meanwhile, I will withdraw

Grantchester (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment would ensure
that the Consumer Council for Water would have to be consulted by the
water and sewerage undertakers when they drew up their draft charging
schemes. The importance of this is that it would allow the CCW to play
a role from an early stage and provide the ability for it to flag
problems then, before the relevant bills start arriving on
customers’ doorsteps and further problems
occur.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000147">One
example where the Consumer Council for Water had previously challenged
a charging plan concerned some companies’ plans to restrict
half-yearly payment options for those on direct debit payments. Some
customers prefer to pay in that way, as it better enables them to
manage their money. The elderly, in particular, may want to retain that
option, so it is important that attempts by those companies to stop it
were successfully challenged by CCWater. That is just the kind of
circumstance that the amendment is designed to
pre-empt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000148">That
gives rise to a whole series of problems surrounding direct debits and
whether there should be any extra charge for non-direct debit payments,
which can be disguised as a discount for direct debits. That may become
part of the Consumer Rights Bill, shortly to come before your
Lordships’ House. Another example 
<?notus-xml column=191?>of the benefit that the amendment would create was
provided when CCWater negotiated with companies not to backdate charges
if a company was at fault for initial error that resulted in
substantial backdated charges. That can be as simple as misreading of a
water meter by the water company’s employees. It is clear that
in such an environment it is always useful, and sometimes essential,
for CCWater to have such a say before charging schemes are finalised.
It ties in with other steps that we hope to take to protect consumers
during the passage of the Bill, such as providing for collective
redress where a number of consumers have been subject to
detriment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140204102000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-0003.htm#140204102000149">The

sewerage undertakers to consult the Consumer Council for Water on their
draft charges schemes. That is clearly a reasonable objective. I

noble Lord is right to say that the protection of consumers is
essential, and never more so than in a sector with monopoly

Earl of Selborne:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 108 refers to the
rights to discharge and its purpose is to support the installation of
sustainable urban drainage systems, or SUDS. It is generally recognised
that SUDS are part of the long-term solution towards the sustainable
use and drainage of water. They improve surface water management and
reduced the risk of flooding, and they may include rain gardens,
permeable paving, swales and the like. They are designed to collect
water and release it slowly back into the environment.</hs_para>

have just agreed, clarifies the function of a sewerage undertaker under
the Water Industry Act 1991 to include the building and maintenance of
SUDS features, so we are here to promote SUDS and the Bill does that.
However, there is a problem. To install a SUDS scheme an undertaker, a
water company or a drainage company has at present to
negotiate the right of discharge. Without such a right or with
the prospect of costly negotiations and litigation—there has
been plenty of that—there is little incentive to deliver SUDS
schemes as opposed to surface water sewers.</hs_para>

remove this uncertainty, which has led to litigation and to a lack of
incentive for the installation of SUDS. It helps sewerage undertakers
to deliver SUDS schemes. We are of course awaiting secondary
legislation, which is a separate issue, on the maintenance and the
issues with local government on SUDS. That apart, this deals
with a much more fundamental issue. It would resolve the legal
uncertainty that has arisen since 1989, when a previous water Bill
removed the right of sewerage undertakers to discharge. The amendment
would therefore restore the legal position to where it was before 1989,
when sewerage undertakers had a statutory right, as highway authorities
still have, 
<?notus-xml column=193?>to discharge pure water into any watercourse. I emphasise that it has to
be pure; no one is suggesting that there should be a licence to pollute

traditional pipe discharges, which are inferior in many respects to
SUDS, as I have explained, can be acquired by compulsory purchase
powers. However, again, under the Bill we are not extending compulsory
purchase powers to SUDS. I am not suggesting that they should be but
that once you have the right to discharge, these powers will give an

fact that this has led to such protracted, expensive and time-consuming
litigation demonstrates that the law was left in an ambiguous
situation—to put it at its kindest—after 1989. The issue
clearly has to be resolved but whether the Supreme Court is the right
organisation to do so is another matter. I think it would be more
appropriate for it to be done by an appropriate Act of Parliament. This
is not asking for something particularly unusual. As I said, highways
authorities have the right to discharge at the moment. Before 1989,
sewerage undertakers had the right to discharge. If landowners found
themselves inconvenienced, it would only be in the sense that they were

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, as noble Lords will
know, there are a great many consequential orders in introducing
individual electoral registration, and in changing some of our voting
regulations and arrangements. There was a time when I knew almost
nothing about this area; I am learning more and
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000004">There
are three instruments for debate today. The Electoral Registration and
Administration Act 2013 (Commencement No. 4 and Consequential
Provision) Order 2013, brings into force, for parliamentary elections,
provisions in the Electoral Registration and Administration Act 2013
concerning the ability of voters to cast a vote at close of poll. The
two sets of regulations—the Local Authorities (Mayoral
Elections) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 and the
Neighbourhood Planning (Referendums) (Amendment) Regulations
2014—update the rules for the conduct and administration of
local mayoral elections in England and Wales and neighbourhood planning
referendums in England. They do so by applying or copying provisions,
including those on close of poll, in the Electoral Registration and
Administration Act 2013 and associated secondary legislation, which
made a number of changes to the rules for UK parliamentary
elections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000005">In
the main, the changes in all three of these instruments are intended to
come into effect for polls held on or after 22 May 2014, which is the
date of the European parliamentary elections and scheduled local
elections in parts of England. The changes are designed to improve the
accessibility and security of the voting process and to implement a
number of recommendations which have been made by, amongst others, the
Electoral Commission and the Association of Electoral Administrators.
The regulations concerning neighbourhood planning referendums contain
an additional provision on calculating 
<?notus-xml column=42?>the campaign expenditure limit for campaigners at a neighbourhood
planning referendum. We intend that this should come into force on the
day after the regulations are made. I will set out this change in more
detail shortly. The instruments are part of a comprehensive package of
statutory instruments which make various changes to the rules for
conducting elections and referendums in the UK. The Government have
consulted on the changes with the Electoral Commission and with others
such as the Association of Electoral
Administrators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000006">The
close of poll order—the first order being considered
today—brings into force Section 19 of the Electoral Registration
and Administration Act 2013. That section provides for voters queuing
at a polling station at close of poll to be issued with ballot papers
and to vote, despite the time of close of poll having passed. This
provision addresses the concern expressed during the passage through
Parliament of the ERA Act about the need for a mechanism to deal with
any queues which could, in some circumstances, form at polling stations
at close of poll, given the isolated but highly publicised instances of
queues at polling stations at the 2010 general election. Counting
officers and returning officers will of course still be expected to
carry out planning for polls, to the same high standards as now, to
ensure that there are sufficient polling stations and adequate staffing
levels to manage the volumes of electors likely to vote in person and
to avoid such queues forming wherever possible. The order also makes
provision for persons queuing at a polling station at close of poll in
order to return a postal ballot paper or postal voting statement to
return it despite the time of the close of poll having passed. This
provision has effect in England, Wales and Scotland
only.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000007">I turn
now to the provisions in the neighbourhood planning referendum
regulations and the mayoral elections regulations. I will first discuss
the measures that are specific to the neighbourhood planning referendum
regulations before turning to the key measures that are common to both
these regulations and to the local mayoral elections regulations. The
neighbourhood planning referendum regulations change the basis on which
the campaign expenditure limit is calculated at these referendums. The
limit is currently calculated by reference to the number of electors on
the register published after the annual canvass in the year preceding
the referendum. However, under the transition to individual electoral
registration, a post-canvass register was not produced in 2013. We are
therefore providing that in future the limit will be calculated by
reference to the register as it exists at the beginning of the
referendum period. This period begins at least 28 working
days before a residential poll and at least 56 working days before a
business and a residential poll that happen together. We intend that
this provision would take effect on the day after the regulations are
made and affect any referendum where the referendum period begins on or
after that date.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020491000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000008">I turn to the measures
that are common to both the neighbourhood planning referendum
regulations and the local mayoral elections regulations. Where any
variations exist, I will point these out. Provisions on these matters
were included in amendments previously made to the European
parliamentary election regulations and debated by Parliament, in order
to apply the 
<?notus-xml column=43?>provisions to the European parliamentary elections this May. Both sets
of regulations update the forms used by voters, such as poll cards and
postal voting statements, that are intended to make the voting process
more accessible. The changes continue the work carried out to modernise
the appearance of forms used by voters at newly created polls, such as
the police and crime commissioner elections and the 2011 referendum on
the parliamentary voting system. The revised material has been produced
following a programme of public user testing and consultation with the
Electoral Commission, the Association of Electoral Administrators,
Scope, SOLACE and territorial offices and following discussion with
electoral services suppliers. The regulations also provide for police
community support officers to enter polling stations and counting
venues under the same conditions as police constables. This will allow
police forces additional flexibility in deploying their resources on
polling day, and will allow them to provide a greater visible
reassurance to the public.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020491000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000009">The
regulations additionally make the same provisions as those to which the
close of poll order relates—that is, they provide that voters
waiting in a queue at the close of poll, at 10 pm on polling day, for
the purpose of voting may be issued with ballot papers to enable them
to vote or may return postal voting statements or postal ballot papers
despite the close of poll. Members of the Committee may wish to note
that relevant provisions in the Representation of the People (England
and Wales) Regulations 2001 apply to mayoral elections and residential
neighbourhood planning regulations, so amendments recently made to
those regulations will also apply to these polls. These recent
amendments include: a requirement for 100% of postal votes indicators
to be checked, rather than the current minimum of 20%; the extension of
emergency proxy provisions to those absent on grounds of business or
military service; and the removal of the restriction on postal votes
being despatched earlier than the 11th working day before the day of
the poll. Where relevant and appropriate, the neighbourhood planning
referendums regulations make similar changes for the purpose of
business
referendums.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000010">Overall,
these provisions make sensible and relevant changes for the conduct and
administration of mayoral elections and neighbourhood planning
referendums, in line with those that have been made already for UK
parliamentary elections. They are designed to increase voter
participation, further improve the integrity of our electoral system
and ensure that the processes underpinning our elections are both more
robust and more relevant to the needs of voters. I commend these
instruments to the
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kennedy of Southwark" PimsId="5762" UID="14020491000244" xid="2042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000244">Lord
Kennedy of Southwark:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall deal with each of
these regulations in turn. I intend to be fairly brief. The Electoral
Registration and Administration Act 2013 (Commencement No. 4 and
Consequential Provision) Order 2013 is welcome. It seeks to deal with
the, frankly, appalling situation of voters turning up at polling
stations and being denied a ballot paper. None of us will forget the
scenes at the most recent general election of angry voters being denied
their right to vote. That was wrong and reflected badly on us as a
nation and as a mature democracy.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=44?><hs_para UID="14020491000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000012">I
note that the Electoral Commission has raised some concerns. As a
former member of the Electoral Commission, though, I say that the
Government are absolutely right on this. The concerns are slim and are
a near impossible eventuality. It will, however, be important to get
the guidance right across the piece. Unfortunately, when you are
dealing with hundreds of returning officers, thousands of electoral
staff and thousands of presiding officers on polling day, there is a
risk of someone getting the application of the regulations wrong. I
very much hope that the commission and the Government will seek the
expertise to be found at the AEA, SOLACE and the political parties on
getting the guidance right. It needs to be crisp, clear,
straightforward and useful to implementing these
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000013">We
also have to ensure that police officers or PCSOs are available as we
get to the close of poll. I do not want to see disputes outside polling
stations about who arrived at what time and who did not arrive on time.
I am aware that we have already passed a previous SI in respect of the
European elections, and these SIs refer to the UK parliamentary and
local mayoral polls as well as neighbourhood planning referendums. Can
the noble Lord confirm that we will pass SIs in respect of local
authority and parish council elections in time for this year’s
local election on 22 May? Can he also tell the Grand Committee when the
SIs will be laid for the local mayoral referendums, council tax
referendums and PCC
elections?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000014">It
is important that all these rules that relate to elections are kept
under review. I was first involved in fighting elections 35 years
ago—which I am sure noble Lords will find it hard to
believe—and the changes that I have seen in that time have been
enormous. The Government have a duty to ensure that the law keeps pace
with the changes we see all around us. I have responded to a number of
these statutory instruments in this House, during my time as a member
of the Electoral Commission and as an official of the Labour Party for
over 20 years. If there was ever an area of the law that needed
consolidating and bringing together under one Act of Parliament, it
surely must be the law in respect of elections and electoral
registration. There are so many different aspects of the law in force
in numerous Acts of Parliament, going back to who knows when, frankly,
that it is confusing for everyone involved, in particular for members
of the public, let alone
practitioners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000015">I
noticed in the amendment regulations that there are no numbers for the
people standing in mayoral elections. I understand that that has been
in force for some time—it is not new—but it had
completely passed me by. Can the noble Lord tell the Grand Committee
how taking away the numbers from the candidates helps people understand
which candidate they are voting for? Normally you would vote for
Gardiner number 1, Kennedy number 2, or Wallace number 3, but you now
cannot do that because the numbers are not there. I hope that that will
not be a trend in further SIs for other elections, particularly in
local elections and where there are multiple candidates, as it would
cause complete confusion.</hs_para>

noble Lord made no mention of political parties. In parties, you have
to have practitioners to understand elections—that is how
processes work. 
<?notus-xml column=45?>The Government should consult all parties on these issues, not just
leave it to the Electoral Commission, the AEA and SOLACE, great bodies
though they are. There are also important views to be had from
practitioners on the other side of the fence. I hope that the noble
Lord can respond to those points in his
reply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="14020491000245" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000245">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for those
helpful comments. As he was talking about his long experience in local
elections, I calculated that my first election campaign was a mere 52
years ago.  I say that with particular enthusiasm because, when
I said during Questions this afternoon that I recalled debating the
question of an English Parliament in 1968, the noble Baroness, Lady
Warsi, was kind enough to turn to me and say, “You
couldn’t have been old enough”. However, I was. The
second election campaign I took part in was the Orpington by-election,
which returned Eric Lubbock, now the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, to the
British Parliament, which was a short while ago. So we have all
struggled with election regulations and their proper consideration for
some time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000018">I
can recall as a young man talking to someone who had stood in a
by-election during the Second World War, who told me just how many
regulations had not been observed under those conditions and the
efforts which some locals took to ensure that some votes were not
counted. Nowadays we have some highly effective and dedicated EROs and
others at local level with whom we have to co-operate in close
partnership. The noble Lord is quite correct to say that perfection is
not possible in every single polling station throughout Great Britain,
but efforts are taken to make sure that, as far as is humanly possible,
the same regulations are obeyed in the same way throughout the
country.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020491000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000212">3.45pm</hs_time><hs_para UID="14020491000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000019">On
the removal of numbers, the research has suggested that this would
decrease confusion, particularly in those mayoral elections where that
peculiar Jack Straw innovation—the supplementary vote—is
used. The noble Lord will recall that Mr Straw was willing to move 20%
of the way towards the alternative vote but not to move very far, so
people were allowed to put down “1” and “2”
but not “3”. I recall from when I was a candidate in
Manchester that a number of people of Irish extraction would vote in
our “X” system by putting down “1”,
“2” and “3” because that was the way in
which they had voted in Ireland. We used to have great arguments as to
whether those votes could be included, because it was quite clear what
the intention was even though they had not voted in the right way. The
conclusion from some detailed research is that not having the numbers
makes the ballot paper rather clearer to those who are voting, whether
or not the supplementary vote is being
used.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000020">The
noble Lord also asked about regulations for other polls, including
parish polls. I am delighted to be able to tell him that further
regulations will be brought forward for me, him and others to discuss
in due course in time for local elections in May. I hope that that
answers all the noble Lord’s
questions.</hs_para>

the effect of removing the numbers from the mayoral election ballot
papers, but one of the big problems that such ballot papers cause is
that many people go to vote and put a cross or mark
by the second column and not the first, and are then disqualified. A
huge number of people do that. It may make the ballot papers clearer to
remove the numbers—I am not sure by how much—but the
amount of votes discarded is a real problem. Can the Minister confirm
that there is no intention to remove the numbers from ballot papers for
local elections? As he will know, in the local elections in May,
particularly in London but also elsewhere, there will be a number of
candidates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000022"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="14020491000247" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000247">Lord

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this legislative
reform order concerns a minor amendment to legislation that would allow
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to centralise and modernise one of
the consular functions it offers to British nationals overseas. It
would allow a minor change to Section 41 of the British Nationality Act
1981, which would in turn allow the FCO to amend its own regulations in
order to centralise in the UK the registration of births and deaths of
British nationals which occur abroad.</hs_para>

death registration is not a legal requirement. It is an optional
service available to those born overseas who could have an entitlement
to British nationality at birth and to British nationals who die
overseas. There is no UK legal requirement for a consular birth or
death registration. Consular birth or death registration does not
confer British
nationality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000026">To
go into greater detail, Section 41 of the British Nationality Act
limits the regulation-making power in such a way that, in nearly all
cases, the registration must be done overseas. Once both the British
Nationality Act and the FCO’s regulations have been amended, the
FCO will be able to establish a central consular birth and death
registration unit in the UK, responsible for registering all consular
births and deaths for British nationals overseas.</hs_para>

reform order was laid on 5 December 2013 by the FCO. It is
proposed to be made under Sections 1 and 2 of the Legislative and
Regulatory Reform Act 2006. This allows a Minister to make provision by
order for removing or reducing any burden resulting directly or
indirectly from legislation, and for improving the delivery of a
service.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000028">The
FCO conducted a 12-week public consultation, from July to October 2013,
which was sent directly to 18 expatriate organisations around the world
and was promoted both on the gov.uk website and on the FCO’s
travel advice Twitter account, which has more than 47,000 followers.
There were seven responses to the consultation; only three of these
completed the survey’s online questionnaire, all responding that
they supported the proposed centralisation of the service. Some
respondents did ask practical questions about how the new system would
operate. The low response rate reflects the fact that this is a
relatively low-volume and non-essential service. Following the
consultation,  
<?notus-xml column=48?>the FCO decided to proceed with its plans. It concluded that, although
the change may mean that a few expatriates may incur slightly greater
costs in the short term because of the need to post original documents
to the UK, the majority will benefit from not having to travel to an
embassy or a high commission to submit an
application.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000029">The
FCO intends to reduce fees for this service once the new central unit
is up and running. The unit will provide a more consistent customer
service, be more effective in determining complicated nationality
decisions and provide a more modern online application and payment
system, in line with the Government’s digital by default
strategy. Another determining factor is that centralisation will free
up consular staff in the FCO’s overseas network, allowing them
to focus more on their primary purpose of assisting British nationals
in distress overseas, particularly the most vulnerable. This is
completely in line with the FCO’s new consular strategy, which
was launched in April 2013.</hs_para>

the LRO in December,  the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee confirmed its satisfaction that the order meets
the  tests set out in the 2006 Act. The committee was satisfied
that the legislative reform order procedure is an appropriate way to
amend the British Nationality Act 1981 and that the affirmative
procedure is appropriate for the change proposed. The LRO is required
to amend the British Nationality Act 1981 to allow  the FCO to
register in the UK births and deaths that occur
overseas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000031">The
current method of registration is inconvenient for many customers and
inefficient for the FCO. This is partly because FCO staff are losing
their nationality decision-making expertise overseas since the overseas
passport service was transferred to Her Majesty’s Passport
Office and centralised in the UK. The FCO plans to centralise this
service into a new single-purpose unit by the end of 2014.
Centralisation will allow the FCO to make efficiencies, pass on savings
to customers through reducing fees once the service is up and running,
reduce the risk of making wrong nationality determinations and give
greater focus to its primary consular function of assisting vulnerable
British nationals in distress
overseas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000032">Consular
birth and death registration is not, I repeat, a legal requirement. It
is an optional service taken advantage of by a small number of people,
but it is available to those born overseas who could have an
entitlement to British nationality at birth and to British nationals
who die overseas. Consular birth registration is a separate service
from passports and immigration. It does not confer nationality and does
not necessarily lead to the issuing of a British passport. It is solely
an optional means of recording a local birth overseas with an official
English-language document. To manage customer expectations of the value
of a consular birth certificate, the FCO will include a disclaimer to
explain that the registration is not a UK birth certificate, does not
replace the original birth certificate issued by the 
<?notus-xml column=49?>authorities in the country where the birth took place, is not a
certificate of identity and that the holder does not acquire British
nationality through the registration.</hs_para>

system, with a common online application and payment procedure, will
provide a more efficient and convenient procedure for customers. The IT
will be ready and tested ahead of rolling-out centralisation from
April. It will be a simple upgrade to the FCO’s existing Compass
system, which has been in use for many years. The FCO aims to be fully
centralised by the end of 2014. If a customer has no internet access
then the application may be made at the appropriate overseas post. As
registrations are optional and rarely time sensitive, the FCO
anticipates providing this assistance in only a small number of cases.
It may help if I remark that in 2012 the UK registered some 6,200
births and some 550 deaths overseas; this is a small number.</hs_para>

once again that the proposed amendment to legislation is a minor one
that will help the FCO to modernise and make more efficient the
consular service that it offers to British national overseas. This will
help the FCO to reach its major goal of streamlining non-essential
services and helping our most vulnerable citizens in trouble
overseas.</hs_para>

Kennedy of Southwark (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in respect of the
legislative reform order, I have a few brief comments. The present
regulations oblige the FCO to register births and deaths overseas of
qualifying British nationals when asked. These procedures are
different, depending on where the events took place. I accept that it
is a complex process which needs trained and qualified staff to
undertake this work.</hs_para>

passport issuing service has been centralised from around the globe
back to the UK some time ago. I can see the merits of setting up a
similar procedure back in the UK, with a unit of trained staff which
can develop real expertise in this area of work. Can the noble Lord
assure me that this is genuinely seen as a sensible efficiency measure
and not some sort of back-door reduction in services? Can he tell the
Grand Committee that he is confident that, in all cases, this new
system will be better and that at no point will a British citizen
living abroad be disadvantaged by moving to this new
system?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000037">Whether
it is the joyous occasion of a new life being brought into the world or
the death of a loved one, the official processes that have to be gone
through should be done as simply and quickly as possible. In the case
of deaths overseas, there will also be conditions from the country in
which the death occurred that will need to be complied with. From the
points that the noble Lord made, he has assured us that in no case
would getting a body back from abroad be more difficult with the
adoption of the legislative reform order. In respect of births and
death, is this purely an optional process that people and families can
use, or not, as they decide? If that is the case, I have no further
points to make on this order.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord touched on a
number of wider issues. On British citizens resident abroad, we are in
a different world 
<?notus-xml column=50?>from 50 or 100 years ago. That is part of why we need to adjust. After
all, communications are now infinitely more rapid and easy than they
were even 50 years ago. My wife spent five years working in Florence,
and we spent some time talking to the British consul-general in
Florence, who used to play a large role in the days when a relatively
small number of rich British people lived in Italy, out of touch with
Britain and needing the help of the local consul. Now that they fly
whenever they like from Florence airport to Gatwick, there are instant
communications and we are all within the European Union—and long
may that last—we do not need consular services of that
type.</hs_para>

of what has shifted has been that we are therefore operating on a
different level. The numbers of British citizens living abroad and,
even more, the number of British visitors abroad has mushroomed on an
astonishing scale over the past 50 years. I find it quite surprising
how small the number of registered births and deaths from abroad has
been, given that I have this image—partly from my elderly
parents’ stories of holidays in Spain and Portugal—that
lots of elderly people go on holiday to those countries and do not
quite make it back afterwards. Obviously, this is not a wide-scale
activity.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000040">I
would argue that this is a sensible efficiency measure, which allows
for careful checks of people’s backgrounds and allows the local

course, those who fall ill while abroad—those who are charged
with crimes or indeed imprisoned while abroad and the families of those
who die while
abroad.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14020491000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000292">Motion

My Lords, the Localism Act 2011 introduced council
tax referendums as a replacement for the previous capping regime. It
did this by amending the Local Government Finance Act 1992, into which
it inserted a new chapter—Chapter 4ZA—on council tax
referendums and a new Section 31A, which changed the way local
authorities in England determine their council tax. Other consequential
amendments were made to legislation, including to the Greater London
Authority Act
1999.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000042">The

<?notus-xml column=51?>several minor drafting errors, such as the incorrect classification of

7 also amends the GLA Act to address an unforeseen deficiency in the
statutory timetable for the GLA when setting and revising its budget
and council tax requirement. If the GLA were to set an excessive
council tax increase, in common with the obligations on all local
authorities it would be required to hold a binding referendum to seek
local agreement to the increase. As part of this process, the authority
would be required to draw up an alternative budget that did not require
an excessive increase in council tax, which could be adopted if the
referendum was lost. There are fixed statutory deadlines for these
budgets to be set, revised and approved. Currently it is possible for
the GLA, through error or oversight, to set an excessive council tax
increase without leaving itself sufficient time to gain approval for an
alternative, non-excessive budget. Article 7 provides the GLA with a
way to recover from such a situation, by allowing the Assembly to
approve a revised non-excessive budget at a later

2 is said to be consequential and aimed, it seems, at ensuring symmetry

that this is not retrospective. Can the Minister say what the impact

Article 7, the Explanatory Note was most difficult to fathom, but at
the end of the day it seems to be essentially about a process issue. We
understand that there is currently a range of circumstances in which
the London Assembly has to initiate a substitute consolidated budget,
or substitute council tax requirement, where the Mayor has failed to
present one. However, currently these have to be made within statutory
deadlines. Where a major precepting authority fails to notify an
excessive increase to a billing authority, the precepting authority
must issue a precept based on substitute calculations. However, until
it does so, the billing authority cannot pass any funds back to the
precepting authority, so it needs to have a process for making
substitute calculations at a later date. Is our understanding of that
correct? Is that all there is to this

On Articles 2 to 5, he asked whether there had been any problems

aware of any reported problems, losses or errors on the part of local

things which we see are inaccurate and need to be changed, but we are

me add a few more points to reassure the noble Lord. We are making the
amendment in Article 3 because payments made by billing authorities to
precepting bodies are sometimes subject to revision during the year,
which could involve the precepting body making a payment back to the
billing authority. The article requires major precepting bodies to take
into account any estimate they make of such
payments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:12:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord asked whether Article 5 would affect the basic amount of
council tax calculations. The answer is no. There was, as I said, a
drafting error when the provisions were first produced, so it is right
to make that change; it is clearly inappropriate for them to remain in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000061">The
noble Lord also gave his assessment of what Article 7 meant, which is
that it concerns a process issue, and asked whether his understanding
of it was correct. He is absolutely correct. This is about process and
about making sure that the Greater London Authority is acting in line
with all local authorities in the way that it is required to set its
council tax and consult its electorate. The order will make sure that,
if it is necessary for the authority to hold a referendum because its
budget is excessive, it can both do that and introduce a lower council
tax rate should the referendum not support the excessive council tax
increase. I assure the noble Lord that this is purely about process,
and I hope that we will ensure that the situation that the GLA
inadvertently found itself in is not repeated. I think that I have

regulations were laid before both Houses on 2 December 2013. They
enable the department to charge application, collection and enforcement
fees for the statutory child maintenance scheme introduced in 2012,
which is delivered by the Child Maintenance Service. They also make
provision for the department to close cases on the 1993 and 2003

addressing the regulations in detail, I should emphasise that the
programme of reform began in 2006 when Sir David Henshaw delivered an
independent report on the future of child maintenance. In his report,
Sir David recommended stopping using the CSA as a default option for
parents, and introducing charges to provide both parents with an
incentive to collaborate. Since then, as part of our reform programme,
we have ended compulsion on parents on benefits to apply to the CSA,
secured the powers to introduce a new child maintenance system and
introduced a full disregard of child maintenance for the purpose of
assessing benefit entitlement from
2010.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000068">All
these actions have been about helping parents to collaborate in the
best interests of their children and to reduce levels of conflict
between parents after a separation. This is because evidence suggests
that children do better when their parents work together. We are taking
a twin approach to increasing the number of parents who work together
after a separation to agree child maintenance rather than relying on
state intervention. First, we are supporting them to work together on
not only child maintenance but the whole range of issues faced
following a separation. Secondly, we are incentivising them to think
twice about whether they could set up a more collaborative family-based
child maintenance arrangement without automatically turning to the
statutory scheme.</hs_para>

reforming the child maintenance landscape to put collaboration and
family-based arrangements at the centre. We are investing £14
million in the Help and Support for Separated Families initiative,
directing parents to the support they need during and after separation.
For those unable to make family-based arrangements, the new, faster,
more efficient 2012 statutory scheme, delivered by the Child

propose to introduce fees for those wishing to apply to the 2012 scheme

a charge is applied for it.</hs_para>

parent with care collection fee from the proposed “7 to
12%” to 4%. By reducing the fee to 4%, we have shifted the
balance in favour of the parent with care even further so that it
stands in a one-to-five relationship with the 20% non-resident parent
fee. It is also charged only on money actually collected. It is the
non-resident parent who faces by far the highest charges, reflecting
the fact that they have greater control over whether they use the
collection service. We believe that both parents should make a
financial contribution towards the cost of the service. The proposed
fees will bring in revenue of £170 million per year. This is a
financial contribution towards the cost of the service, which remains
heavily subsidised by the taxpayer.</hs_para>

calculates the amount payable and the non-resident parent makes
payments directly to the parent with care. Direct Pay will provide a
way for parents to access the statutory service in a way that can help
rebuild trust between them. We are also proposing enforcement charges
for non-resident parents to encourage them to comply with their
commitments and to help to offset the cost of administrative action to
enforce compliance. The current system offers no financial incentive

main change is the order in which cases are selected for closure. The
details of this order are included in the scheme that accompanies these
regulations. We will divide the caseload into five segments and close
them sequentially. To summarise: the first cases to be closed are those

cases to be selected will be those where there is an enforced method of
payment in place, or legal enforcement action ongoing. Non-resident
parents in this category will be invited to undergo a positive test for
compliance. They will be required to demonstrate their ability to pay
voluntarily for a period of six months. This will inform the
department’s decision as to whether they should be allowed to
pay the parent with care directly, and avoid collection fees, if an

entirely in favour of everything that can be done, and that this
Government are doing, to try to help people who have had a relationship
that has broken up. I am familiar from long ago with divorce cases; I
did a lot of them but, as the Committee knows, that was a long time
ago. However, the difficulties of interpersonal relationships were as
formidable then as they are now, and I wish every success to the moves
that have been made to try to help people by the Department for Work
and Pensions, the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Education,
which are involved in the Children and Families Bill, which is having
its Third Reading tomorrow. I went to a meeting that Ministers
organised in connection with that Bill, and I had to remind them that
the DWP was also working in this area of trying to help people. Of
course, they said that they work very closely together, so I am glad to
hear that. The closer they get together, the more chance that their
measures will be successful. As I say, I wish them every success in
that. Unfortunately, so far those efforts have not produced universal
success, and the regulations contemplate at least the possibility that
they will not have universal success in future.</hs_para>

to stress is that when it comes to the obligation to maintain a child,
the parents’ obligation is absolute. It does not matter what
sort of dispute they have had with the other party to the arrangements
in the past. I accept immediately that there are many different types
of squabble that can emerge, and it is by no means clear that the
non-resident parent is always fully responsible. I entirely understand
that for the question of the break-up of the arrangements, both parties
usually have some degree of responsibility. When it comes to the
payment of maintenance, though, that obligation is absolute and is not
qualified by the fact that the other party to the arrangement has been
terrible, difficult or whatever. That is what these fee regulations are
concerned with.</hs_para>

I have referred to appears when the collection system comes into
operation. That happens only when the Child Maintenance Service, not
the other party, is satisfied that without the collection service,
maintenance is unlikely to be paid. That is  in Section 137 of
the Welfare Reform Act 2012. The decision that the collection service
comes into operation, with its charges, is entirely the responsibility
of the Child Maintenance Service and has nothing whatever to do with
any responsibility of the parent with care. In that situation, the
imposition of the collection charge on the parent with care is
unjustified in principle.</hs_para>

course, this is not by any means the first time that I have raised this
issue, and I thank the departmental Ministers, who have changed over
time, for the courtesy with which they have listened to the same thing
being said again and again. That has not been an altogether
unproductive process, because concessions have been made that I warmly
welcome. The concessions are narrated in the Explanatory Memorandum; I
will not weary the Committee by going over them but I agree that they
are quite substantial. The most recent one was the reduction from the
7% to 12% charge that was originally thought of to 4% in the case of
the parent with care. As I say, I welcome that very much and am glad
that it has happened. However, as the Explanatory Memorandum says, this
charge remains controversial, and I think it is unjustified in
principle.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, in the very important amendment that he

concessions made by the Government in reducing the application fee for
a child maintenance calculation to £20 and reducing the parent
with care collection charge by 4% on every payment—on which I
congratulate them—there is a real danger that the effect of the
new charging regime will be that fewer children end up with fair and

want to press the Minister for assurances that the Government will
closely monitor what happens to maintenance for children whose CSA

them, case by case, in terms of future maintenance

will not be enough for the Government to congratulate themselves if
fewer parents apply to use the statutory maintenance service, unless
they know for certain that the parents concerned have made private
arrangements for maintenance that result in regular payments of
realistic amounts for the children concerned. Similarly, it will not be
enough to be satisfied that fewer parents are asking to use the
collection service and have opted for a direct payment
arrangement—again, unless they know for certain that those
direct payment arrangements are resulting in regular payment of the
liabilities that have been calculated by the Child Maintenance
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000094">In
the past, the department has said it can assume that every direct
payment arrangement is paid in full and on time because, if not,
parents with care would ask to use the collection service. Even if this
assumption were true now, it will certainly not be true in the future,
given that the collection charges are expressly intended to deter
parents from asking to use the collection service, regardless of the
circumstances. I therefore seek full assurances from the Minister that
the department will track in detail how children fare as their CSA
cases are closed down and charges are brought
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000095"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:39:48"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope" PimsId="4856" UID="14020491000265" xid="1873" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000265">Lord

commanding and profoundly serious way. His weight being added to this
question is something to which I hope that the Minister and department

the clause in the memorandum that says that this is controversial; that
is why it is controversial. This money which is being taken out of the

exclusively, poorly paid families who are doing their best to struggle

is not going to go

there have been concessions, and I do not think that my noble friend
the Minister needs an alibi. He has other fish to fry; this is none of
his business. It is a very bad change. I actually take a more
fundamental view. I have been of the opinion since 1991, when I started
on all of this, that charging was wrong in principle. I am long enough
in the tooth to remember the period during 1993 and 1995 when we tried
charging. I have said this before: it was a 
<?notus-xml column=60?>disaster. Why? Because nobody collected any money. They were not
collecting fees or enforcing debts, so people were saying, “Why
are we paying these fees when we are not getting any money?”.
The scheme was quickly
abandoned<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:42:01"></hs_TimeCode>. We
need to learn lessons about that. I do not believe that even the new,
all-singing, all-dancing Child Maintenance Service—while the
improvements are welcome—can offer guarantees that the
enforcement will be
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:42:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000098">Changing
the balance of my concern, because I have always been really worried
about the parents with care more than anything else, some of the
charges which are going to be levelled at the non-resident parents are
eye-wateringly high. There are a lot of non-resident parents out there
who do not understand the difference that will be made with the
combination of a recalculation and a collection fee. I wait with bated
breath to see where this new co-operation which is going to break out
all over the place is going to start. It is fantasy. A long time ago I
was a divorce lawyer, and I know what people can do one another when
they separate. It is sometimes quite unbelievable. I am sure that my
noble and learned friend Lord Mackay, with his previous distinguished
legal career and all his work with children’s charities, would
reinforce that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
I object to fees in principle. I do not think that they will work. I
hope that I am wrong, but that has always been my position and it is
worth

that we have used for charging fees is flawed. Again, I agree with
everything that my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay has said, but I
want to add a point which has been drawn to my attention by
Gingerbread, which is right in saying that if the Child Maintenance
Service has the weight of decision in testing the question of
“unlikely to pay or not”—to allow the parent with
care to join or stay in the service—that is a contestable
decision. It is an important decision for both parents. It is an
administrative decision which is taken out of both their hands. I do
not know what assurances have been given, or whether there is anything
that I have missed in the regulations which makes it a requirement to
explain in detail why that decision has been taken, but it seems to me
contrary to natural justice. In any other area of public life where
such an administrative decision is made an inbuilt independent appeal
is automatically attached to it. That is entirely absent from this new
system. I appeal to my noble friend to go away and look at the
provisions in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008,
Section 6(5), where, I think, the Secretary of State is given
discretion about introducing an appeal. As part of the undertaking that
I hope my noble friend will give to the Committee to continue to
monitor all this carefully there should be the possibility of the
Secretary of State making that discretionary decision, so that we can
have an appeal available, if it becomes obvious—as I believe it
will—that it is
necessary.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020491000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000218">4.45

statement that charging will induce these behavioural changes is
completely fallacious. The David Henshaw report came out of the blue,
to put it mildly. I did not know him before, and I have not seen or
heard of him since. However, his report was devoid of
evidence—there was no evidence for this ex cathedra 
<?notus-xml column=61?>statement that fees would suddenly make all the difference, the scales
would fall from people’s eyes, they would fall into one
another’s arms and they would say, “Let’s agree it
is £40”, or £50 or £60. It is not real; it
will not happen. In particular, 2 million parents will be caught by the
CSA closure programme over time, 36% of whom have been apart for more
than 10 years. A charging regime, we are asked to believe, will drive
them together so that they can avoid paying the charges. What it will
actually do is cause a whole new level of tension within the families.
If the parties have been apart for more than 10 years the children have
probably flown the nest, and that is probably the safest place for them
when such questions are being considered. It is fantasy. I hope I am
wrong, but I think it is nonsense. This whole policy is built on
sand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000101">Another
point is that for the first time—and this changes the dimension
the department is now operating in—the DWP is conflicted about,
on the one hand, garnering fees to pay the Treasury debts that it has
incurred, and on the other, making proper financial provision for
children in lone-parent families, many of them serially disadvantaged.
I received an interesting answer to a question I asked. Over a 10-year
period, from 2013-14 to 2022-23, fee revenues are estimated at
£1.612 billion. You may say, “Well, there have been
concessions, and it is down from 7% to 4%”, and so on. The noble
and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, made these points, rightly, and I agree
that that is a welcome change, and 10 years may be a long time.
However, that is £1.612 billion that is not going into family
household budgets. The department is now in a very different situation;
it is not trying to do its best for families, but trying to save money.
It cannot successfully do both. The more fees it collects, the less
chance it has of looking after these families and the children in them.
By the way, I do not understand the analysis of future fee income, but
it got past the Treasury and maybe that is all it was designed to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000102">I will
make two further points. It is wrong to start charging in case closure
until we know support systems are put in place. The Minister reminded
us that there will be £40 million over quite a period of time; a
£20 million-period of expenditure will end in 2015,
which will set up the help and support for its separated parents
pilots. However, let us be careful and think about this, as the pilots
will end in 2015, and we heard earlier that this charging process and
the case closure will roll out earlier than that. Therefore it is not
just a question of the system being there and waiting.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020491000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000103">By<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:50:11"></hs_TimeCode>
the way, it is not safe for the department to rely on the fact that
there are a lot of relational support services for separating parents.
There are many, and they are very good, but they are designed in the
main to deal with newly separated parents who are willing to work
together, not people who have been apart for more than 10 years.
Therefore the contexts in which those questions are tested and in which
the support is offered are totally different. It is not safe to go into
this new domain, where the pilots have not been evaluated; I have no
confidence in it. I do not mean that the people who are doing it are
acting in bad faith; I am sure that they are doing their absolute best
and that they are sincere. The resources that were put behind them are
inadequate for the task. If we are 
<?notus-xml column=62?>raising £1.612 billion over 10 years, surely to goodness we can
think about spending a little more money to support those families who
will find themselves in that new and challenging set of
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T16:51:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000104">Finally,
how well is the shiny new Child Maintenance Service doing? As the
Minister said, it has been in operation for more than a year and took
all-new applicants for the first time in November last year. I would
like to know what proportion of current CMS cases have been paid in
full right now. If the Minister does not have that information in his
inside pocket, I would be pleased to hear about it as soon as possible.
I know that those figures will come out in due course, because the
quarterly statistics are informative and regular, and we look forward
to seeing them. However, if there is any way of getting an early rush
on how the proportion of current CMS cases have been paid in full or
not, I would be keen to see that this

how much is owed in current CMS arrears since it began a year ago? The
point of those two questions is that if we taking enforcement
seriously—in my experience that would be the first time since
1993—we must make enforcement professional, efficient and
workable, otherwise condemning people to pay fees is contrary to
natural justice, bad policy, and worst of all, inimical to the

says:</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14020491000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000209">“we
conclude that although the transfer scheme may make savings it may
imperfectly achieve the overarching objective of providing financial
support to
children”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="14020491000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000203">The
Committee engaged in a correspondence with the relevant Minister in
another place, which eventually drew more information out but in my
view was not ultimately satisfactory in providing assurance on that
point.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="14020491000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000111">I
shall ask the Minister to reassure the Committee on those broad points
and then ask some specific questions. First, a number of noble Lords
have raised behavioural issues. The impact assessment assumes that
fewer cases will enter the statutory scheme as a result of the change,
but also suggests that the proportion of arrangements affected will
rise from the current 60% to 70%. The assumptions seem to be rather
optimistic. The present pattern of compliance in family cases is one
thing, but that is not necessarily a guide to what we may expect to see
in future. As my honourable friend Kate Green put it in another place,
at the moment we have parents who may be choosing positively to
co-operate, but in future parents with family arrangements will be
those who simply see it as the lesser of two evils. There will
therefore be a different set of arrangements going on in family
arrangements from those that prevail at the moment, so how confident is
the Minister of those
figures?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000112">On
the cost objective, the Government are clear that they expect to score
substantial financial gains from the new scheme being introduced,
especially as the result of charging fees. Fees both bring in income
and reduce running costs, as parents are deterred from using the
system. However, I looked in vain for a parallel level of ambition to
increase the amount of child support that would actually reach
children, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood. What are the
Government’s ambitions in that connection? After all, the point
of a child support scheme is not to be efficient. It should be
efficient, but its point is in fact to get money from the non-resident
parent to the parent with care. Presumably the Government have some
ambitions for increasing the amount of maintenance that is going to be
transferred to children as a result of the reforms. Could they help us
on that point?</hs_para>

questions about the implementation of the new scheme, some of them
touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and some by the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe. This is crucial as the Government always said that
they would not introduce fees until phase one of the new system was
working well. The Minister told us that the scheme started in November
and that they aimed to move people on from next summer. Can he tell us
a bit more, as the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=64?>Lord Kirkwood, also asked, about how the new scheme has been performing
so far? I will certainly be interested to hear the answer to the noble
Lord’s question about how many cases have been paid in
full.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000114">How is
the interface with HMRC working? I am particularly interested in
self-employed non-resident parents. There is the issue of who is
responsible for enforcement. I am assuming that that will lie with the
CMS but it would be helpful if the Minister clarified that. A common
complaint is when a self-employed NRP declares very low levels of
profit on, for the sake of argument, his business but the parent with
care believes, or has evidence based on his apparent lifestyle, that in
fact a much higher level of income is coming in than might be suggested
by the latest set of accounts made available to the taxman. At the
moment, if she has that evidence she can go to the CSA and it can
investigate that. If that should happen in future, does the CMS have
the powers to investigate that or will it be left to HMRC? If the CMS
has the powers, will it exercise them? If it is HMRC, what assurances
has the Minister had that it will do this and prioritise it over the
other workloads placed on its
shoulders?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000115">When
does the Minister expect to be in a position to publish a full range of
statistics on cases being dealt with by the CMS? Will these stats show

and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, gave us the benefit of his wisdom,
gained over many years, about what happens to divorcing couples and the
challenges that will be faced in dealing with family-based
arrangements. That point was taken up by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood.
I, too, worry that the Government are being overly optimistic about how
easy those parents will find it to make family-based arrangements. I
have seen a copy of a joint letter to the Government from Gingerbread
and Families Need Fathers, which says that 13% to 14% of parents
describe their relationship with the other parent as “not
friendly” and more than 40% of parents in the current scheme
have no contact with one another at all. That is a pretty big standing
start, to go from no contact to being able to agree a familial
arrangement. I am very interested to know what kind of support will be
available to people in that situation to help them to do it. The noble
Lord, Lord Kirkwood, also raised this important point.</hs_para>

previously that their aim was to offer an integrated model of family
support services but, as the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, pointed out,
the pilots are getting up and running only now and some are not due to
start until May. Can the Government explain how they are holding
together their plans to move some of the longer-standing cases, where
the parents are least likely to be in contact, on to the new scheme
early with the kind of provision of help they will need to enable them
to do
this?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000120">Turning
to the question of fees, I would be grateful if the Minister could
clarify the purpose of introducing the fees. Is it to bring in money to
offset the costs of running the scheme, or is it to try to
disincentivise parents from using the scheme? It would be helpful to
the Committee if the Minister could make that clear. If it is the
latter, either solely or in part, what thought have the Government
given the kinds of parents who may be deterred? The Government’s
own statistics show that a third of new CSA applicants have already
experienced a broken private arrangement; more than half have
experienced violence or abuse from the non-resident parent; and almost
six in 10 have poor or non-existent relations with the other parent, as
we have just discussed. So there will be some—possibly
many—parents with care who have good reason to want to use the
statutory scheme, and the Government need to think carefully about the
consequences if the fee regime was used to deter
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000121">I would
also like to understand the role the fees are playing. The noble Lord,
Lord Kirkwood, has been busy with Written Questions, and he drew out
from the Government not just the fee income that is predicted but cost
saving that the service is anticipating over the next 10
years—not just in the current scheme but the additional costs
that will have to be invested. Does the DWP want to encourage parents
to use the statutory scheme to pay fees so that it can use the money to
offset its costs, or does it want to deter them from using the scheme
because that way the running costs will be lower? Given that, what
steer has been given to
parents?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000122">The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, expressed very clear
concerns about the fact that a parent with care faces a collection
charge, despite the fact that she is able to access the scheme only if
it has already been established—and not by her—that the
non-resident parent is unlikely to pay. The Minister mentioned
behavioural incentives. Can he explain what the behavioural incentive
is for the parent with care in those circumstances? If she is able to
access the scheme only when it has become clear that the non-resident
parent will not pay, what should she do differently?</hs_para>

Kirkwood, has raised the question of appeals so I do not need to
revisit that, but I will listen with interest to the Minister’s
response. I have a couple of other small points. One concerns domestic
violence. I very much welcome the decision not to charge application
fees in cases of domestic violence. The Minister will be aware that
even where domestic violence has been alleged or indeed admitted, the
non-resident parent can still use the direct payment option. He will
also be aware that voluntary organisations,

on the safety and security of the parent with care in those
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000124">In
the impact assessment, the Government have recognised the need for some
sort of money transfer option, which would enable the parent with care
to prevent any contact information being shared; for example, normal
bank sort codes will reveal geographical information about where she is
located, and she may have gone to another part of the country to
protect herself and her children from a violent former partner. I
believe that the Government are looking at trying to find some kind of
bank account which would have non-geographical data attached to it. Can
the Minister update the Committee on that? Can he also assure us that,
unless and until a parent with care is able to have that kind of safe
mechanism, she will not be expected to accept payment directly from the
non-resident parent, with the consequences that that

a number of noble Lords have mentioned the 30-month review, which was

me—that that review is likely to be too soon to take advantage
of the data coming out of the longitudinal study to which the
Government have committed. Given that, can the Minister give the

tell me that I have missed, which I may well have done, the fact that

<?notus-xml column=67?>series of suggestions, both publicly and privately to us, aimed at
improving the scheme and helping children. We have listened very
carefully to his representations and taken action to reduce the strain
on the parent with care. Although my noble and learned friend has made
clear his view that the balance is still tilted towards the taxpayer at
the expense of the parent with care, I hope that there is agreement
that this is a question of striking the right balance and that it is
appropriate that we do that by considering actual

as a result of the consultation, we have amended our proposals for case
closure by putting back those cases where parents within the statutory
service have most to lose. We have put to the end of the case closure
process those cases where money is flowing, which often follows
hard-fought compliance, and the flow is maintained only by enforced
collections. We have done this to ensure that money keeps flowing and
compliance continues. These cases are most likely to fall into the
category that my noble and learned friend is most concerned about,
where parents with care find themselves unable to establish workable
direct payment arrangements regardless of their willingness to do
so.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000132">Secondly,
the 30-month review allows us to consider actual behaviour, to check
that the impact of the reforms is as expected and to provide an
indication of whether there are any unintended consequences for clients
or the taxpayer. We intend to evaluate the overall impact of the child
maintenance reforms in wider society, including the impact on overall
maintenance outcomes. Our approach to the review is to use existing
survey and administrative data sources where possible, combining these
with internally and externally commissioned quantitative and
qualitative research where necessary.</hs_para>

aim is that the child maintenance system in Great Britain should work
better. We are going to focus on the impact on children of these
changes. A key criterion for success of our reforms, which will be
tested in the 30-month review, would be to increase the number of
children benefiting from maintenance. Our estimates suggest that this
number should rise, and we look forward to having this confirmed by the
review—a point that the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, was
particularly interested
in<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:11:16"></hs_TimeCode>. If there are
fewer children receiving child maintenance as a result of our charging
regime, this will be made clear by the 30-month review and we could
consider what changes might be required. By that time, we will know how
people will behave and refinements to the system, along the lines that
my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay has recommended to us in the
past—in other words, segmenting the caseload into “can
make direct pay arrangements” and “cannot make direct pay
arrangements”—can be considered on a more informed basis.
To introduce this complexity at this stage would add delay to bringing

reforms will mean that more children will be better off, as our
estimates suggest that there will be an increase in the proportion of
positive outcomes for clients on the statutory scheme. This is due to
more availability of data and more

increase in the number of effective family-based arrangements. In the
statutory scheme, the effect of the annual review coupled with direct
interfaces with Jobcentre Plus and HMRC should mean that in future
fewer cases are nil-assessed, meaning that more money could flow. We
estimate that the percentage of nil-assessed cases will fall from the
current 23% to around 6% of all arrangements in the longer term; I hope

some of the immediate passions have died down. Will charging support
collaboration and what is the evidence for that? Our research shows
that over half of parents could come to a private arrangement if given
support, and the fees regulations provide a nudge towards this
step.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000142">My noble

provides support for separated parents, and this support will be
crucial in helping separated parents through case closure. A programme

will be more children in receipt of maintenance and more effective

will change hands. For example, it would be perfectly possible for
someone who was currently getting the full statutory amount through the
statutory system to have in future a family-based arrangement in which
they agree to take half of that amount to keep each other happy. Will
the Government also be monitoring, and set a target for, the amount of
child maintenance that is changing hands, and will they monitor in
particular whether the amounts for individual families go down? In
other words, one could see a change in the mean—by, for example,
people who are currently nil-assessed joining the system—but

enough tax has been paid but at the moment, as I understand it, and I
would be grateful if he would tell me whether or not I am right, a
parent with care can go to the CSA with evidence showing that the
non-resident parent has higher income than has been declared to the
CSA—for example, if the lifestyle in terms of a house, a car or
money spent would not appear to tally with the relatively small amount

My Lords, over the past year the Green Deal has been
steadily growing in momentum. Around 130,000 Green Deal assessments
have taken place. Nearly 500,000 energy-efficiency measures have been
installed through ECO, cashback and the Green Deal. One company alone
says that it has installed Green Deal measures in nearly 10,000 homes
so far.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000161">The
financing mechanism, allowing customers to pay through their
electricity bills, is only one way of paying for the Green Deal. We now
have more than 1,600 Green Deal plans in the system. The Green Deal
Finance Company is handling around 130 new plan applications a week,
totalling nearly £6 million in funds offered. Forty Green Deal
Providers are now able to offer Green Deal finance, and 19 of these are
actively writing plans for
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000162">One
area where we believe the Green Deal could be particularly effective is
the rented sector. Action to improve the energy efficiency of private
rented properties is, as we know, badly needed. This sector has a
disproportionate number of fuel-poor households—21%
overall—and a high number of F-rated and G-rated properties: 13%
of the stock, almost twice the national average of 8%. To date,
energy-efficiency investment in the rented sector has been constrained
by split incentives. The landlord pays for the energy-efficiency
measures but the tenant benefits. The Green Deal pay-as-you-save model
helps to address this split incentive.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020491000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000163">The electricity bill
payer, who is normally the tenant, meets the cost of the measures
through savings on their overall energy bill. The Green Deal repayments
will appear on the tenant’s electricity bill and will be
collected by their electricity supplier in exactly the same way as
their charges for electricity consumption. However, the cost of these
repayments should be matched by the savings in overall energy costs
that a tenant is likely to benefit from as a result of the Green Deal
energy-efficiency measures. A tenant will pay for the Green Deal
instalments only while they occupy the property and are therefore
benefiting from the measures. The result is that the tenant will live
in a warmer, more 
<?notus-xml column=73?>comfortable home. When the tenant leaves, the responsibility for making
the Green Deal repayments passes on to the new tenant, or to the
landlord if there is a void
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000164">The
only situation in which a tenant will have any liability to pay
anything in relation to the Green Deal after they have left the
property is if they have built up arrears, which include Green Deal
instalments, on their electricity bill. When they move out, their
electricity supplier will send them a final bill. If there are arrears
on the bill for electricity consumption and Green Deal instalments, the
supplier will seek the tenant to pay. This is exactly the same process
as exists now for
tenants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000165">When
a Green Deal plan is first set up, the existing tenant will receive
detailed information about the plan and must give their written
consent. The Energy Act 2011 provides that they have 14 days in which
they can withdraw their consent if they change their mind. The new
tenant moving into the property will be made aware of the Green Deal
through specific disclosure requirements. For example, the energy
performance certificate, or EPC, which is already a legal requirement
in the rented sector, will show the presence of a Green Deal plan at
the property, the energy savings that will arise and the level of the
repayments. A new tenant will therefore have all the information that
they need before they decide to rent the property. They also have the
right to request a full copy of the Green Deal plan from the landlord
or the Green Deal
provider.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000166">We
expect to see real demand for the Green Deal in the private rented
sector, both from tenants who want to live in more energy-efficient and
comfortable homes and from landlords who wish to improve their
properties. This provides a real win-win. We expect this to increase as
a result of the minimum energy efficiency standards that we are
developing for landlords. The Green Deal provides a mechanism that did
not exist previously for tenants to work with landlords to improve the
energy efficiency of their homes. We want to make sure that tenants do
not live in cold, damp and draughty houses for which they end up paying
too much on their energy
bills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000167">Among
the reasons cited by landlords for their caution towards Green Deal
finance was that they needed greater clarity about how consumer credit
legislation worked with the Green Deal to have confidence to lend at
scale. The amendment to the Consumer Credit Act, provided by the order
we are debating today, will give that confidence. We have thoroughly
reviewed the consumer credit legislation to ensure that it will work
effectively with the Green Deal. Although this analysis has taken long
than expected, the amendment will now allow the same Green Deal plan to
be offered to all customers, irrespective of what type of property they
live in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000168">I
turn to the details of the order. The credit arrangement introduced by
the Green Deal, otherwise known as a Green Deal plan, is a new form of
unsecured credit. In owner-occupied properties the customer arranging
the energy efficiency improvements will generally pay the repayments as
they are paying the electricity bill. However, as I have mentioned
previously, in the rented sector the landlord is likely to arrange for
the 
<?notus-xml column=74?>improvements while the tenant makes the repayments. This has given rise
to some uncertainty. When is a Green Deal plan regulated by the
Consumer Credit Act, and who is entitled to the protection of the
Consumer Credit Act for a Green Deal plan? Is it the tenant or the
landlord?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000169">To
help to address these uncertainties, the order that we are debating
today makes specific amendments to the Consumer Credit Act. The order
does not change existing Green Deal policy or its legal framework. The
amendments will, however, give Green Deal providers greater clarity and
confidence when issuing Green Deal plans. In turn, that will encourage
more people to take up the Green Deal.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020491000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000170">In particular, these
amendments resolve two key issues. First, to address concerns relating
to the difficulty in determining whether or not a particular Green Deal
plan is regulated, we have now provided that almost all domestic Green
Deal plans will be regulated by the Consumer Credit Act, regardless of
those who are making the improvements. Tenants moving into a domestic
property can be reassured that they will receive the protections
afforded by the Consumer Credit Act. Non-domestic Green Deal plans will
be regulated only if the person arranging the improvements is an
individual, not a business. This approach will greatly simplify the
process for Green Deal providers and ensure that in all appropriate
cases Green Deal plans are regulated under the Act—including,
for example, where a Green Deal plan is set up by a corporate landlord
during a void
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000171">Secondly,
while our key policy concern has always been to ensure that consumer
tenants receive all appropriate protections under the Consumer Credit
Act, we received feedback that the landlord, or the person making the
improvements, should be entitled to certain rights and protections, so
we carefully analysed this Act to determine which protections would be
relevant to them. Following this analysis and discussions with a wide
range of stakeholders, our amendment provides that both the bill payer
and the person making the improvements are given the protections of a
debtor, but each for specified sections of the Act. This ensures that
tenants and landlords receive the specific rights and protections that
are relevant to their roles under a Green Deal
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000172">To make
it clear for Green Deal providers which sections of the Consumer Credit
Act will apply to a particular person, our amendment sets out
whether  a reference to the debtor in the Act is to be read as
a reference to the bill payer at the time when the plan is made, the
current bill payer, any previous bill payers who have arrears
outstanding or the person making the improvements. Our approach is that
the bill payer, who has liability to pay instalments under a Green Deal
plan, will receive all material and appropriate consumer protections.
There will be no reduction in the level of customer protection that a
tenant can expect. However, the person making the improvements, for as
long as they are an owner or occupier of the property, will also
receive a number of protections.</hs_para>

amendments will not alter the principles, provided for in the Energy
Act 2011, that whoever is the bill payer at a given time is liable for
making repayments 
<?notus-xml column=75?>under the Green Deal plan. As mentioned previously, a new bill payer
automatically becomes liable for instalments from the time when they
assume responsibility for the electricity bill—for example, when
a new tenant moves into the property. Landlords will become liable for
Green Deal instalments if they become the bill payer—for
example, during a void
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000174">As
the Committee may be aware, the regulatory regime for consumer credit
is changing on 1 April. After that date, lenders will need to be
authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority rather than the Office of
Fair Trading. In the next couple of months, we therefore also intend to
introduce some small amendments to the FCA’s legislation to
reflect the approach set out in this order.</hs_para>

conclusion, I firmly believe that the amendments to the Consumer Credit
Act brought about by this order will ensure that consumers and tenants
who pay money under a Green Deal plan receive all the appropriate
protections. It will give the clarity that Green Deal providers are
seeking and give them the confidence to offer plans to consumers across
all property sectors. This will allow them to access the untapped
demand and to press ahead with rolling out the Green Deal across the
country at scale, delivering warmer homes for us all. I commend the
order to the

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
excellent explanation of this rather technical document. I have to
disappoint the Committee by saying that my comments will not be
immensely profound today, except to say that I welcome the statutory
instrument because it helps to clarify to a number of the parties
involved in the Green Deal exactly what happens and when. That has to

number of us have been slightly frustrated at the rollout of the
finance, what the Minister said about the stimulus that the Green Deal
has given to a number of people to really investigate getting better
insulation for their homes was very important. It is obviously one of
the big challenges for our nation in terms of meeting carbon targets,
let alone in terms of addressing fuel poverty, that we increase the
thermal efficiency of our housing stock, and the programme is at least
doing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:45:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000178">One
thing struck me as the Minister was speaking, but I am sure that the
answer that it is no problem at all. With the increased amount of
switching that is now going on—much as the Government have
encouraged and been quite successful in stimulating—I presume
that there is still no difficulty in terms of where the liability goes,
arises or follows through after a number of switches of accounts by
tenants when they come in, because I hope that that will be an
increasing feature of the market in terms of

bear with me, I want to make a few general comments about the Green
Deal and then some specific comments about the statutory instrument. I
agree that if the impetus behind the instrument is to create clarity
about the protections that exist for tenants and owners under consumer
protection legislation, it must be a good
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:46:54"></hs_TimeCode> and we

see how the Green Deal more generally is playing out. We have seen
130,000 assessments undertaken but, from those, fewer than 700
financial deals being taken out. The Minister in the other place has
been keen to point out that what we want is measures undertaken, and
that is a good thing, but the low take-up of the financial aspects
points towards something about the scheme that may need to be reviewed.
It is clear that it is not as popular as we might have hoped. We look
forward to further announcements from the Government on how they are
going to change that. A very low take-up of the financial package
creates a very small pool of people carrying a liability with them that
never becomes normalised or well understood in the wider populace. It
can disadvantage those early adopters if it does not ever take off.
They will carry liabilities on their properties that few people
understand and may instinctively dislike. So the take-up of the
financial package is important. It is good that measures are being
taken on personal finance and other financial mechanisms, but the
Government cannot simply point to the assessments and say, “Oh,
it’s all fine”. The financing was always a key part of
this and we have to assess why it is not being taken up with more
vigour and
enthusiasm<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:48:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000182">The
other question that arises is around monitoring. The assessment of the
Minister in the other place was that 80% of people who undertake an
assessment go on to fit measures. That sounds great, but I am afraid
that I do not know how that number was calculated or where those
numbers are recorded. Perhaps we could hear more about that number. If
the numbers are to be a mechanism, but outside the financing mechanism,
that tips or nudges other people into action, we perhaps need to think
again about how we record and monitor what is actually happening. The
figure should be not a guesstimate but a hard number that we can
publish and have confidence
in<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-04T17:49:07"></hs_TimeCode>. Perhaps it
is simply a matter of requiring the companies that undertake the
measures to report to an agency. Perhaps the Landmark Group, which
currently monitors the EPC, could be that group; it could keep a
record. I would be interested in the Minister’s comments on
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000183">I turn
to the rented sector, which is the focus of  this new
clarification. This is an important issue. The Minister has stated, and
it is clear, that a disproportionately large number of people live in
fuel poverty in this sector, and the housing stock, with 13% of
properties rated F or G, is not being invested in. A lot of people in
the private rented sector are living in cold, damp homes. We must
address
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000184">I take
the point about the split incentives: it is very difficult to get this
right. If it is left on the landlord, they do not feel the benefit of
the reduced bills. If the bill payer carries the entire burden, they do
not get the same benefit as the landlord whose property has been 
<?notus-xml column=77?>improved and made more attractive. The Government might say,
“Well, that’s the way the balance has to tip and
we’ve now tipped it back in favour of the tenant”, which
is probably a good thing, but it raises a few questions. One is that,
while landlords will presumably get some protection under the Consumer
Protection Act, what will happen to a property where the tenant leaves
but it is then left vacant for a lengthy period? Is it simply that the
financial deal is suspended? What happens during that period? There
could be properties that are vacant for quite a long time. What then
happens to the creditor who is expecting payments that are not being
made? Is the time frame extended? What happens in those
cases?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000185">There
may also be landlords—this will probably not happen
frequently—who decide to stop renting and to sell their property
for development or demolition. What happens in those circumstances? If
it is sold on as a house or as a dwelling that can be lived in, I can
understand that it would pass, but if it is demolished, who then makes
good the debt owed to the energy finance
company?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000186">There
are questions around the rented sector that need to be looked at. The
Minister mentioned an existing legal requirement to produce an energy
performance certificate if a property changes hands between tenants.
This is, I believe, poorly enforced. In the publication <I>Energy in
Buildings &amp;</I><I> Industry</I> of November-December 2013, it was
revealed that DCLG is currently forced to pay compensation to Landmark,
the body that collects the certificates and does the administration, to
the tune of £6 million because too few people are complying with
this legally binding requirement from the European Union. This seems
crazy: taxpayers’ money is being spent to make good a contract
signed with a private company because of a failure to enforce a legally
binding requirement. That needs to be sorted out. If the uptake of
energy efficiency in the rented sector is insufficient, we should look
first at why we are not enforcing the use of legally required energy
performance certificates. The statement that new tenants will have all
the information necessary to decide whether they want to move into a
property sounds slightly hollow when the evidence is that the uptake of
the legally binding EPCs is not present. The bedrock of enforcement
seems not to be in place. Could the Minister come back to me on what we
are doing to enforce EPCs in the rented
sector?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020491000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000187">My
final point is that it is good that this statutory instrument is
addressing the issue of uncertainty and consumer protection. That is
one uncertainty too many, and it is good that it is being resolved with
this change in the law. However, this policy continues to be affected
by a range of uncertainties. We know that the poor take-up of the
financing package is going to lead to changes. We expect it to be
continually updated and changed as we find out more about how people
are taking it up. That is good if it finally leads to a successful
scheme. However, it has been mentioned that the golden rule may
change.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020491000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140204-gc0001.htm#14020491000188">If
the golden rule changes, and the payback necessary to comply with the
golden rule changes, you may edge into the situation where a tenant
takes on a lot of debt, knowing they are going to be moving on quite
soon, 
<?notus-xml column=78?>and the incoming tenants are then facing something quite unattractive.
In those situations, I suspect that landlords are left with potentially
unrentable properties. That is something that no one wants to see. It
could act as a disincentive for landlords to embrace this scheme, if
they fear that there will be a low take-up, high risk and the potential
for their properties to be priced out of the market through measures
that do not comply with the golden rule. As this policy is being
modified, we need to think carefully about the detailed implications.
On that point, however, we support this

which I will refer in a moment. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady

noble Baroness’s opening comments about the take-up of the Green
Deal, we tend to assume that everything has to be done through a
particular type of finance scheme. We have found that the Green Deal
finance is only one payment option for getting Green Deal measures in
place. We have found that self-finance—people going out, taking
on measures and paying for them themselves—has been a much more
popular way of getting these measures in place. The noble Baroness
mentioned the numbers. We know that 500,000 measures have already been
put into around 400,000 homes, whether through ECO, self-finance or
Green Deal finance. To reduce the issue to being seen only through the
success of Green Deal finance distorts the real picture of the Green
Deal, which is that it is a long-term programme to ensure that we get
real energy-efficiency measures put into homes. Those measures may be
financed in a variety of ways.</hs_para>

say to the noble Baroness that we need to take heart. Feedback has come
back from one company that has managed to install Green Deal measures
into 10,000 homes. The picture is not always as clear cut as measuring
it only against Green Deal financing, which slightly distorts the
programme’s actual success. Yes, it is slow, but it is a
slow-but-steady-progress programme; we would expect that, because it is

Teverson asked whether switching would have an impact on the rights of
the customer. The customer is able to switch suppliers exactly as he or
she can currently do. What they cannot do it switch to smaller

Lady Worthington, asked what would happen when a property was
demolished or ceased to exist. The owners would still be liable to pay
because the Green Deal would still be in place. She also asked about
the regulations for the private rented sector. We plan to consult
shortly on new regulations to require landlords to improve their homes
from 2018. From 2016, landlords should not really be able 
<?notus-xml column=79?>to refuse measures if the regulations make them put the measures in. We
ultimately want housing stock with energy-efficiency measures, to
reduce energy usage and ensure that tenants in those buildings do not
end up paying over the odds for energy use.</hs_para>

We are working very closely with the DCLG to improve EPC compliance. We

That is right and correct. We will make changes where we can make
improvements. It is right that we have constructive debates towards
that. I have always said to the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, and

Worthington:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for her response. Just
before she sits down, I want to reiterate the point about the
measurement of these measures. There is a danger here that we are
seeking slightly to rewrite history. When the Green Deal was launched,
it clearly was all about the finance package, and that was meant to be
what was going to unlock it. My concern 
<?notus-xml column=80?>is that if we move the goalposts and now say, “Well,  it
was always about assessments; that’s the main 
thing”, or, “Self-financing is the
important thing”, that  creates a problem where early
adopters are taking on a mechanism which, if it does not become well
understood or commonplace, will mean that we see people not wanting
those properties. That disadvantages people who implement the measures
because the understanding of the package and the
liabilities—this weird thing that never becomes
mainstream—stays niche. That is the issue.</hs_para>

encouraged to hear that the Minister’s department is working
with the DCLG. This is an important issue; after all, it is a legal
requirement, so it is very basic. Before we make new requirements,
could we perhaps look at thinking about more public information for
tenants? That could include advertising, making sure that tenants are
aware of their rights to request a new certificate, and maybe adverts
that are being placed should carry EPC certificates, as they often do
now when you buy a house. Perhaps tenants need the same. I am
encouraged by that and I look forward to hearing more about
it.</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely grateful for those
comments. I go back to my point that, while it is important that Green
Deal finance is an important part of the programme, we do not seek to
make that the only method by which people can access measures. Overall,
we have seen that people who want to go out and get these measures done
are actually doing it through their own self-financing. The Green Deal
finance is available, but if they choose to find an alternative way, it
is their right to do so. The suppliers make it very clear, through
their installers, what measures will work and how they will be
reported. We are also working with the Council of Mortgage Lenders to
ensure that we educate them on the Green Deal as well, to prevent it
becoming a barrier to people wanting to access

the awareness and accountability of Afghan police on the protection of

disparate community-based forces with wide-ranging motivations
including ethnic rivalry and political grievances. It does not have a
command structure in the conventional military sense and has no clear
single commander. Various claims have been made during the recent
conflict about the political affiliation and command of groups of Nuer
youth, described as the White Army by some commentators and political
leaders, but evidence to support these claims is limited.</hs_para>
