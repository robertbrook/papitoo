made eloquently—and, I thought, in a very measured way—by
the Governor of the Bank of England in his speech last week in

proposed inevitably involves ceding some degree of national
sovereignty—the very opposite of what independence is supposed
to be about. One wonders why any nationalist would, in all sincerity,
genuinely want one.</hs_Para>

consequence of the reduction in the number of companies operating in

business people having concerns, we are talking about a threat not just
to business, but to jobs. The UK is now the fastest-growing economy in
the G7, and unemployment in Scotland is at 6.4%, which is significantly
lower than the average across the UK, which is 7.1%. We have achieved
that because we are part of the UK, not despite it. It is a result of

expected, and that immediate action is required. The Environment Agency

in Dorset, with many people losing their electricity. More than 60,000

run the Department but to hold to account those who do. That is

want to start with a simple observation: successful economies cannot
exist if suppliers take advantage of their customers and do not act in
their best interest. Competition helps to ensure that suppliers do the
right thing, but when a service or product is complex, and when the
customer cannot know whether he or she is receiving a good service or
buying the right product, the onus has to be on the supplier to act in
good faith. It comes down to trust. We trust that the service we
require will be delivered to the best of the ability of the person or
company providing it. We also trust that the product we purchase works
and can do the job. If not, we demand some kind of redress and do not
expect to pick up the repair bill. Those who act in a professional
manner will guard against bad
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000021">One
place where trust and professionalism are vital is in the financial and
investment services industry, but here is the problem: the agent of the
agent of the saver can lose sight of the ultimate customer’s
best interest. Nowhere is that clearer than in the investments of our
pension industry, which is worth more than £2 trillion, or 135%
of the size of the UK economy. With those statistics in mind, and with
auto-enrolment bringing an additional 11 million savers into the
system—many of them low-paid—the industry has a great
responsibility to get it
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000022">Today,
millions of pension savers from all over the world own shares in global
companies. For the most part, these people are not wealthy investors;
they work in shops and factories, small businesses and local
government. Are all these companies run on their behalf to make a
decent profit to pay a pension, and in a socially responsible way? Does
our investment industry encourage them, on our behalf, to do so and
bring them to book when they do not? Does the investment industry
encourage the long-term profitable investment that its pensioner
clients need? In most cases the answer is yes, but in some cases the
system
fails.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000023">I
believe that those whose task it is to look after the money of millions
of pension savers should be under a fiduciary duty. We insist on it for
pension trustees, but that obligation should not be lost if the
management of the fund is delegated to someone
else.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000024">Over
the decades, the Labour movement has championed workers rights. Now we
must champion the rights of working people as capital holders and
investors in the stock market. They are the new capitalists and they
are our people, too. We must call on those who manage our funds to do
so by putting our interests ahead of their own. At the core of every
decision they take should be the savers’ interests, because it
is our money, not theirs, for which they have responsibility. That is
the essence of fiduciary duty. Financial institutions need to reflect
such duties in the way in which they practise their craft. 
<?notus-xml column=278?>That is why fiduciary duties, transparency and
accountability are important, and that is why I wish to bring in this
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000025">For
pensioners, sustainable financial performance is what counts. This Bill
is intended to emphasise the importance of the long-term result, which
is the one that counts for millions of hard-working pension savers in
our economy. I agree with ShareAction that, just as section 172 of the
Companies Act 2006 requires company directors to have regard for the
consequences of any decision in the long term, we should require
investors in charge of our pension savings to be similarly enlightened.
Those investors should also have regard to the impact of decisions on
the financial system and the real economy, and take stock of social and
environmental considerations as well as the implications of any
investment activities on the
beneficiary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000026">All
of this is important because in 2010 only 11.5% of UK shares were owned
by individuals. In the 1960s the figure was more than 50%. Today, the
major investment decisions that affect companies are taken by asset
managers controlling trillions of pounds. That money is our money. We
want to know where it is invested and why. This Bill would make it a
requirement for pension funds to detail where they invest. Votes taken
by asset managers on the remuneration of corporate executives should
also be in the public domain. Those votes represent our interest and
should not be
secret.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000027">The
Bill would also ensure that fees paid to pension managers and other
intermediaries should be transparent, including an explanation of how
much they are and why they are necessary. The Office of Fair Trading
has discovered 18 different charges levied on pension funds, many of
which we are not even told about. All of this matters because it is
unacceptable for fees to eat up as much as 40% of a pension
pot.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020565000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020565000028">Lord

people are trapped on the ward and cannot go home because there is not
adequate support at home. That means that A and E
cannot admit to the ward because the beds are full. Hospitals are
operating way beyond safe occupancy levels. Because of that, the whole
hospital begins to jam up and the pressure backs up through
A and E. When A and E

I know Warrington hospital well and the pressures that have been on it,

country because so many ambulances have been held in queues outside
A and E, unable to hand over patients to
A and E staff because it is full. That has left
large swathes of the country—particularly in rural
areas—without adequate ambulance cover, and very serious
incidents have taken 
<?notus-xml column=284?>place across the country, not least in the Minister’s area of

treatment for “Gove-itis” is being rationed, like
everything else, unfortunately. As my hon. Friend said, the Government
claim they are keeping A and Es and 
<?notus-xml column=286?>call them “local” A and Es, but they
are actually downgrading A and E units all over
the country. How can it make sense to close and downgrade A
and Es in the midst of an A and E
crisis? In west London, as my hon. Friend knows, incredible changes are
being introduced without proper regard for the evidence I am presenting
to the House today of a change in A and E and of
sustained pressure on A and E units. The
Government must go back and consider their plans for my hon.

complacency, but synthetic rage does not help either. He must remember
that when he was Health Secretary, and indeed a Health Minister, up to
seven ambulances were queuing outside Treliske hospital in Cornwall.

the Government’s Health and Social Care Bill, and I pay credit
to him for that as we worked across party lines on that issue. It is my
job to hold the Government to account where there are problems in the
national health service, and if the Minister is saying to me that there
are no problems in the health service right now, I am afraid I do not
agree with him. Emergency services are under intense pressure. If he
looks back to our time in government, as he invited me to do, the
winter crisis was a regular feature at the turn of the millennium and
the early years of the last decade, although it got progressively
better and better and we did not see the annual winter crisis. Now it
is back with a vengeance, although it is different. The winter/spring
crisis has become a summer/autumn crisis too. The pressure is
relentless and it needs a proper, lasting

did not continue to misrepresent what  I said on the NHS. I
have never said, “Cut the NHS”. I stood at the last
election on a commitment to protect the NHS budget in real terms. He
stood on a manifesto promising real-terms increases for the NHS. I said

that 
<?notus-xml column=287?>they could not get through to Ministers who were obsessed with
structural reorganisation. They were left feeling like John the Baptist

of the major problems with the pressure on A and
E is the number of older people trapped in hospital. This is a product
of demographic pressure and the ageing society. Nursing staff talk of
how, when they first qualified, it was rare to see someone in their 90s
on the ward. Now they are there in great numbers and that makes the
task of meeting their needs much more complex. When people reach an
advanced age it is simply not possible to separate out their physical,
social and mental needs. Need becomes a blur of all three. Our
hospitals are not geared up to provide the additional mental and social
support that very frail elderly people often
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020566000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020566000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Margot James" PimsId="5592" UID="14020566000075" xid="1202" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020566000075">Margot

all, of the needs of older people are met in an acute hospital
environment, which explains why their condition often drops like a
stone. It is a phenomenon that was accurately identified by Robert
Francis QC in his report, published a year ago this week. He called for
an overhaul of the way in which older people are cared for in acute
hospitals. He was right to do so, and while I applaud some of the steps
the Secretary of State has taken in that regard, such as the move
towards a named consultant, I do not believe it will tackle the root
cause of the problem, which is the arrival of far too many older people
in hospital in the first place. Only when that is tackled will we begin

Burnham:</Member></B> My hon. Friend puts his finger on it. There are
families who are choosing between eating, heating or other essentials,
such as prescriptions. That is the reality for many families and it is
having an impact on their health. For those on the Government Benches
not to recognise that that is the reality of life for many people, I
fear for the state that we are in. They have been shouting at me for
the past few minutes about scurvy. I can tell the hon. Member for
Taunton Deane (Mr Browne) that the number of admissions has
doubled. There are a relatively small number of cases, but they are on
the rise. He really should not sit there barracking and dismissing the
whole problem. He would do well to look at the
facts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020566000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020566000034">Today,
the Secretary of State says that the NHS  got better in the
past year. He should say that to the 131,000 people left waiting on
trolleys for more than four hours. He should say that to the people
finding it harder to get a GP appointment under his Government, left
ringing the surgery at 9 am to be told that nothing is available. He
should tell that to the families of children who have suffered a mental
health crisis, but are told that there are no beds available anywhere
in the country and end up being held in police cells. The truth is that
the Government have failed to get the A and E
crisis under control and it is threatening to drag down the rest of the
NHS. In the past 12 months trolley waits are up, waiting times are up,
emergency admissions are up, cancelled operations are up and delayed
discharges are up, too. That is the reality of what is happening in the
NHS.</hs_Para>

main reasons for the intense pressure on A and E
is the collapse of social care in England. In December, a report from
the Personal Social Services Research Unit found that, due to local
government cuts, social care support in the home has been withdrawn
from about 500,000 older and vulnerable people. These 
<?notus-xml column=291?>are people who were receiving support in the home, but are no longer
getting any help. Even for those people still receiving some
support, we continue to hear stories of corners
being cut: slapdash 15-minute visits where staff have to choose between
helping people wash or helping people eat. If we carry on like this,
our hospitals will become more and more full of older people.
A and E will be overwhelmed by the pressure and
that really is no answer to the ageing society. That brings me to the
second part of our debate today: the
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020566000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0001.htm#14020566000036">What
is clear to most people is that there will not be a solution to the
sustained pressure on A and E without better
integration of hospital services with social care, primary care and
more collaboration between the two. What is also clear is that there is
now great frustration among people working in the NHS that they are
being prevented from developing solutions to the A
and E crisis by a large barrier standing in their way: the
Health and Social Care Act 2012. This Government like to talk about
integration, but the fact is that they have legislated for
fragmentation. Under this Government, market madness has run riot
throughout the NHS and is now holding back solutions to the care that
older people need.</hs_Para>

Burnham:</Member></B> I agree with the hon. Gentleman. There are
examples of good practice out there, but I suggest that he speaks to
chief executives of clinical commissioning groups and trusts. They are
telling me that the competition regime introduced by his Government is
a barrier to that kind of sensible collaboration. The chief executive
of a large NHS trust near here says that he tried to create a
partnership with GP practices and social care, but was told by his
lawyers that he could not because it was anti-competitive. Does the
hon. Gentleman support that? Is that what he thought he was legislating
for when he voted for the Health and Social Care Act? People are being
held back from doing the right thing for fear of breaking this
Government’s competition rules.</hs_Para>

heard of two CCGs in Blackpool that have been referred to Monitor for
failing to send enough patients to a private hospital. The CCG says
that there is a good reason for that: patients can be treated better in
the community, avoiding costly unnecessary hospital visits. That is not
good enough for the new NHS, however, so the CCG has had to hire an
administrator to collect thousands of documents, tracking every
referral from GPs and spending valuable resources that could have been
spent on the front line.</hs_Para>

clinicians? The Government said that they were going to put GPs in
charge. Instead, they have put the market in charge
of these decisions and that is completely unjustifiable. The chief
executive of Poole hospital said that it cost it more than £6
million in lawyers and paperwork and that without the merger the trust
will now have an £8 million deficit. That is what has happened.

hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) today made some strong
accusations. He talked about the worst winter in A and E for a decade.
For months now, he has been predicting a winter crisis in A and E, but
as ever, when we look at the facts, they simply do not stack up. Let us
look at the last week available for A and E statistics, which
is the week ending 26 January. Over 96% of patients were seen within
four hours. At this stage in the winter, we have missed the target four
times; at the same stage when he was Health Secretary, he had missed it
12 times. That is three times more.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> He says the target is different.
It is true: on the basis of advice from clinicians, the target was
reduced from 98% to 95%, so let us strip out the targets altogether and
just ask a simple question. How many people every day are being treated
within four hours? Under him, it was fewer than 52,000; under this
Government it is nearly 55,000. That is 3,000 more people every
day.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman did not just say that; he also said that people were
waiting longer and longer to be seen, but that is simply not true. When
he was Health Secretary, shockingly, people had to wait on average over
an hour to be seen in emergency departments. With 350 more A and E
consultants—as my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk (George
Freeman) rightly mentioned—under this Government we have cut
that to just 30 minutes. The right hon. Gentleman has the gall to stand

debate in the House about section 75 of the Health and Social Care Act,
and his Minister had to withdraw the regulations and rewrite them, but
the view of the entire NHS is that section 75 requires services to be

putting behind them Labour’s appalling legacy of poor care. We
have 14 hospitals in special measures—all of them, incidentally,
with A and E departments—making encouraging progress after a
very difficult year, with 650 additional nursing staff and 50
board-level replacements between them. Every single one of those
hospitals had warning signs under Labour, but rather than sorting out
the problems, Labour chose to sweep them under the carpet, sometimes
because they had arisen during the run-up to an election. There are
5,900 more clinical staff in the NHS than there were a year ago, and
there

not hidden away. We will keep people out of A and E departments in the

England; to apologise to the relatives and survivors of Mid Staffs not
just for what happened, but for the policy mistakes that led to what
happened; and to commit Labour to more compassionate, safer care in the

“running down the NHS”, and instead to support every

extent of the crisis that is being faced by accident and emergency
departments around the country, one would be forgiven for thinking that
this Government must have inherited an NHS on the brink of collapse. In
fact, the opposite is true. I know we have stopped doing the patient
satisfaction surveys, but at the time that was discontinued, patient
satisfaction was at an all-time high and we must not forget that the
national health service had been transformed by the Labour party. I
worked in the health service and I remember what it was like in the 18
years when the Tories were running it. The NHS that the Labour party
inherited in 1997 was transformed. The budget for the NHS was
£30 billion then, but when we left the NHS in good health
in 2010, the budget was over £100 billion. The 18 years
of Tory neglect had been thoroughly addressed with new hospital
buildings. Every single A and E department was replaced.</hs_Para>

seen since? We have seen an unwanted top-down reorganisation, which
nobody wanted and nobody voted for, coupled with under-investment, and
the slashing of alternative services has placed a huge burden on our A
and E services. By referring to alternative services I am talking, for
instance, about walk-in treatment centres, including my own excellent
Healthworks in Paradise lane, Easington Colliery. It is under enormous
pressure yet offers a fantastic service with out-of-hours and weekend
opening, but we are not sure whether that will continue because of
pressures that the clinical commissioning group is facing. By almost
any standard, it is clear that the performances of accident and
emergency departments are struggling under the current Government. It
is clear that patients are waiting longer to be seen and that
the numbers of delayed discharges and emergency admissions are
up—I think the Secretary of State admitted that. The number of
cancelled operations is certainly up.</hs_Para>

to some of the problems. It has rightly been pointed out that the

demographic changes involving more older people and people with core
morbidities and multiple conditions. That is placing a huge amount of
extra pressure on A and E departments, but that pressure is
being compounded by damaging cuts to local authority budgets.</hs_Para>

authority, Durham county council, is experiencing cuts of £222
million between 2011 and 2017. I know that Ministers will say that
social care is ring-fenced and that £3.8 billion is being
transferred to the home care fund, to be made available to clinical
commissioning groups and local authorities, but what that means in real
terms for the people living in Easington is that EDPIP—the East
Durham Positive Inclusion Partnership—which supports frail
elderly people and young people in vulnerable families, is closing down
because of a lack of funding from the local authority. Similarly, East
Durham Community Transport, which provides transport to take the frail
elderly—including my mother, incidentally—to day centres

Government have been warned by experts that cutting the staggering
£1.8 billion from council social care budgets in the first three
years of this Government would have a knock-on effect for the NHS,

made in expert witnesses’ evidence to the Health Select
Committee, on which I have the honour to serve. Because of the cuts to
social care, fewer older people are getting adequate support in the
community, and are therefore visiting A and E departments instead. The
impact of that is twofold. First, it means that those with care needs
are not getting the treatment they need. Secondly, it means that our A
and E departments are being put under great strain. Directly and
indirectly, the Government have ignored warnings that by slashing
social care they would make it difficult to discharge patients with

Lefroy</B> (Stafford) (Con):</Member> First, I want to praise all those
who work in accident and emergency departments up and down the country
to provide a vital full-time 24/7 service locally and nationally. Many
Members have already pointed out that it is almost a year since the
Francis report was published. Its reception in the House demonstrated
one of the best examples of cross-party respect from the Prime Minister
and the Leader of the Opposition and, subsequently, from my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State and the shadow Secretary of State. I
would like to see that cross-party support being built on.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000099">I should also
like to praise the Secretary of State for the work that he has done to
take the recommendations forward. He has mentioned some of them today,
including those relating to the chief inspector of hospitals, to social
care and to general practice. Many more aspects 
<?notus-xml column=307?>of the report have already been mentioned, and there will no doubt be
more to come. I must stress, however, that we need to have a proper
debate on the Francis report now, one year on, in Government time in
the House, to see where we have got to.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000100">I also pay
tribute to all those people who did the work that enabled the Francis
report to come about. They include Julie Bailey, Helene Donnelly and
the many others who worked with Cure the NHS, and all those in Stafford
hospital who have subsequently responded to the report to make the
hospital a place that I am proud to say now provides some of the best
care in our region, including those in the A and E department. We have,
however, lost our 24/7 A and E department; we now have a 14/7 A and E
department. That is something that we are going to have to look at
again; we need to look at how we are to cover the out-of-hours
emergency care in our area. Nevertheless, we now have some of the
best A and E care in the region, because it is consultant led.
We now have sufficient consultants to cover that service.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000101">I want to
make four points that I believe need to be taken fully into account in
this debate on A and E services. The first is about doctors. The
Secretary of State has already mentioned the problem with recruiting
people into emergency medicine. It is not seen as the most attractive
career, perhaps because of the shift work involved. We need to look at
the whole training structure. Perhaps it would be better for trainee
doctors to spend more time in accident and emergency departments in
their foundation years. Perhaps we should add a third foundation year
in order to enable them to spend more time in A and E, because that is
surely where they will learn most about this kind of
medicine.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000102">We also need
to look carefully at the role of specialisms in the NHS. Although that
would be the subject for a whole other debate, it is very important,
because we have more than 60 specialisms in this country, compared with
about 20 in Norway. Their increasing role means there is a need to
maintain a full-time specialist rota of up to 10 consultants, which is
placing increasing stress on the finances of the NHS. That is true in A
and E, as elsewhere. That is a subject for another day, but it is a
very important
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000103">Another
area to mention is demographics, although I will not go on at
length about it because the facts are known to us all. In
Staffordshire, we are expecting the number of over-85s to double and
the number of over-60s to go up by 50% in the next 25 years. There is
no doubt that we have reached a tipping point, particularly as the baby
boomers enter their retirement years, and that is not recognised. It is
not just a straight line graph; there is a bit of exponential growth in
the number of older people now coming in to our hospitals. That is to
be expected.</hs_Para>

Qureshi:</Member></B> I agree with everything the hon. Gentleman has
said so far. Will he also consider the fact that A and E waiting time
rises have also been caused by: the effect of walk-in centres closing;
the closure of NHS Direct and its replacement by the botched
111 system, which has not helped anyone; and a real cut in
adult care, which has meant that a lot of elderly people have been
taken to hospitals, instead of being cared for at home, and they cannot
be released unless they have somewhere safe to go
to?</hs_Para>

Thérèse Coffey</B> (Suffolk Coastal) (Con):</Member> My
hon. Friend may not be aware that a briefing was given by the College
of Emergency Medicine to Members of Parliament. One of its
representatives, I believe it was Dr Mann, was asked by hon. Members
about the closure of walk-in centres and he replied that there was an
initial blip but that levels went back to what they were before. So in
his view those closures made very little
difference.</hs_Para>

Lefroy:</Member></B> We do not have sufficient data on this. I
urge the Government to examine how we can collect more data about the
reasons why people come to A and E and whether their visits could have
been prevented by other provision. I am sure that that can be done in
some cases, but at the moment we are arguing at cross purposes because
we do not have sufficient data.</hs_Para>

point, on the lack of integration, relates to discharges. There is
pressure on hospitals to discharge people, particularly the elderly,
because of the pressure on beds. One GP in my constituency raised this
issue, citing one of their patients who was improperly discharged and
saying that they were very distressed at the condition in which they
found him. Stafford hospital has come up with a solution, which it will
implement shortly, whereby every patient with complex needs will not be
discharged unless it is absolutely clear that they have proper care in
the community to go to. We would expect that for all patients, and I am
very glad that Stafford hospital is taking that up.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000109">The final
reason to mention is that patients are often confused about where to
go, and I am therefore glad that the Government have undertaken a
review of the classification of A and E departments. We have A and E
departments, urgent care centres and minor injuries units, and we have
various grades of A and E. We need a national classification
that makes it clear what services people can get at which point. Often
people turn up and find that they have come to the inappropriate
place.</hs_Para>

to make a few remarks about the competition matters that have been
raised in the debate, and I do this from a local perspective. The trust
special administrators for the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust
have proposed that Stafford hospital should merge with University
Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke and that Cannock hospital
should merge with Wolverhampton’s trust. That is the right
solution, it is not being opposed and we are not finding any problem
with competition law. There is a big difference between the acute and
non-acute sectors. As the acute sector runs in a tight way around the
country, it is very difficult to see how there can be much competition
in provision within it, because that has been provided exclusively by
NHS trusts up to now. Within the non-acute sector we have found in my
constituency that, under competition rules, an NHS service that went to
the private sector under the previous Government has come back into the
NHS under this Government, because it was determined that the NHS would
provide a better service. So this does work both ways; it does not
always go the way some people think it might.</hs_Para>

lose sight of the real hard work that people are doing in A and Es up
and down the country. Almost all the work that goes on there is
incredibly good and is what our constituents need, but we must make
sure that the points that I and others have outlined are dealt with,
because with the demographics going the way they are, we will face
increasing pressures year on

Barron:</Member></B> Let me touch briefly on the matter that is in
today’s press. The Secretary of State said that we had to keep
people out of A and E; he is absolutely right. If I made an addition to
our motion today, it would have been around the issue of alcohol.
Alcohol is a major problem in accident and emergency departments
throughout the land. It used to be an issue on Friday and Saturday
nights, but now it is an issue seven nights a week in cities. Not that
long ago, the Prime Minister said that the Government were considering
putting a minimum price on a unit of alcohol to reduce binge drinking
and to improve public health. Today we had an announcement from the
Minister for Crime Prevention, the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman
Baker)—not from the Department of Health—that the
Government are to ban the sale of cheap alcohol in England and Wales
because they want to cut back on alcohol-related 
<?notus-xml column=311?>crime. People who work daily with the problems of
alcohol and alcoholism have expressed views on the matter. The Alcohol
Health Alliance, which includes the medical royal colleges, said that
the impact of the ban on selling at below duty plus VAT would be
negligible. It will affect about 1.3% of sales.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000127">Eric Appleby,

idea that banning below-cost sales will help tackle our problem with
alcohol is laughable, it’s confusing and close to impossible to
implement. On top of this, reports show it would have an impact on just
1% of alcohol products sold in shops and supermarkets leaving untouched
most of those drinks that are so blatantly targeted at young people.
The government is wasting time when international evidence shows that
minimum unit pricing is what we need to save lives and cut
crime.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14020579000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000128">I
could go on, but suffice it to say that the Government have completely
dumped the idea that alcohol is a threat to the public health of this
country. The measure will not stop people bingeing. It will not stop
alcohol-fuelled people from turning up at A and E. The truth is that
some 50% of people who turn up at A and E get no treatment at all. We
should be looking at the societal effects that are driving people into
A and E departments—whether it is closure of walk-in centres or
the fact that too many people are falling down because they have had
too much to drink and believe that they have a right to block up A and
Es and potentially slow down treatment for those who are facing an
emergency. The Government are ducking the issues related to alcohol and
are ducking the problems in A and E departments up and down the land.
It is about time they showed some courage and did something positive.
Alcohol is a public health issue, not a crime
issue.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_05_PT_1/2295E7962DCBD7022B66A63A355D352FA03DB5D6" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2014">Wednesday

of alcohol has been ducked by successive Governments for a very long
time. He is absolutely right to campaign on it, and I absolutely agree
that we need to see the introduction of minimum unit pricing. However,
we should not in any way give the impression that that of itself is the
entire solution to what is a broad societal problem. None the less, it

addressing some of the comments made by the shadow Secretary of State,
I wish to place on the record my thanks to the staff at my local
hospital, St Helier, for all the work they do not just over the
winter period when the pressure is undoubtedly at its most acute, but
right across the year. Having been in the hospital over the Christmas
period singing carols, which hopefully did not discomfort people too
much, I saw for myself just how that pressure can build. I also saw how
well the staff are perceived by their patients.</hs_Para>

want to register a frustration with the Minister today about something
that has been going on in my patch for several years now. For almost as
long as I have been an MP, clouds have from time to time gathered over
the future of my local hospital. In 2010, the previous Labour
Government signed off an outline business case for the rebuild and
refurbishment of St Helier’s hospital. That was great
news, and a culmination of work by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), the hon. Member for Mitcham and
Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) and me. We secured funding from the
Government worth some £219 million. Then there was a
change of Government; a coalition came in. Given the spending review
and the desire to tackle the public borrowing problem, it was far from
certain whether that funding would stay in the Budget. Again, the three
of us lobbied hard, and we were delighted when my right hon. Friend the
Chief Secretary to the Treasury was able to confirm the
funding.</hs_Para>

the dying days of the primary care trusts, a review was launched of
accident and emergency and maternity services in south-west London. It
was called Better Services Better Value, but it offered neither. It has
been an absolutely crystal clear case study of everything that is bad
and wrong about NHS change management. There are some really good
examples of change management, stroke care in London being the
exemplar. However, we have to refer to that example too often, as there
are too few other really good examples of change having been managed
well. All too often the public feel left out of such processes, and it
is no wonder they mount the barricades to oppose change of which they
feel no ownership.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Carshalton and Wallington and I were repeatedly
told during the process by the then chief executive of the primary care
trust, Ann Radmore, that the rebuild of St Helier was a fixed point in
the whole process. It was not to be touched; it was sacrosanct and the
rebuild would happen regardless. I have to say, however, that the
events of the past three years have left me feeling betrayed and lied
to. As a result of the uncertainty caused by BSBV, three years
on—despite GPs having now declared BSBV’s proposals
unviable, and having gone back to the drawing board—my local
trust and clinical commissioning group are saying they cannot proceed
with that £219 million. They lack the will and vision to take it
forward, and I hope the Minister can confirm today that the
£219 million is still in the Department’s
budget lines and that he will encourage my local NHS to work with my
local councils and Members of Parliament to bring forward these
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000135">The
motion moved by the shadow Secretary of State today feels a bit thin,
and a little like a re-editing of its previous two incarnations in an
attempt to create the sense of a febrile environment of a looming and
predicted crisis and calamity that is about to engulf us all. That
tactic has been adopted by the Opposition time and again, and time and
again it has not been borne out on the ground. The analysis of the
right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) is deeply political, and let
me give just one example. He lays the blame for delayed discharges
principally at the door of budget pressures on social service
departments. That is not true. If he looks at the figures, he will see
that the bulk of the pressure is caused by delayed discharges in the
NHS, not social services. I do not pretend for one moment 
<?notus-xml column=313?>that there are not parts of the country where social service cuts are
impacting on delayed discharges, but the picture is more nuanced and
complicated, and I wish the shadow Secretary of State had the courage

the figures, it needs to be resolved, but there seems to be a
disconnect between what people think is happening and what the figures
show. I have been to events at which clinicians have said that the
problem is the local social services, but when they are shown the
figures they are surprised. Perhaps that is why we need, as the hon.
Lady says, to ensure that there is an agreed way in which such things
are reported, which is what, I think, was put in place by the previous
Labour Government. These figures have been collected for a long time,

driver of delayed
discharges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000138"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Main" PimsId="4829" UID="14020579002402" xid="890" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579002402">Mrs

hon. Friend’s speech, but as he knows there is a big lobby going
on. That was the point I was trying to make to the Secretary of State,
although obviously I did not make it very well. Under the previous
Government, West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust had a significant
number of delayed discharges—although that is coming right down
now—and the figures were not on the books, so to speak, thanks
to a very creative form of accounting. It is nuanced and there have
been problems on all sides. To try to paint it as one-sided is totally

Burstow:</Member></B> That is absolutely right. For example, in
continuing health care there is often a great deal of contestability
that leads to discharge delays, but they are NHS-caused delays. I am
not saying that the NHS should be blamed any more than social services,
but I want some honesty about how the figures are presented as they do
not bear close scrutiny in the argument made by the right hon. Member
for Leigh. His solution is simplistic, too. It is good to have a debate

is complex and driven by a multifactoral set of problems. There are
seasonal changes, with high-volume, less complex A and E attendance in
the spring and summer, and a pattern of fewer but more complex cases in
the autumn and winter that often drive up admissions. It is also
important to note that it is a 
<?notus-xml column=315?>question not just of an ageing society but of a rise
in co-morbidity, which drives the pressures in our A and E departments.

self-referrals—which is an increase on last summer. There has
been a 13% increase in admissions for stays lasting longer than 72
hours, with a drop in shorter stays, a 31% increase in triages into the
hospital’s resuscitation area, and an 11% increase in admissions
into critical care. There is now a different mix of patients being
admitted. The chief executive, Sir David Dalton, tells me
that those trends now appear to be year-round, rather than a purely
seasonal impact of winter pressures. He said—my hon. Friend the

publicly funded care. Some of those who have lost that care will fund
it themselves, but in other cases the work load will fall on unpaid
family carers. We have been warned about that in surveys. Carers UK
found that 55% of carers are caring for someone who has been admitted
to emergency hospital services in the last three years, and a
significant number of them said that additional support could have
prevented the emergency
admission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000164">We
also know—this is a worry for those who are concerned about
carers—that full-time carers are themselves more than twice as
likely to be in poor health as people without caring responsibilities.
The Care Bill has not yet completed its passage through the House, but
it does not do enough to support full-time carers, particularly given
the funding situation for social care. Carers are the first line in
prevention, so properly identifying and supporting them can prevent an
escalation in demand. However, identification of carers is not
happening and the Care Bill does not do enough to change
that.</hs_Para>

Cancer Support has found that 70% of carers of people with cancer come
into contact with health professionals. GPs and hospital doctors should
identify carers and signpost them to information and advice, but in
many cases they do not. Many hon. Members will encounter such people in
their casework. The Care Bill gives a carer a right to a local
authority carer’s assessment, but that is meaningless for a
carer who has no contact with a local authority. In fact,
1,000 fewer families this year will have that constant

of pounds every year, but we have to face the fact that they are
choosing between heating and eating, and in some cases eating only one
meal a day. As was noted earlier, there is also the lack of
funding to pay for prescriptions. Carers UK has warned—we should
take note of this—that if this country’s 6.5
million carers are not supported, we will be pushed them to breaking
point. In my authority, for example, if they are left unable to care,
they will not be able to go to social care and will have to go straight

only an hour a day. Since 2010, 145,000 more older people have had to

NHS staffing, the Health Committee inquiry highlighted the fact that
only one in five emergency departments have the right level of
consultant cover for 16 hours a day. That worrying situation is not set

trainee posts in emergency medicine are being filled—156 out of
193 such posts were left unfilled in the latest recruitment round. Even
Salford Royal, which is an excellent hospital, is experiencing

I am proud that we have strengthened the CQC through an independent

ambulance services, however, while the regional targets of 75% of

have been met in most of the country, that did not show what was

time in pressing the case for not just hitting a regional target, but

People out in the countryside—not even that isolated, but in
smaller towns or villages—were almost ignored because they did

action by this Government, chief executive of the east of England
ambulance service. During his very short tenure, he has already been
able to bring a new sense of urgency and a recognition that staff are
not coming through the pipeline quickly enough, and he is doing
something about that. I am confident that when we meet him next week,
we will be able to understand his plans even further.</hs_Para>

reasons I was accused of Gove-itis earlier is that it frustrates me
that Members of Parliament are accused of complacency when in

complacent, we have approached this in a consistent way. I recommend to
MPs from other parts of the country that instead of just waiting for
someone in Whitehall to act on these issues, and mocking MPs who say
they are working hard to press their case and hold their local board to
account, they should get on and do it, not just wait for others to do
so. I give credit to NHS England. At times, getting it to recognise the
real problems that we were facing on behalf of our constituents felt
like wading through treacle, but it has finally got the message, and
together we are starting to turn the situation around.</hs_Para>

concerned about a potential reconfiguration of stroke services that

minutes of the 999 call being made. As a consequence, as my hon. Friend

more funding to be given to areas of rural sparsity in light of the
fact that geography matters in trying to deal with such
situations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000182">I

Government Members; it is a universal thing. As we continue to support
the NHS, there is no way that we can ever be accused of complacency.
The reality is that we are dealing with the issues,

we continue to work on many of its recommendations. I am therefore very

several times about the experience in my area, where in recent months
we have been undergoing a major reconfiguration of hospital services,
particularly accident and emergency. I have to report that, whatever
the metrics or the resourcing may be demonstrating, the patient
experience as reported to me, particularly regarding our A and E
departments at Manchester Royal infirmary and at Wythenshawe hospital,
is that there is a great deal of pressure and strain in the system.
People are reporting long waits in very pressured environments, and
there is a genuine sense of unhappiness about the atmosphere in which
they feel emergency care is being provided because of the stretched
services. A whole range of pressures are coinciding. There is rising
demand due to some of the social reasons that right hon. and hon.
Members have mentioned, including individuals’ behaviour; public
health crises; pressures on resourcing in the NHS; and the pressures
brought about by reconfiguration itself. It is hard to disentangle
which of those different pressures is contributing to so much stress in
the system.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000185">I would like
to highlight a few key points that I hope the Minister will take on
board. There is no doubt that more change is coming in the NHS and we
are learning quite a lot in my area as we go along. First, the
reconfiguration of accident and emergency services and their
downgrading to an urgent care centre at Trafford general hospital has
immediately been followed by rising numbers at neighbouring A and E
departments. My hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South
(Barbara Keeley) mentioned the huge rise, in percentage terms, at
Salford Royal hospital. That is also the case at Wythenshawe, in
particular, as we are discovering on the doorsteps in Wythenshawe and
Sale East. My colleague Mike Kane, who I hope will very soon be an hon.
Friend in this House, has been talking to hundreds of local people, and
we know that Wythenshawe hospital is experiencing very great
pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000186">On
10 out of 13 days in January, Manchester Royal infirmary’s A and
E department failed to meet the four-hour waiting time target, as did
Wythenshawe on 11 out of 13 days, and four Manchester trusts
failed to meet the target in quarter 3. It is difficult to
disentangle whether that is attributable wholly or in part to the
reconfiguration of services. None the less, there are real pressures in
our A and E departments in Greater Manchester. Particularly in the
immediate aftermath of the reconfiguration at Trafford, there
have been reports of long ambulance queues, especially at
Wythenshawe. That is not surprising, because the reconfiguration has
inevitably created significant numbers of additional ambulance journeys
as people are presenting at what is now an urgent care centre but may
have to be transferred elsewhere for specialist care. I understand that
there have been 100 extra ambulance journeys in the immediate aftermath
of the reconfiguration. People are also going to what are, in effect,
their own places. I think that is 
<?notus-xml column=321?>understandable, because, as the hon. Member for Stafford (Jeremy
Lefroy)—who is no longer in his place—has said, the
picture is
confusing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000187">Local
road signs used to say, “A&amp;E”, but now they say,
“A&amp;E not 24 hours”, following the reconfiguration at
Trafford. To be frank, that is an utterly meaningless piece of
information for somebody driving to an A and E department, because it
gives them no idea of when during those 24 hours the service will not
be open. There is also real confusion about what is or is not available
at the urgent care centre and whether it is safe to go
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000188">Local
people tell me that the reason they do not go to Trafford is that they
do not believe they are any longer allowed to go there. That was not
the clinicians’ planning assumption when the urgent care centre
was introduced, but that is what patients believe. As the hon. Member
for Stafford said—Sir Bruce Keogh has put his finger on this,
too—it is really important that patients are given clarity about
what is available, where to go and when. We have to pay much more
attention to educating the public about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000189">Another
difficulty that we discovered very quickly is that the decision tree
used by North West ambulance service has resulted in its taking cases
to Wythenshawe and to Salford Royal and Manchester Royal infirmary
which should, under the original plan, have gone to Trafford urgent
care centre. We are learning a lot from what is going on in the
aftermath of the reconfiguration. It would be interesting to hear from
the Minister how the lessons will be taken on board and
distributed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000190">Pressure
is also being created in a wider context. My right hon. Friend the
Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) mentioned in particular the pressure of
rising poverty, which is, without question, leading to higher levels of
need and people presenting at our hospitals. The number of hospital
admittances as a result of malnutrition nearly doubled—it went
up from 3,161 to 5,499—between 2008-09 and 2011-12. They did not
all present at A and E, but they did all present at a hospital and that
is of real
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000191"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andy Burnham" PimsId="2376" UID="14020579002417" xid="81" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579002417">Andy
Burnham:</Member></B> Was as my hon. Friend as surprised as I was at
some of the sneering from Government Members when she intervened on me

themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000192"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kate Green" PimsId="5566" UID="14020579002418" xid="1207" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579002418">Kate
Green:</Member></B> When the <I>Manchester Evening News</I> published a
report about the shocking rise in malnutrition in our region, people
were horrified and commented voluntarily on how disgraceful and
shameful it was that, in such a rich economy, we could be in such a
situation. There is no doubt that that is partly because of pressure on
family
incomes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000193">I
want to highlight the position of disabled people in particular, who
face extra costs for special diets, aids and adaptations, prescription
charges and continence pads. All of those costs have to be met by
disability benefits that are of dwindling value. There is also further
pressure on the services on which they rely, including day services,
respite care, access to mobility aids and care at home, which is under
great pressure because of social care budget cuts.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=322?><hs_Para UID="14020579000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000194">In
conclusion, against a backdrop of great pressure—some of it to
do with changes to the NHS, some with rising remand and some with wider
environmental factors—change and further reconfiguration may be
necessary, but it is very difficult to do it. I want to finish by
making three points to the Minister about what we are learning from the
situation in Trafford, where we are integrating health and
social care. First, it is not a quick fix. Secondly, it is not possible
to remove services from our hospitals before the care and provision is
available in the community—that is of real concern at a time
when budgets are pressed. Thirdly, there is a huge piece of work to be
done—the Government have not embarked on it—on educating
the public and driving up public understanding. The public in my local
area are extremely confused about what the NHS is able to provide to
them and where they should go to get it. I am sure we are not unique.
The situation is undoubtedly creating additional pressure for hospitals
and other NHS providers, and I hope the Minister and his colleagues
will address
it.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14020579002301" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579002301">3.14

want to discuss problems with the NHS in my locality. My constituents
have been affected by a number of difficulties in the NHS in recent
years, predominantly down to the legacy and failings of the previous
Labour Government, particularly the deficit of NHS local health care
provision. Mid Essex has suffered as a result of the bloated
bureaucracy of the primary care trusts and strategic health authority,
which took money away from front-line care and patients. That is
Labour’s
legacy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000197">To
put that in context, between 1997 and 2009 the number of managers and
senior managers in the East of England strategic health authority more
than doubled from 1,300 to well over 2,700. The number just kept
increasing. The worst case involved Mid Essex PCT—I was so
thrilled when PCTs were dismantled—and its predecessor trusts,
whereby between 2001 and 2009 the number of managers and senior
managers soared from 10 to 102, while the proportion of administrative
staff working in the PCT itself doubled from 17% to 33%. That money
should have gone to front-line patients in Witham and Mid Essex. That
is the legacy we are trying to
overcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000198">When
this Government came to office, those two PCTs were spending a combined
total of £25 million on management costs alone, which is simply
shocking and appalling. That is why the reforms are not just welcome,
but vital to Mid Essex and my constituency: money can now be spent on
providing care and investing in the health and care services that my
constituents and patients desperately need. The actions taken by this
Government mean that more of the record levels of spending on the
NHS—which the Government are committed to and which the
Opposition opposed—will be spent on patients in my constituency,
rather than on administrators, managers and
bureaucrats.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000199">One
of the most damaging aspects of Labour’s legacy in my
constituency is the incredible health deficit in Witham town. Witham is
a growing town and I am very 
<?notus-xml column=323?>proud of it—it is incredible. Despite the NHS deficits we have
faced, our patients have campaigned and I have worked alongside them.

out-patient services delivered locally in the community, rather than
have to travel to Braintree, Chelmsford or Colchester. Colchester and
Chelmsford both have hospitals that are undergoing major reviews at
present. The challenge we face is to bring in new services to serve our
expanding town. The prospects of achieving that objective are enhanced
by the fact that this Government are putting record sums into the NHS
and by the dialogue at community level between the town council and NHS
England. I commend both, but specifically Witham town council for its
support, and particularly Andrew Pike of NHS England and his team for
working closely with me to examine the options, despite significant

know that we can count on the encouragement of Ministers, who have
listened and been incredibly supportive. That brings me back to the
fundamental point that if the Labour party, when it was in government,

less on management and bureaucracy, and more on front-line patient
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000205">Another
very significant health care concern for my constituents is that raised

in his support of us all in pushing for and achieving the resignation
of board members last year, and in relation to the trust’s poor
performance in getting ambulances to patients efficiently and on time,

Ministers’ involvement and support and, by contrast, we have now
seen changes. The previous members of the trust’s board, many of
whom, including a Labour councillor, were appointed under the previous
Labour Government, ought to have provided strategic
leadership—this is all about leadership—but they left the
trust in an appalling state, under-staffed, poorly resourced and

climbing Everest to deal with the legacy we were left. Collectively,
local MPs are supporting him in his task to repair the damage to the

to which the Labour party turned a blind eye, that there is no doubt
that Labour closed its eyes and completely ignored the fact that
patient care was neglected and the overall cost in lives, which is
appalling. I therefore welcome the commitment from our Health Secretary

is a pleasure to speak in this debate. When it comes to the NHS, the
nub of the matter is the same for both Government Members and
Opposition Members. We have a real pride and interest in it, and we
want it to do well. Over our years in this world, we and our families
have all been recipients of its services, so it is very
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000212">The
issue is a UK-wide one. Recently in Northern Ireland, some tough
decisions have had to be made to close some A and E departments at
particular times, and there have certainly been bumps in that process
and better preparation might have prevented those problems. Such a
decision was taken by the chief executive of the trust in my Down
district council area. The hon. Member for South Down (Ms Ritchie) and
I had an opportunity to meet the chief executive to discuss the issue
and put forward our constituents’ viewpoint, but our opinion was
not met favourably. The chief executive felt that 
<?notus-xml column=325?>there was no other option, and that other hospitals in the area could
cope with the additional pressures. That decision has come under close
scrutiny and review, and the savings or outcomes are not yet fully
known, but the decision was taken and it
stands.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000213">The

NHS is one of the things that we can most be proud of in the
UK—a system by which all people are entitled to a high level of
care at no cost other than their tax and national insurance
contributions. However, no matter how much money is spent in the Health
Department, there is always a need for more. The portfolio of a Health
Minister or Secretary of State is not one that I would take on for, as
we used to say, all of the tea in china, and that is a lot of tea. I
take my hat off to my colleague Edwin Poots at home, and all those who
have to make tough decisions. I sometimes feel that I could not make
such decisions, but I understand why they have to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000216">In
preparation for this debate I considered the differences between how A
and Es are run and the different quality of care in A and Es in
different areas. In delving into the subject, I came across the
last three words of the Opposition motion, which are “improving
patient care”. I was shocked by a briefing I received from
Macmillan Cancer Support, which was referred to by the hon. Member for
Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley). Macmillan is very close to
my heart, as I believe it is to many in the Chamber, because of the
issues it deals with. I was left with no option but to use this
opportunity to highlight the care of the cancer sufferers and
survivors, whom we all
know.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000217">According
to Macmillan Cancer Support, between 2015 and 2020 the number of people
living with or beyond cancer in the UK will rise from 2.5 million
to 3 million. By 2020, almost half the people living in the UK
will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. Just this week, I
had an opportunity to go to the Backbench Business Committee—I
was seeking a debate on another issue—and the hon. Member for
Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) asked for a debate on cancer. The
figures and headlines that we have seen this week indicate that cancer
is a time bomb. It is frightening stuff. It used to be said that one in
three people would be intimately affected by cancer, with a diagnosis
for either themselves or an immediate family member; now that is
changing to a cancer diagnosis for one in every two
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000218">In
the run-up to that, we must certainly get our ducks in a line—if
I may use such terminology—to ensure that we are ready, and that
patient care will be of top quality, no matter what people’s
postcode. The fact is that although our palliative care is second to
none and there have been improvements in diagnosis rates, the UK is not
to the fore in survival rates. Given that we face one in every two
people having a cancer diagnosis in the very near future, that needs to
change and to become a priority. If we can deal with a diagnosis early,
we can improve survival rates. That is what we should all try to
achieve.</hs_Para>

highlighted that a recent study on cancer survival rates in 29
countries in Europe—the Eurocare-5 research—has shown
that the UK continues to lag behind other European countries. Macmillan

the improvement, I am concerned that the overall survival rates for
nine out of 10 common cancers are lower than the European average. We
have low survival rates for kidney, stomach, ovarian and colon cancers,
and intermediate survival rates for rectum, breast and prostate
cancers, cutaneous melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Furthermore, the UK has one of the lowest survival rates in Europe for
elderly patients. One reason for the rise in cancer rates is that
people are living longer. Given that we have an ageing population, it
is essential for the Government and the NHS to prioritise cancer care
and early
diagnosis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000225">Both
the motion and the amendment refer to an integrated system. This week,
we had the climax of the Committee stage of the Care Bill. The Minister
who is responding to this debate said that he had visited Northern
Ireland to see how our integrated care system works. The hon. Member
for Leicester West (Liz Kendall), who was here earlier, expressed a
wish to come to Northern Ireland to see how that system works. I hope
to facilitate that for her so that the Opposition can understand the
system that we have back home. We must have early diagnosis. That
relies on patients informing their GPs of their symptoms, but also on
the correct referrals being made and tests carried out when patients
present at A and E departments. That should be considered when there is
any shift around in care for those in A and E. If somebody is sent home
with painkillers and told to make an appointment with their GP, how
does that link up to the integrated
system?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000226">As
I stated at the beginning of my comments, no matter how much money is
allocated to the Department of Health, it will never be enough to meet
the needs. For that reason, the Department is tasked with making
savings. I understand that that is essential, but it is also important
that the care that people receive through the NHS is second to none.
There is a way of balancing those demands. Tough decisions need to be
made and changes must be put in place, but the priorities must be
clear. I ask for cancer care, including early diagnosis and support
services, to be prioritised. I hope that everyone agrees that the most
important words in the motion are “improving patient
care”. On that, I think the House can
unite.</hs_Para>

of the policy makers in the health service who appeared before the
Health Committee warned us that there was not much detail in the
lead-up to the Health and Social Care Act 2012. There was no
pre-legislative scrutiny and then there was a pause. Not for the first
time, the Government rushed to get legislation through without proper
scrutiny and without an electoral

played into the hands of the people who think that this Government and
this country are up for sale to the highest bidder, and that there is
no commitment to the people of this country. The Shard is an example. I
understand that a number of its floors have been allocated to a private
hospital. That is somewhere where pearly kings and queens cannot afford

am pleased to see a number of my colleagues on the Health Committee in
the Chamber. We hear a lot of first-hand evidence. At a time when there
are concerns about A and E, the Government seem to be intent on
fiddling about with name changes. The NHS Commissioning Board is now
known as NHS England. The integration transformation fund is now known
as the better care fund. Interestingly, the Chancellor announced in the
spending review in July that the £3.8 billion that has been
allocated to the integration transformation fund—aka the better
care fund—will only be available in 2015-16. However, the
problem needs to be addressed
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000232" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000232">That
£3.8 billion is not extra money, but money that has been
underspent in the NHS over the past few years. The
underspend was £2.2 billion in 2013 and £1.4
billion in the previous year. When I asked the Secretary of State on 26
November last year why the underspend was not used for the NHS, he said
that I should ask that question of Labour Ministers. I do not know
whether he meant that I should do so in 2015. As I pointed out in an
aside, which was not picked up by the Official Reporters, I am not a
time traveller like Dr Who and was only elected in 2010. The rules of
the House say that I should have had a proper response, rather than a
dismissive
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000233">Another
issue is that people have been fired and then rehired. One in five of
the 19,000 staff who have been given redundancy payments has returned
to the NHS. That is more money that has been wasted and that should
have been spent on patients. Primary care trusts were disbanded and
then re-formed with a different name. Urgent care boards were set
up—their name was then changed to working groups—to
ensure that there was a forum to replace the PCTs. All of that has
strained resources and made staff suffer, without any increase in pay.
There is job creation. However, it is not in front-line services, but
in the appointment of a chief 
<?notus-xml column=328?>inspector, which was not suggested by the Francis report, and of
assistant chief inspectors. There may well be assistant assistant chief
inspectors as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000234">The
Select Committee heard evidence that the pay policy was significant in
enabling the NHS to fill the gap, and NHS England said that, so far,
around 25% of efficiency gains had come from pay. Ask A and E doctors
who are struggling with working unsocial hours while locums
without continuity in patient care are paid more, and they will say,
“We need more staff; it is more money wasted on locums and
agencies.” Perhaps Ministers should think about golden handcuffs
for A and E staff, or the equivalent of an A and E special
allowance to recognise the work of those doctors and staff in A
and E. That might go some way towards ensuring that we keep
them in their place and provide a safe service while doctors
are trained. The College of Emergency Medicine has made repeated calls
for such measures, and the emergency medicine taskforce made
recommendations in 2011, yet we are still waiting for action.</hs_Para>

will know from their own hospitals that patients are suffering from
delayed discharge. I have seen that first hand at Manor hospital after
the closure of the accident and emergency department at Stafford
hospital, where perhaps the relationship with local government is not
at the same stage as it is with the local authority in Walsall, for
example, and it takes longer to discharge patients. We are still
waiting for the £4 million that is needed because we have had to

20% to 25% of people in hospital should have been discharged. The

of hospitals with approximately two wards full of people who could be
discharged. Our House of Commons Library says there have
been £1.8 billion of cuts in social care, but
apparently, the boffins at NHS England have not “dissected
out” why people are in hospital when they do not need to
be there. They are working on it now—that serious
work on delayed discharges has apparently only just started, despite
there being a problem for some

Berger</B> (Liverpool, Wavertree) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> This debate has
laid bare the stark reality of the Government’s blinkered
approach to the NHS. They are utterly complacent, hopelessly out of
touch, and in complete denial not only about the scale of the crisis in
A and E, but about how their changes to competition rules are making
things even worse. They have nothing to offer patients and our
hard-working doctors and nurses who tirelessly serve the NHS every
single day, except smoke and mirrors to try to disguise the real
causes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000244">The
Government have come to the House today celebrating “the strong
performance”—it is in their amendment—of A and E.
We have previously heard the Secretary of State insisting that the NHS
is getting better. Almost 1 million patients have waited longer than
four hours in the last year and Ministers are asking for a pat on the
back. In the last 12 months, trolley waits are up; delayed discharges
are up; 18-week waits are up; median and mean waiting times are up;
emergency admissions are up; cancelled elective operations are up;
cancelled urgent operations are up; and we have even seen patients
being ferried to A and E in the back of police cars because no
ambulances are available. It is not getting better, it is getting
worse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0002.htm#14020579000245">If

last three years of the Labour Government. In the first three years of
this Government, they have rocketed by 633,000. Ministers may be

people going to A and E in the first place. I refer back to the
increase of 16,000 in the last three years of the Labour Government,
and of 633,000 in the first three years of this Government. Why is
that? A quarter of walk-in centres have closed. NHS Direct was
abolished. The guarantee of a GP appointment in 48 hours was scrapped,
and extended GP opening hours were cut. As my hon. Friends the Members

is so ridiculous. There was an increase of 16,000 in the last three
years of the Labour Government, which has rocketed to 633,000 in the
first three years of this Government. The gap in those figures is
tremendous. The GP contract happened in 2004. When have we seen crises

also raise the issue of the amount of money NHS trusts are now having

pensioners were admitted as

another reason for that: it is now harder, not easier, to get a GP
appointment under this Government. The Royal College of General
Practitioners says that it will soon become the norm for people to wait
a week or longer to see their GP. Just this week, I was contacted by a
constituent whose partner was suffering from chest pains. They

patients are having to endure right across the country, and it is being

Britain. People are having to eat less, and less healthily, and more
than half a million people are being forced to turn to food banks. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley and Eccles South described so
poignantly, carers are having to make the choice between heating and
eating. GPs are now asking patients when they last had a meal. It is no
coincidence that, as food bank use has exploded, so have
cases of malnutrition. There has been a 42% increase in malnutrition
cases, and in 2012-13 more than 5,000 people were thus
diagnosed in English hospitals. I share the view of my hon. Friend the

Labour Government, when there was a year-on-year increase of 4.7%.

his A and E target for two of his three quarters—was that a
crisis in those days?—whereas we are seeing 2,000 more patients
every day in under four hours than when Labour was in government.
Ambulance performance is better than at the same time last year,
meaning more ambulances arriving on scene in under eight minutes.
Across the country, delays in handing over patients at A and E have
dropped by a third compared with last year as a result of new

Friends the Members for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey) and for Witham

Members would like people to think that the NHS is going to ruin. They
are so desperate—using the examples of scurvy and rickets. Of
course, when that happens it is incredibly serious, but to suggest that
that is part of the problem is outrageous. We heard the figures for
scurvy, but there were 66 admissions for rickets in 2010-11 and 65 in
2012-13, so the figure has gone down. The truth is that we inherited a
dysfunctional system that was crying out for reform—too many
people ending up in hospital because of crises in their care, and far
too much money spent on bureaucracy, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Witham made clear.</hs_Para>

have argued the case for a different approach. We are making the
essential changes and supporting NHS staff through difficult times. For
this winter we are investing an additional £400 million in

areas, we are already seeing the benefit of those additional funds,

undertake a fundamental review of urgent and emergency care, but there
are still far too many people ending up in hospital because of crises
in care. There are too many people with long-term conditions who are
still receiving unco-ordinated care. That is frustrating for the
patient, it wastes money for the system and it can lead to worse health
outcomes, as we fail to prevent such conditions from getting worse. It
is our aim in government to join up services, fitting them around

party had in power, it did nothing significant to achieve it. In fact,
many of the things it did and the decisions it made took the NHS in the
wrong direction—on tariffs, on incentivising more activity in
hospitals, on the disastrous private finance initiative and on the
equally disastrous GP contract. I am proud to say that it is this
Government who are taking the practical steps to make integration more
commonplace throughout the country. We have selected 14 integrated care
pioneers and we now have the £3.8 billion better care

services to become more integrated. We are leading the charge to make
that happen, and to improve care and support for people throughout the

more clinical staff and 23,000 fewer administrators; welcomes changes
to the GP contract which restore the personal link between doctors and
their most vulnerable patients; welcomes the announcement of the Better

closer to home; believes that clinicians are in the best position to
make judgements about the most appropriate care for their patients;
notes that rules on tendering are no different to the rules that

this House believes that insecurity at work has increased under this
Government, compounding the cost of living crisis facing families;
further believes that the Government’s policies have made life
less secure for people at work by watering down their rights, including
protections against unfair dismissal and by abandoning an
evidence-based approach to health and safety; notes that the number of
employees working part-time who want to work full-time has grown by
over 350,000 since the Government took office to over 1.4 million,
alongside a marked rise in zero-hours contracts; recognises that
insecure jobs add to pressure on the social security budget by making
it harder for people to buy a home or save for their own pension; calls
on the Government to reverse the trend of rising insecurity at work by
reforming zero-hours contracts so they are not exploitative, addressing
false self-employment by closing loopholes which allow it to take
place, scrapping the failed ‘shares for rights’ scheme,
strengthening and properly enforcing the National Minimum Wage,
including by increasing fines to £50,000 and giving local
authorities enforcement powers, and incentivising employers to pay a
Living Wage through ‘make work pay’ contracts; and
further calls on the Government to adopt a proper industrial strategy
to help create more high-skilled, better paid jobs so the UK can earn
its way out of the cost of living crisis with stronger and
better-balanced growth.</hs_brev>

London our unemployment rate is 8.1% compared with a national average
of 7.1%. For those of our constituents who are in work, living
standards have never before been under so much strain. A living

1,700 jobs to my constituency in a project that has been on the table
for long time—since I first became an MP nine years ago. It is

employment survey. Members on the Government Benches shake their heads.
It was the Government’s own UK Commission for Employment and
Skills, which co-funded that survey, that described what we now have as
a “climate of fear”. More recent research carried out

say, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, in the context of falling
unemployment, that the main thing is that people should have a job and
that, unemployment having rising for much of this Parliament, they
should be grateful to have a job at all. Of course we would all prefer
to see our constituents in work rather than out of it, but we have to
be more ambitious for the people we represent. We want them to achieve
their dreams and aspirations. We want them not only to have a job, but
to have decent work that pays a wage they can live on and offers a
decent level of security. For the Opposition, any old job will not do,
because we believe that we must do better for the people we represent,
and for the people we hope to represent after the next general

Friend the Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant). The significance of those

was about to go into the shape and the nature of the employment that we
see. There are those who are in work but cannot get the additional
hours that they want. Over 1.4 million people are working part-time
because they cannot find a full-time job; that figure is up by more
than a third compared with when this Government came into office. Over
3 million workers—more than 10% of the work force—are
underemployed. These are people who are employed but wish to work more

many of my hon. Friends have said, there are those who do not have any
security at work but want it so that they can plan and provide
stability for their families. Over half a million employees in
temporary positions lack any job security because they cannot find
permanent roles. Last year, we learned the true extent of the abuse of
zero-hours contracts, which my hon. Friends just mentioned, when the
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development published its data
suggesting that as many as 1 million people are employed on zero-hours
contracts. To recap, we are talking about contracts under which the
employee is not guaranteed work and is paid only for the work that he
or she carries out. In practice, this means that people do not know
where the next pay cheque is coming from, are unable to plan ahead,
and, in many cases, are constantly living hand to mouth. Of course,
insecurity at work increases pressure on the social security budget
because it makes it harder for people to borrow to buy a home or to
save for their pension. Again, we are determined to change this. We
cannot go on like this.</hs_Para>

certainly clear is that this Government have heaped further insecurity

through some of the things the Government have done to people’s
rights in the workplace. They have increased the service requirement
for claiming unfair dismissal from one to two years, depriving people
of the right to seek justice when they have been wronged in the
workplace. They have reduced compensatory rewards for unfair dismissal,
which, as I have said in this House 
<?notus-xml column=350?>before, will impact in particular on those in middle-income
occupations—the squeezed middle. They have also reduced the
consultation period for collective redundancy and have sought to water
down TUPE protections for people. I could go

know that much of that was inspired by the 2011 report by the
Conservative party donor and employment law adviser to the Prime
Minister, Adrian Beecroft. By his own admission, in public evidence

mind Beecroft, the best example of the Secretary of State failing to
resist measures that increase insecurity in the workplace—my
hon. Friend the Member for Coventry South (Mr Cunningham) has just
referred to this—is the shares for rights scheme announced by
the Chancellor at the Conservative party conference in 2012. The scheme
provides for new employer shareholder status, whereby in return for
between £2,000 and £50,000-worth of shares in their
employer, the employee gives up fundamental rights at work: the right

Umunna:</Member></B> I agree with all of that, and it has definitely
had an impact. Ultimately, to tackle these problems we need a proper
comprehensive industrial strategy that is implemented across all
Departments. Some people say, “Well, the Government have an
industrial strategy”, but there is no point having an industrial
strategy that only the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
buys into, or in using such a strategy to support our defence sector if
at the beginning of the Parliament the Ministry of Defence decides to
buy product off the shelf from other countries. We must rebalance the
economy in the long term, and that is still some way off. In his speech
the other week, the Secretary of State acknowledged that, but we still
do not export enough, and we still have geographical imbalances and
relatively low levels of business investment. We will earn and grow our
way out of this cost of living crisis and create more security by
better balancing our economy with a proper industrial strategy. I
commend the motion to the
House.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_05_PT_1/9C9BC4EA0DC3236DC19869CFBD40A0EACC03DCD2" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2014">Wednesday

the hon. Member for Streatham faces is that of creating a cliché
such as “triple-dip recession” or “no more boom

the situation changes. Labour’s slogan is now the “cost
of living crisis”, and at first sight that is a plausible line
of attack because, as I have always acknowledged, real wages fell in
the wake of the financial crisis, the country is poorer and the
consequences have been painful. The hon. Gentleman buttressed his
argument by quoting from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that this
painful process is likely to go on until the end of next year. That was
what it said until quite recently, but I do not know whether he has
seen its report today, which states that the cost of living crisis is
to turn around this year. Inflation is now falling so rapidly and the
economy recovering so quickly that it expects that turnaround to happen
by the middle of the year. I fear that the “cost of living
crisis” may be another to go in to the museum of
clichés.</hs_Para>

absolute terms by 7,000, and that the number of people in full-time
employment has risen by 475,000. There was an issue relating to
part-time jobs in the depth of the recession. It was understandable

next twist in the argument on employment moved gradually away from the
prediction of mass unemployment. The argument became that because
public sector employment was declining, the growth in private sector
employment would never catch up. What has actually happened is a very
clear trend. In the period since we came into office, 1.1 million
private sector jobs have been created. There have been losses in public
sector employment of 440,000 jobs, but the ratio is about three to one.
If we go back to the first quarter of last year, before the recovery
had become properly embedded, the figures show that in every single
region of the country, including in the north-east of England, private
sector growth exceeded the decline in public sector employment, and
that that trend has been
sustained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579001483" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0003.htm#14020579001483"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Bridgen" PimsId="5593" UID="14020579003587" xid="1220" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0003.htm#14020579003587">Andrew

and all parts of the UK are now benefiting. Even among particular
groups of the population with past experiences of unemployment

over-65s—employment is now at pre-recession levels. The overall
story in the labour market is a positive one, but there are

higher than it was before. Of course, these are qualitative judgments

penalties for minimum wage abuse. He may recall that I explained to the

the scope of employment tribunals, both by extending the qualifying
period from one to two years and through the fee system, albeit with
remission in respect of people on low incomes, as I think he would
acknowledge. That was done for a specific reason. We are trying to
ensure that difficult cases are moved from a legal, court framework to
a framework of conciliation through ACAS. Lest anyone imagine that ACAS
is some right-wing, business-friendly organisation that is against
employees, let me point out—I do not know whether this has been
picked up by the Opposition—that I recently appointed Brendan
Barber as its head, so those whose employment disputes are referred to
it can be pretty confident that they will be dealt with properly. It is
surely right and sensible for small and medium-sized companies in
particular not to tie up a lot of time and money in litigious processes

conciliation.</hs_Para>

also refers to the dilution, as it has been described, of health and
safety standards, although the hon. Member for Streatham did not refer
to that in his speech. I do not know whether he has read the
Löfstedt report, but it makes the position very clear.
Essentially, what we have suggested is that where there is high-risk
employment—and there is a great deal of it in agriculture,
construction and manufacturing—the inspection regime should
remain intact, but where there is found to be a low risk and that
finding is evidence-based, the level of inspections should be reduced.
No attempt is being made to undermine the safety regime applying to
dangerous occupations.</hs_Para>

bearing it in mind that, under the present Government, as under the

recent survey, there were 148 fatalities last year. That is 148 too
many, but the figure is comparable to the figure for best previous
year, 2009-2010, and significantly better than the figures in any other
previous years. It means that we have a better health and safety record
than almost any other country, including Germany, and that we are three
times safer than France. Members should try to remember that important

me deal with the one issue on which the hon. Member for Streatham spent
quite a lot of time and with which he had a certain amount of fun. I
refer to the “shares for rights” scheme. Of course, it is
possible to develop a critique of that scheme, but what I find amusing
is that at least three totally separate and conflicting arguments have
been advanced against it. The first is that downtrodden workers will be
stripped of their employment rights. When the scheme was being dealt
with in Parliament, we tried to ensure that it would be entirely
voluntary, and indeed we responded to proposals from the Opposition in
order to entrench that.</hs_Para>

of criticism has nothing to do with downtrodden workers, but is all
about highly paid executives carrying out a tax scam. That may be true.
However, a third criticism—which we heard from Back Benchers and
which is, at least currently, supported by the facts—was that
neither of those things are happening, because not many people are
taking up the scheme. If the Opposition are going to launch a
full-frontal attack on the proposals, they should work out which of
those three arguments they believe
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579001514" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0003.htm#14020579001514"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Umunna" PimsId="5653" UID="14020579003605" xid="1215" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0003.htm#14020579003605">Mr

Russell Brown</B> (Dumfries and Galloway) (Lab):</Member> I want to
begin by reminding colleagues of exactly where we have come from over
the last couple of decades. When I entered the House in 1997, in my
communities there were many households where families were working
flat-out. Many women in particular were holding down two, and sometimes
three, jobs in order to make ends meet. Frankly, for many families
there was little or no quality family time as parents operated like
ships that passed in the night; as one parent came in the door from
work, the other was quite often leaving, or at least soon thereafter,
to go out and do their job. Work-life balance was not even a thought
for many households.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579001526" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0003.htm#14020579001526">The then
Labour Opposition gave a commitment to introduce a national minimum
wage, which the then Conservative Government laughed at saying it would
lead to the loss of about 1 million jobs. The evidence showed that if
we took £1 million and gave it to the poorest-paid workers, it
had the potential to create between 35 and 40 jobs. I served on the
national minimum 
<?notus-xml column=364?>wage Committee stage, as did you, Mr Speaker. I
distinctly remember two or three long nights when we sat through the
night to get that legislation passed.</hs_Para>

did that national minimum wage have? In my area we depend very much on
small and medium-sized businesses, but there was a recognition that by
paying the poorest people additional income, that money “washed
around” in the local economy, giving local businesses the
confidence perhaps to take on another member of staff as prospects
looked brighter. If every small business had taken on one new member of
staff at that time, there would have been no unemployment, and that is
still the position today. If every small and medium-sized enterprise
took on one additional member of staff, we would have no unemployment.
The big issue, however, is whether businesses feel confident enough to
do that. They are looking for a degree of certainty, and a glimmer of
hope that there will be a brighter future.</hs_Para>

the Secretary of State that there might well be a recovery going on out
there, but it is pretty patchy across the various parts of the United
Kingdom. Any economic recovery that has taken place under this
Government has involved a race to the bottom for those who earn the
lowest wages and have the fewest rights at work. People at work are
being hit by rising insecurity, as Ministers have made it easier for
employers to fire rather than easier to hire, watered down
people’s rights at work and compounded the cost of living crisis
for many families. The Opposition have made it clear that we plan to
ban zero-hours contracts when they exploit people, to end the scandal
of false self-employment, to strengthen the national minimum wage and
its enforcement and to incentivise employers to pay a living wage
through “make work pay” contracts.</hs_Para>

finish by mentioning a couple of issues that have arisen in my own
area. As I have said on many occasions, it is an area with a low-wage
economy. I am not, however, one of those individuals who is constantly
moaning, and we are now, thankfully, seeing a slight increase in the
average wage in rural south-west Scotland. It has moved from being
around 24% below the UK national average to being between 18% and 19%
below it. One of the big crises in our area is youth unemployment,
which remains stubbornly high at 6.1%, compared with the UK average of
4.9%. It has remained at that high level for many years. It is all very
well for us in this House to talk about young people being our future;
those young people are there today. They are the future, but that is
what is happening today.</hs_Para>

company operating in my area is now considering exploiting a loophole
that would enable it to get rid of its UK crews and bring in crews from
non-European economic area countries. That could involve seafarers who,
in some parts of the world, are being paid as little as £2.41 an
hour. I put it to the Secretary of State that that is a disgrace. It
represents the sheer, naked exploitation of a loophole that exists in
this country, and I would have expected much more of the company
involved. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will look seriously at
what can be done to close that loophole.</hs_Para>

issue came to light in my office towards the end of last week. I have a
young constituent who is a single parent. She has been on a zero-hours
contract for some time. She wants to establish a business, but her
contract states that if she leaves her employment, she cannot go on to
do similar work elsewhere within  
<?notus-xml column=365?>three months. She wants to develop her own business,
but she is being told not only that she cannot take on similar work or
run a business within three months of leaving that company, but that
she cannot work within a 10-mile radius of where she is currently
working. Her employers have pulled her in and told her that they are
prepared to sack her and take her to court. The terms of that contract
are unbelievable, and I sincerely hope that the Secretary of State will
look at some of the contracts that people such as my constituent are
having to tolerate in 2014. Finally, I thank him for the figures that
he has given the House to illustrate the number of hours being worked
per month, but I would like to see the figures for the past four years,
if possible.</hs_Para>

at the movement of wages over the past 10 to 15 years, we see that a
far more subtle change has been going on, which we need to address.
Middle-income earners have seen their wages, in real-terms, first
plateau and then decrease slightly from 2003-04, even up until the
point of the crisis, as a result of increased tax and increased costs
of living. That might indicate that we need to have a rather fuller
debate about why that is happening in our country—and was even
before we hit the extraordinary circumstances of the great recession.
Some claim that this has been on the Opposition’s lips for a
long time, but I find that problematic, because I was speaking about
the cost of living before my election in 2010 and in the days
afterwards. It was immediately of concern to everyone, on almost every

about not just those who are most hard pressed, but those people, often
on middle incomes, who have not much wiggle room because they have a
mortgage. They are at the most expensive stage in their life. They are
bringing up children and saving for a pension. The things that make
life bearable for them—sometimes they are in jobs that they do
not particularly enjoy—are the holiday and the curry every
fortnight. Those things have now gone by the wayside, but that happened
not in 2013 but in 2007-08. People’s lifestyles have changed
over that period, and we need to address that in the long term. To
claim that that change is a result of specific Government policies is
profoundly misleading. We are addressing the problems identified on

Admittedly she was offering just above the minimum wage—I am
afraid that is what most cleaners in this country are paid—but
they were jobs none the less. She said that she was prevented from
taking on those people because of the labour regulations. As a result
of the changes we made in 2011-12, she has hired dozens more people who
otherwise would have been without a job. I want to see those people on
a living wage. I also want to see them keeping more of their money,
which is partly why I am so proud of what we did with income tax relief
for the lowest paid and why, through changes to national insurance, we
are making it even easier for companies to hire. It is a good thing to

people on zero-hours contracts who would prefer to be on a permanent

weekend, I met a constituent who made an interesting point. Before the
great recession, he was employed as a construction worker. He was laid
off in 2009-10. Recently, he has been getting a lot more agency work,
much of which is zero hours, but he is earning considerably more than
he did when he was in full-time employment. I asked him whether he
preferred the security or the money. He said that, obviously, he would
like both, but given a choice at this moment, he preferred the money.
He said, “I know that as the economy begins to improve and
construction gets a proper foothold, I will have the security,
too.” These are difficult choices. I wish that, rather
than making a litany of complaints, the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr
Umunna) had concentrated on the meat of the discussion, which he
outlines in the last sentence of the motion. We need to talk about
skills and education levels, all of which were left in a terrible state
by the previous Government and which we are having to unpick and undo.

that the Government’s watering down of rights, including
protections against unfair dismissal, might be affecting the job

trade unionists by the company. At the time, I asserted that the

not done enough to influence that person not to write in that paper

investigation, I discovered that the company has been going around
telling the elected shop stewards that they are not suitable people,
that their credentials will be removed and that management will decide
who will be the conveners and the representatives. Last night, I sought
out the International Labour Organisation conventions on the matter.
They are convention 87, on freedom of association and the protection of
the right to organise, and convention 98, on the right to organise and
collective bargaining, and they have both been breached by the company.
I thought that perhaps something had happened under the UK Government
to weaken 
<?notus-xml column=369?>those conventions, so I looked up the rights of
trade unionists in the UK on the gov.uk website. The section headed
“Trade union membership: your employment rights” states
that people have the right to be a trade unionist and to be an activist
with a trade union, and that they will be represented by their elected
convener or shop steward. I went to the next section, entitled
“Role of your trade union rep”, and that role is to
represent members’ views to management and take part in
discussions with management.</hs_Para>

is saying that a company does not have the right to sack a convener for
telling the management that the work force have a different view. A
company has no right to sack a convener because it does not like the
fact that his union wrote something about it in a newspaper. The
Secretary of State has underwritten £150 million in loan
guarantees for the company to fund its expansion into using ethane from
America and it has received £9 million from the Scottish
Government in regional selective assistance, so I call on the Secretary
of State to make these people come to the table and realise that they
cannot breach ILO conventions or the laws of this land by sacking
people summarily. I demand that they reinstate the convener forthwith
and do what we all said. There should be no recriminations and no
victimisation; let us negotiate the way forward. This is an important
issue for my constituents and the economy of both Scotland and this
country and we cannot have bully boys. I name Declan Sealy as the

security, but because of the hundreds of workers who are dependent on

In the Bridgend county borough area it increased by 63%. The same

struggling with rent arrears in each of Wales’s 22
unitary authorities. Blaenau Gwent and Ceredigion, which are completely
contrasting constituencies, given Blaenau Gwent’s

seen an increase in the proportion of clients struggling with rent
arrears—35% in Blaenau Gwent and nearly 40% in Ceredigion. The
same can be said of Flintshire, Neath, Port Talbot, Powys, the Vale of
Glamorgan and other areas. The employment figures might offer a crude
indication of some recovery, but underneath those figures something odd
is going on, because many of the people clamouring for debt

United Kingdom, and has a travel-to-work area that includes Cardiff,
where jobs should be available. Yet people in that area, including
those in work, are struggling with payday loans and debt advice, and
there has been a near-enough tenfold increase in the number of those
seeking payday loans. It is the same in Flintshire, Newport, and so on.

was lost to the economy by the strikes that were called for today and

be some acknowledgement by Labour Members of an economy that was so

not even think about fuel prices for small businesses, deliverymen, and
all the people in our economy who get themselves to work. They will not
condemn the strikes that prevented many people from getting to work,

from St Albans—perhaps the Labour party will reflect on the
amount of money that could have been in the economy and the amount of
people who could have got to work today. They were prevented from doing
so by a union leader who lives in social housing because he feels it is
his due, rather than because he needs it, and who has not apologised

in respect of youth unemployment, we need to encourage young people to

new businesses have been created since the general election. However,
more young people need to understand that they do not just have to go
to university or do an apprenticeship, because they might have the
ability to set up their own business. Young people have the enthusiasm,
energy and risk-taking ability to do so. I did a business degree at
university. Of the 350 students on the course, I was the only one who
went on to run my own business because entrepreneurial flair and
risk-taking were taught out of us. Obviously, I was not paying enough
attention. I therefore welcome organisations, such as Outset in
Swindon, that provide mentoring for young people so that they can use
their enthusiasm, having been inspired by TV programmes such as

counter some of the myths that have been perpetuated. It is constantly
stated that Labour Governments always leave office with unemployment
higher than when they came to office. That is not true. Between 1945

1950s and 1960s, the position was very stable. Let us contrast that
with the 18 years of Conservative Government between 1979
and—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Government Members can
brush it aside if they wish, but for 13 of those 18 years,
unemployment was higher than 10%. When the Conservative

other myth that has been perpetuated is that pensioners have this
Government to thank for the largest cash rise in pensions ever because
they introduced the triple lock. It did not happen because of the
triple lock; it happened because inflation was so high in that year,
which was largely due to the increase in VAT. If Members 
<?notus-xml column=377?>care to remember, it was said that that was never
going to happen. The rate of inflation is the reason why the cash rise
in pensions had to be so high. For pensioners, it was merely an
inflationary cash rise. It had nothing whatever to do with the triple
lock. If nothing had changed in the policy, the rise would have been
exactly the
same.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579001610" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579001610">I
want to touch on what all this means for a lot of people. We hear a lot
about all the private sector jobs that have been created. However,
nearly 500,000 of those private sector jobs are in the health and
social care field, and most of those are funded by the public sector.
They are private sector jobs only because they have been outsourced.
For far too many of those employees, the working conditions have
worsened. Earlier, a Government Member sought to intervene to say that
Labour councils have outsourced contracts. I know of Labour councils
that have outsourced contracts. My council has such contracts because
it inherited them from the previous Liberal Democrat
council.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579001611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579001611">Private
firms are operating social care services on the basis of zero-hours
contracts. People who work in the social care sector, much like the
McDonald’s workers who have been discussed, wait at home to see
how many hours they will get each week. Not only is that bad for the
employee who never knows how much she will earn from one week to the
next, but it is absolutely atrocious for the person for whom the care
is being provided. It is no wonder that people do not know who their
carer will be on any given day when the work is organised in that
fashion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579001612" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579001612">The
Government cannot escape responsibility for that situation. Why are
councils finding themselves in that position? In Scotland it is largely
because we have now had the council tax freeze, which has been
mentioned, for six or seven years. It is not properly funded; local
councils are strapped for cash, and as a result they are looking for
experience in how to provide services. If a care service is outsourced,
for example, it provides very poor employment circumstances for
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579001613" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579001613">Another
problem that people encounter when on such contracts is how they
organise child care. How can they do that if they never know when they
will be able to work? One couple I spoke to at the weekend told me that
they had to give up the possibility of both working, because they could
not organise child care around their work contracts. That has knock-on
consequences not just on their working conditions, but also on
other aspects of their working life. These real issues are
happening in all our constituencies, and we need to change
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_05_PT_1/C54FBCCABD3E682F424F893ACF1D363339BFD254" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2014">Wednesday

Sharma</B> (Reading West) (Con):</Member> This Opposition day debate is
no more than a fig leaf covering the fact that the Labour party has
absolutely no policies to offer. It is still a blank piece of paper
when it comes to policies. I find it amazing that every time we hear
from Labour Members, they always give the impression that they have
some sort of monopoly on compassion. Is that the same compassion that
meant that unemployment and youth unemployment were higher in 2010 than
in 1997? Is it the same compassion that meant that Labour missed all
its child poverty targets, that the gap between rich and poor grew
wider, and that left us with a record budget deficit for which we have
still had no apology whatsoever?</hs_Para>

improve job security and tackle the cost of living is to grow the
economy and get business confidence going, which leads to more jobs and
rising prosperity. That is exactly what the Government are doing by
cutting taxes, getting rid of unnecessary red tape, investing in our
young people and infrastructure, and welcoming foreign inward

little about Reading, the town that I represent and where I grew up,
because I am incredibly proud that it is an economic powerhouse not
just in the Thames valley but in the country as a whole. What have the
Government been doing for young people in Reading? They have been
investing some £4 million in the last year in the pupil premium,
providing 3,000 new apprenticeships, investing millions more in new
school places, and bringing youth unemployment down to 225 in December
2013, compared with 635 when we came into government. The key is
getting students ready for the workplace and, like many of my
colleagues, I have run careers fares. At the last one, 1,200 students
came along to talk to 60 companies. I run employability workshops with
local employers, which are the sort of thing we ought to be doing to

employers in my constituency are creating many jobs—small
companies as well as larger ones. Tesco has just set up a new

There are almost 1,200 new jobs, but also 85 jobs for the long-term
unemployed. I went to a graduation ceremony last year for people who
had not had a job for a long time but had finally found employment
through that scheme. It was an incredibly emotional graduation. People
were there, with their grandchildren and parents, from across the
social spectrum—real people whose lives were being turned
around. The reason why companies such as Tesco are confident about
creating those jobs is that they have been given that confidence as a
result of this Government’s policies.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) talked about how
people can set up their own business, and how that is a real engine for
social mobility, and how this Government are helping people through the
new enterprise allowance. Under us, businesses are setting up at the
rate of 2,000 a month. That is what we want—young people setting
up in business, older people and women setting up in business. Those

bill, we say it might have gone up a little bit; it will have gone up
by 5% in five years, yet under Labour it had gone up by 20%. What we

the record that I, on behalf of the communities that I represent, thank
the emergency services, local councils, Cornwall council, the
Environment Agency and scores of volunteers who have spent many hours
over the past two days tackling the damage caused by the recent storms
that have hit Cornwall.</hs_Para>

hours, people in Cornwall will have come together in the finest
tradition of the Cornish motto, “One and all”. Although
it remains my privilege to represent a part of the country that
demonstrably shows such community spirit, there are issues that the
Government must tackle to improve resilience to flooding events and to
ensure that they do their part in the same way that local communities
are doing theirs.</hs_Para>

Speaker, you and other hon. Members will be aware that the china clay
industry in Cornwall is more than 260 years old and has played a
formative part in Cornwall’s cultural history. On his discovery
of china clay in 1746, William Cookworthy began to experiment to
produce hard-paste porcelain and finally patented his formula in 1768.
With control over the use of china clay and china stone for porcelain
manufacture, Cookworthy opened his own pottery in Plymouth, moving to
Bristol in 1770. Four years later, Cookworthy retired and transferred
his business to his partner, Richard Champion, who almost immediately
applied for an extension of the original patent. However, that was met
with fierce opposition from the potters of Staffordshire, led by Josiah
Wedgwood, who were keen to use china clay for their own wares. After
Champion’s monopoly was broken by the Staffordshire companies
they leased their own pits in Cornwall, but by 1830 they had given up
control of production to others and bought their clay from agents or
groups of adventurers who would later found the first china clay
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002207">Production
increased with the discovery of other uses of china clay and by 1858 42
companies were producing about 65,000 tonnes of clay a year. Today,
Imerys Minerals Ltd is the single producer of china clay in the area
and almost 1.5 million tonnes of clay is produced annually in Cornwall
and
Devon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002208">There
is no settlement in my constituency untouched by the clay industry. Sky
tips still tower above St Austell bay and intricate networks of
viaducts and old settling pits still stretch out from wooded valleys.
Many of the coastal towns, including Newquay, have at some point been
centres of the export of china clay around the world. Like many parts
of our country with a traditional industry that has dominated local
employment for decades, many generations of families have worked in the
industry with, until recently, a presumption that there were well-paid
jobs for
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002209">The
decline of the industry has been mirrored by the decline of some
communities in Cornwall. Communities that used to be aspirational have
had their sights set lower and communities that used to be
outward-looking 
<?notus-xml column=393?>have turned in on themselves. The sad reality is
that in many of the former china clay mining villages in my
constituency—such as Bugle, Nanpean, St Dennis and
Penwithick—we have seen a transition from generations of
families working in the same industry to a generation of families not
working at all. Educational attainment is low, health outcomes are poor
and families struggle to make ends meet. Despite intervention from
successive Governments, regenerating the communities will take time.
That time means that some of the people affected will not be able to
make the most of their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002210">Let
us also be clear that the modern clay industry contributes
significantly to the economy of Cornwall and that should not be
underestimated. Worth £155 million per year, it is a
huge financial asset to the duchy and is one of the UK’s most
valuable mineral exports, second only to North sea oil and
gas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002211">Globally,
Britain is the world’s fourth largest producer and exporter of
china clay and Cornwall is at the very heart of the industry. Indeed,
china clay from Cornwall accounts for 88% of total UK sales and none
more so than that from the pits around St Austell. Huge white pits make
a good third of my constituency look like a lunar landscape, as anyone
who has flown into Newquay airport will be able to
attest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002212">The
industry, however, has struggled in recent years. In 2010, 1 million
dry tonnes of clay were sold, but in 1988 that figure was almost three
times higher at 2.8 million tonnes. As with other
industries, emerging markets in Brazil and China have undercut exports
and alternative processes, in paper processing for example, have
reduced demand. As a result the number of people employed locally has
plummeted from a high point of some 13,000 across Cornwall and Devon to
just about 900 today. In an industry that is located among a few small
towns, the recent news of extra job losses is acutely
felt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002213">Imerys,
a French-owned company and the largest producer of china clay in the
world, acquired English China Clays in St Austell back in 1999 for
£756 million, along with its then 2,000 employees. Sadly, recent
job losses have been all too common in the industry. In 2006, Imerys
made 800 people redundant, which was a devastating blow to the
communities affected in both Devon and Cornwall. At the time, the local
community was told that these losses would shore up the operation and
provide additional resilience and that the jobs left would be secure in
the long term. However, it has been announced in recent weeks that the
company will be shedding a further 70 jobs. Some hon. Members might
think that 70 is a relatively small number of job losses, but it is not
just 70 jobs; it is 70 families, 70 homes and 70 stories of personal
hardship. The news is of course devastating for the families involved,
as it will likely mean hardship and stress for months, if not years, to
come.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002214">Furthermore,
some skilled, technical jobs at the Imerys laboratories in Par Moor are
being relocated outside Cornwall, leaving people with a stark choice:
to tear up their family roots and move up country to keep an insecure
job, or to lose it altogether. Put simply, job losses, industrial
decline and outsourcing of skilled work from Cornwall are exactly the
opposite of what this Government are trying to achieve nationally and
locally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002215">As
if that was not bad enough for a part of the world that is already
struggling, there is potentially worse to come if the Government do not
act. Of particular 
<?notus-xml column=394?>concern is the European Commission’s current investigation into
the aggregates levy. The levy was introduced over 10 years ago to
discourage the use of primary sources of aggregates from deposits
beside rivers and quarries and to encourage the use of recycled or
secondary materials instead.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020579002216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002216">There were,
and are, good environmental reasons for the levy, but the large
producers do not like it, of course, and have been lobbying for its
removal for some years. Last year, having failed to convince the UK
Treasury, some persuaded the European Commission that the levy was
unfair and should be investigated as a possible unfair state aid to
those companies selling secondary aggregates and avoiding the levy. The
Commission launched an investigation and the Treasury then decided to
suspend the
levy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002217">The
china clay industry in Cornwall is directly affected by the suspension
of the levy. The industry sells secondary aggregates as a by-product of
china clay production. For every tonne of china clay produced, some 9
tonnes of waste have to be disposed of, mostly in the large tips that
are a feature of the mid-Cornwall skyline. However, some of the waste
can be processed further into secondary aggregates, for example for use
in the construction of the London Olympic stadium at Stratford, and
there is growing demand for secondary aggregates for the many building
and construction projects currently under way, particularly in the
south-east, where the customer wants to demonstrate a green policy by
using secondary aggregates, rather than primary
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002218">Secondary
aggregates can be transported either by rail or by sea through the port
of Fowey. It is estimated that that market could grow to over 1 million
tonnes within a few years. Of course, we all know that a green
alternative must not cost the customer much more, so the business
relies on being exempt from the £2 per tonne aggregate levy to
balance the additional cost of transport. All that is at risk if the
European Commission is persuaded by the major primary aggregate
producers that china clay waste is not actually a waste but is mined to
sell as aggregate. It is an odd argument: who would bother to mine it
when there is perhaps 500 million tonnes—the result of decades
of china clay production—sitting in tips in and around St
Austell?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002219">The
Commission’s consultation on the matter has just closed, and I
am grateful that my right hon. Friends in the Treasury have already
submitted a helpful and robust response, no doubt recognising that it
is in the Treasury’s interests not only to retain the levy, but
to increase it to encourage further the use of secondary aggregates. I,
too, have submitted a robust response, as has Graham Watson, the Member
of the European Parliament for the South West of
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002220">Let
us be clear that between 300 and 500 jobs in the St Austell area are at
risk if china clay waste loses the exemption from the aggregate levy.
Tonight, I would like to reiterate my plea that the Government ensure
that the European Commission is given the full facts and that Ministers
lobby as hard as possible to allow the exemption to continue, for good
environmental reasons, for Cornish jobs and for more revenue for the
Treasury. Those are three wins for which I think it is worth us, as a
Government,
fighting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002221">The
china clay industry is as much a part of Cornwall’s history as
tin mining, fishing or farming. It remains one of Cornwall’s
largest employers and is responsible for 
<?notus-xml column=395?>millions of pounds going into the wider economy each
year, and it still employs just under 1,000 people. It is an industry
that I am proud to have spent some time working in, as did my mother,
my grandfather and many other members of my family in Cornwall. The
industry deserves recognition from Government for the vital role that
it plays in helping to support the Cornish economy, and recognition
from all of us for the wider role that china clay plays in our lives.
From paints to plastics, and pharmaceuticals to paper, china clay is
one of the unsung heroes of the modern
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002222">I
ask the Minister to recognise the industry’s role in Cornwall,
to join me in meeting senior industry representatives to discuss what
more the Government can do to ensure its continued success, and to work
to ensure that every resource of Government is put in place to help and
support those who recently found out that they have lost their jobs.
The china clay industry remains as vital to Cornwall’s future as
it has been to our past. I hope the Government will join me today to
work towards ensuring that this is not another great British industry
that we let slip out of our
hands.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_05_PT_1/91B8AAD3566CE0DE071C84639D5E3DA84E123D9E" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2014">Wednesday

(Michael Fallon):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member
for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert) on securing a debate on
this important issue. We recognise the importance of the china clay
industry to his constituency and to the region as a whole. It is
inextricably woven into the industrial fabric of the west country. Any
visitor to St Austell is, as he said, likely to be struck by the
impressive sharp peaks known as the “Cornish Alps”, which
dominate the surrounding landscape and represent the most visible part
of a story that, as he told us, goes back some 250 years.</hs_Para>

major employer in the south-west, and its plans to make redundancies as
part of a restructuring exercise following the recent merger will
clearly have come as a major blow to the employees concerned, to their
families, and to the communities in which they live. I fully appreciate
the potential implications of this for St Austell and the surrounding
area. This was of course a commercial decision for the company. I
understand that it has been forced to make some difficult decisions in
order to remain competitive and to safeguard the future of its
operations in the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

want to keep as many jobs as possible here in the United Kingdom, but
it is not for the Government to tell companies how to run their
businesses. We certainly recognise that they face fierce competition
from low-cost economies, particularly in basic raw materials such as
china clay. We operate in an increasingly globalised, competitive
environment and, as I am sure my hon. Friend would agree, the
Government have to be careful not to respond with protectionist
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002226">I
believe that the redundancies to which my hon. Friend has drawn the
House’s attention will take place towards the end of February
and will be voluntary. As recently as 22 January, Jobcentre Plus
approached the company to offer support through its rapid response
service. Imerys has engaged Penna, a third-party provider of support,
to advise the people affected. I want to tell my hon. Friend that
Jobcentre Plus stands ready to 
<?notus-xml column=396?>work alongside Penna and Imerys should it be asked. Although these
redundancies are a commercial matter for Imerys, we are working with
the company on the important issue of energy costs, and UK Trade &amp;
Investment is actively engaged with the company as regards
assistance with exports. More widely, other Government measures are in
place to promote growth and job creation in the Cornwall

is one of the world’s largest producers of china clay after
Brazil, the United States and China. China clay is our second most
valuable minerals export after hydrocarbons. However, china clay sales
have been on a declining trend since 1988. Increased competition in the
global markets for paper clays has reduced profitability for many
producers. Brazil has enormous deposits of high quality clay in the
Amazon basin and low production costs, making it highly competitive
globally, despite the additional shipping costs. The industry,
including Imerys, has responded by effecting structural change and
investing in more efficient production methods. It has restructured its
production in Cornwall significantly since 2006, and that has sadly
resulted in the loss of over 800 jobs over this period. However, as my
hon. Friend will know, there have also been closures in this industry
in other parts of the world, including the United
States.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020579002228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/debtext/140205-0004.htm#14020579002228">I
understand the pressures being faced by the energy intensive
industries, such as the china clay sector, in terms of their
international competitiveness, and I am extremely concerned about the
impact of relatively high energy prices. The Government are

Pearce</B> (Erith and Thamesmead) (Lab):</Member> It is a privilege, Mr
Howarth, to have this debate under your chairmanship. It is testament
to the crisis in London that several London MPs are here. I will speak
about private landlords, many of whom are excellent, professional and
responsible; my comments are in their interests and those of my
constituents.</hs_Para>

has always been a hot spot for housing, but recent policy reforms and
cuts in funding by the Government and the Mayor have resulted in
Londoners facing a housing crisis. Recent polling from Ipsos MORI
showed that four in five people—82%—agree that there is a
housing crisis in London. House building is down, and homelessness and
rough sleeping are rising. In 31 of 32 London boroughs, less than 10%
of available properties for sale are affordable to a couple on average
wages, with children. As an MP, I earn a good salary, but if I were
starting out now, I would be unable to buy a family home in most areas
of London. In addition, the lack of an adequate supply of social and
affordable housing means that many people have no choice but to rent
privately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000008">The
situation could become even worse. Statistics from the Ministry of
Justice show that one in 56 households in London are at risk of
mortgage or landlord repossession, compared with one in 105 households
nationally. Discussions tend to focus on building affordable and social
housing, but neither can be provided overnight. We must focus on what
needs to be done to help people now. I initiated this debate to discuss
practical steps that should be urgently taken to regulate the private
rented sector throughout
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000010">In
the past 10 years, the proportion of families renting in London has
increased from one in 10 to one in four. If population growth is taken
into account, that is  a 119% increase in the number of
families renting. In  my constituency, almost one fifth of all
families live in private rented accommodation. The private rented
sector in London has grown by 75% in 10 years, but rented accommodation
is not offering people the opportunity to create secure homes and
stable
families.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000011">The
private rented sector is notoriously unstable. Renters typically have
short contracts of six or perhaps 12 months. Rent increases are
unpredictable. The life of the private renter is typically unstable,
insecure and blighted by anxiety. I regularly meet families who tell me
that they are living in substandard properties that are damp and
overcrowded, and that their accommodation is making their children ill.
They tell me that, for all this, they struggle to pay extortionate
rent. They tell me they fear eviction. They tell me that they are
desperate, and they are.</hs_Para>

biggest problems facing families who rent privately is the instability
of the market, and the lack of a statutory system of private rented
sector regulation to safeguard standards and of any meaningful security
of tenure. The assured shorthold tenancy gives tenants just six
months’ protection from eviction, after which landlords can
evict them or raise their rent by any amount with two months’
notice. Renters have no long-term certainty, and that is no way to
raise a
family.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000013">I
have met families in my constituency with children under 10 who are
attending their third primary school due to multiple evictions over
their short lifetime. That is not surprising because, according to
Shelter, renters are 11 times more likely to have moved in the last
year than people with a mortgage. That has a negative impact on
children’s education and well-being. Government research found
that frequent movers are significantly less likely to obtain five A to
C GCSEs, or to be registered with a GP. That is yet another
example of children from the poorest background being failed. We must
reform the assured shorthold tenancy and increase security of tenure
beyond the six-month limit if we are to have stable communities and
give children the best chance  in
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000014">There
is not just the emotional cost of moving: uprooting is extremely
expensive. Letting agencies can charge excessive fees of hundreds of
pounds for administration costs, in addition to requiring deposits and
advanced rent. The result is further pressure on renters who are
already struggling to balance rising rents and living costs. The
instability of the private rented sector means renters face these
charges more frequently—the more frequent the turnover, the more
money the letting agent makes.</hs_Para>

for the industry to face regulation, as the informal code of practice
has clearly not worked. The extent and level of activities that can be
charged for should also be regulated to ensure consistency. Renters
should not have to pay disproportionate amounts for basic services,
such as swapping, renewing or editing contracts—and all the
while rent is out of control: the cost of renting has soared while
wages have dropped. Rent inflation in London is 4.8%, and at the same
time, the average wage for ordinary Londoners has fallen by 5%.

stabilisation. It is time to protect the consumer while allowing
landlords to make a living, but some in my constituency are making a
killing. Rent stabilisation is sometimes called second or third
generation rent control, and is used in many other countries, including
France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. Although some critics say that
landlords would flee the sector, that has not happened in those
countries, nor has it affected the development of large and functioning
private sectors. Rent stability is needed to provide people with
stability. That is logical, fair and
overdue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000019">Although
rents are rising, the same cannot be said about the standard of rental
property. According to Shelter, private rented homes are in worse
physical condition than homes in all other tenures. My postbag shows an
increasing number of families whose physical and mental health is being
severely affected by living  in overcrowded, damp and unsafe
accommodation for which they are paying inflated rent. The lack of
regulation means that vulnerable tenants in substandard living
conditions can be exploited. We need a fair system of checks and
balances, and a national system of landlord accreditation to offer
much-needed
regulation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000020">Private
properties should be assessed by local authorities to determine whether
they are fit for human habitation before they are rented. The Law
Commission has called for every tenancy to include the implied term
that the dwelling should be fit for human habitation. I support that
call. We must grant greater powers to local authorities to root out and
strike off rogue landlords. There are many good and reputable

a system requiring landlords to conform to certain standards or face
penalties would not only improve the quality of private rented
properties, but give private renters the security they are currently
denied. It is clear that there is an imbalance of power between tenants
and landlords. Tenants will not ask for conditions to be improved
because they fear retaliatory eviction, which occurs when a landlord
attempts to evict a tenant in response to a reasonable request, such as
having health and safety issues addressed. A survey by The
Tenants’ Voice in 2013 found that 61% of tenants were worried
about complaining to their landlords about anything. It also found that

Alexander</B> (Lewisham East) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
participate in this debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the
Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Teresa Pearce) on securing it. I am
afraid that I cannot stay for the whole debate because I am chairing a
meeting at 10.30 am, so I will miss the contributions from the Minister
and, sadly, from our Front-Bench spokeswoman, the hon. Member for
Wolverhampton North East (Emma
Reynolds).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000029">When
I sat down yesterday to think about what I might say in this debate, I
realised that I have made  a similar speech in each of the
years I have been a Member of Parliament. I make no apology for that,
because the housing crisis in London has a direct impact on my
constituents. For many of them, that impact is devastating for their
lives and those of their families.</hs_Para>

crisis in London is of long standing, but I believe it has been made
worse by the policies of the Tory-Liberal Government. If the crisis is
not addressed, it will continue to cause misery and unhappiness for
many. It will damage our economic competitiveness and place enormous
strain on our already overstretched transport system, as the hon.
Member for Mid Bedfordshire (Nadine Dorries) has said.</hs_Para>

think of London’s housing crisis as a problem that affects only
certain people—perhaps those on a particular income or of a
particular age—but nothing could be further from the truth. With
rocketing house prices and sky-high rents, London’s housing
crisis is as much about the young professional couple in their 30s who
are unable to buy their first home as about the family of five who rent
an overcrowded flat from a slum landlord. The housing crisis is as much
about the nurse or the firefighter who cannot afford a shared ownership
property as it is about the rough sleeper who can find shelter only in
a disused garage or on a bench in a railway
station.</hs_Para>

Thornberry</B> (Islington South and Finsbury) (Lab):</Member> The issue
affects all of us across London. I do not know whether I have yet
shared with my hon. Friend the story of a firefighter and a midwife
whom I met, who lived in overcrowded conditions and wanted to part-buy.
When I looked into where they might get a part-ownership property, I
realised that the only place they could afford to buy was somewhere out
near Redbridge, and only after she had qualified as a midwife.
Affordable housing in central London is social housing, in my view.
Does my hon. Friend agree?</hs_Para>

Alexander:</Member></B> I do. In my experience, it is especially

three-bedroom shared-ownership property. They have to be earning in the

properties.</hs_Para>

Dorries:</Member></B> Many moons ago—some in this room may not
even have been born—in 1978, as a newly qualified nurse on a
newly qualified nurse’s salary, I was able to buy my own home
independently without a partner. Compare that with today, when there is
absolutely no possibility of a newly qualified nurse buying a home in
London.</hs_Para>

Alexander:</Member></B> I have met nurses in my constituency who might
be able to afford to buy a flat elsewhere in the country, but in London
that is simply impossible. I have not dreamt up the nurse, the rough
sleeper on a bench in a railway station or the others whom I have
described; they are real people whom I have met and spoken to in the
past few years. I am not surprised when I read that 82% of Londoners
think that the capital is in the grip of a full-scale housing crisis,
or that 27% believe the affordability of housing to be the most
important issue facing the capital, because I hear the same thing week
in, week out.</hs_Para>

most common conversations that I have at my fortnightly advice
surgeries is about the huge mismatch between the demand for and the
supply of affordable homes in London. I see family after family living
in overcrowded conditions who want to move to a suitably sized property
at a rent that they can afford. I say “rent”, 
<?notus-xml column=78?>because the idea of buying a home is completely out of reach for many.
Someone on a minimum-wage job lucky enough to be working full
time—that is quite a big assumption—earns less than
£12,000 a year. The idea that there is any property in London
that they could afford to buy is laughable.</hs_Para>

as my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead said, that if I
had not been in the fortunate position of buying a home with my
husband, many parts of my constituency—that is Lewisham, not
Kensington or Chelsea—would be unaffordable for me as an MP on a
salary of £68,000. I do not say that to plead poverty; I
recognise that I am very well off. However, my situation demonstrates
that the housing market in London is such that people in many different
walks of life cannot afford the modest home that they would
like.</hs_Para>

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member> My
hon. Friend says that there are parts of Lewisham that she cannot
afford on an MP’s salary. Is she aware that there is nowhere at
all in Hackney where I afford to buy a property on an MP’s
salary?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Heidi Alexander" PimsId="5563" UID="14020562000121" xid="1126" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000121">Heidi
Alexander:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I am
quite lucky that my husband and I bought a terraced house in Lewisham a
few years ago, because if we were buying today, I am not so sure that
we could afford it. House prices have gone crazy. The Government are
stoking up demand with their Help to Buy scheme, but they are simply
not doing enough to increase supply. The result is a potentially
massive housing bubble.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020562000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000040">With fewer
and fewer people able to buy, more people end up living in properties
in the private rented sector, even when that would not be their first
choice. There is increased demand at both ends of the private rented
market, because people are not buying and homes to rent from councils
and housing associations are so few and far between. The rents of
thousands of working people in London, many of whom rent from private
landlords, are subsidised through housing benefit.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020562000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000041">Since 2009,
the number of people working in London and receiving support from
housing benefit has increased by 110%. That has happened on the
Government’s watch. Ministers claim that they want to reduce the
housing benefit bill, but unless they invest in building significant
numbers of homes to be rented at social rents—not so-called
affordable rents—that bill will continue to rise.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020562000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000042">What needs to
change? First, money must be made available in the form of capital
grants. The Government’s decision in 2010 to slash the
affordable house building programme by 63% was just plain wrong.
Housing associations need finance to deliver homes. Councils must be
given greater borrowing powers so that they, too, can once again build
on a reasonable scale. We must lift the cap on borrowing on the housing
revenue account.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020562000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000043">I know that
the Government have made minor changes, but they do not go far enough.
London councils estimate that if the cap was lifted, 14,000 extra homes
could be built by 2021. We should also explore the idea of setting up a
London housing corporation to build homes directly, as suggested this
week by Labour London assembly member Tom Copley. The simple truth is
that we need to invest now to save on revenue costs in the longer 
<?notus-xml column=79?>term. Taxpayers’ money is being used to line the pockets of
London’s private landlords on a massive
scale. That cannot be right, and the solution is to build more social
housing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000044">Secondly,
we must take a more strategic approach  to public land.
Londoners know only too well that  the shape of their public
services is changing. Fire stations are closing, changes have been
proposed to police stations, and virtually every hospital faces some
form of reconfiguration. Such buildings and the land that they sit on
are precious public assets and should not be flogged off to the highest
bidder simply to end up as expensive flats for overseas investors to
leave empty. When there is such housing need in the capital, that is
scandalous and should not be allowed to
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000045">Thirdly,
we must take some difficult decisions about our planning policy, in
both London and the areas around it. Do we build up or out? How can we
finance comprehensive regeneration schemes on brownfield sites in
London? How do we ensure maximum benefit to existing communities?
Politicians at all levels have a role to play. If we are to deliver the
homes that London needs, there will controversial planning applications
time and again. Politicians are going to have to step up to the mark
and argue the case as to why something is the right thing to do. It is
notable that recent figures from the House of Commons Library show that
Labour-run councils in London have built five times as many affordable
homes as Tory
councils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000046">Councils
need proper powers to deal with developers who sit on land waiting for
house prices to rise, and they need to be able to negotiate hard with
developers about social rented housing provision. That comes back to my
first point: financing mechanisms must be put in place for social
housing to be delivered. I do not pretend that solving London’s
housing crisis is easy, but we must understand the scale of the
challenge and act now to do something about it. I do not want to be
stood here in five years’ time making the same speech
again.</hs_Para>

doing something about the situation; I am afraid that the present

optimism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000048"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="14020562000122" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000122">Several

serve under your chairmanship, Mr Howarth, although it is a shame that
not a single Conservative or Lib Dem MP from London is present. I share

hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead (Teresa Pearce) on

debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000051">I
am going to talk about Hammersmith, which shares the problems that have
been mentioned but where they are more extreme for two reasons. First,
the average  
<?notus-xml column=80?>price of any property in Hammersmith is now £700,000, renting a
three-bedroom house on the open market would cost almost £800 a
week, and last year Hammersmith saw the largest increase in property
prices anywhere in the country—25%. A survey done by London
Citizens some years ago showed that the only housing in London that is
affordable to anyone on the London living wage—not the minimum
wage—is social housing. The myth that new definitions of
affordable housing are in some way affordable is simply wrong. We need
more social housing to address the housing
crisis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000052">The
second reason why Hammersmith is in a particularly pernicious state is
that the Conservative-run local authority—David Cameron’s
favourite council, although most commentators would agree that it is on
the extreme edge of the Conservative party—sets out deliberately
to exacerbate the situation. It began as a simple Porterite
gerrymandering exercise. An article on the Conservative Home website
from 11 February 2009 detailed an analysis by the then leader of the
council based on figures supplied by the hon. Member for Chelsea and
Fulham (Greg Hands). The article identified the fact that many
Conservative target seats for the 2010 election—such as
Hammersmith, Westminster North and Birmingham Edgbaston—had high
percentages of social housing. It cited figures of 36% for Hammersmith,
30% for Westminster North and 29% for Birmingham Edgbaston, and said
that as a consequence of those percentages, such target seats did not
fall to the Conservatives in the way that they
should.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000053">The
article specifically
stated:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14020562000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000102">“Today
social housing has become welfare housing where both a
dependency culture and a culture of entitlement
predominate…Conservative principles of freedom, self-reliance
and personal responsibility run counter to this culture. Calling for
the state to provide a “hand up instead of a hand out” is
unlikely to
resonate.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14020562000054" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000054">It
then went on to analyse the boroughs across London, finding that those
with less than 25% social housing were likely to return Conservative
councils and that those with more than 30% were likely to return Labour
councils. It was as simple as that at that stage—it was all
about fixing the result of elections by not building or reducing the
quantum of social housing. It has now gone much further. The new buzz
phrase is “sweat the asset,” which means demolishing
low-rise affordable social housing and building high-rise luxury flats
sold off-plan to developers abroad. That is currently happening across
my constituency. We have also heard cod sociology about how any subsidy
of housing somehow encourages this thing called dependency
culture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000055">I
am not making this up—it is all in a document called
“Principles for Social Housing Reform” that asked for
four things from an incoming Conservative Government: no capital
subsidy, no security of tenure, no duty to house people in need and no
subsidised risk. The authors have almost everything that they asked
for. They do not have no duty to house people in need, but they do have
a duty to discharge people into the private rented sector, and the
benefit caps and cuts have meant that, of course, that is often outside
London—certainly outside inner London. All the other requests
have become true within very few
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000056">Hammersmith
council, however, has gone much further. It is part of
Hammersmith’s planning policy that no new social housing units
can be created. Where there is 
<?notus-xml column=81?>any affordable housing—there is a target of 40% on any single
development, but it rarely exceeds 10%—it is typically a
discount market sale, so it costs 80% of market rent or sale, meaning
that it is, of course, completely unaffordable.</hs_Para>

borough and my constituency, there is area development of which Albert
Speer or Ceausescu would be proud. In the north of the
borough—at Old Oak, the Earl’s Court opportunity area or
White City—hundreds of acres of land have been redeveloped. Over
the next 20 years, 50,000 new homes are to be built in one of the most
overcrowded parts of the country. Under Conservative policy, not one
will be a new social home. On any particular development, typically 70%
to 80% are sold off-plan abroad and will stand empty to hide or put
away money, or be used as a profit-generating
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020562000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000058">Such
matters are not only exacerbating the current housing crisis; we are
losing for a generation, possibly for all time, the idea that there
will be affordable housing in London. I am getting signs, even from my
colleagues, that I should wind up—they know that I could go on
for a considerable time. We are seeing whole council blocks and estates
being emptied out, demolished and sold to private companies for luxury
housing. If that is not social cleansing and social engineering, I do
not know what it is. This is an absolute scandal.</hs_Para>

final thing I will say is that the latest thing the council has done is
to refuse to answer freedom of information requests from me on housing
matters, which of course is contrary to law. That is a matter that I
will be taking further. I am at least glad to see that the council is
embarrassed about what it is doing. It may just be that, because we
have local elections in May, it is concerned about those. I hope that
the message will go out loud and clear, not only to my constituents but
across London, that Conservative councils are about exacerbating
housing need and not about solving the housing

the Ipsos MORI poll in London a couple of weeks ago, we saw the
evidence that, for the first time ever, Londoners rate the housing
crisis as the most serious issue facing them, with 82% of those polled
agreeing that we are in the grip of a housing crisis. That crisis
affects just about every Londoner—certainly every younger
Londoner, who faces the challenge of finding a home of their own. We
see this crisis as a cost-of-living crisis, with people unable to
afford to buy the homes that, until a few years ago, they were able to
buy, albeit sometimes with a struggle. We now see that it is necessary
to have a salary of around £50,000 to get a mortgage on a
first-time property in London, and of course that is not far off double
the average income in London.</hs_Para>

£938 a month. Again,

whose families are in the private rented sector or social rented
sector, the situation is leading to the explosion of overcrowding.
Currently, 24% of all Londoners are living in overcrowded
accommodation. Tragically, I often see young people thrown out of their
overcrowded family homes drifting into sofa surfing and sometimes into
homelessness. We have seen a dramatic rise in homelessness, especially

situation has not only had a serious impact on people’s lives

half a billion pounds on emergency accommodation since 2010. My own
local authority is Westminster, which of course has led the charge on
so many of the policies that the Government are adopting. It has spent
a staggering £111 million on emergency accommodation. That

is absolutely right that some of the conditions that people are living
in are shocking in their squalor. That is particularly offensive, given

many times, in Westminster Hall and elsewhere, that it appals me that
we can have two households living next door to each other, one in a
local authority property where the rent is, say, £110 or
£120 a week—allowing people in that household to work and
thereby improving their incentive to work—while next door to
them is a former right-to-buy property. Many such properties are rented
back to the local authority 
<?notus-xml column=83?>for emergency accommodation, and the rent for them can reach £500

of new build in London; I simplify, but that is broadly true. One type
is high-value properties that are frequently being sold off-plan and
internationally. Indeed, last week we heard that only 27% of central
London properties are being sold to domestic buyers. As the ITEM Club
said of the London housing
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T10:06:30"></hs_TimeCode>:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14020562000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020562000103">“Arguably,

is an absolute outrage and a betrayal of Londoners. It also leads to
the second type of new build, whereby the affordable social rented
housing being built—supposedly to balance the first type of new
build—has only Kafkaesque “affordable” rents,
charged at up to 80% of market rents, so it is not “social
housing” in any sense at all that we have ever

we saw the Office for Budget Responsibility in December uprate its
estimate for expenditure on housing benefit by an additional—I

they be able to help look after mum at the weekends? Will the family

If the rent was genuinely affordable, we would say, “All right
then, pay housing benefit on it.” If we paid housing benefit at
80% of market rent in Islington, we would blow the Department for Work
and Pensions budget within a few months; that would simply not be
affordable, unless someone was a banker or in charge of an investment

the most important issue facing Londoners. To those on either side of

housing market is broken because of the limitless flood of
non-domiciled buyers who are buying properties in zone 1, where upper
middle class or even middle class Londoners once lived. They are being

People who would never have dreamt of living in Hackney 30 years ago
are buying three-bedroom family houses there for upwards of £1
million, and that means that I could not buy a family house in Hackney

of the increasing challenges in my constituency has been the growth in
the private rented sector. Throughout Hackney, owner-occupation is 23%,
and the private rented sector is more than 26% of households, so more
people rent privately than become home owners. I pay tribute to the
organisation Digs and to Hackney council, which are looking at how
there can be better rights for private renters, but there are systemic
problems, which I want to bring to the Minister’s attention

right to buy has been mentioned, but in Hackney last year the number of
right-to-buy purchases doubled as a result of Government policy from 35
to 70. As my hon. Friends have said, the price of housing is now so 
<?notus-xml column=89?>high that even with discounts and so on from the Government, there is
not much opportunity to buy. There is a huge gulf between someone who
rents in the social sector, or indeed in the private rented sector now,
and the opportunity to buy, because house prices are so
high<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T10:27:38"></hs_TimeCode>. At March
2013, for example—nearly a year ago—the average terraced

on the private rented sector, the army of landlords in
Hackney—throughout London, I hear—is largely made up of
two groups: overseas investors, who use London property as a cash
asset; and private individuals. According to figures from the
Residential Landlords Association, 89% of landlords are private
individuals. People in Hackney, or elsewhere, sometimes need to
relocate outside London. They own a flat or home in Hackney, but the
problem is that if they were to sell and move somewhere outside London,
but then needed to come back, the difference in property values is so
great and so entrenched that there would be no prospect of them
returning to the same level of housing. Some therefore hold on to their
property, and that contributes to the army of private
landlords.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020563000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020563000008">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T10:33:48"></hs_TimeCode>
is one of the reasons why the council in Hackney is setting up a
lettings agency of its own—to work with some of those
individuals, professionalise them and make an experimental attempt to
get longer-term tenancies with reluctant landlords who are nervous
about their position. It is crazy when people hold on to assets for the
reason I have outlined, rather than just to have a home. That is a

that we do not have as many rogue landlords as neighbouring boroughs

the other issue of overseas individuals that causes many problems. I
have questions for the Minister. House prices have gone up, but even
with modest borrowing on high-value properties in Hackney, many
landlords will not be making a great deal of money. They are tied to
certain mortgage commitments; this is because of the army of
individuals renting privately in the borough.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Glenda Jackson)
raised the concern about former right-to-buy properties being sold on
repeatedly. Again that is an issue in Hackney, partly because someone
who has exercised the right to buy on a high-level property cannot then
sell on to anyone with a mortgage, which limits their options. That
means that more of the non-resident landlords—businesses that do
not need a mortgage—take them on. Is the Minister’s
Department thinking about supporting models such as Hackney’s
letting agency, which is attempting to improve the situation locally?
What it is doing is a drop in the ocean, but we hope that it will lead

Chancellor’s Department and various others. It is empty and is

bought by a company that will no doubt do the conversion work very
well, but will not provide one flat for anyone in social housing need,

the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)
said. I introduced a ten-minute rule Bill in October to regulate the
private rented sector. If we are to deal with the housing crisis in
London, we have to tackle it in a number of ways. First, we need a
planning policy that enforces the need for social housing content on
all sites, including office conversions. Secondly, there must be
massive investment by local authorities in affordable council housing,
with secure tenancies and affordable rents, not the market-level rent
model imposed by the Government.</hs_Para>

recognising that a third of my constituents live in the private rented
sector, and that the proportion nationally, although slightly lower, is
rising very fast, we need regulation of agencies, enforced conditions
in tenancies so that there are decent-quality homes, and, above all,
affordable rents. I therefore seek a default power for London local
authorities to impose a rent model across London to ensure that we keep
the diversity of our population and work force, and do not go down the
desperate road of housing for the wealthy and homelessness for the
poor.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_05_PT_1/3306FD36AAD7B25B36CED3CEA71BC7781134F502" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2014">Wednesday

housing crisis across England, but it is clear that it is particularly
acute here in London. We have heard both passion and anger from
Opposition Members about that acute shortage of housing and of
affordable homes in London. It is no surprise that four out of five
Londoners think that the capital is in the grip of a full-scale housing
crisis. Earlier this week the economic forecaster Ernst and Young
warned, very worryingly, of “bubble-like” conditions in
the London housing market. The average house price in the capital is
£437,000 and is predicted to rise to an eye-watering
£600,000 by 2018. That is simply unaffordable, not only for
people on low incomes in London but for people on middle incomes and
decent salaries as well. Many of my hon. Friends have made that
point.</hs_Para>

many of my hon. Friends have underlined, there are massive problems in
the private rented sector. As my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and
Thamesmead highlighted, whereas 10 years ago one in 10 Londoners was
renting, now it is one in four, and that number is growing rapidly.
Rents are at record highs, are rising much faster than wages and
consume more than 50% of average family incomes in London.</hs_Para>

the Minister some figures. In Westminster, to be able to pay 80% of
market rent for a three-bedroom home tenants would have to earn an
annual income of £109,000. In Southwark, renting a two-bed flat
at 80% of market rent would require an income of £44,000. The
severe shortage of affordable housing is accelerating what many of my
hon. Friends have been talking about, which is social segregation here
in the capital and, if we are not careful, a hollowing out not only of
central London but of London more generally. My hon. Friends have
talked about midwives, nurses, teachers, policemen and firefighters not
being able to afford to live in the communities where they work. That

Islington the local housing allowance, which is the amount someone is

to enable councils to introduce licensing schemes. This afternoon I am
going to Newham—by taxi, not by tube—to see the licensing
scheme that has been introduced there, which is driving up standards in

demand, which is one of the qualifications for the licensing schemes,

I have some fond memories of my time as a bookmaker and of some of the

incident. Whether someone was upset with the odds being offered or by
losing money that they could not afford, their anger was inevitably
directed at the person behind the counter: me. While it could be
shrugged off when someone was working with me, I felt particularly
vulnerable when working alone, in particular if I had taken large sums
of money. I left the betting industry some 14 years ago and had assumed
that the practice of single staffing had ended. I was therefore shocked
to learn that it is still going on, which I why called for this

the past few weeks and months, I have read about an increasing number
of cases where betting shop workers have been attacked, assaulted and
tragically even murdered. When we discuss the betting trade, whether
problem gambling or antisocial behaviour, we rarely focus on betting
shop staff, yet 55,000 people work in bookmaking, which is the
equivalent of 10% of the leisure industry. The work force is mainly
made up of women, some of whom are re-entering the workplace after
having children, or students, who need flexible  or part-time
work while studying, as I did when I was  a student.</hs_Para>

recent years, however, we have witnessed a reduction in the number of
betting shop employees. From 2008 to 2011, the number of betting shop
staff fell from 60,247 to 54,311. In contrast, the number of shops has
increased from 8,862 in March 2009 to 9,067 in March 2011. We expect
staff to enforce consumer protection measures and to verify the age of
gamblers. At the same time, they have to police fixed odds betting
terminals. Speak to somebody who works in a betting shop today and they
will tell you how difficult it is for staff to oversee FOBT usage if
they are on their own. In addition, they have to get on with the job
that they are employed to do. When someone works alone in a shop, they
are expected to do all that as well as take and settle bets.
Ultimately, employees are being asked to work as both cashier and
manager at the same time, and often they are not paid any extra for
working what are in effect two jobs. Following a meeting with Ladbrokes
yesterday, I was pleased to hear that such workers receive a supplement
of 30p an hour, which is a promising move in the right
direction.</hs_Para>

such schemes and combat problem gambling if they are working alone,

behaviour being witnessed during visits to 37 betting shops in London

Ministers have a responsibility to act to protect staff at work. I want
to draw attention to several cases that give an indication of the level
of violence to which betting shop staff can be vulnerable when working
alone. Community recently asked its members to provide their stories

secure in the knowledge that what goes on in a shop is properly
monitored, and I am pleased that some steps are being taken in such
areas. Community has told me that it has had more engagement with firms
like Betfred in recent months and is holding meetings to discuss its
current restructuring. I also wrote to William Hill to ask what
measures it was taking to combat this problem. It is trialling a system
in its shops that will ensure that any shop policy is dictated by how
best to protect shop staff. It tells me that shops designated as high
risk under their security risk assessment process, as mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T11:07:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Shipley (Philip Davies), were excluded from the recent lone-working
trial. William Hill has assured me that it has also undertaken a
shop-by-shop risk assessment. Of particular importance is the fact that
it has consulted heavily with staff. William Hill is also drawing
together a lone-working policy document to set out clearly the
company’s approach to single staffing. There are also some
fantastic campaigns that are working to draw attention to the problems
caused by lone working. The <I>Sutton Guardian</I> recently launched
its “Safe Bet” campaign to fight for safer conditions for
betting shop workers. Campaigns such as that are extremely important if

problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020563000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020563000093">As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T11:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>

betting shop, I worked in a bank. Compared with the level of security
that we had at the betting shop, the Securicor van would turn up at the
bank and the staff would be wearing armour and helmets to take the
money away. The bank had security measures in place, which the betting
industry needs to consider. An interesting idea is that the marketplace
manager, who looks after three or four shops, should take the takings
and have security measures in

Staff safety was mentioned. The Government have made it clear that
staff and customer safety in any workplace is of paramount importance.
Employers have a legal duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act

betting industry has taken steps to enhance staff safety in recent
years. In 2010, the betting industry formed the Safe Bet Alliance,

instances of crime against staff, customers and betting operators. The
alliance’s principles agree a voluntary minimum standard of
workplace safety and security for the industry. Those standards were
developed in collaboration with the industry, police and local
authorities. Statistics from the Association of British Bookmakers show
that the number of robberies in London fell by 60% in the two years
following the introduction of the
code.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020563000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0001.htm#14020563000112">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T11:19:22"></hs_TimeCode>

covered by those principles.
Every<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T11:19:17"></hs_TimeCode> employer

have heard that single staffing limits the ability of staff to
intervene when customers experience problems. It is essential that all
gambling operators, not just betting shops, are able to provide support
to customers who appear to be having difficulty. That is why
it  is already a condition of an operator’s licence
granted by the Gambling Commission that licensees define  their
policies when there are concerns that a customer’s behaviour may
indicate problem gambling. Those policies must include training for all
staff on their respective responsibilities and how and when any
customer intervention should occur.
Those<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T11:20:37"></hs_TimeCode> procedures
must be adhered to as a minimum requirement by gambling operators. The

been part of a team that had been responsible not just for prosecuting,
but for tracking down and indicting various Nazi war criminals and
bringing them to justice at Nuremberg. I was, and have continued to be,

would like to suggest a number of actions that could be taken to make
life in Gaza more tolerable. First, people should be allowed to exit
Gaza, otherwise it becomes simply a large open prison. It is difficult
to think of anywhere else in the world where there is such restriction
on the movement of people. As I understand it, Israel is still
committed to a two-state solution, but Palestine is a state divided
into two, and how does one keep Gaza and the West Bank together as a
viable unit and potential state if Palestinian citizens are not allowed
even to travel freely between them? Before the blockade, thousands of
Gazans went to Israel daily to work, and it was an important source of
employment.</hs_Para>

there is an urgent need for fuel—fuel for power plants, fuel to
pump fresh water and fuel to put in cars, which are all essentials for
life. I understand that Turkey and Qatar have donated fuel for Gaza but
that there are difficulties in the politics, and consequently in the
logistics, of delivering it from Qatar. Many would argue that the
constant use of diesel for power plants in Gaza is not sustainable in
the long term. In any event, continuous power cuts are causing
irreparable damage to the Gazan electricity network, which is likely
shortly to become inoperable. The Gazans need more electricity, a
high-voltage line from Israel in the medium term and the ability to
access natural gas for a Gazan power plant in the longer
term.</hs_Para>

increasing concern among donors, NGOs and the international community
that constantly applying sticking-plaster solutions to the humanitarian
situation in Gaza does not address the root causes of its problems. The
simple fact is that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is getting
worse, however much money the international community puts into it. The
occupation must end. Gazan business should be allowed to export to
Israel, and through Israel to the west bank. It may be possible to
export Gazan strawberries for a couple of months a year to the
Netherlands, but sustainable exports from Gaza are entirely to Israel
and the west bank. There appears to be a total ban on exports from Gaza
to either Israel or the west bank, however, which is
resulting in mounting unemployment and grinding
poverty.</hs_Para>

Tony Baldry:</Member></B> I entirely agree. Israel, the occupying
power, does not seem prepared to allow people or exports to leave Gaza,
and it seems equally unwilling to allow construction materials into
Gaza. There appears to be an almost total ban on construction
materials. There are strict controls even for international projects
organised by the donor community: UNRWA can currently take forward only
12 of the 32 construction projects that it considers to be essential in
Gaza. There is a need for new housing and to repair damage caused by
the recent storms. Construction was one of the only industries in Gaza
that used to be growing, and it once employed 20,000 people, but now
practically no construction is taking place. The present humanitarian
crisis seems to affect every aspect of Gaza. People appear not to be
getting permits to travel to hospital. For the past two years there
have been serious shortages of medical supplies and drugs, and the UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 30%
to 50% of drugs are at zero stock.</hs_Para>

fishermen and farmers are also having a tough time. Fisherman are
allowed to fish up to 6 nautical miles from Gaza’s coastline,
but the main fish stocks are 8 nautical miles from the shore and
fishing in nearer waters provides no livelihoods. There have been cases
of fisherman being shot or their boats being confiscated. The reality
is that 95% of Gazan fishermen are now dependent on aid. No new people
are fishing, because it is impossible to make a living.</hs_Para>

the difficulty that there is no clarity about the width of the buffer
zone between Gaza and the Israeli border. Officially, it would seem to
be 100 metres, but Palestinians have been shot up to 300
metres from the border, and I am even told that one was shot 1 km from
the border. Farmers are not clear about whether and where it is safe
for them to work and till their land. That has a cumulative effect,
because if agricultural land is not properly worked it has little
chance of recovery. The hours that farmers can work are also restricted
to between 7 am and 3 pm. Many farmers in Gaza, as elsewhere in the
world, want to get up at first light—5 am—to work their

condemnation. They are self-righteous and
complacent. We must now take action against them. We must impose
sanctions. If the spineless Obama will not do it, we must do
it—even unilaterally. We must press the European community for
it to be done. These people cannot be persuaded. We cannot appeal to
their better nature when they do not have one. It is all very well
saying, “Wicked, wicked Hamas.” Hamas is dreadful. I have
met people from Hamas, but nothing it has done justifies punishing

for a partition of what was then Palestine, under the British mandate,
into an Israeli and a Palestinian part. The Israelis accepted that, but
the partition did not come about. As soon as the state of Israel was
created, the partition was made redundant through an invasion of

is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that Gaza is a prison;
others have said that it is like an open prison. Actually, there is a
difference: in open prisons, people get clean water, food, medical
treatment, and even books or television to watch at times, so even the
comparison with open prisons is not accurate. If Palestinians were in
that situation, they might think that that was a bit of a rejoicement.
Gaza is a real prison in the worst sense of the word.</hs_Para>

struck me in all this is that the state of Israel was founded because
of what happened to the millions and millions of Jews who suffered
genocide. Their properties, homes and

some of the people who are running the state of Israel seem to be quite

looked with great interest at the environmental problems faced by Gaza.
I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)
for allowing me to intervene on him about the issue of the environment;
I pay tribute to his speech and how he delivered it. The water shortage
in Gaza is due, in part, to the fact that it is a dry area; in part to
its large population; and in part to the fact that there will always be
a problem of water supply in the whole region because of the large
population, their needs and so on.</hs_Para>

can be dealt with by sharing, co-operation and conservation. Instead,
the alluvial rivers that flowed into Gaza no longer do so because
Israel stops off the water somewhere else. The aquifer is not being
replenished fast enough to deal with the rate of abstraction, so sea
water and polluted sewage are seeping into it. In all honesty, the Gaza
coastal aquifer should not be used from this moment onwards, because it
is too dangerous and too polluted, but what else are the people of Gaza
supposed to do? They cannot bring in desalination plants, because they
cannot bring in the technology or get the energy to use them.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:33:48"></hs_TimeCode>The problem then
moves on. How can they possibly sustain any level of agriculture? They
cannot, unless there is water.</hs_Para>

right hon. Gentleman also talked about the economic problems of Gaza.
He was generous with his words, as there is not really an economy in
Gaza. The economy, such as it is, is what the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency spends, what the aid community gives and what Qatar spends
on capital developments. However, the ability to export food or
anything else is so nastily constrained by the Israeli checkpoints that
there is just disaster, destruction and waste.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:34:35"></hs_TimeCode>It is a
humanitarian disaster. It is totally the responsibility of the power
that is encircling Gaza and has brought this situation about. It is

will make a couple of points. First, I have been to Gaza on a couple of
occasions. I went after Operation Cast Lead, and the situation was dire
although we all know that things have got a lot worse since then. More
than 2,000 tunnels have been closed. Although that reduced the number
of illegal weapons getting into Gaza, it also stopped the people of
Gaza from accessing the everyday things they need to survive. It is
totally inhumane to close all those tunnels without easing the
blockade. My second point is about the women and 
<?notus-xml column=123?>children of Gaza, who have suffered for so many years in a situation of
conflict and insecurity. They do not deserve to be denied the most
basic human rights just because of where they live or the political
party that happens to rule them.</hs_Para>

will put specific questions to the Minister who is here today. The
answers may help in the immediate situation, pending the end of the

exports as well as imports? Will they push for Erez to be reopened for
imports and exports, and if necessary fund more security scanners if
there is a real need for them? Will they push Israel to organise a

exports can reach west bank markets? A lorry convoy system could be

sad duty of attending his funeral tomorrow. He was murdered by the
Taliban a few weeks ago in Kabul, where he was on a humanitarian
mission. I had known him for the past five years as the main organiser
of Labour Friends of Palestine and the Middle East, a job that he did
brilliantly. The fact that he was killed on humanitarian duty sums up
the man. He was a true friend to the Palestinian people. He ran the
Gaza 
<?notus-xml column=124?>marathon two years ago to raise money, and he visited the area often.
Del was of Sikh origin, but we have heard today that Muslims,
Christians, Jews and those of no religion at all have all strongly
supported the people of Gaza’s right to self-determination and
their simple right to lead a decent life.</hs_Para>

shelling of hospitals, which was done knowingly, and white phosphorus

humanitarian situation in Gaza is deeply troubling, as evidenced by

conflict in Gaza and the continuing blockade have exacerbated the
chronic lack of basic infrastructure. We believe that the Israeli

fully support a negotiated two-state solution that establishes a safe

sides enjoying the respect and recognition of their neighbours and the
wider international community. I speculate that that view would be
uncontroversial in the House.

understand and welcome the International Development Committee inquiry

Palestinian Territories and look forward to seeing and debating the

DFID’s programme in the Occupied Palestinian Territories;
whether DFID is focusing on the right sectors and working with the
right organisations; whether DFID’s funding to the

2009, the Labour Government responded to the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza, giving an additional £15 million at the height
of the conflict. While I accept that this Government have increased
spend in the Occupied Palestinian Territories since that time, has the
Minister considered additional funding to meet the costs of
December’s flooding and associated humanitarian
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>? Although
the immediate need is clear and must be met, Gaza must also be set on
the path of sustainability through DFID’s investment. I would
welcome a few comments from the Minister about how she is tackling the
issue of both the short-term and long-term
crisis.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:49:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

additional thoughts before I allow the Minister to step in and talk
about DFID’s work. First, we know that the tunnel clampdown,
which began last summer, has had a significant impact on the ability of
Palestinians to get the bare necessities of day-to-day living. Food and
building resources previously transported through the tunnel system
have been stripped back, leaving a growing problem of food insecurity
and undeveloped infrastructure. We know that that has had a massive
effect on the Palestinian economy, with some £250 million being
taken out of key sectors and some 20,000 jobs being lost. The
construction industry, previously valued at a quarter of Gaza’s
GDP, is among the sectors that have been hit
hardest<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:50:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000162">Secondly,
there are serious, immediate concerns about health. A recent World
Health Organisation report concluded that a third of medicines and half
of medical disposables are simply out of stock. There are no cancer
drugs. At a time when hospitals are trying to deal with the fallout of
the floods, hundreds of thousands of gallons of sewage-filled water are
washing out entire districts and pressure is being added to areas where
disease is already rife. What is the Minister doing to ensure that we
can respond to the immediate needs of the situation, which has been
exacerbated in recent
months<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000163">DFID
has committed £94 million of bilateral aid to the Occupied
Palestinian Territories over the past financial year. Will the Minister
lay out how that spending is split between the territories? Will any
spending be shifted in response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza?
There is clearly much more work to be done, and Gaza requires immediate
assistance, as well as long-term strategy and investment in basic
infrastructure, to meet development needs. It is right that the UK
Government, alongside other partner nations, should play their part in
helping to give the people of the region a chance to build an equitable
future free from poverty and disease and truly
secure.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_05_PT_1/F6B5928B70BF1F61CD832DFCE470A6AB84E11F55" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="5 February 2014">Wednesday

situation in Gaza is untenable. Indeed, the UN has predicted that by
2020, unless we see major changes Gaza will have become unliveable.
Obviously, the UK Government are concerned about the crisis, so I
welcome today’s debate. A great many points and questions have
been raised, and I am undecided as to whether to tell Members what I
was going to tell them or to try to answer their questions. I will try
to address some of the points first, which may mean that I do not

the points that have been raised, we welcome the modest extension of
the opening hours at Kerem Shalom during recent storms. We continue to
push for exports, and there is no security argument against exports
that we can understand. The Dutch recently funded a scanner at Kerem
Shalom that remains unused, so there is currently no case for the UK to
provide another scanner, although we understand the frustration. Only
the easing of Israeli restrictions will relieve the situation.
Conversations are currently ongoing with EU partners on possible
broader assistance. Exports to the west bank via a land
bridge—something that was raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:55:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

continues to support US-led efforts. There is huge frustration with the
lack of progress, but at least talks are taking
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000168">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:54:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:54:26"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) mentioned drinking
water, desalination and the environment. Restrictions on construction
materials mean that it is not possible to build the necessary
infrastructure. The EU is doing important work on water and sanitation
in the area. Water scarcity is a serious problem across the region.
There has been a lack of rain, and as well as the political situation,
a series of things have led to a water shortage. A division of the
water supply is crucial for both countries in any two-state

for Walsall North (Mr Winnick) mentioned sewage, the lack of medical
care and the lack of power. The serious sewage spills in December 2013
were due to the severe weather, but the underlying problem is actually
the lack of power for sewage pumps. DFID supports the UN access
co-ordination unit’s work with the World Health Organisation,
Israel, the Palestinian authorities and aid agencies to transfer
medical supplies, but obviously restrictions mean that patients cannot
always access specialist
treatment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T15:56:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

hope I have answered some of the points that have been raised. As we
have heard today, this is a dark time for the people of Gaza, and I do
not exaggerate when I say that they are struggling to survive. The UN
has assessed the situation as close to breaking point, and a return to
violence is increasingly likely. As hon. Members know, the humanitarian
crisis in Gaza is not a new problem. Poverty, unemployment and
shortages of food, water, fuel and medical supplies have made life a
daily struggle for too

that we take for granted, such as clean water and jobs, are not a norm
for people living in Gaza, and we are concerned about that. Gaza has a
chronic and devastating power shortage, and the latest crisis caused by
the storms has all too clearly revealed the fundamental weakness of
relying on imported fuel, as well as the dangers of using interim
measures such as cooking oil. The root of those problems is Israeli
movement and access restrictions. We understand Israel’s
legitimate security concerns, and we have recently seen increases in
the number of rockets fired from Gaza into Israel. We condemn such
actions wholeheartedly, but they are the 
<?notus-xml column=130?>actions of a few and should not automatically mean increased suffering

material imports are the root of many problems in the area. Actions by
Egypt to close the illegal smuggling tunnels have undoubtedly made the
situation worse, but ultimately the responsibility lies with Israel, as

contributions from developers to improve and enhance council services

sat on the Bill Committee that considered what is now the Planning Act
2004 and was closely involved in the previous Government’s
attempts to produce a meaningful system for developer contributions. I
therefore appreciate the current challenges faced by the Department.
That said, it is a shame to constrain local authorities to follow a
one-size-fits-all system like the community infrastructure levy, which
will not achieve the level of simplicity of West Berkshire’s
existing scheme or raise the sums that it does. Today I am asking the
Minister to allow a degree of flexibility for well run councils like
West Berkshire to continue with their tried and tested
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:26:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

West Berkshire council has sought contributions from residential
developments as small as one house and from commercial developments

approach has meant that even the smallest residential development
contributes towards improvements and to the expansion of council
services, be that education, highways, libraries, waste disposal, adult
social care, open spaces or health care. Other services
require contributions, or mitigation measures for larger developments,
and the council’s affordable housing policy was recently updated
so that developments of more than five dwellings provide much needed
affordable housing on a proportional
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-05T16:27:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000192">West

there is no cost to the taxpayer. Rough calculations provided to me by
council officials, however, show that if the community infrastructure

received only about 75% of the amount that it has raised, with about

Berkshire council was involved with the previous Government’s
proposals for the planning gain supplement and with the early
development of its replacement, the community infrastructure levy. The
Minister will note that West Berkshire council has consistently sent
robust responses to consultations on the issue. The council has
experienced no detrimental effects as a result of its developer
contributions policy, and its housing build numbers are close to
target, with an average of 515 from an annual target of 525. It
maintains a housing supply—based on existing planning
permissions—for in excess of five years. It cannot therefore be
argued that the policy has held back development.</hs_Para>

replaced by a scheme that will raise less money and is more
complicated. As the Minister will note, CIL takes nearly two years to
adopt, given the 
<?notus-xml column=133?>lengthy and onerous adoption processes prescribed by the regulations. It
costs somewhere near £50,000, which, replicated across the
country, is a substantial sum. By contrast, West

administer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000198">Regulations
for the CIL were initially launched in 2010. Since then there have been
amendment regulations in 2011, 2012, 2013 and now this year. Each new
set of regulations has served to add intricacies, correct mistakes or
provide further benefits to the development industry—for
instance, the recent relaxation to exempt self-build housing from
paying CIL has been added to other exemptions for affordable housing,
for charities, and for large extensions to homes. In addition, CIL
would not be payable in converting offices to dwellings. Such
developments could be substantial, with resulting impacts on council
services; but with no net increase in square metreage, no CIL is
payable, and therefore the existing council taxpayers pick up the
burden.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000199">West
Berkshire council members feel that they  have been forced to
replace a perfectly acceptable and efficient system with a substandard

Government’s making, but of the previous Government’s. As

way of assisting the Minister, therefore, I suggest that he remove the
cut-off date of 6 April 2015 from the regulations. That is all that is
forcing West Berkshire council to adopt the CIL: it is the date from
which the council is prevented from using a formulaic approach to
secure contributions. My proposal would not even require an amendment
to legislation, something I know that the Department would welcome. I
present that as a suggestion to the problem. It works in West
Berkshire, and I hope that in his response the Minister will address

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Brandon Lewis):</Member></B>  It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Hood. I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon) on securing this
debate on West Berkshire council’s community infrastructure
levy. I know he campaigns hard on issues that affect West
Berkshire—not least among that work is his success in securing
significant funding for rural broadband, which will be a big
opportunity for people in that
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000202">I
shall start by going through some of the issues about the levy in
general, before turning specifically not just to West Berkshire but to
the helpful suggestion made by my hon. Friend for a solution to the
problem. I would argue that the basic principles behind the levy are
right. The levy introduces a set tariff on new development,
contributing to the provision of essential supporting infrastructure
based on viability and evidence. In that sense, the levy is the best
framework not only to provide essential local infrastructure but to
unlock land for growth. The levy is fair, fast and more certain and
transparent than the system that was there before of individually
negotiated section 106 planning agreements. 
<?notus-xml column=134?>The whole process of developing the levy is subject to public
consultation, the development of a robust evidence
base and independent
examination.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000203">With
the levy, developers know up front what they will be charged and when
payment will be required. Section 106 agreements, on the other hand, do
not offer the kind of transparency that the levy provides, as
contributions are determined through often lengthy negotiations between
developers and local authorities. The levy enables local authorities to
prioritise spending on infrastructure across their area to facilitate
local growth and development. Authorities are also able to use levy
funds to deliver infrastructure outside their area, by working with
other local authorities, so long as it supports development in their
area.</hs_Para>

agreements are site-specific and cannot be used to mitigate wider
impacts of development. Individual section 106 agreements may be
subject to viability testing, which can cause delays. That is not an
issue for the levy, as local economic viability will have been tested
at examination prior to adoption of the charging schedule. The levy
does not replace section 106 planning obligations, but restricts their
use in areas that have adopted the levy to ensure there is no double
charging of developers. From April 2015, that restriction will apply
everywhere else—I will come on to the specific issue of the
cut-off
date.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000205">The
majority of the levy funds are kept by the authority to contribute not
only to the provision of infrastructure for their communities, such as
schools and roads, but to its improvement, replacement, operation and
maintenance, ensuring that the infrastructure is there for years
to
come.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000206">We
feel strongly that local people should be given a real say over
infrastructure priorities in their area. One of the amendments to the
regulations required local authorities to pass on 15% of levy receipts
from development in local areas to parish or community councils, a
figure that increases to 25% where there is an adopted neighbourhood
plan. That is good news for local people and ensures that they share in
the benefits of development.</hs_Para>

is being made. We now have 30 charging schedules in place. A further 48
are with the Planning Inspectorate for examination, and 12 have been
approved. We forecast that levy adoption rates will increase steadily,
which will in turn increase the overall levy revenues over the next 10
years. The most recent estimate suggests that average annual levy
revenues could be in excess of £300 million.</hs_Para>

implementation of the levy. Some are considering the potential of
pooling levy funds to unlock growth and development as part of a
strategic investment fund. The Government will seek to encourage and
support such developments.</hs_Para>

early days, however, as the first set of regulations only came into
effect in 2010. We have had to make some changes along the way, and
that has so far led to five definite amendments. Those changes have
been made to make sure that the system is fair, flexible and clear to
local authorities and to developers. To be able to do that we have
listened to people who deal with the levy on a daily
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000210">Draft
amendments to the levy regulations are currently before the House and
are due to be debated in Committee on 10 February. The amendments are
designed to make 
<?notus-xml column=135?>the levy fairer, more flexible and transparent. I
will outline briefly the five key aspects of those amendments. They
are: exempting from the levy those building their own homes, or
extending existing ones, to help reduce the disproportionate burden
placed on that sector of society; allowing levy rates to be set by
scale of development; allowing offsetting of levy liabilities when
development is altered prior to completion; lessening levy liabilities
for buildings brought back into use; and moving the date from which
pooling restrictions on section 106 agreements apply to April 2015,
giving authorities enough time to reflect changes to the operation of
the levy.</hs_Para>

Friend will be aware of many of those issues, so I shall now turn
specifically to West Berkshire council. We welcome the efforts the
council has put into developing its charging schedule, which we
understand will come into effect in April this year. The draft charging
schedule was examined by an independent planning inspector on 23
October last year. A report was issued in early November recommending
that the charging schedule be approved. Given that the levy is a charge
on local development, it is right that charging schedules are subject
to local community engagement and public
examination.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000212">Local
authorities must provide robust evidence, based on local viability
considerations, to justify the rates being set in their draft charging
schedules. That includes a requirement to have regard to all responses
received as part of the public consultation on the draft charging
schedule. Inspectors, in their turn, must take into account all the
evidence submitted by local authorities, and that includes any
representations from interested parties. I understand that the
inspector was satisfied that the draft charging schedule was supported

entering Parliament, I spent two decades as a professional engineer,
working across three continents. Regardless of where I was or the size
of the company, it was always a predominantly male, or indeed all-male,
environment, but it is only when I walk into a toy shop that I feel I
am really experiencing gender segregation. At some point over the past
three decades, the toy industry decided that parents and children could
not be trusted to figure out what to buy without colour-coded gender
labelling—that means Science museum toys being labelled
“for boys”, whereas miniature dustpans and brushes are
“Girl Stuff”, according to SportsDirect.</hs_Para>

say over the past three decades, because there was a time when toys
were toys and blue and pink were just colours. An Argos catalogue page

viral on the internet because it showed a girl proudly clasping her
latest Lego creation. None of the text was gender-specific and the girl
was actually wearing blue.</hs_Para>

happened? Did someone dye the Y chromosome blue in the ’80s or
force the X chromosome to secrete only pink hormones? No. This
aggressive gender segregation is a consequence of big-company marketing
tactics. Every successful marketeer knows that differentiation makes
for greater profit margins and segmentation gives a bigger overall
market, so with three-year-old girls only being able to
“choose” pink tricycles, the manufacturer can charge more
for that special girly shade of pink and the premium princess saddle.
Of course, that trike cannot be handed over to a brother or nephew,
ensuring further sales of blue bikes with Action Man handlebars. It has
got to the point where it is difficult to buy toys for girls that are
not pink, princess-primed and/or fairy-infused.</hs_Para>

between children’s play, how their imagination is inspired and
the careers they choose. Research from many sources, including Argos,

one of the Government’s first actions on coming to power was to
end the funding for the UK Resource Centre for Women in Science,
Engineering and Technology, which sought to provide a coherent strategy
to promote gender balance in STEM. I got the impression that the
Government saw their role as being to step back and let the market
deliver, in what might be described as a “rising tide raises all
boats” approach. However, when I started my engineering degree,
12% of my peers were women, and 30 years later, I am afraid to say that
the proportion of female engineering students has not increased at all,
so the market has not delivered. At 6%, the UK has the lowest
proportion of female professional engineers in Europe. India, a country
that has a significant gender literacy gap, manages to attract more
women into STEM than we do.</hs_Para>

imbalance is a question not only of social justice but of UK
competitiveness, and it is a key factor in the gender pay gap.
Traditionally male jobs traditionally pay more than traditionally
female ones. Key political and social questions about climate change,
genetically modified food, healthy ageing and an expanding population
have science and engineering at their heart, and I do not believe that
it is acceptable to lock out 50% of our population from making their
contribution on those important questions.</hs_Para>

Member for Mid Worcestershire’s vigorous campaign for more
female engineers. The Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon.

Toymaster and Fenwick—from Newcastle, although I am sure that
that is coincidental—and the worst-performing store was
Morrisons. I should say, 
<?notus-xml column=140?>however, that when it heard of my debate, Morrisons wrote to me to say
that it plans to arrange products based on their cost, and to end the
use of pink and blue. Tesco had the most gendered catalogue and

does the gendering of toys matter? The subject can appear to be
something of a fringe interest, but it matters to individuals because
it is not fair. Children are actively learning all the time how they
are supposed to feel and behave and what will make them

fair to make little girls feel that they should not be kicking

learn through play, and if we want them to explore their skills and

the hon. Lady said, the issue also matters to society and our economy
more broadly. Today, women make an enormous contribution to the UK and
there are more women in work than ever before, but they still do not
have an equal chance to succeed. Women continue to earn less than men.
We are under-represented in senior roles and over-represented in
low-paying sectors. More women than men work part time or not at all.
Some of that is down to the practical barriers that women face that can
stop them getting on in work, and the Government are working with
business to remove those barriers wherever we can find them, but some
of 
<?notus-xml column=142?>it comes down to the simple fact that we do not encourage girls to

way we play as children informs the skills we develop and how we
perceive ourselves. Girls and boys take into the classroom assumptions
that they develop as part of playing. That has a significant impact on
how they then develop, and on their future career aspirations. It is
therefore unsurprising that boys who have routinely experienced the
sense of accomplishment associated with designing and building
something, which can often can come from playing with what would be
seen as a boy’s toy, feel more at home with subjects such as
maths and science, which utilise such skills more.</hs_Para>

not have such experiences when they are younger, girls feel less
confident, and it is just a small leap from that to assuming that they
are not good at those subjects. That really affects how they progress
at school. Assumptions and stereotypes about girls’ abilities
and interests—the perception that certain subjects, just like
certain toys, just “aren’t for you”—go on
to shape the choices girls make at school. Those choices have
significant
implications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000251">By
the time they get to university level, boys and girls are strongly
segregated in some areas with, on the whole, boys dominating in the
subjects that can lead to the most financially lucrative careers. In
2013, only 6,600 girls took A-level physics, compared with just over
25,000 boys. That is a massive difference—girls made up just
over 20% of the cohort. Of the 13,000 students who took further maths
at A-level, only 3,700 were girls. That shows a clear differentiation.
Of university places accepted, only 13% of engineering places, 18% of
technology places and 22% of mathematics and computer science places
are taken by women. Fewer than 9% of engineers in the UK are women,
compared with around 20% in Italy and 26% in Sweden. There is no
intrinsic reason why we should not be able to make a significant
difference to that in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000252">On
the other hand, women made up 89% of students studying nursing and 85%
studying education—areas of work that are often poorer paid than
those that follow from a science degree. That not only results in women
being poorer than men—as the hon. Lady said, 22% of the gender
pay gap can be explained by the industries and occupations in which
women work—but it also costs our economy significant amounts.
There are skills shortages across the science, technology, engineering
and maths sector, but as long as girls continue to feel that that world
is not for them, our businesses will continue to miss out on vital
talent that they need for future development. Put simply, we cannot
afford not to allow girls the opportunity to enjoy and pursue the whole
range of subjects, starting right at the beginning with their learning
through
play.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000253">The
hon. Lady asked what the Government were doing. They are playing their
part. Public pressure on companies helps a lot on this issue, and a
number of the organisations she mentioned have been extremely
effective. The Government support the Women’s Business Council,
which has done excellent work to raise girls’ aspirations.
Alongside the council, we are taking action in schools on career
advice, apprenticeships, technical colleges, STEM careers, enterprise,
child care, equal pay and flexible working, all of which will help
girls to reach their full potential in the workplace. In response to
the 
<?notus-xml column=143?>WBC’s recommendation, we are currently developing an online
resource for parents of teenage girls that will help them to guide
their daughters to make confident and informed career choices
independent of gender stereotypes and representations. Hopefully, that

information on that. There has clearly been some progress on the
issue—she cited some examples of the moves made by retailers in
response to the pressure on them. Some of them are beginning to
recognise that there are wider implications to gender-specific
marketing. The issue is not just about selling twice as many bikes
because pink and blue cannot be used interchangeably; there are broader
implications for the economy as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000257">There
have been some really positive moves from retailers, some of which the
hon. Lady talked about. For example, she mentioned Boots, but Debenhams
and The Entertainer have also stopped gender-specific labelling of
toys, and M&amp;S has committed to making its own-brand toys gender
neutral. I find it enormously encouraging that there is starting to be
a recognition that things have gone too far and something must be done.
I hope that those companies lead the way so that we see such changes
emulated more
widely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000258">I
recognise that there are some arguments in favour of the gender
marketing of toys. For example, science and engineering kits are aimed
at girls by using pink and purple to attract them to play with them
more, and there are also pink Lego sets, pink globes and so on. It is
argued that such products sell well and show girls that science and
other potential careers are for them. That might be true, but it raises
the issue of whether, in the longer term, that just reinforces the
notion that if it is not pink and pretty, it is not for girls. That
concerns me. As someone who never wears pink, I feel that we should be
able to broaden out. Girls should have wider aspirations, rather than
just assuming that they have to play with it if it is
pink.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020575000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/halltext/140205h0002.htm#14020575000259">It
is often suggested that those of us who oppose gender-specific toys are
somehow going against nature and attempting social engineering against
children’s perfectly natural and hard-wired preferences, but
nothing could be further from the truth. I am not trying to stop boys
from playing football or girls from playing with dolls. Nature
undoubtedly has a role in how children play and interact with toys. My
three-year-old son is completely obsessed with cars, trains and
diggers, and he always has been, but he also makes a mean cup of
pretend tea and is very good at making pretend cakes. Nature has a role
to play, but it is not the be-all and
end-all.</hs_Para>

grow up to be fantastic chefs and designers, and there will be girls
who will be professional footballers or engineers or scientists. The
issue is about ensuring that children have the choice and are able to
play with a wide range of toys to develop their skills across the board
and decide what is best for them and where their interests and skills
lie. That will be different for every child.</hs_Para>

also about ensuring that parents are able to help their children have
that choice without feeling completely bound by the marketing that
suggests they are supposed to buy only certain types of toys for their
child because of the child’s gender. We should free people to
make choices based on the interests, skills and desires of the
children, rather than on the associated marketing. Surely it makes
sense that when children first start to explore the world and discover
their interests and skills, they should be completely free to let their
imaginations roam and to identify what they want to do with their
lives.</hs_Para>

most reasonable people would agree that it is wrong to limit our
children’s horizons, particularly at such an early age; wrong to
restrict their creative play and, as a result, their occupational
opportunities; and wrong to shame them for wanting to explore a wide
range of toys. Perhaps where people differ is on how important they
think the issue is and how much impact it has. We could do with some
rigorous, high-quality research to help guide parents, teachers,
manufacturers, retailers and advertisers on the right and responsible
way forward. I have looked, and there seems to be little, if any,
research in that area. It would be good to see some research on what
impact the issue has; that might persuade people to change how they
retail or advertise toys and help parents shape the choices that they
make on behalf of their children.</hs_Para>

hugely important part of our children’s learning and
development. It is of course for children and their parents to choose
the toys they play with, as we were just discussing. They should be
able to make those choices freely from a full range of toys. How our
children play helps to shape their aspirations for the future, and I
want those aspirations to be based on their abilities and interests,
not on stereotypes. I value the right of every single child to be
treated as a unique individual and to be given the opportunity to
explore their own interests and develop their own potential and
talents, wherever they may lie. That is important not only for children
now playing, but for the future of the

the settlement that we have set out recognises the responsibility of
local government to find sensible savings and make better use of its
resources and leaves councils with considerable total spending power,
with an overall reduction, excluding the Greater London Authority, for
next year of just 2.9%. The settlement also confirms the £9.5
million that we proposed for the most rural local authorities in order
to assist them in driving forward efficiencies in their area. This

protection than we offered both last year and the year before. We have
achieved this by increasing the amount we have made available to
protect councils through the efficiency support grant, now worth some
£9.4 million in 2014-15. But we will expect the councils in
receipt of that funding—in line with the efficiencies that we
are asking all councils to deliver—to improve services. We will

Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (Chris
Grayling):</Member></B> Today I am publishing the Government response

reform” setting out the package of reform I intend to take

responses.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020567000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/wmstext/140205m0001.htm#14020567000467">Judicial
review is, and will remain, an important means of ensuring that the
actions of Government and other public bodies are lawful. But I am
clear that a  
<?notus-xml column=28?>wide-ranging package of reform is necessary to ensure that cases,
particularly significant planning cases, are dealt with more quickly
and that judicial review cannot be abused to generate publicity and
delay perfectly lawful decisions. This is an important part of the
Government’s programme to tackle public burdens, promote growth
and stimulate economic
recovery.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020567000468" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/wmstext/140205m0001.htm#14020567000468">Three
of the reforms I am taking forward were previously announced in the
national infrastructure plan and autumn statement on 4 and 5 December
respectively. These are the establishment of a specialist planning
court, with time scales for case progression in civil procedure rules,
which will speed the consideration of challenges to planning decisions;
changes to the way in which the courts deal with cases raising defects
that are highly unlikely to have affected the outcome, so that judicial
review focuses on matters of substance and not mere technicalities; and
reforms to enable more cases to “leapfrog” directly to
the Supreme Court, ensuring they are resolved more
quickly.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020567000469" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/wmstext/140205m0001.htm#14020567000469">In
addition, I intend to take forward a robust package of reforms which
will see claimants carry a more proportionate measure of financial risk
when deciding whether to bring or continue weak claims. This package
includes limiting the use of protective cost orders to exceptional
cases with a clear public interest; ensuring that details of anyone
financially backing a judicial review are disclosed, even if they are
not named as a party, to ensure that costs can be fairly awarded;
strengthening the implications for a legal representative of receiving
a wasted costs order on account of their unreasonable or negligent
behaviour; and making third parties who intervene in a judicial review
case responsible for their own costs and any costs incurred by a party
as a result of their
intervention.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020567000470" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/wmstext/140205m0001.htm#14020567000470">I
will also bring forward changes to restrict payment to legal aid
providers unless permission is granted, subject to discretionary
payment by the Legal Aid Agency on my behalf. This change will help to
ensure that limited legal aid resources are targeted where they are
needed most, which is essential if the legal aid system is to command
public confidence and
credibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020567000471" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/wmstext/140205m0001.htm#14020567000471">Clauses

Programme (IDAP) is in the process of being phased out and replaced by
a newly developed and accredited programme for perpetrators of domestic
violence, the Building Better Relationships (BBR) programme. BBR has
already been implemented throughout a number of probation trusts,
replacing its predecessors, IDAP and the Community Domestic Violence

Integrated Domestic Abuse

does not include the use of restorative justice. We do not believe that
victims should be automatically precluded from taking part in
restorative justice on the basis of the crime committed against them.
Restorative justice may be suitable for any offence provided both the
victim and offender consent and have been carefully assessed by a
trained restorative justice facilitator. However, restorative justice
is not often used in cases of domestic violence due to the risk of harm
to the victim. If a victim of domestic abuse requests restorative
justice then it will require very careful consideration by an
experienced facilitator. The safety of the victim is
paramount.</hs_Para>

First time entrants are offenders who received their first reprimand,

England and Wales. Offenders who were resident outside of England and
Wales at the time of their first conviction, caution, reprimand or
warning are not counted in these statistics. Additionally,
non-recordable offences (ie TV licence evasion, driving without
insurance) are not recorded on the Police National Computer and
therefore not counted. Where an offender was dealt with for multiple

stable home is just one factor which contributes to reducing the
likelihood of an offender reoffending upon release from prison. Having
access to employment upon release is another. Our transforming
rehabilitation proposals recognise that giving prisoners continuing
support both 
<?notus-xml column=294?>in prison and in the community after their release means they are less
likely to reoffend. We are therefore seeking to change the law to
extend statutory supervision to all prisoners including those serving
less than 12 months' imprisonment. We are also realigning the prison
estate to enable most prisoners to be released from a prison in their
home area in order to provide continuous 'through the gate'
rehabilitative support. This will improve the rehabilitation of
prisoners by ensuring they are released closer to home with the right
support for their ongoing

July 2013 set out that strategic economic plans will be assessed on
three core criteria: ambition and rationale, value for money, and
delivery and risk. Plans should demonstrate how local areas can drive
growth, and the priorities and themes should be determined locally.
Local enterprise partnerships with a clear link to HS2 (for example
those with planned stations) are likely to consider in their economic
plans the actions that are relevant to maximising the benefits of their

for the current financial year is just over £99 million,
excluding DEFRA policy development costs. That is after taking account
of EU funding of around £12 million, which is as yet not
guaranteed. Of this, £66 million is for operational, policy and
laboratory work carried out by the Animal Health and Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, including payments to private vets for TB testing.
A further £23.5 million is for cattle compensation costs, net of
salvage income. It is reasonable to expect that we will continue to
incur similar, possibly greater, costs in future years unless tough new

appreciates the important contribution the National Wildlife Crime Unit
makes to tackling wildlife law enforcement both at home and
internationally. Further to the Secretary of State for the Home
Department, my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May),

alarming problem of increasing levels of rhino and elephant poaching
and the illegal wildlife trade is a priority for this Government. We
recognise the need to ensure that we provide a co-ordinated and
effective response to tackle it. DEFRA has been working closely with a
number of Departments across Whitehall to achieve this and we will,
jointly with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, be hosting a
high-level, inter-Governmental Conference in London on 13 February to
galvanise the international community to take action to reduce poaching
and trafficking. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr
Paterson) and the Secretary of State for International Development, my

Vaizey:</Member></B> The Recognition Panel is independent of the press
industry and politicians. The Recognition Panel will determine its own
procedures for conducting its business and discharging its functions
under the Charter. It will be for the Board of the Recognition Panel to
determine its annual budget for each financial year and, in doing so,
ensure it achieves value for money. Further details of the Panel's
funding arrangements can be found in Article 11 of the Royal Charter.
Initial Public funding does not mean the Government can interfere in
the decisions of the Board of the Recognition Panel. I understand the
Commissioner for Public Appointments has appointed the Appointments
Committee that will make the initial appointments to the Board of the
Panel. The Charter provides that it is for the Board of the Recognition
Panel to take decisions about the form the new body will take. Further
information can be found on the Commissioner's
website:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14020589002535" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/text/140205w0003.htm#14020589002535">http://publicappointmentscommissioner.independent.gov.uk/press-self-regulation/</hs_brev><hs_8Question UID="14020589000158" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/text/140205w0003.htm#14020589000158">Public

Vaizey:</Member></B> As made clear in “Connectivity, Content,
Consumers: Britain's Digital Platform for Growth”, the
Government wants to see zero net charges-where the fees for access to
the main platforms (satellite, cable, DTT) and for public service
channels (the BBC, ITV, C4 and C5) cancel each other out. This
recognises that Platforms benefit from having must-see content
distributed across their services, while broadcasters benefit from
having access to mass market
audiences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020589002427" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140205/text/140205w0003.htm#14020589002427">For
cable, this outcome is achieved by section 73 of the Copyright, Design
and Patents Act (COPA). This provision is presently the subject of
litigation, as online services are relying on it to exploit PSB
content, with no benefit flowing back to the PSB. We will launch a
consultation on this issue once the outcome of the present litigation
is known, before bringing forward legislative proposals as
required.</hs_Para>
