Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Earl will
recollect our debates on the Health and Social Care Act 2012, when
repeated assurances were made by Ministers that clinical commissioning
groups would not be forced to tender out services. However, all the
evidence to NHS England and the advice which clinical commissioning
groups are getting from their lawyers suggests that under Section 75 of
the Act, they have to do so. Does the noble Earl agree that that is an
awful waste of money and effort, and that all it is doing is
fragmenting

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, commissioners do not have to use
competitive tendering for all services. First, acute elective
care—which represents the vast majority of NHS
services—is not secured through competitive tendering at all,
and that will continue to be the case. Secondly, a single-tender action
may be justified on 
<?notus-xml column=70?>the basis that there is only one provider able to meet
the clinical quality and safety standards that the commissioner
requires. There will be guidance coming out on that, and draft guidance
has already been published. Any confusion that exists among
commissioners should be clarified by that
means<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:15:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Winston (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, would it be fair to say that the
noble Earl is somewhat between Scylla and Charybdis on this issue? On
the one hand tendering is certainly more expensive but, on the other,
if tendering does not take place, is there not a real risk that
services will be offered at the price that the market will bear rather
than the one that it really costs the health service? The health
service has not always managed to cost out its treatments
effectively.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> The noble Lord makes a good point. There is, I
think, a desire on everybody’s part not to see competition
result in a race to the bottom on price. That is why we have specified
that commissioners must make clear what standards they expect and apply
those consistently to whoever is tendering for the service in question
at a price which reflects a fair value. We believe that the current
rules protect the NHS but also protect those bidding. I emphasise that
competition will not be pursued as an end in itself; it will be pursued
as a means to drive up

Alderdice (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is quite clear that there are
certain kinds of services that benefit from being grouped together and
provided by large providers who can do so economically but to a high
quality. However, there are other services that are better provided
locally by people who know the circumstances and are often working in
relatively small charitable bodies; for example, in the mental health
sector. It is very difficult for these to tender in the way that larger
companies can. Can my noble friend give me some reassurance that the
Government recognise this dilemma and are trying to find ways in which
smaller, local, charitable providers in certain areas can be protected,
facilitated or encouraged, so that we are not simply taken over by
larger corporations, which may not be in the best interests of
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13100957000691" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000691">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My noble friend makes an important point. I think
that it is common to all sides of the House that charities and social
enterprises play an important part in providing NHS care. They have
done so for many years, and give patients more choice of where and how
they are treated. We have a set of rules which, at least in theory,
should protect those groups of providers. If a commissioner fails to
take account of providers who are capable of providing a service and
simply, for example, rolls over an existing contract, then it is open
to the provider in question to complain to Monitor, which will be the
adjudicator of any anti-competitive
conduct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Pitkeathley" PimsId="59" UID="13100957000692" xid="1389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000692">Baroness

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, that has already happened to an extent,
not least under the previous Government, who made sure that the nascent
social enterprises that were formed out of transforming community
services were set up on a sustainable basis. However, we have built
into the 2012 Act a provision which prevents active discrimination in
favour of one sector or another, so government help specifically for a
particular sector is, I am afraid, not legally
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000012"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:19:36"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Walton of Detchant" PimsId="4515" UID="13100957000694" xid="1485" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000694">Lord

Falkland (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister; that was a
more encouraging reply than I had expected. I am glad that the scenario
that he describes is likely to cover all of England. The dossiers that
have been compiled on matters that concerned both Houses of Parliament
in 2003 are very surprising. It was a major concern of the two Houses
that there would be proper protection for residents in areas where they
might find their peace damaged as a result of late-night licences. In
my area the offences have been quite extraordinary. If, when I spoke
during the Bill’s passage, I had thought that there would be
behaviour of this kind between midnight and 3 o’clock in the
morning in my area in south London, I would have been much more active
about it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:23:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Is
there is a way to protect older and vulnerable people from the disorder
that comes from late-night drinking, particularly after people come out
of venues? People who live in almshouses near me tell me that their
lives have been made quite
impossible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

people, of course, and old people are among them. One of the things
that we have done with the existing licensing laws is to rebalance the
Licensing Act so that there is a vicinity test; as long as evidence
exists within a local community concerning the disruption that can be
caused by late-night drinking, it is able to submit this to the
licensing authorities. I can give the noble Viscount more
encouragement: Milton Keynes has also voted in favour of a late-night
levy, which is likely to come in next year. The Anti-social Behaviour,
Crime and Policing Bill will also encourage the noble Lord; it is
making its way through the Commons and will shortly arrive here, and
will greatly empower communities in this

have talked before about the 250,000 people living in overcrowded
accommodation, with 1.8 million people on the waiting list. But the
economic signals going on in the social rented sector are very odd. The
demand from single people and couples represents each year 61%, for the
latest year we have—and it has not changed much. The number of
homes provided that have single bedrooms comes to only 13%. Over the
past decade, the social rented sector has built virtually no new single
bedrooms, at 30,000; that compares with the private rented sector,
which has produced in that period 280,000. There is a real economic
mismatch going on in terms of what we are encouraging the social rented
sector to build, and we need to make sure that we are building the type

Sherlock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister accept that
last week the courts ruled that a woman with multiple sclerosis was
entitled to have a bedroom separate from her husband because otherwise
her human rights were breached? The courts have now ruled that disabled
children and disabled adults can have their own rooms. These savings
are vanishing before our eyes, and there are no rooms for people to 
<?notus-xml column=76?>move into because there are no smaller properties.
Do the Government accept that the National Housing Federation has

child marriage. It is of course a reflection of the low status of women

child marriage. We address this explicitly, for example in our

that has been resisted in the past by my noble friend the Minister and
I am somewhat confused as to why that should be. In 2002, the National
Health Service was more than happy to add spiritual well-being as one
of the conditions that should be applied to care that was given. I do
not understand what has changed since. Has the NHS come to regret
having these words in its remit? Does it find that spiritual wellbeing
does not fit within the National Health Service today? Are people of
faith who find that having an NHS that regards their spiritual
well-being as important somehow more difficult to handle than atheists
and people who have no faith at all? I should have almost thought that
the reverse is true. When we come to what is euphemistically called
end-of-life care, I should have thought that people of faith have
something to look forward to, rather than atheists who, if they follow
Richard Dawkins, are 
<?notus-xml column=83?>faced with a great black hole of oblivion. They
might find that the end of life is rather more forbidding than do those
who have faith.</hs_para>

Deben (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I support what my noble friend has
just said. I have to say to the Minister that this amendment is rather
necessary because there is a generalised belief that forces in our
society are determined to marginalise that which has actually made our
society and has had such an influence on the provision of healthcare
for our people. The history of healthcare in Britain shows that it was
fundamentally founded by those of faith. That does not say anything
about anyone else, but it does say that if we want holistic
medicine—I am not a great believer in anything other than
orthodox medicine, so I am not encouraging all kinds of what I consider
to be alternatives, which are best left alone—we have to
understand that it is about the whole person, and for many people this
is a most important part of the whole person. For this not to be in the
Bill will be seen by many as another example of society specifically
seeking to marginalise an important section of our community on whom we
depend widely for many of our voluntary activities, and certainly on
whom we have depended and do depend for our health services. I hope
very much that the Minister will take this point

the Government conceding to a secular society and surely they recognise
that for many sick people, the spiritual dimension is extremely
important. It is not a question merely of healing physical ills and
curing physical diseases, it is a question of recognising that many
people, particularly as they near the end of their lives, have a great
need to fall back upon their faith, and that should be recognised and
encouraged. For the life of me, I cannot see what the Government are

of Christian Scientists to have their beliefs respected, in particular
their right to refuse treatment. That said, when we discussed this
matter in Committee, while at that point the Minister was as
sympathetic as always, he failed to draw a distinction that is
important to people of faith, which is that between the use of the
words “emotional” and “spiritual”. People
of faith believe that matters which are spiritual are of a different
order from those matters which are emotional. I have a degree of
sympathy with their

it acceptable to present somebody with a diet that was not reflective

all people are treated with dignity and respect has been brought out so
explicitly. These are words that the man and woman in the street really
understand; they get to the heart of some of the concerns about the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to
all noble Lords who have spoken and for the opportunity to discuss once
again this important new well-being principle set out in Clause 1. The
amendments in this group cover three important issues. The first of
these relates to the application of the duty to promote well-being to
the Secretary of State. In Committee we debated the link between the
role of the Secretary of State and the duty of local authorities to
promote the well-being of individuals. There was clear strength of
feeling in the Committee that the Bill should make explicit reference
to the Secretary of State having regard to the duty on the local
authority to consider the well-being of the individual. An amendment in
this regard is not essential because the local authority well-being
duty is in any event a relevant factor for the Secretary of State to
take into account when issuing guidance or regulations. However, I do
recognise the strength of feeling and I am happy to clarify the
position.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000100">In
response to the concerns, I have tabled Amendment 138, which explicitly
requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the local authority
well-being duty when issuing regulations and guidance. This achieves, I
hope, the same ends as intended by the amendments tabled by the noble
Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Warner, and I trust that they will support
the government
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000101">The
second issue relates to the focus on dignity, to which my noble friend
has just referred. In Committee, noble Lords expressed concern that
personal dignity was not adequately reflected in the well-being
principle, in spite of the change that the Government made to this
effect following consultation on the draft care and support Bill. Let
there be no doubt that the Government place the utmost importance on
dignity and respect in care. These factors must be central to the
well-being principle. In order to ensure that dignity is given due
prominence in primary legislation, I am pleased to 
<?notus-xml column=86?>have been able to table Amendments 2 and 3, which give greater emphasis
to personal dignity and respect as components of
well-being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000102">The
third issue in this group relates to another constituent part of
individual well-being: spiritual well-being. My noble friend Lady
Barker’s Amendment 4 would include an explicit reference to
spiritual well-being in Clause 1(2). We debated a similar amendment in
Committee. I said then, and I emphasise now, that the Government
recognise the importance of spiritual well-being as a concept and
understand the particular significance that it can have for some
people, especially at the end of their life. We would absolutely not
want an approach that excluded spiritual well-being from consideration
where that was clearly of consequence to the individual
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000103">However,
it is important to understand that that is not the approach which the
Bill sets out. The factors included in Clause 1(2) contain high-level
matters which should be interpreted broadly to fit the individual case.
Spiritual well-being should be considered where it is relevant to the
person’s overall well-being. Moreover, spiritual well-being is
likely to be closely related to other matters, such as emotional
well-being, which are listed in the
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000104">In
addition, local authorities must also consider the person’s
views, wishes and feelings, as set out in Clause 1(3)(b). This provides
a further clear direction to local authorities to have regard to
personal matters, which could well include beliefs or other views that
would promote an individual’s spiritual well-being. Although it
is not explicitly mentioned, spiritual well-being is nevertheless
accounted
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000105">I hope

Government have committed to address this disparity for young carers by
bringing forward very welcome changes in how they will join up this

carers and their families. This is extremely welcome, but it will leave

These amendments include parent carers in three key places in the Bill

of disabled children and how they intend to address the disparity with
the rights of parent carers. The Government have put forward an
approach which joins up the Care Bill and the Children and Families
Bill for young carers—which is very much to be welcomed and on
which the Government are to be congratulated—and these
amendments call for them to do the same for parents 
<?notus-xml column=89?>of disabled children. If nothing is done about this, parents of disabled
children will be left with lesser and inconsistent rights to assessment
and support. The rights of certain groups of carers will be left at
different levels in different pieces of legislation, which will be
confusing for many people, and parents of disabled children, who
already have difficulty accessing support, will find it even harder to

Government are improving the rights of carers for adults by removing
the need to provide regular and substantial care in order to receive an

placing a duty on local authorities to provide services to the carer

introducing a new well-being principle. All this is very welcome, but
parents of disabled children also need support. They have often
struggled to establish rights as individuals on a par with other
carers, and they are at particular risk of having their own rights
overlooked as individuals. Too often, they are seen only as parents and
their needs as carers are not identified or supported. This was summed
up for me this weekend in a conversation I had with a parent carer
known to me. He and his wife have been caring for their 30 year-old,
very disabled son who is physically and mentally disabled. They have
been caring for him for more than 30 years and have had the usual
struggle in trying to find any support. When trying to access respite
care when the wife, who has diabetes, was severely ill, they were told,
“But you’re not carers. These rights don’t apply
to you. You’re only parents”. They are not only parents.

addition to the negative impact on outcomes for the whole family caused

making it easier for adults to receive a carer’s assessment by
creating an automatic right to one and removing the requirement that
they provide regular and substantial care. When I see that in
legislation I want to stand up and cheer. That is a great development.
However, unless similar changes are brought forward for the parents of
disabled children, they will still need to request a carer’s
assessment from their local authority and do not have a right to one
unless they are providing regular and substantial care. This disparity
means that parent carers will be the only carers to have these
additional barriers to support in front of them. This amendment seeks
to include parents of disabled children in the duty on local

Amendments 46 to 48 and 58 are about charging for carers’
services. They are supported by Carers UK and the Carers Trust. The
current law includes the power to charge for meeting the needs of
carers but very few local authorities use this power. As well as
continuing to give local authorities the power to charge carers, the
Bill includes a power to charge carers for arranging services for them.
Local authority adult and social care budgets are under ever-increasing
pressure and we must be concerned that carers may be looked to as a
source of revenue. Carers already contribute a huge amount, often at
great personal cost, as caring has a negative impact on their finances,
health and well-being, and opportunities to engage in work and
education. I make no apology for repeating the figure that I have
quoted many times in your Lordships’ House—Carers UK has
calculated that the contribution of carers is worth £119 billion
a year in savings to the Exchequer. Charging a carer for support to
meet their needs, often in order to help them continue in caring, risks
being counterproductive by preventing carers 
<?notus-xml column=91?>accessing services and may even discourage carers seeking support. As a
result, the adoption of charging policies would result in additional

and the person or people they are looking after—we should
remember that many carers look after more than one person—may
not have the same income. In many cases, carers have had to give up
work or live on a reduced income as a direct result of their caring
responsibilities. They may not have access to the same income that
enables the person they care for to self-fund their care and support.
The cost of supporting individual carers is frequently minimal but the
financial benefit to local authorities can be significant. The
Government have identified that carers are the first line of
prevention, and that properly identifying and supporting carers will
prevent escalation of demand on statutory services. The
Government’s own impact assessment of the Care Bill set out
evidence on the cost-effectiveness of supporting carers: for example,
by preventing or delaying hospital or residential care admission; by
sustaining the caring role; by improving the health and well-being of
carers; and by assisting carers to remain in or return to
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13100957000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000128">A
number of local authorities have individually examined the value of
their care and support services and have concluded that supporting
carers is very cost effective. Surrey County Council, for example, did
a cost-modelling exercise which concluded that supporting carers helps
prevent breakdown of caring situations, provides help in a manner that
many families appreciate and avoids far greater costs for the provision
of more expensive and intrusive care packages. This was also the
conclusion of Herefordshire County Council, which recently reversed its
decision to charge for carer services. It found that charging would
risk increased pressure on social care budgets and that no additional
income would be raised by the council because of carers’ low
income. No advantage could be gained because of the negative effects of
charging. I should declare an interest as patron of Herefordshire
Carers Support, but I am sure that that had nothing at all to do with

cost of services for carers will not accrue towards a care account.
This means that, unlike disabled or older people, any services which
carers pay for themselves, or which they are given through public
services if they are deemed eligible, will not count towards the care
account. In the care account model, any unpaid support that a carer
provides for eligible needs will reduce the amount that the public will
have had to contribute towards the capped-costs model. In other words,
a carer’s contribution is counted several times over, yet they
themselves may have to make increasing financial contributions which
would not go towards their own care account for the future. There is
nothing in the capped-costs model which recognises the contribution of
carers and many carers will feel that it is unfair that they provide
unpaid care and must pay for support which enables them to continue to
do so. By any judgment, that is

Amendment 48; I apologise for delaying the House with all these
amendments, but I might as well speak to them while I am on my feet.
Amendment 48 is about services of an intimate nature which can only be
provided to the disabled person. We considered this in Committee. There
is no clarity in the Bill about what a disabled person’s service
is and what a carer’s service is, which will lead to confused
decision-making and carers being increasingly, or wrongly, charged for
services. Under the current legislation—the Carers and Disabled
Children Act 2000, which I had the honour of taking through your
Lordships’ House—services provided to the disabled person
in order to meet the needs of the carer cannot include services for the
disabled person that are of an “intimate nature”. This
ensures that disabled people keep control of their own services while
protecting carers from being charged for services. This is a vital
protection which is critical for carers. This amendment seeks to
reintroduce this wording into the Bill with several clear purposes. The
first is to ensure that disabled people will keep control of personal
services. The second is to ensure that decision-making is made clearer
for front-line professionals. The third is to protect carers from
increasingly being charged for
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000132">Currently<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 specifies that services
provided to the disabled person in order to meet the needs of the carer
cannot include services “of an intimate nature”. The
Bill, as we know, introduces new rights to assessment for carers; new
duties to provide services to carers following assessment; and the
power to charge for services to carers that are provided to them and to
charge for arranging these services. Disabled people can be charged for
services provided them, including if the services meet the needs of
carers, but currently there is no definition of whom a service belongs
to. This was a recommendation in the Joint Committee’s report
when we scrutinised the draft care and support Bill: that the
Government protect carers from being wrongly charged by including the
wording at Clause
14.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000133">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>
wording is very welcome because it prevents wrongful charging, but the
Bill still leaves wide open the issue of how a practitioner decides to
whom the service is provided and thus potentially charged. The new
wording of the Bill opens up the possibility, I fear, that intimate
care services for a disabled person could be provided to the carer and
a whole new scale of charging developed. I do not believe that that was
the Government’s intention when they changed the wording of the
Bill, so that the definition of intimate care should be retained, with
more detailed guidance to assist local authorities and carer centres in
using the legislation. The reason this clarification matters even
further is because of what I referred to earlier about

young carers as a whole to be reassured and clear about how the two

where a young carer is supporting an adult with the young
carer’s assessment, which will be undertaken under the Children

vulnerable to losing out on their education and on the things that they
want to do with their lives and how their health can suffer as a result
of having to undertake significant caring responsibilities. However, it
is a shocking fact that too often young carers do not get the help they
need. One of the reasons for this is that, under the current assessment
process, the person they are caring for does not receive enough support
and the needs of the whole family are often not taken into

must remember that this can have a devastating impact on both the young
carers and the cared-for person. As a trustee of our local carer
support group in Elmbridge, I can say that we see this from both ends.
Many of our registered young carers are delivering hands-on support and
may be the only other person in 
<?notus-xml column=94?>the house. For example, if their parent has mental health
problems—very often the most hidden of caring roles—the
child may have to look after themselves on a daily basis, make their
own meals and get off to school, as well as being supportive of the
parent and carrying out tasks for them. At the same time, a disabled
parent does not want to see their child overburdened with caring
duties; they feel desperate and guilty when they require care and
support that is not forthcoming as part of the care package, and the
child just has to help—and usually wants to anyway. That is a
dilemma.</hs_para>

care and support needs are assessed in relation to the presence of a
young carer, so adult needs are met sufficiently and children are

law to be clear that adult services need to assess and meet adult needs
first, but with a view to whether a child may be caring for them and
providing the support as required. Children should not be picking up

essential aim has been to ensure that local authorities provide or

Amendment 10 specifically deals with the issue of local
authorities’ duty to identify young carers. We know that
currently, adult social care services and health services routinely
fail to identify children who may be caring for an adult, even when the
adult is assessed, and that also applies to schools. As a result,
children can continue to undertake harmful caring roles and end up
developing needs for care and support themselves. The lack of a
co-ordinated response between children’s and adult services
remains an ongoing difficulty for young carers and their families. I
hope that the noble Earl will recognise the need to address this
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000143">On
the other amendments in the group, we strongly support the intentions

terms of preventing them undertaking inappropriate caring. Amendments
46, 47 and 58, in the name of my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley, seek to
address the very real fears of carers and their organisations over
carers being charged for key services that they are not currently
charged for. My noble friend’s amendments represent an excellent
opportunity to put carers’ minds at rest on this issue once and

my noble friend’s Amendment 48 addresses the important issue of
carers generally—not just young carers—being required to
undertake inappropriate caring. We dealt with this issue in relation to
the assessment process extensively in Committee and we strongly support
this amendment. Support from family and carers should be considered as
a way of meeting needs rather than as a reason for deciding that the
person does not have needs or is not eligible for care. Carers must not
be pressurised to provide care that they do not feel able to provide. I

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise very briefly to speak
to Amendment 34 in my name. The purpose of this amendment relates to
the definition of a carer, to ensure that it could include a young
person as well as an adult. I wish to explain that I tabled the
amendment before the extremely welcome Statement by the Secretary of
State for Education earlier in the week, and the tabling of the new
amendments on young carers. As other noble Lords said today in the
Chamber, I very strongly welcome this. I know, from talking to both
departments—the Department for Education and the Department of
Health—that a lot of very effective work has gone on over the
summer that has been very effective both at official and ministerial
levels. I also very much welcome the fact that the National Young
Carers Coalition has been very much involved in these changes, and I

them.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:44:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:44:11"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13100957000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000240">4.45pm<I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:44:11"></hs_TimeCode></I></hs_time><hs_para UID="13100957000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000146"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mackay of Clashfern" PimsId="1610" UID="13100957000787" xid="1761" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000787">Lord

is obviously important that the situation regarding children who are
carers is properly focused. As your Lordships know, I am a
vice-president of the Carers Trust and have an interest from that point
of view. I have difficulty understanding exactly the scope of the
clauses here, because the clause dealing with well-being talks about
the “individual”. I assume that this includes the
disabled child as well as the carer, and that the same is true even
when the child is not disabled. If one has a carer, the child will be
an “individual”, I assume. The adult definition comes in
the next clause, Clause 2. Clause 1 refers to an
“individual”, so I assume that children are included in
that clause and therefore that the local authority, in performing its
functions, has an obligation to have regard to the well-being of
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:45:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:45:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000147"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13100957000788" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000788">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend Lady Tyler said,
Amendments 7, 10 and 34 in this group about young carers provide an
opportunity within our debates to welcome the Written Ministerial
Statement yesterday from my right honourable friend the Secretary of
State for Education about the Government’s proposed amendments
to the Children and Families Bill on the assessment of young carers.
They give effect to the Government’s stated intentions to
consolidate and simplify legislation relating to young carers’
assessments, making rights and duties clearer to both young
people and
practitioners. In the Government’s view, these
provisions sit most appropriately within children’s
legislation.</hs_para>

right to an assessment of needs would be extended to all young carers
under the age of 18, regardless of who they care for, what type of care
they provide or how often they provide it. Local authorities would have
to carry out an assessment of a young carer’s needs for support
on request or on the appearance of need. The amendments also enable
local authorities to align the assessment of a young carer with an
assessment of an adult that they care
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000149">I believe
that the government amendment will achieve the desired effect of my
noble friend Lady Tyler’s amendment to Clause 10 by putting a
young carer’s entitlement to an assessment on a similar footing
to the provisions in the Care Bill for an adult carer’s
assessment. I have also tabled an amendment to Clause 12 of
the Care Bill, which we will debate shortly, that makes it clear that a
local authority may combine an adult assessment with a child’s
assessment, including a young carer’s assessment, provided all
parties agree. The government amendment to the Children and Families
Bill will also achieve the desired effect of Amendment 10 by
requiring local authorities to take steps to identify the extent to
which there are young carers within their area who have needs for
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000150">Amendment
7 would extend to young carers provisions in Clause 2 that require a
local authority to provide services, facilities and resources to
prevent or reduce needs for support among adult carers. Prevention is
an important matter to highlight, but the Bill already makes sufficient
provision on this issue, as it requires local authorities to have
regard to overall family circumstances when fulfilling their duties
under the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000151">Clause 1

Domestic, family and personal relationships are specifically included,
and such relationships could encompass parenting responsibilities, the
adequate functioning of the family and the household and the impact of
providing care and support on other members of the family. We do not
think that it would be appropriate to refer to preventing the needs of
young carers specifically. One means of preventing their needs will be,
of course, to meet or delay the needs of those whom they care for, and
this is clearly covered by the existing provision. There may be other
means, which could include the provision of services directly to the
young carer. However, such routes would not be appropriate for adult
care and support to take, and we do not believe that a duty should sit

will make it clear in statutory guidance that all these provisions

specifically to the importance of preventing children undertaking
inappropriate or excessive caring responsibilities. In addition, in
drafting regulations about an adult’s assessment under the
regulation-making powers in Clause 12, we will make it clear that a
whole-family approach should be adopted, where appropriate. An
adult’s assessment should then take into account the functioning
of the family and the household, and the impact of providing care
and support on other members of the family, including
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:50:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

turn to the position of those with parental responsibilities for
disabled children, which is an important issue. However, we do not
consider it appropriate to include provisions within the Care Bill
about the assessment of parent carers of disabled children, as proposed
in Amendments 6, 8, 9 and 35 from the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley.
In the Government’s view, the main provision for assessing and
supporting those caring for disabled children should be in
children’s legislation, so that the family’s need for
support can be looked at holistically. In most cases, the best way of
supporting a parent carer of a disabled child and other members of the
family is by the provision of support directly to the child concerned.
It would not be appropriate for adult care and support to be
undertaking an assessment of those needs, when adult support is not
best placed to meet them. The view of the Minister for Children and
Families is that there is already sufficient provision under Section 17
of the Children Act 1989 to provide for the assessment and support of
children in need, including disabled children and their
parents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:51:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000154">I
turn to Amendments 46 and 58 from the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley,
about charging carers for support. We remain of the view that local
authorities should retain the power that they have now to charge carers
for support provided directly to them. Many local authorities do not
impose charges on carers because they, of course, recognise the
valuable contribution that carers make to society. However, some may
choose to impose a nominal fee to cover a proportion of the costs of
providing a particular form of support for carers—for
example, a relaxation class or gym membership—and we do not
think it appropriate to remove that discretion and flexibility. Indeed,
removing the ability to charge even a small amount could result in the
withdrawal of such services
altogether.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000155">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:52:57"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Baroness argued that the cost of caring should not count towards

assessments take the support provided by carers into account in
determining the care package. We are clear that the care package should
count towards the cap, because that should ensure that all people
receive the support that they need. We have heard from the care and
support sector that the cap will provide carers, as well as care users,
with the financial support to help them decide on the right care for
them to help provide, and to reassure them that their families will not

have some concern about the noble Baroness’s Amendment 48, which
proposes that the provision of intimate services to a person needing
care cannot be provided to meet a carer’s need for support. This
would create a legal barrier that could significantly hinder the
provision of a much-needed type of support to carers. Let me provide
one example. It may be appropriate to meet a carer’s needs by
providing a service direct to the person cared for. If some type of
replacement care is provided to allow the carer to take a break from
caring, it may look like home care delivered to the adult needing care,
even though it is provided to meet a carer’s needs. The
amendment would seriously limit the ability of local authorities to
make such arrangements because it would provide that the care workers
could carry out some activities, 
<?notus-xml column=98?>but not others of an “intimate
nature<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:54:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>”.
That could leave a situation where the care worker was able to sit with
an adult needing care but not take them to the toilet. That is likely
to lead only to
confusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:54:45"></hs_TimeCode>, I
suggest. We accept that clarity is needed about when a type of support
should be considered to be provided directly to the carer, and when to
the adult needing care. We will produce guidance on this matter, but we
cannot support an amendment that sets such an inflexible rule in
primary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000157">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:55:10"></hs_TimeCode>

important issue of assessing those with parental responsibility for

the same entitlement to a carer’s assessment as young carers and
adults caring for adults will have through the respective provisions of
the Children and Families Bill and the Care Bill. Department of Health

we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:59:55"></hs_TimeCode> supported the
view of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the
Local Government Association that the Bill should include a specific
duty on NHS bodies equivalent to the duty on local authorities to
integrate services and that this shared involvement should be enshrined
in the Bill. Joint strategic needs assessments and joint health and
well-being strategies should provide a strategic overview of how the
health and well-being of local communities can be improved and health
inequalities reduced. ADASS has long maintained that local health and
well-being boards are pivotal in the delivery model in this respect and

Howe, said in Committee that he had no argument with the sentiments

local authorities and clinical commissioning groups to have regard to
the relevant joint strategic needs assessment and joint health and
well-being strategy in exercising any of their functions, which would
include their duty to co-operate and promote integration. The noble

certainly accept and understand those points but I would like us to go
further. I argue that the measure should be much more explicit in the
Bill in relation to the National Health Service’s duty of
co-operation. We know that the current crisis in accident and emergency
services which seems to be extending through the early autumn period is
symptomatic of a health and social care system that is under huge
pressure. If reductions in social care funding and support for the
third sector mean that patients cannot be discharged from hospital that
has a knock-on impact throughout the whole system. This Bill places
major responsibilities on local authorities. Without the full
co-operation of the National Health Service they will be very hard
pressed to discharge those responsibilities.</hs_para>

report published today by the University of Birmingham and Birmingham
City Council entitled <I>Turning the Welfare State Upside Down</I>? The
report says that our social care system is broken and increasingly
unfit for purpose and that we need a big and bold response to tackle
the crisis and ensure a decent and fair system for the future. The
report is right to emphasise the need for close co-operation between
social care and the NHS and to shape services around the needs of the
individual. The problem is that the Government through their 2012 Act
have created a disintegrated system instead of an integrated one and a
system where fragmentation is rejoiced at and where the operation of a
market is meant to drive a wedge between people who ought to be
co-operating
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000168">I do

Best (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to the two amendments
in my name and in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the noble
Baronesses, Lady Eaton and Lady Barker. These amendments are carried

give more prominence in the Bill to housing. I declare my interest as

overarching case for these amendments is that everyone's care needs are
inseparably connected to the place where they live and where, for most
older people, they spend all their time. The right accommodation can
sustain our independence and well-being even if we face the illnesses
or long-term conditions that afflict many of us in older age. The right
accommodation can pre-empt and prevent the need for domiciliary and
residential care and hugely reduce costs to the NHS and local authority
social services. For younger adults with care needs, the right
accommodation can enable a fulfilling life within the community, not
hidden away in an institutional setting. The wrong accommodation can
cause accidents and, indeed, mental health problems; keep people in
hospital because their home will not have them back; and can force
people into costly residential
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000173">This
Bill is the chance to incorporate housing into the health and care
equation so that these three interlinked dimensions can really work
together. The noble Earl has worked hard over the recess to bring back
improvements to the Bill. In relation to the housing issues, the noble
Earl has noted that our concerns are shared by a number of Peers who
feel that the Bill gives insufficient emphasis to the question of
housing. He fully accepts the integral role of housing in helping meet
care and support needs, and has told us that he sympathises with the
arguments he has heard. I am very grateful to the noble Earl for the
two amendments he has tabled to give greater prominence to the link
between health, social care and housing. His response will be greatly
welcomed by the Care and Support Alliance and, within that group, the
National Housing Federation, which drafted the original
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000174">Government
Amendment 28 to Clause 6 extends the duty of local authorities to
co-operate with partners so that this duty will encompass housing
associations—registered providers of social housing—which
is a very significant step in absolutely the right direction.
Government Amendment 12 to Clause 3 ensures that, in terms of the
integration of services, housing will be classified as
“health related” and will therefore be 
<?notus-xml column=102?>taken on board by clinical commissioning groups and
the NHS Commissioning Board, NHS England. Both these changes are really
positive and I congratulate the noble Earl for his farsightedness, once

risk of appearing slightly churlish, however, perhaps I could press the
noble Earl on the two issues that remain outstanding and are covered by
the two amendments in my name, which have support from all parts of the
House. In relation to advice, Amendment 15 to Clause 4 would
ensure that people have access to good information on the options
available to them in relation to housing requirements, spelling out
both ways in which their current home could be made more suitable and
the choices that they could make about a move to supported or
retirement accommodation, such as assisted living and extra care
housing.</hs_para>

the Bill ensures that advice on care services will be made available,
the Joint Committee on the draft Bill strongly recommended that advice
on housing options also be included. So far, this recommendation has
not been taken on board. It is not an onerous extra requirement to
include housing advice in the mix, particularly given that many local
authorities already ensure that people get this advice. Indeed, the
Local Government Association supports this amendment. The Minister
pointed out in Committee that information and advice on specialist
housing options should be included when housing information is
supplied. This amendment adds the prompt for such housing advice also
to be included when guidance is given on care matters.</hs_para>

move to a more suitable place can be suggested for a younger adult with
care requirements. Sources of support for helping an older person to
downsize, perhaps in decluttering the attic or sorting out the garden
shed, can be recommended. For those who stay put, there is often so
much to be done of a practical nature in making life easier for an
older person and reducing their dependency on paid carers or family
carers. From replacing hard-to-turn taps with long-handle lever taps
for someone with arthritic hands, or fitting firm banister rails to the
stairs, right through to converting the bathroom to fit a walk-in
shower or installing a stair lift, all such adaptations can delay or
prevent the need for more intrusive and expensive care provision. With
good advice, paying for those adaptations can be covered by disabled
facilities grants or equity loans, just as advice for a younger adult
with care needs can be given on how the costs of renting a more
suitable home can be

great pleasure of visiting the brilliant Centre for Independent Living
in Knowsley, jointly funded and staffed by the health, social care and
housing services in this borough. The centre brings together all the
key elements of a truly holistic service. The occupational therapists
are there, as are the care and repair team who can organise reliable
builders and advise on grants, the wheelchair and aids teams, and the
handy persons who do small improvement jobs. All the different
disciplines and specialisms come together in Knowsley’s centre.
It helped some 5,700 people last year. About half were referred by GPs,
and health needs are therefore often the trigger, but the solution may
well be in meeting the individual’s requirements 
<?notus-xml column=103?>within their home or, indeed, in pursuing a housing
solution elsewhere, such as a move to extra care. So when a local
authority gets it right, as in Knowsley, it really can do a fantastic,

second amendment in my name and those of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and

“have regard to”, not the “must”, part of
Clause 5, but would mean that in seeking to manage the market for care
provision, local authorities should have regard to the housing
situation facing those with care needs in their area. It raises the
profile of housing in this context so that the different parts of local
government all take it into account in their policies and

doubt by feeding the necessary information into the planning system to
influence future housing provision. In devising their strategies,
health and well-being boards would consider whether more and better
housing should be a priority, whether more disabled facilities grants
or support for home improvements could play a greater part in
preventing the need for intensive personal care, or whether extending a
handy person service would not pay for itself almost instantly. This
amendment would mean integrating housing considerations into the

Contemplating the need for changes in lifestyle, managing illness and
losing the ability to live independently are very daunting and
stressful experiences for many elderly people. The proposals in Clause
4 for local authorities to provide information and advice are crucial
in enabling people to have the knowledge they need to make decisions
with which they feel comfortable. It does seem that the Bill as drafted
has a major omission—the absence of advice on housing
options.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000185">I
worked as a councillor in a northern metropolitan area for many years.
I noticed on many occasions that elderly people were totally unaware of
some of the opportunities that were available to protect them. I will
give the House one example. An elderly lady asked whether I could help
her by getting the electricity board to repair the light on the other
side of the footpath across her garden. When I pursued the case, it
transpired that because this lady was physically infirm, she was unable
to reach her bathroom and lavatory, so she was crossing her garden in
the depths of winter to use an outside lavatory. The reason she needed
the light was in order to get to it. She was totally unaware of the
possibility of making adaptations, with help from the local authority,
to provide her with a downstairs bathroom. These kinds of incidents
reflect the reality of what elderly people know about in terms of
services. It is not good enough to say, “They will find out
about them somewhere”. If it was part of this provision, that

lived at home until they were in their 90s. My father was 96 when he
died, and my mother was 95. They were fortunate because I was aware of
the adaptations that could be provided for them—small things
such as grips, handrails and the like. They enabled my father to cope
with the infirmities of my mother and for the two of them together to
enjoy independent living. But, as I have said, most elderly people are
not aware of this provision. When looking at options for care, most
people would not think of asking the local authority about housing
options. As a local authority person, I am always cautious of giving
extra tasks to local authorities, but I know that this part of the Bill
would not create a 
<?notus-xml column=105?>huge burden because local authorities already
provide information about the care-related housing options that are
available in their area. The point is that those options are not joined
up and they do not come under the provision that this clause as drafted

However, this Bill is also important, particularly these amendments.
What the Minister gives us assurances about in this House does not
always happen on the ground. The matter of housing provision for
disabled people has caused aggro up and down the country. People are
worried about it. If the Minister can be helpful today, that will do a

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the noble Lord,
Lord Best, in relation to Amendments 15 and 23. Obviously, we welcome
the government amendments to which the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will
speak shortly, but it seems that the amendments tabled by the noble
Lord, Lord Best, point to areas where the government amendments do not
really meet the needs. Amendment 15, on making available information
about housing adaptations and on specialist and accessible housing as a
key requirement of a local authority’s information service, was
a clear recommendation of the Joint Committee. The noble Baroness has
just illustrated why making such information available is so important.
It could be very helpful in terms of avoiding the need for people to
receive long-term care. We should not underestimate the challenge
people face when simply trying to find their way through the system. We
find it complex, so how much more difficult must it be for those with
little experience of the care sector and the housing system?
I believe that Amendment 23 is critical to the success of the
Government’s own housing amendment. It would ensure a three-way
integration that would be an explicit part of a local
authority’s duty to promote efficient and effective local
markets for meeting care and support. It would particularly
ensure that it has regard to the importance of adults’
access to suitable living
accommodation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000190">We

age-friendly city programme. It seemed to be a really good illustration
of how, if a recognition of the changing needs and 
<?notus-xml column=106?>support of older people is at your core, and you supply a range of care
and support housing options as an alternative to residential care, it
makes the essential connection between, for example, managing a

support to Amendments 11 and 15. I remind the House that many years
ago, in the good old days, housing and health were together in the same
ministry; there was a united ministry covering both health and housing.
We have lost something by that separation. I think that the NHS needs
to be given a push on integration, so I very much like the amendment of
my noble friend. Too often the NHS forgets that it could help itself by
working more closely with other interests, and it would be a timely
reminder in this piece of legislation to get that message across. As
the noble Lord, Lord Best, has said, we have missed many opportunities
over a long period of time, to bring housing into the party as the
population has aged. All it has done is increase the burden on adult
social care and the NHS. It would be a missed opportunity if we did not
rectify some of that

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much agree with noble Lords that
housing, along with health, and care and support, should be considered
as the three legs of the stool. In relation to housing we are clear
about two things: first, many types of housing can be provided as a
means of meeting or preventing care and support needs—for
example, extra care housing. That is why accommodation is listed as a
way of meeting needs in Clause
8.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000196">Secondly,
housing is a wider determinant of health; simply having a roof over
your head can have an enormous impact on your health and well-being. To
reflect this, the “suitability of living accommodation”
is listed as part of well-being in Clause 1(2). I hope that those two
points in particular will serve to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady
Masham.</hs_para>

12 clarifies that housing is a “health-related” service,
and that both local authorities and the NHS are required to promote
integration between care and support, health and housing. This makes
the 
<?notus-xml column=107?>importance of housing explicit not only in the
integration duty in this Bill but in the comparable duties on the NHS
in the 2006 Act. I hope noble Lords will welcome
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000198">In
Committee, noble Lords also expressed the view that we needed to
clarify that local authorities are required to co-operate with
providers of services, including providers of housing services.
Amendment 28, again in my name, does just this. The non-exhaustive list
of the types of “other persons” we expect local
authorities to co-operate with would now include certain providers of
health, care and support, and housing services. However, we cannot add
these bodies as “relevant partners”, as public law is
limited in the extent to which it can place duties on such private
bodies.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13100957000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000243">5.30

can reassure the noble Lord, Lord Best, and my noble friends Lord
Shipley and Lady Eaton that it is a key principle of the Bill that
where any type of housing is provided in relation to a person’s
care and support needs, that must be considered part of “care
and support”. It follows that where housing or accommodation is
provided to meet—or indeed prevent, delay or reduce—needs
for care and support, local authority duties to provide information and
advice, and shape the market, must include such types of accommodation.
I undertake that these matters will be made clear in statutory
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000200">However,
we must be clear where the boundaries lie between responsibilities for
care and support, which will include many types of housing,
and for general housing that is not related to care needs. Amendments
15 and 23, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Best, risk
blurring this divide and creating overlap and confusion between housing
and care and support. In that respect, there is, I am afraid, a
fundamental problem with these amendments. Providing information and
advice about general housing options and ensuring that there is
sufficient suitable housing available is clearly the responsibility of
the local housing authority, which is not always the local authority
responsible for care and support in that area. It simply is not
reasonable to ask local authorities, in their care and support
functions, to carry out those other
functions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000201">Turning
to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, it is
incontrovertible that local authorities and relevant partners must
co-operate in order to ensure both integration and safe and timely
transfers of care; indeed, the Bill already requires this. Clause 6
requires that local authorities and relevant partners co-operate with
one another where relevant to care and support. Subsection (5) of this
clause sets out some key examples of when this duty should be used.
There can be no question that this duty would also apply to promoting
integration.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_09_PT_1/262BBA58BED7DC23758793A31AD771F30799DB4E" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 October 2013">Wednesday,

respect to integration, Clause 3 requires local authorities to promote
integration while carrying out their care and support functions.
Consequently, this applies to Clause 6. Further, the co-operation duty
requires the relevant partners, including NHS bodies and local

of their respective functions. Such co-operation is inexorably linked
to the integration duty.</hs_para>

in complete agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, in his Amendment
11 that it is imperative that NHS bodies are also under a duty to
promote integration. That very thing is achieved by Sections
13N and 14Z1 of the NHS Act 2006, as amended by the 2012 Act, which
Clause 3 is intended to reflect. Far from the legislation driving
fragmentation, it is actually shot through with duties around
integration of services. Although I appreciate the noble Lord’s
intention to add further symbolic focus on integration, I do not
consider it necessary to make further provisions in this regard, and I
am sure he will appreciate that we should not be populating Acts of
Parliament with provisions that are legally
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000204">That

same as the one specified by Clause 9. As a result, Amendment 39 would

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, it is good to know that
after due consideration the noble Earl is satisfied with his own
amendment. On the housing amendments, the noble Lord, Lord Best, will
make up his own mind, but it struck me that he is relying on the
difference between the local authority as the local housing authority
and the local authority as the care authority. He is of course right to
say that in county shire areas in some places it is a different
function. However, there remains a concern, given that in relation to
care and support we are talking about difficult circumstances, often
with vulnerable people, over whether the appropriate advice and support
will be given. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Best, will reflect on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100957000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100957000214">On my
Amendment 11, on integration, the noble Earl relies on existing duties
of co-operation on the NHS, and Clauses 3 and 6. Where I fundamentally
disagree with him is on the impact of the 2012 Act. The noble Earl may
not be aware of just how difficult it now is for the NHS to put a
cohesive plan and programme together in every locality, because the
current incentives do not encourage that integration. I know that he
warns us against putting what he thinks is a superfluous clause in the
Bill—but this Care Bill is vitally important. It revises social
care legislation and adds the foundations of the implementation of the
Dilnot commission. It would be very helpful if there were an explicit
duty of co-operation on the National Health Service, because we will
not bring about integrated care without the full support of the
National Health Service. On due reflection, I would like to test

Greengross (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 18
in this group as well. I have already expressed my support for the
Bill, which will make a huge difference to the lives of users of social
care services and their families. However, a little more can be done to
reform the Bill in the areas of information and advice, and also
complaints and redress. I welcome the fact that the Government have
recognised this issue and that the Minister has tabled amendments on
their behalf. This shows that the Government accept the need for
proactive engagement around information and advice, the importance of
understanding when and how people access information, and the need
for a focus on identifying those who would most benefit from
it. These issues reflect exactly the thrust of my amendments except
that, unlike the Government’s, mine relate to all information
and advice about care and support, not just financial information and
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T17:57:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

emphasis on proper access to financial advice, it seems a bit
inconsistent not to apply this proactive approach to all forms of
information and advice about care. For example, even when considering
financial options, it is difficult to disentangle these from
information that is needed about other aspects of care such as the
choice of providers. It might even apply to housing, which was
addressed in the debate on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord

local authority should be on improving outcomes through targeted
information and advice that people can access at the right time and in
the right way. The first of these amendments was raised in Committee
and the Government responded that statutory guidance would make it
clear that in order to fulfil the duty around information and advice,
local authorities will need to facilitate access to it. However, I

answering.” People also need information and advice at key pinch
points; we know this. This amendment would ensure that local
authorities consider these when designing their information and advice
strategies. For example, people often see their general practitioner as
a focal point for information and advice about care, and while the GP
may not always be in the best position to give this advice, local

also that the information and advice takes full account of their

an untrained person with a leaflet on local services, probably
including lots of irrelevant information, is quite likely to leave
someone more confused than they were before the visit. In fact, if
local authorities do not want people to find their way to

costly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100967000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0001.htm#13100967000010">My few

come from people who are properly qualified to give it. It is not
enough to have Tom, Dick and Harry advise in this field. It is not
enough, even, for local authorities to send people to see people who
they may think are quite plausible advisers, such as Citizens Advice:
they do not know the complications involved in giving financial advice,
particularly to people who have got some money and need to make sure
that it will provide them with the care in a home that they want. They
need proper, regulated financial advice, given by advisers who can be
called to task by the Financial Conduct Authority if the advice they
give is not sufficient, who have to follow the rules set by it and must
have the kind of qualifications required by it. Therefore, in my view
the Government are some way short of what is required in these

if historians were to go back through the annals of the British

officials have briefed Ministers to say “no” to requests
for advocacy. During the 20 years that I have followed these sorts of
issues, during which advocacy has became part of social care,

I come to individuals who qualify to have an advocate. Subsection (4)
of the proposed new clause is quite clear that that is reduced to
people who have substantial difficulty in understanding and retaining
information, in making judgments by weighing things or in communicating
their views. What is not in the Government’s Amendment 118 is a
right of access for the advocate to access those people. Under the
Mental Capacity Act and the Mental Health Act, where advocates are
appointed they have a statutory right of access to people and a
statutory right to interview those people in private. Given that we are
talking about some fairly vulnerable people, would it be possible to

made by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, it is important that people are
properly trained for the roles that they will undertake in this

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I will make a few remarks about three
separate subjects that are covered in this group of amendments. First,
I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, on her tenacity on the
subject of advocacy. I very much support what the Government are doing
to try to respond to that, because it is a view that many of us across
the House have had for some time. The Bill was deficient in terms of
advocacy for those who need that kind of help and

in relation to my noble friend Lord Lipsey’s remarks, which we
will go into a bit more under the next amendment. I remind the
Government of the mis-selling of pensions and insurance in the
financial services sector. They would do well to dwell on that before
they eliminate the idea of some regulation. I see the argument that not
all types of financial advice need a regulated financial adviser.
However, some types of that advice need a regulated financial adviser.
My peace offering to the Government is the following. If they thought a
bit more about this, given what happened in the financial services
sector, it may be possible to separate out the types of financial
advice and deal with it in regulation, where we need both regulated and
unregulated people. At the moment, the Government are being too
broad-brush in ignoring some of the complexities, particularly around
equity release and deferred payments, which may be equally as complex
as any of the pensions and insurance issues that were being rather
gaily sold by untrained people in the financial services
sector.</hs_para>

take issue with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, on Amendment 21,
drawing on my six years as a director of social services. In the 1980s,
we set up a care management system where care managers did not have to
be qualified social workers. These people were putting together
packages of care after an in-service training course, which enabled
them to deal with some very vulnerable people with quite complex needs.
It is not necessary to have a social worker. Many local authority
departments over the years have developed benefits advice services that
run alongside their social work colleagues, which give financial

their way around the social security system. I caution the Government
against not going down that path. With all due respect to the
professional advice that the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has had,
qualified social workers are not necessarily very good at giving some
of the advice that we are talking about.</hs_para>

more to the point, we should not divert a scarce resource such as
qualified social workers into this area of activity when we do not need
to. I remind the noble Earl that we are seeing, in the

skills and resources is in some of those other areas of work that local

all that in the Government’s view high quality, accessible
information is vital if we are to realise the aims set out in this
Bill. We heard some excellent arguments in Committee about financial
advice, advocacy, accessibility and signposting to other sources of
information and advice. I hope that the amendments we are tabling
today, and the commitments that we can give about our work with the
sector on statutory guidance, will persuade noble Lords that we have
listened to what we heard in Committee and have acted
accordingly.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, has tabled two amendments, Amendments
13 and 18, which state that local authorities should facilitate access
to information and advice and that they should be accessible to those
who would benefit. Amendment 21, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady
Meacher, proposes regulation-making powers which specify when social
workers should provide information in complex cases. Following
consultation, we made clear that information and advice must be
accessible to those who have a need for them in relation to care and
support. It says exactly that in Clause 4(4). Local authorities will
have to meet the information needs of all groups, including those who
often find it most difficult to access information, such as those with
sensory impairments, people from BME backgrounds, people who are
socially isolated or who have complex conditions. We are absolutely
clear about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000003">“Accessible

Bill—also mean ensuring that information and advice are
available in the right format, in the right places and at the right

When appropriate and most effective, that advice should be given
directly by a qualified social worker. There will be other occasions
when information and advice are best and most appropriately provided by
others. We are working with all interested parties on what this means
in practice and on translating this into the statutory

population—including those who would benefit from that. Each
local authority will need to tailor the service to its
population’s needs. I can confirm to the noble Baroness that the
detail about how to do this will be covered in statutory guidance, and

Government have also listened carefully to concerns expressed about the
provision of information and advice on financial matters. We have in
response tabled Amendments 16 and 17, which seek to make clearer the
active role that local authorities have. Amendment 16 requires local
authorities to have regard to the importance of identifying individuals
who would be likely to benefit from financial advice. This encourages a
more active role for local authorities to consider whether people would
benefit from financial advice. Amendment 17 means that local
authorities must seek to ensure that adults understand how to access

particular point that I want to bring out here is that the Government
do not believe it would be appropriate to require local authorities to
make direct referrals. For the most part, local authorities do not
possess the necessary expertise, and there is a risk that a referral
leading to poor advice could bring a significant burden of
accountability on to the local authority. We will work closely with
stakeholders as we produce the statutory guidance to understand how
different types of financial advice, including regulated
financial advice, might be of benefit for people in different
situations, as well as the active role of local authorities within
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000008">Amendments

independent financial advice on matters relevant to the meeting of

about the potential confusion, particularly in the financial services

the amendment proposed by my noble friend Lady Barker about the
importance of access to independent advocacy. The Bill requires local
authorities to involve adults in the assessment, care-planning and
review processes. Most people will be able to carry out this
involvement on their own and many others will have family or friends
who are able to represent their views. However, in the light of what we
have heard from noble Lords and other stakeholders, the Government
accept that some people may require independent assistance to make this
involvement a reality, which is why we are bringing forward Amendments
118 and 119. These are very similar to the amendments in the name of my
noble friend Lady Barker. I shall address in a moment the questions
that she put to

close work with the sector, we agree that the people who need this
assistance most are those who have substantial difficulty in
understanding, retaining, using or weighing the necessary information
to allow this involvement, as well as those who have difficulty in
communicating their wishes and feelings. For these people, our
amendment states that local authorities would be under a duty to
provide an independent advocate if there was no appropriate person to
represent the individual who was not also involved in that
person’s care or treatment. This would usually be a friend or
family member. The Government’s amendments go further by
proposing a similar duty to provide independent advocates to facilitate
people’s involvement in the safeguarding processes. We consider
it vital that people are at the heart of these processes, rather than
having these processes done to them.</hs_para>

noble friend asked about the term “involve”. The change
in the duty to involve a person as opposed to consulting them in the
assessment, care-planning and review processes was made as a result of
public consultation. It represents a significant shift by changing the
emphasis on the process from being one that is led by the local
authority to one carried out jointly with the individual. In practice,
this means that people will need to be actively involved throughout the
process, meaning that local authorities take their views into account
rather than being able to perform tick-box assessment exercises, which
is sometimes the accusation now. This fits with our whole approach to
reforming care and support, shifting from a paternalistic view and a
system where the authorities know best to a system that is driven
around people and their individual
preferences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:32:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000012">My

Proposed subsection (2) of government Amendment 118 requires an
advocate to be made available to the individual, and the duty of
co-operation in Clause 6 requires relevant partners of a local
authority to co-operate in such matters. The regulation-making power at
proposed subsection (7)(d) in Amendment 118 allows us to
make provision as to the manner in which independent advocates are to
perform their functions. This will allow the Government to specify that
advocates will need to see the individuals, among other things. We have
not yet made decisions about the specific content of these regulations,
as we will work collaboratively with all interested stakeholders to

regulation-making power will allow us to specify the manner in which
independent advocates will carry out their role. There are two main
ways of quality-assuring the work of advocates, which was another issue
raised by my noble friend. The first is through the commissioning
process, whereby local authorities set out what they expect of the
advocacy service in terms of quantity and quality and monitor it
through performance indicators and regular meetings. Secondly, the
department has also funded a sector-specific quality assurance
framework, whereby organisations start by carrying out a
self-assessment and then are visited by assessors, who examine and
report on the quality of the work. This is called the quality

turn to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about how we
will monitor effectiveness and what recourse individuals have. First,
by putting care and support law into a single statute, we are ensuring
that local authorities are clear about their care and support
obligations. As public bodies, they are obliged to comply with these
legal obligations, and we can rightly assume that they will do so. In
some circumstances, an individual bringing legal proceedings 
<?notus-xml column=123?>against a local authority may be able to argue that
an authority’s failure to comply with such duties has adversely
affected them, and hence a failure to comply could be subject to a
legal challenge. We will, however, be coming on to debate the role of
the CQC in this context, and I can perhaps elaborate further on our

point. We have had these matters under discussion for quite some time,
and the first three Peers named on the amendment—myself, the
noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross—had a most useful meeting with the Minister and
Norman Lamb from another place on 12 September. There was complete
agreement at that meeting that, if it was at all possible, we wanted to
go forward on the basis of consensus on the matters of advice and
information, and I am sure that that is right. However, I think it fair
to say that we are not quite there yet.</hs_para>

Minister very kindly agreed to share with us his notes for his speech
in reply to the debate this evening in advance so that we could
consider them, because many things that he might want to say are very
relevant to whether we have a picture for advice that really does the
job—sorry to mix the analogies. The Minister fulfilled his kind
promise, but only at 2.41 pm this afternoon, and I have not had a
chance to digest his words, nor to discuss them with my colleagues,
whose names are on the amendment. He also suggested that we should have
further talks if they would be helpful, particularly, he said, between
Report stage days. Clearly we are not considering finished business
here. All I am asking is that there should be agreement from him and
from the House that if either he or we think that an amendment at Third
Reading is appropriate and necessary—it may well not
be—he will not resist it on the grounds that we have thoroughly
debated it. This is open territory and we are trying to find a way
forward. In that way we can avoid any Divisions this evening. I would

do I spend so much time banging on about advice? This is an incredibly
complicated area. The financial products are very complicated, and many
people do not have a natural understanding of them. We all sort of know
what a pension is. How many people, even in this House, know what a
point-of-use care plan policy is? Who would be able to evaluate whether
it was good value for money or bad? There is a large gap in the degree
to which people know and understand the kind of products that can be
involved here and the issues that can
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:43:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000025">There
is not a lot of this advice about, by the way. Some 53% of councils did
not even refer people in care homes them for independent financial
advice. Only 7,000 of the 53,000 self-funders in care homes have had
appropriate financial advice. A point-of-use policy can ensure that
they can go on paying for their care however long they happen to stay
in the home. Their whole lives are at stake, yet hardly more than 10%
have received the financial advice they
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:44:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000026">This
is costly not just to the individual but to the councils. Nearly
one-fifth of self-funders end up falling back on the state to pay. It
costs councils £435 million a year, which is a substantial sum.
Much of this could be avoided if people got appropriate financial
advice. I do not think that this is not common ground
with the Government, but it is, I think, a reason why the
Government need to make absolutely sure that they get it right in what
they
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:44:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

advice has greatly increased as a result of the Dilnot scheme. The
scheme has no stronger supporter than me, except possibly the Minister.
I think it is a very good outcome to a very long and protracted debate.
Nevertheless, it does make a lot of things more complicated. I will
give an example that I gave in an earlier debate. You can apply for
help under the means test and find that you are worse off if you get it
because, although you get a little help under the means test, you lose
attendance allowance if you get any means-tested support at all. I was
amazed when I found that out, and I study this every day. How many
people would know that unless they had the right kind of financial
advice? That could come from citizens advice bureaux if their computer
systems were up to it, but you really want an independent adviser to
help you in the round. I do not think that is very
controversial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:45:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13100969000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000077">6.45

made me wonder why the original clauses in the Bill—and, as I
argued earlier, even the revised clauses—are rather weak. I
think I detected the answer in the Minister’s reply to the
previous debate. What everybody is terribly worried about is a council
saying, “Go and see Jones down the road. He will give you the
right advice.” If that advice later turns out not to be very
good, that person will not sue Jones or go to the Financial Ombudsman
Service; he will sue the council. That seems to me a perfectly
reasonable point. However, at the other end it does not work, either.
It is no good if the council just hands him a list of financial
advisers and says, “Why don’t you ring one of these
chappies if you are not happy?” because that will not cause
people to do it. What we are looking for is not a direction to go and
see X, nor a vague offer that something might be a good idea if he
wanted to do it. We need to nudge people pretty firmly in the direction
of getting financial advice. Of course, any individual is free to say
that they do not want that advice; that would then be their
lookout<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:47:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000029">I
am not sure—and the House will judge when it has heard the
Minister’s remarks—that even now we have cracked the
dilemma of how we nudge. However, many local authorities are making
very good progress in this field—for example, Nottinghamshire
and West Sussex, which we have discussed before—setting up fora
in which the local authority, independent financial advisers, citizens
advice bureaux and the voluntary sector all co-operate and provide a
service to people. Incidentally, some councils are doing this because
they absolutely need to for the benefit of their own budget. A whole
lot of people are moving out of inner London who are self-funders but
who do not have enough money to go on self-funding forever. They will
impose an impossible burden on those councils. The go-ahead ones are
going ahead and the ones who do not like this area are not doing
anything at all. That is why we need more vigour from the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:48:05"></hs_TimeCode> on
this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000030">Furthermore,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:48:15"></hs_TimeCode> am not
convinced that enough is being done to get the regulation system up to
speed. Regulation of advisers in this field was only reluctantly
embraced by the old FSA. I am not sure that the new regime is doing
very much better. I hope that the Government are doing enough to push
it to take this issue seriously. Not enough is going on to make sure 
<?notus-xml column=127?>that enough qualified advisers are coming forward.
It is a very good job for an adviser now that the old ways of making
money by flogging people dodgy investments are becoming increasingly
difficult. This is a very good field and I would advise any reputable
financial adviser with the right knowledge to think seriously about
going into it. It is very satisfying work and can be rewarding.

see here a great shortfall—to which my amendment would be only
one part of the solution, but an important part—between what is
needed and what is actually happening. It is crucial that the House
satisfies itself that the Minister’s department really is
gripping this and not being paralysed in the headlights by thinking,
“Oh, dear, some poor local authority or the Government may get
the blame if this goes wrong”. The whole Dilnot scheme depends
on getting advice right. It is as strong and as simple as that. If it
fails for the lack of dealing with the advice problem, we as a nation,

to be a difference between the Minister and those who supported a
similar amendment to this in Committee is over who should be directly

amendment before us gives the Secretary of State a duty to ensure
through national public awareness campaigns that there is a high level
of public awareness and understanding of the terms and implications of
the cap on the cost of care. In his reply to a similar amendment in
Committee, the Minister simply noted that the Bill as it stands places
a duty on local authorities to provide information and advice,
including on the cap system. In later correspondence, for which I am
very grateful to the Minister, he expanded on the point. He noted that,
first, the funding reforms create a shared interest on the part of
local authorities, government and the financial services industry to
make sure that people are aware of the reforms and have access to the
right information and advice at the right time so that they can plan
and be prepared to meet their care and support needs. Secondly, the
Government want to act in partnership with these key stakeholders to
get this right, building on the effective relationships already
established. Thirdly, the Government are seeking views in a
consultation on the design and technical implementation of the funding
reforms, which includes addressing the best way to proceed to raise
awareness of these reforms nationally and
locally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:59:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

remarks make it clear that there are lots of interested parties in this
communications endeavour, but they entirely overlook the question of
leadership. A campaign as vital as this needs leadership. I maintain
that that leadership can come only from the Secretary of State. Local
authorities, almost by definition, cannot easily lead in any national
sense. As for the financial services industry, it is convinced that the
information campaigns need clear, well defined leadership, and is quite
clear that it cannot come from that industry. Who would believe facts
on the reforms presented by somebody trying to sell you something? In
fact, the ABI has told me that it believes that the public information
initiative should be led by the Government. That is what part 1 of this
amendment would do—give the Secretary of State leadership and
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000036">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>
other areas where the Minister may differ about a communications
campaign are how high to set the bar and how to explicitly make it
plain that it is not just the terms of the reform that have to be
understood but the implications of the terms of the reform. It is not
much good being aware of the facts if you cannot work out what the
facts mean for you. However, the difference over how high to
set the bar for a communication campaign is critical. As the noble
Lord, Lord Hunt, pointed out a moment ago, the Bill states only that
local authorities must establish and maintain a service for providing
information and advice. The Bill does not set any measure for whether
anyone actually receives or understands this information and advice. It
does not set targets of any

them informed calls for a more definite and more regular assessment.
The Minister also felt that the kind of annual survey we proposed might
be very expensive. I have had extensive 
<?notus-xml column=129?>experience of these surveys in business over the
past 20 years and I can reassure the Minister immediately that the kind
of annual survey this amendment proposes would have an essentially
trivial cost. That is why, for the sake of clarity, the amendment makes
reference to a “representative poll of adults”. This kind
of survey would, in fact, cost very little, would be very easy to
administer and would be exceptionally quick in delivering
results.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13100969000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000039">I

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, I fully endorse what my two esteemed
colleagues said regarding the need for appropriate financial advice. I
am still of the opinion that people should be referred to regulated
advisers, who are best placed to advise them on the full range of
solutions open to them. However, to avoid repetition, I will briefly
concentrate on the paragraph in Amendment 20 dealing with other areas
of concern about which we have already talked in some depth such as
housing. People with specific medical conditions and complex needs are
reliant on suitable housing provision. We should also not forget the
needs of their carers in this regard. The local authority will need to
engage with agencies and organisations such as the CABs and Age UK in
an integrated way. This should be part of providing a relevant local
advice and information
envelope.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000041">Plainly,
there is no point in getting appropriate financial advice if, through
no fault of the adviser, faithfully following that advice cannot be
guaranteed to lead to good care outcomes. Those outcomes may be
consequent upon ensuring that things such as the suitability of the
individual’s housing and accommodation are included in any wider
fact finding conducted by the local authority alongside any care or
financial assessments it performs. That housing suitability will
probably depend on the complexity of the care package that the
individual’s needs disclose. Those needs will probably derive
directly from the specific set of conditions and symptoms that the
individual
faces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000042">No one
would expect a local authority to be familiar with every possible
combination of health and social circumstances that an individual may
face, which is why close working alongside local agencies and
organisations such as the CABs and Age UK in assuring the existence of
a complete, competent advice and information envelope is so important.
Indeed, it is my firm view that the quality of that integrated approach
to care management may well be the key determinant on which successful
outcomes depend. I urge the Minister to adopt our amendment, as we
believe that it would go a long way to ensure more effective and
efficient outcomes for both the service user and the

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of the
Association of Professional Financial Advisers. One of the areas that
regulated financial advisers are most concerned about is that they
should be able to do the job that they are there for. I am concerned
that recent “reforms” have meant that there are fewer
people available to give advice and fewer people getting advice. One of
our problems is that this means that people get bad advice. They say
something to their friend round the corner, or somebody says “I
think so-and-so’s OK”, or they have read something in the
newspaper. One of our difficulties here is that the perfect gets in the
way of the good. People are frightened to say things like, “here
is a list of people” or “here is somebody I have
used”, in case they then incur some kind of responsibility. Yet
if we do not help people to find someone who can give them advice, the
very people who most need advice do not get it. I am concerned that
this is becoming almost a social problem in the sense that those who
are best off and least need advice get the best advice while those who
are less well off and need advice do not get it because we have got
ourselves into this
mess.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000045">I am not
in a position to say that this or that amendment is ideal, but I hope
the Minister will accept that, in today’s circumstances, unless
we give clarity to people and make it relatively easy and simple for
them to go to get advice, they will not go and will not be able
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000046">I have two
more short points to make. First, we have concentrated on the
simplicity of the advice when you get it, which seems to me to be the
wrong place. It is the simplicity of getting the advice that really
matters. Very often, the advice that is given may not be all that
simple, because the circumstances may not be all that simple, but if
the simplicity of getting the advice is right then it can be moved
through more
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000047">Secondly,
in considering these amendments and, indeed the Bill—at this
stage and going forward—I hope the Minister will realise that
one of the problems about seeking advice is that the language used is
incomprehensible to anybody but the professional. I find this
embarrassing: I once sat on an FSA committee designed to try to make
more people more financially literate and spent my whole time asking
superior people in the finance world to explain to me what they meant.
I discovered that they did not always know what they meant. There is a
sort of language which is used and batted backwards and forwards
between these people. There is a terrible fallout in this. I remember
that a friend of mine was asked for advice—not about finance,
but about how to buy a theatre ticket—by a man had never gone to
the theatre before but whose wife wanted to go to something. She
explained and dealt with it but a friend of hers said, very
superiorly: “Of course everybody knows how to buy a theatre
ticket”. My friend asked, very simply: “Could you buy a
football ticket”?</hs_para>

problems, so I hope we can try to do this in a way which is

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to support this amendment and,
particularly, to talk about the first two prongs of it. I do this
partly from my experience as a member of the Dilnot commission. I
remind the House what that commission said on the subject of an
awareness campaign. We made only 10 recommendations, one of which was a
very strong one because we had been incredibly depressed by the
evidence given about people’s understanding of the present
system, let alone the new one. When you have 60% of the population
thinking that social care is provided by the NHS, you have a bit of a
problem explaining to people how the system operates. Since they have
not even mastered the existing system, you have to make a
really big effort to get across some of the messages about the changes
to it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100969000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100969000050">You
could argue that it is a bit like Africa: if you have never had a

three sentences were worked over very carefully and we said exactly
what we meant on those issues. We said them as strongly as that because
we thought that, to some extent, the success or failure of the changes
encompassed in the Bill depend on that awareness campaign. I have not
seen the Minister’s reply, but I have a suspicion—because
I know how health Ministers get briefed—that there will be
something about how this is not appropriate stuff to put in the Bill. I
can see that there is some strength in that argument but if we are not
to put it in the Bill then the Minister has got to start to tell us, in
detail, what the Government are going to do.</hs_parafo>

more than two years to think about this. We were made to produce a
report very quickly indeed: within 12 months. It is now more than two
years since it was produced and I should have thought we could expect a
reasonably detailed plan from the Department of Health about how it is
actually going to make the public aware. It would be nice if the
Minister accepted the amendment, but if he is not going to, we need to
know: where is the budgetary provision for the awareness campaign; what
work has been done on the selection of people to help run the campaign;
when it will start and how long it will go on for. How much are you
going to pay for this? Do you accept the idea that all good awareness
campaigns have some kind of follow-up arrangements? The noble Lord,
Lord Sharkey, has suggested an annual survey and I would not disagree
with that. As he rightly said, these surveys are, from my experience,
relatively cheap to do. Given the sums of money we are talking about in
the Bill, this would be a very modest thing to do and there is
certainly no point in having an awareness campaign if you are not going
to check up whether there has been any increase in awareness.</hs_para>

to the second prong, which we have already talked a little bit about
under the previous group of amendments. I strongly support what my
noble friend Lord Lipsey said, and I want to return to the issue of
mis-selling. We have had some serious problems in this country about
the way the public has been sold financial products and we ought to be
able to learn from history over that. It is not any old Tom, Dick and
Harry who can give sensible advice to people about complex financial
issues. The noble Lord, Lord Deben, is right: many of these issues are
complex and you need a simple system to get to the advice, but the
advice is not always going to be

with the sort of circumstances that families and older people may be
faced with. It is fairly common that an older person is going to give
up their house; their spouse has died and they will have to give up the
house. The family might well want to have a conference about what they
do with that house. There are several options: they could keep the
house and rent it for income; they could go for equity release; they
could go for deferred payments; or they could go for a point of care
plan, as my noble friend said. Choosing the best thing to do from some
of those options is not straightforward; it will require someone who
knows their way around some of these issues and can give advice to
people and their families on how to make a sensible, good decision that
fits their particular circumstances. The Government have to give more
consideration to
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T19:10:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

issue will be complicated and there could be some circumstances in
which the financial advice does not need to be given by a regulated
financial adviser. However, the Government now have to do the legwork
on separating the sort of situations where regulated financial advice
is needed from those where one can be more relaxed about it. If we do
not give guidance of some standing and credibility to local
authorities, we put them in an invidious position because they will be
damned if they do and damned if they do not. They need some advice on
the sorts of circumstances in which they, to discharge their
obligations under the terms of this piece of legislation, can point
people clearly in the direction of advice that is likely to be

a point to the noble Earl about the Secretary of State’s new
obligation under government Amendment 138 to have regard to the local
authority’s requirement in Clause 1 to promote well-being. The
Secretary of State is now pretty much in the same position as that of
the local authority when he is producing guidance and regulations. It
is at least an arguable case that he would not be fulfilling that
requirement unless he put in place some credible arrangements for sound
financial advice being given to people and he helped the public to
understand the details of the arrangements of the new scheme that the
Government were implementing. I am not a lawyer, but it would be worth
a punt by going to lawyers to 
<?notus-xml column=133?>argue that the Secretary of State would be in breach

complex indeed. They also find the system of social care funding to be
complex. How much more complex will it be when the Dilnot provisions in
the Bill are introduced? My noble friend made the point that many
people misunderstand the current system. Many people think that social
care is free at the point of use until they suddenly reach a situation
where either they or their relatives are faced with catastrophic issues
around long-term care. Even in relation to Dilnot, my noble friend Lord
Lipsey pointed out in Committee that many people think there is this
cap of £72,000 but, as we know, it is much more complex than
that. The £72,000 cap is based on the fee that the local
authority will pay for people who are not self-funded, but we know that
self-funders, in essence, subsidise those who go into care that is in
one way or another funded by the local authority because they meet the
means-test requirements. Of course it is not free because there then
have to be hotel costs, which Dilnot estimated to be about
£12,000 a year. This matter is therefore very complex and many

struck by a report produced two or three weeks ago by the Association
of British Insurers, which looked at annuities. The range of rates of
return for annuities is quite extraordinary. The ABI figures showed
that people who fail to take advice or shop around for their annuity
are settling for retirement incomes that in some cases are nearly a
third lower than those they could receive from the best deal. Indeed,
the new rates published by the ABI show that the best conventional
annuity pays out 31% more than the worst, equating to a
difference of more than £1,400 a year in retirement income for a
£100,000 pension. The gap between the best and the worst is up

into which they are paying their money but shopped around. However, the
evidence seems to be that the public in general find annuities
difficult to work with. If people cannot find their way around the

it is necessary. It is not necessary, for one thing, because we are
already building a partnership without legislation. We have embarked
upon a joint programme with local government to implement the reforms,
and I can assure my noble friend Lord Sharkey, and the noble Lord, Lord
Warner, in particular, that awareness-raising will be a part of this.
We are engaging with the voluntary sector, care providers and the
financial services industry to make sure that we all play our part in
communicating these reforms effectively. It is a joint effort and a
joint

limb of the amendment, the Government are not convinced that it is
proportionate to require the Secretary of State to conduct a poll and
publish a subsequent annual report on awareness of the capped costs

of the reforms and the Government have committed to conduct
post-legislative scrutiny of all new legislation. Moreover, recognising
the need to improve data on public understanding of care and support,
we have also taken steps to develop and include new survey questions
for the annual Health Survey for England. The new questions will be
used to monitor and track public awareness over time. If questions are
included, fieldwork will be conducted throughout 2014, and the report
will be published at the end of 2015. These data would provide us with
a baseline against which we can evaluate changes in public awareness.
The survey is conducted annually, so there is scope to include the
questions in subsequent years. Additionally, there are already
questions in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing—
ELSA—which capture public awareness of care and support and
expectations of how it is funded. Some data are already available and
the next set will be available at the start of 2016. Together, these
steps will inform the ongoing implementation and policy development
process that will take place in the years to come. I hope that is

noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, emphasised the importance of people
understanding the various products that are available. We agree that,
in some instances where someone is considering a financial product such
as a care annuity, financial advice should be regulated through the
Financial Conduct Authority. However, there are many sources of
valuable financial advice that do not need to be regulated and can be
provided free of charge—such as advice on managing money from
the citizens advice bureaux or from the Money Advice Service. In
addition, the fact that financial advice is regulated does not mean
that it is appropriate for care and support purposes. Very few
regulated financial advisers currently have a qualification or expert
knowledge of care and support, though we hope that this sector will
develop over the coming 
<?notus-xml column=136?>months and years. In this context, the term “independent

the comments of the noble Lord, I took it that he accepted that it
would be inappropriate to require local authorities to make direct
referrals where, for the most part, they do not possess the necessary
expertise to judge between advisers. Requiring them to do so would
present a significant burden and could result in a local authority
making an unnecessary or inappropriate referral. There is the further
risk that a referral leading to poor advice could be seen as the fault
of the local authority, a point he acknowledged, bringing yet more of a
burden of responsibility in increased disputes, and even legal
challenge. We believe that the decision to take up financial advice, of
whatever form, and the choice of adviser, should belong to the

for the positive things that he said from which we can draw
encouragement. I was particularly pleased to hear him talk about the
national role of the department in information provision and confirm
that there will be campaigns around landmarks in the Dilnot report to
carry that forward. Equally, there are some things on which, if I may
say so, he still is not quite there. Nobody advocates direct
referrals—nobody. I accept his argument—everybody
does—that you cannot just send people to say, “You have
to go and see so and so”, or, “So and so is your
man”. The other extreme is to say that you do nothing. You
provide, for 
<?notus-xml column=137?>example, a list of suitably qualified advisers within the local
authority area; you tell people how to get hold of them. We should not
set up straw men, whom nobody is advocating, in order to fend off

things the Minister said would be valuable to follow up in writing. I
am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, will agree with me that it
would be fascinating to see the monitoring suggestions as a substitute
for the poll that he suggested, because if they work, that is fine and
we will not press it, but if they seem to fall short, that would be
different. I think that there will be room to ask the Minister for
further discussions with the movers of this amendment so that we can
narrow even further the ground before us. I do not pretend to be fully
satisfied as I stand here tonight. I gave my reasons earlier why I do
not think that the Government’s amendments to the Bill complete
the picture, but we are making progress, as we all want to, and we are
having a good dialogue. With the Minister’s help, I want to
carry that forward before Third Reading, at which stage we will see

Corston (Lab):</B> My Lords, in opening this debate, which seeks the
Government’s response to the European Union Committee report on
the workload of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is
important to stress at the outset that the Justice,
Institutions and Consumer Protection Sub-Committee, which I have the
honour to chair, has been interested for some time in the operation of
the CJEU. In 2011, the sub-committee carried out an inquiry under the 
<?notus-xml column=138?>excellent chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, into the
workload of the Court of Justice and produced a report in April of that
year. Among other things, the sub-committee recommended that the number
of advocates-general appointed to the Court of Justice should be
increased; the General Court should consider establishing specialist
chambers; and, most significantly, that the number of judges appointed
to the General Court should be increased in order for the court to deal
with its workload efficiently and to speed up
proceedings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100975000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000023">Shortly
after the report was published, the president of the CJEU put forward a
series of proposals designed to increase the efficiency of the court.
Most notable were the proposals to increase the number of judges in the
General Court by 12 in order to tackle the increasing number of pending
cases before the court. The Commission thought that increasing the
number of judges in the General Court would be the only possible
solution to the court’s workload problems, stating
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13100975000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000065">“only
by immediately increasing the number of judges . . . will it be
possible to stem the flow of new cases and effectively tackle the
backlog of cases”.</hs_quotefo>

generally agreed that the number of judges ought to be increased.
However, agreement proved elusive, principally over the method for
appointing the additional judges. In May 2012, the aspects of the
president’s proposal dealing with increasing the General
Court’s judiciary were dropped in order to facilitate agreement
by the member states to the other parts of his
proposals.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13100975000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000024">Subsequently,
a Friends of the Presidency Group was established by the Council,
comprising representatives from all member states with a view to
examining the case for increasing the number of judges in the
General Court. However, the group failed to reach any conclusions and
the presidency put forward a proposal for consideration at the General
Affairs Council on 11 December 2012 which included the
appointment of nine additional judges appointed through a rotation
system. The proposal was rejected by the member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100975000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000025">At
this point, the sub-committee decided to conduct a follow-up inquiry to
determine whether the adopted proposals were having an impact on the
workload of the court and whether there was still a case for increasing
the number of advocates-general in the Court of Justice and increasing
the number of judges in the General Court. The sub-committee wrote to
the witnesses who had participated in the original inquiry and asked
them to provide written evidence. Evidence was also heard from the
Minister for Europe, the right honourable Mr David Lidington, in March.
Shortly after we published our call for evidence, the CJEU requested
that the number of advocates-general be increased by three, and after
debates in both Houses of Parliament, as required by the European Union
Act 2011, the proposal was agreed by the Council on 25 June. The first
of the new advocates-general will be from Poland and is due to take up
the post shortly. In line with the existing rotation, the other two
will be of Czech and Danish nationality. They will take up their posts
in October 2015.</hs_para>

we concluded that there was still a case for increasing the number of
judges to the General Court. The latest statistics from the court
indicate that there has been a reduction in the number of pending cases
due to a fall in the number of new cases. The average time that it
takes the General Court to dispose of a case has fallen by 1.9 months
to 24.8 months. The sub-committee welcomed the decrease in the number
of new cases but considered it a temporary respite. It argued that
little could be inferred from the decrease in the number of new cases
brought before the court as the long-term trend was clearly upwards.
The sub-committee called on the Government to make the case strongly in
discussions with member states to increase the number of judges and to
urge member states to find a system of appointment of additional judges
that safeguards the stability of the court and the quality of the
judiciary. The Government responded to our follow-up report in July.
They agreed with most of the conclusions in the report and appeared to
be more positive about appointing additional judges to the General
Court as a means to deal with the court’s backlog of cases. They
also seemed to favour a merit-based selection process to appoint
additional judges. The Commission also agreed with the follow-up
report’s conclusions. It stated that “an overwhelming
majority” of member states and MEPs supported the appointment of
more judges to the General Court. However, the Commission cautioned
that it is up to the member states to agree, by what is called
“common accord”, a method for appointing additional
judges.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100975000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000027">Given
the inability of member states to reach agreement on a method for the
appointment of additional judges to the General Court, the Commission
appears to have lost interest in the issue for the time being. However,

committee, continues to push for an increase in the number of judges.
In June 2013, it agreed a report on the draft regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council amending the Protocol on the

Bowness (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to do little more tonight
than support the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, in her plea to the
Government for answers to those questions and particularly that they
ensure that additional judges are indeed appointed to the General Court
as soon as possible. As the noble Baroness has told the House, the
committee concluded that this was necessary some time ago while I had
the pleasure of serving on that committee and nothing, to my knowledge,
has changed. I am pleased to say that, from the Government’s
response to the follow-up report, they now appear to agree that the
case for increasing the number of judges has been well made. If that is
indeed the case, I am pleased that they have been converted to
the idea. As I have said on previous occasions, I trust that
resources will not again be considered the
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100975000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000031">A
robust functioning legal system is invaluable. The rule of law in the
widest sense is perhaps the greatest bulwark against bad government,
and preserving the quality and effectiveness of the European Court
system is important. The court is a vital institution for the proper
functioning of the Union. Without the court we have nothing to buttress
the operation of the single market which is so much more complicated
than a trade deal and is, we are told and all agree, essential for our
interests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100975000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000032">The
question of resources should be put in the context of the sums
involved. From an overall EU budget of the cost of the court is just
over 0.25%. It is difficult to know how much the United Kingdom
contributes to that because statistics do not give a breakdown.
However, on the basis that we contribute something like 11.5% of our

be £32 million.</hs_para>

a number of aspects. That is disappointing to the observers of the
general scene in Europe. I hope that 
<?notus-xml column=142?>that attitude will change over time. The Government face enormous

European Union, by the beginning of December next year, will undertake
a much greater, with widespread consent and enthusiasm, and will need
extra resources. Although there was a temporary dip, the workload is
already showing signs of renewed increase and that will become a major
element of its work in future as it deals with all aspects under the
treaties—the contents of the two main treaties and dealing
principally with the single market and all the things of greater
complexity that flow from that as time goes on. One thinks of all the
possible cases that will arise over trade marks, patents and
intellectual property, as well as more mundane disputes that will arise
between corporations, and between Governments and corporations in
different member states, as the single market develops. There is still
a lot of work to be done in the single market context. People tend to
think that it is mostly completed, but that really is not true; it is
an ongoing situation and the Court of Justice is going to be a vital
part of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100975000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100975000042">On the
Government’s side, there seems to be a psychological reluctance
to show any enthusiasm for these matters at all, which is a great pity.
I am sure that that view is shared be members of the main European
Union Select Committee, of all parties and backgrounds, as well as the
sub-committees. Although scrutiny means the right to be critical about
things that are either manifestly not in our national interest or
against the practical interest of a particular piece of policy
formation or political decision, the general picture should be more
positive. As my noble friend Lord Bowness quite rightly said, the
amount of money involved in making sure that this court works
efficiently and properly on an expanded basis with additional
judges—who, I personally hope, will be chosen on their merits,
as has already been enunciated; we thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Corston, for her opening remarks—is so miniscule as to be within
any of the foreseeable elements of the European Union budget totals
anyway. I think I am right in saying that year in, year out, the actual

this is the fourth time in the past two years that I, as European
spokesman for the Opposition, have had to speak on this matter. I
cannot think of any European topic on which we have had so many
debates, other than our membership of the EU itself. Some people might
say that to have four debates on the European Court of Justice in the
space of two years shows that the House of Lords has got its priorities
wrong in timetabling its business. That may be a true general point but
in this case it actually demonstrates the persistence of your
Lordships’ European Union Committee and the quality and
commitment of its members to see that its recommendations are acted on
by the Government. The noble Baroness, Lady Corston, and the noble

in all these three areas progress will be very dependent on the
court and its judgments. The digital area is full of competing vested
interests. The energy area is full of strong national incumbent
companies that want to hang on to their monopoly positions. We had the
services directive in 2005 and there has been a great deal of
foot-dragging by some member states in its implementation. If you are

difficulty of fundamental importance to the Government’s

to have a more efficient European Commission that does not
over-regulate, we have to get away from every member state having a
commissioner of its own, each with a portfolio of their own. That
inevitably results in an extension of European action. We want a much
more focused Commission. At the very minimum, there has to be some
system of senior and junior commissioners. The equality of member

if the costs of Europe are to be cut, it is absurd that there is a
Court of Auditors in which every member state has an auditor with their

the principle of every member state having its own person. The question
of reconstituting the court on a basis where not every member state
gets an additional judge is at the heart of the reform agenda for
Brussels. It is a fundamental point. The Government have to seize this

functioning European Court is in the interests of all EU member states.
I accept the view of the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, that it is in our
national interest too. The Government have
consistently supported efforts 
<?notus-xml column=146?>to reform the court to uphold the integrity of EU
law and to increase the capacity and efficiency of the court. We all
benefit from effective EU law—including British businesses
operating within the single market. I accept the views of the noble
Lord, Lord Liddle, on that. In evaluating any proposed reforms, the UK
has been keen to ensure a number of things. First, reform should
promote the effective passage of justice. Secondly, it should be based
on clear evidence of need. Thirdly, it should not place additional
burdens on the EU’s budget. Fourthly, it should avoid full-scale
treaty change; and fifthly, it should be acceptable to
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100980000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100980000012">Since
the European sub-committee’s initial report in 2011, several
useful reforms have been implemented. These include increasing the
number of judges in the Grand Chamber from 13 to 15; streamlining
procedures by, for example, abolishing the requirement to read the
report for the hearing in full; allowing for the appointment of
temporary judges to the Civil Service Tribunal and establishing
a new office of vice-president in the Court of Justice and the General
Court. In the debate of 23 July 2012, when this House agreed to support
these changes, my noble friend Lord Howell noted that they were fairly
modest. The Government agree that their impact on the processing speed
of the court is also likely to be modest. However, we believe that even
a modest impact is to be welcomed. Given that these measures came into
effect only towards the end of last year, it is too early to assess
their substantive impact. We will monitor their effect over the coming
months.</hs_para>

substantive reforms, your Lordships will remember that earlier this
year, the Government received the approval of both Houses to agree to
increase the number of advocates-general at the Court of Justice to
nine from 1 July 2013, and to 11 from 7 October 2015. The
Government share the belief of the sub-committee that this reform will
help the court to handle cases more quickly and improve the quality of
decision-making. At the Council of Ministers’ meeting in June,
the Government agreed to this reform. We expect the first of these
additional appointments—a permanent Polish
advocate-general—to be made soon. This appointment will bring
Poland into line with the other “Big Six” member states,
including the UK, all of which have permanent advocates-general. The
two other additional advocates-general will increase the existing
rotation system from three to five. Under the current
arrangements, we expect that the first two, due to be appointed in
October 2015, will be Czech and
Danish.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100980000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100980000014">In its
request, the court sought to have the first additional advocate-general
in post from 1 July 2013. Since this request was made only on 16
January 2013, and as the Council agreed to it only in June, this was
always an ambitious timetable. The Poles estimate that their nomination
process will take four months. We therefore expect that we will shortly
be presented with the Polish nomination. The court and other member
states are keen for the Polish advocate-general to be in post as soon
as possible. The UK therefore stands ready to approve any suitable
candidate.</hs_para>

the General Court. These negotiations have continued since March 2011,
and still seem some way from a successful conclusion. While there is a
case to be made for additional judicial appointments, the questions of
how many more judges there should be, and how they should be appointed,
remain open; as does the question of cost-effectiveness. In particular,
the debate on selection method has reached an impasse. The political

response to the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, the Government believe
that increasing the number of judges in the General Court could form

details still need to be worked out, and many states have strong
objections in principle. That said, we are encouraged by President
Skouris’ comments on the benefits and feasibility of a

economic climate, there is an imperative on all the EU’s

been clear throughout that any additional advocates-general or
additional General Court judges should not result in an increase to the
EU’s budgetary demands. We believe that the relatively small
additional financial pressures of appointing the advocates-general can
be met from within the court’s existing budget, which was more
than €354 million for 2013, and which the court has underspent
in previous years. When we agreed to these appointments at the Council
of Ministers meeting of 25 June, we submitted a statement noting this
expectation. Likewise, we will continue to emphasise that any
additional reform costs must not create pressure for an increase in the
EU’s administrative budget. During discussions on the annual
budgetary framework next year, we,

Meacher (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I will also speak to Amendments 25
and 26 in this group and acknowledge the Government’s Amendments
24 and 27, which I will mention later. I start with
Amendments 22 and 25. As many noble Lords have said, the
Care Bill has the potential very significantly to improve the care of
elderly and disabled people. However, there is also 
<?notus-xml column=149?>the possibility that only a part of that potential will be realised,
particularly in the face of significant cuts to local authority
budgets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 22 therefore places in the Bill a requirement for there to be
regulations about how services are commissioned to ensure that they
offer at least a sufficient level of quality to the individual.
Amendment 25 ensures that home visits are not normally commissioned for
less than 30 minutes. The amendments provide for a service of at least
minimum quality, as I said, which will ensure the dignity of each
elderly or disabled person. They also allow flexibility—which is
important—for short visits, for example for the delivery of a
meal or for giving an injection, and also for longer visits.</hs_para>

became very clear to me when I met the director of the Bikur Cholim
social care organisation, which has been in operation for many years
looking after people in the Jewish community. The director told me that
for a disabled, doubly-incontinent client, a morning visit cannot be
completed in less than one hour. Dealing with the
incontinence—and one does not want to go into too much detail
about that—can be time consuming. A bath or shower is essential
for a doubly-incontinent person; they need a change of clothes,
possibly a change of sheets, to have food provided and help to get
dressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100980000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100980000026">When
you think about all that, it is fairly obvious that you could not
possibly do it in half an hour. However, in our financial context there
is an increasing tendency to commission ever-shorter home visits, many
lasting only 15 minutes, as has been well publicised on the
“Today” programme twice this week. Indeed, a survey by
the UK Homecare Association found that one in 10 visits already last
only 15 minutes and the proportion of 15-minute visits has increased by
17% over the past five

Disability has seen tenders for visits of only 10 minutes and,
according to the person on the “Today” programme, these
carers tend to take 10 minutes to take off what they describe as
“their hat and coat”. I am quite curious about carers
arriving in a hat and coat, but there we go. It means they would then
have to shoot out of the door without their hat and coat. The mind
boggles. This is a very serious issue and a tragic quote from a
disabled client makes the point better than I can: “By the time
they have got me to the commode and helped me to change, the time is
up. I end up choosing between getting my meal prepared or having my
commode emptied. Do I get a drink or do I go to the
toilet?”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100980000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100980000028">Imagine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:29:59"></hs_TimeCode>
having to make those kinds of choices. The public do not support
depriving elderly and disabled people of a dignified service. Some 96%
are critical of these very short visits for personal care; people
understand about an injection, I think. Will the Minister clarify on
the Floor of the House that a visit to deliver personal care,
including, as it will inevitably, dressing, taking the client to the
toilet or bathing, within a timeframe of 15 minutes is simply
impossible and always will be. Therefore, one can say something pretty
firm about it.</hs_para>

of the carers too, workers complain that they have had to stay longer
than 15 minutes in almost every visit, even though they are
paid only for 15 minutes and they are not paid for their travel 
<?notus-xml column=150?>time either. As one said, “You just cannot possibly do this job
in that length of time”. The question is whether we are giving
sufficient priority to elderly and disabled people living at home. I
think we have to answer, “Surely not”. The Minister,
Norman Lamb, has very publicly criticised 15-minute personal care
visits, but there is nothing in the Bill to prevent this practice from
continuing and, indeed, from spreading further. The government
amendments do not really tackle the problem, although I know that the
Minister always tries very hard to do what he can. He will be aware of
the 2,000 plus e-mails that have landed—not necessarily on his
desk but in the office—within the past few days expressing
concerns about this issue. It has concerned people very

Masham of Ilton (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 22 but
am concerned about Amendment 25. Is it wise to mention 30 minutes? I
declare an interest as president of a spinal injuries association. Some
of our members have broken their necks and are paralysed from their
neck down. To get a paralysed person up, to do an evacuation of their
bowels and to wash and dress them, using a hoist, might take at least
three hours. Surely it is better to stress the individual’s
needs rather than to set in stone half an hour. Providers of care may
use that as a
marker<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:42:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recently been in the headlines, is totally ridiculous. Having the
choice of whether a carer takes someone to the lavatory or gives them a
drink is unacceptable. If stress is put on the carer who cannot do the
job in that time, they will leave and not do the job at all. The person
needing care is left in a dangerous position if adequate care is not
given. The amendments need to be flexible and aimed at an
individual’s personal needs. I hope very much that the Minister
will look at this and will do something to make it
acceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Greengross (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I was the lead commissioner at
the Equality and Human Rights Commission during a big inquiry looking
at home care for older, frail people. We found that half of the people
receiving such care were satisfied with it. Half were not. Mostly, the
complaints were about breaches of their human rights. This is a
terrible indictment of our care system: to be able to say that because
of the care that is regularly given to people, their human rights are
breached is absolutely unacceptable.</hs_para>

Disability discovered this week, is going up: 60% of local authorities
commission them and the number has risen by 17% in the past five years.
I do not want to delay colleagues in the House for very long; it is
just that you cannot do the sorts of jobs that the majority of people
need in 15 minutes. Of course, one needs flexibility: to give somebody
a 
<?notus-xml column=152?>dose of medicine does not take very long, but to
really care for someone, which involves all the tasks that the noble
Baroness, Lady Meacher, mentioned so lucidly and clearly, takes much
longer. We need some way in the Bill of making absolutely sure that
this cannot continue. It is absolutely disgraceful that we have to have

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, on reading carefully
the amendments in the name of the Minister, I hope that he will be able
to provide reassurance that his amendments will go further than
Amendments 22 and 25 to which I have added my name and that
they will be much more about the whole person and the whole
person’s needs. I recognise that there are dangers in putting a
timeframe around anything; there is the danger that it will be used as
a so-called minimum standard, down to which people will drop. I
initially wanted to support these amendments and I suppose, if I had a
choice, I would have added my name to those of the Minister now,
because there is a real problem if care is not adequate in quality and
promoting well-being in that it creates dependency rather than
reablement towards increasing independence. There is a sense of
personal worth that goes along with being able to do things, however
slowly, rather than having to accept somebody doing them for you
because they are in a terrible rush. I hope that the Minister will
provide us with a much wider reassurance than the words suggest at

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I was most interested
to hear the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and I agreed
with every word, but I do think the time limit specified would not be
right and I strongly support Amendment 27. However, there are other
aspects of this care issue that we have not really thought
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000007">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:49:33"></hs_TimeCode>
that is covered in Amendment 27 is about the well-being of carers. I
find it very disturbing that a woman I know who lives in with a person
needing pretty comprehensive care every Saturday and Sunday and stays
overnight on both nights, is appallingly paid for this because she is
self-employed. I said to her that I could not believe she was earning
so little when it is such a very important job and so very time
consuming. I told her I would look on the internet to see what she is
entitled to as a minimum wage. It turns out that there is no minimum
wage for a self-employed person. That quite stunned me; there is a
great reservoir of people who would be willing to take on self-employed
caring positions and do them for quite long periods, not rushing
people, but not at her rate of pay, which worked out at a little over
£2 an hour for all the hours she was there. I suggested that,
since she had done training in care, she should work instead for the
people who provide a service for the local authority. She followed that
up and it turned out that she would not earn much more, because they
are not paid for travelling time. Unless the organisation improved so
that her two, three, four or 10 jobs—whatever it is—were
almost next door to one another, the unpaid travelling time would
constitute much more of her day than the time actually caring for
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, is that it is
more than just physical care. We have heard much in recent days about
people’s extreme loneliness, how they can go almost for days
with hardly a word with anyone. That is a most essential thing in life,
to feel that you have not been abandoned. The woman in the television
report talked about taking your coat off, making your booking and going
through it all, and how you are left with 10 minutes in the middle and
then you book in a final 10 minutes to reverse everything. That is
exactly what I remember from when I was chairman of local social
services 30 years ago; that was exactly the same problem
then.</hs_para>

are not new problems; because there are so many more older people who
need more care, and there is more awareness, with people wanting to
stay in their own homes, this problem has grown, and we do not have the
solutions to match the need. I strongly support the emphasis on the
well-being of carers, which is mentioned in Amendment 27—that is
important. People should feel that they are doing a worthwhile job and
that what they are doing is helping other people. They should also be
reasonably remunerated for it. There is so much that we would all
support; I feel that all noble Lords in this Chamber
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>want
to see more help and more efficiently used help.

Emerton (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I apologise for not having heard
the first part of the speech made by my noble friend Lady Meacher; I
can only say how much I agree with her. In the past nine weeks, while
the carer was away, I had the personal experience of doing two
weeks’ full-time caring. I timed waking up, giving the
medication, getting breakfast, rushing up to do my post while she was
having her breakfast, and then attending to her personal care and
getting her dressed. It took an hour and a half, every day, and that
was just the
morning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T20:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000011">On
the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, the minimum quality
standards in the noble Earl’s amendment set a good standard.
However, that needs to be supported by an assessment and care
programme. There needs to be a proper assessment of what is required in
terms of the total care, not just the minimum. We have a system for
some of our residents in the retirement development where I live, where
prevention to admission to hospital is done by an assessment of how
much time care is required. Two people come from the
unit—a nurse and a physiotherapist—and fully assess the
patient. If there is a proper care programme, that gives the time
element. Amendment 25 says “excluding travel time” and
that a visit should not take less than 30 minutes. It is difficult to
be so prescriptive, but if that was according to the care plan, it
might go a long

Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 151 is in

our debates about the quality of care that is being given to many

way in which care workers themselves are treated. I very much agree

I will quote one or two statistics from it. In this survey, 79.1% of

£8 per hour. The majority do not get set wages. Their turnover
is very high: 57.8% of those surveyed were not paid for travelling time

that employers ought to be banned from insisting that zero-hour

issue of how care workers are treated and employed is directly linked
to the arguments of the noble Baronesses, Lady Meacher and Lady
Greengross, about 15-minute care visits. There is no doubt that there
is widespread concern about the impact of local authorities setting
what can seem to many to be arbitrary limits in the time allowed for
care. I do not necessarily go along with the amendment sponsored by the
Leonard Cheshire organisation, but the argument that it raises about
care workers being asked to provide personal care, including supporting
service users to dress, bathe, eat and go to the bathroom in a
timeframe that simply does not allow dignity or respect, seems
powerful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000016">Equally,
I have noted the comments of the president of the Association of
Directors of Adult Social Services, who cautions against taking a
broad-brush approach in terms of the time that should be given to each
client. The association agrees with Leonard Cheshire Disability that 15
minutes is not long enough to allow some homecare tasks to be done, but
it says that there is need for some flexible and truly personal
approach, so that each person can be assessed and provided with the
appropriate care. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, made a powerful
point that if one seeks to place in legislation a minimum number of
minutes, the risk is that it would not meet some people’s needs.
However, the problem is that if one starts to define it in legislation,
it might become the maximum. That seems to be one of the great
dangers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000017">That

regulations when there were unsatisfactory employment practices. I
deliberately drew that amendment widely, because I do not think that we

I like about Amendment 151, in the name of my noble friend, is that it

permitted a word before the end of the debate. I supported these

though I take the points that have been made about being too
prescriptive about time limits in Amendment 25. I think the essential
point is that the Bill introduces a number of important new duties and
responsibilities designed to enshrine the right values at the heart of
our care system—for example, the primacy of the well-being of
the individual. However, these values are only as good as the services
that are put in place to give effect to them. It is not enough simply
to put empty principles into legislation. The Bill needs to contain

no assurance that the practice of commissioning very short personal

producing regulations that set out in greater detail what should count
as quality commissioning. From those points of view, I still feel that

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by
thanking noble Lords for the excellent debates that we have had on
these topics in Committee and again this evening. As the report by
Leonard Cheshire Disability highlighted earlier this week, we need to
move away from overly prescriptive commissioning, which focuses on
price and time slots, to consider how local authorities can deliver
better outcomes and quality care. I therefore fully agree with the
principles behind the amendments that noble Lords have tabled with
regard to poor local authority commissioning practices. Of course,
noble Lords will be aware that Clause 5 requires local authorities to
promote a market in high-quality services and specifically requires
authorities to consider this duty when arranging services to meet
people’s needs. This would make it very difficult for local
authorities to commission services in 15-minute slots where doing so
undermines the quality of those
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000031">Clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:09:52"></hs_TimeCode>
5 also requires local authorities, in fulfilling this duty, to have
regard to the need to ensure there are sufficient services available to
meet people’s needs. With regard to Amendment 26, it is
important to recognise that local authorities can achieve this only
through working with providers in their area. We therefore do not
believe that it would be appropriate to require local authorities to
ensure sufficiency of services independently. This could lead to local
authorities finding themselves forced into providing services where a
market had not developed otherwise. Therefore,  
<?notus-xml column=158?>I cannot support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness. She asked
me to clarify what “having regard to something” means.
Where that duty is present, it is not something that local authorities
are able to ignore. In other words, if they have to have regard to a
particular thing, that is not something they can disregard. Rather, the
clause as drafted is intended to recognise, as I have said, that
sufficiency of services can be achieved by local authorities only when
working with providers and not by local authorities
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000032">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:11:10"></hs_TimeCode>
was clear in Committee that, in the view of many in this House, the
Bill as it stands does not go far enough in relation to poor local
authority commissioning practices. We have reconsidered our position
and developed our own amendment, Amendment 27, in the light of the
concerns raised. This amendment would require local authorities, when
commissioning services, to consider the effect of their commissioning
decisions on the well-being of the people using those services. Our
approach has some significant differences from and, I would argue,
three clear advantages over, the approach suggested in Amendments 22
and 25, which seek to prohibit specific commissioning practices and in
particular to require homecare visits to last at least 30 minutes. The
first advantage is that our approach sends a clear message on the face
of the Bill that commissioning services without properly considering
the impact on individuals’ well-being is unacceptable. We
believe, in the light of the arguments expressed in Committee, that it
is important that we are able to send this message on the face of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000033">Second<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
our approach also explicitly prevents local authorities making
decisions about how they commission services without giving due regard
to the impact on individuals’ well-being. This goes a long way
towards achieving the objective we all share of tackling poor
commissioning practices while maintaining local authorities’
ability to decide the most appropriate approach to commissioning
services for the people in their area, and acknowledging that the
underlying issues here are cultural and cannot be tackled by
legislation
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000034">Third<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:12:54"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
our approach has a singular focus on the outcome that we all want to
achieve of promoting individuals’ well-being. Consequently, our
approach is holistic of all poor commissioning practices and
future-proofed against new practices that could emerge without risking
the creation of perverse incentives through taking an overly
prescriptive approach. Moreover, our approach is also holistic
of commissioning for all types of care and support, not merely focused
on one area: that is, not just on personal
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000035">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:13:28"></hs_TimeCode>
contrast, there are three reasons why I cannot support the approach set
out in the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher. First, it is
important to recognise that local authority commissioners do not act in
ways that undermine well-being because they want to, but rather because
they do not recognise the effects of their decisions or feel unable to
commission in other ways. As the president of the Association of
Directors of Adult Social Services has argued, we should be careful of
assuming
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13100981000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000105">“simply

recognise the limitations of legislation in tackling this issue. We
have heard during this debate some appalling examples of people having
to choose between being fed and being cleaned as a result of homecare
visits being commissioned for too short a time. Local authorities that
commission such services are palpably failing in their duty to meet
people’s needs. That they still commission such services
demonstrates the fact that the underlying problems here are cultural
and cannot simply be legislated away. Banning specific poor practices
will only lead to other poor practices emerging. Instead, I strongly
believe that we need to work with authorities to enhance
commissioners’ understanding of the effects of their
commissioning decisions on individuals’ well-being and of how
they can commission more

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, we certainly know that the reduction in
resources has had some effect. However, it is interesting that the
feedback from local authority chief executives and directors of adult
social services suggests clearly that the detrimental effect on the
provision of adult social care is not as dramatic as one might suppose
from the drop in local authority budgets. This is partly because of the
funding provided by my department to local authorities to make up some
of the gap. I would not wish to say that there has been zero effect. We
think, from the feedback, that the volume of services has diminished by
about 5%. This is 5% too much, in most people’s eyes, but may
not be as significant as some have feared.</hs_para>

central prescription risks prohibiting practices that may, in some
circumstances, be consistent with high-quality care. For example,
15-minute homecare visits could well be appropriate in some situations,
for instance for helping people to take medication, which is not a
process that takes very long at all. Further, using legislation to ban
specific processes may result in perverse incentives arising, without
addressing the actual problem. A number of noble Lords made that

just about local authority commissioning practices but more widely
about how the local authority can work with the market in its area,
including with providers from which it does not commission services, to
foster a high-quality workforce. This reflects our strong belief that
the characteristics of the workforce, including opportunities for
learning and skills development, have a direct relationship with the

Section 48 of the Act, but we are talking there about
providers. As regards commissioners, we are proposing in a later

concerns have been raised about a particular local authority or NHS
commissioner; there would not be periodic, regular reviews. However,
the CQC will be looking at every provider over a period of time. The

ability of the CQC to examine providers. I was saying earlier that it

those noble Lords to feel able not to press their amendments. I do not
yet know what the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, intends to do with her
amendment, but it may be helpful for noble Lords to know that
the Government do not consider that a decision on Amendment 25

Meacher:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Earl for his
thoughtful response and also all noble Lords who contributed to this
debate. It has been very considered, and the points raised have
been very important. These visits can require three hours of work, or
one and a half hours—all sorts of different lengths of time.
Whatever is decided ultimately must enable those visits needing that
length of time to be undertaken in that way.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:28:20"></hs_TimeCode> welcome the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and I am sure that the CQC has
an enormously important role to play in this. I wonder whether the
Minister would think it appropriate to require a thematic review of
this issue to be undertaken by the CQC, bearing in mind the level of
concern across the country about what is happening at the moment, which
clearly is not acceptable in terms of these very short visits for
personal
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000054">The
noble Earl mentioned the 5% reduction in the budget for adult social
care. It sounds small, but we all know that the adult social care
budget has always been incredibly low—way below what it should
be. Priority has never been given to this area of work, so a 5%
reduction is pretty serious. There is a lot to be done. The noble Earl
referred to guidance, regulations, and so on. I personally would
welcome an opportunity to have a discussion with him about how, in the
guidance and regulations, it might be possible to ensure that adequate
priority is given to this area of work. This is really what we are

Greengross:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment concerns discharge
plans for people in hospital. I shall start by saying that, in response
to my Amendment 87ZA tabled in Committee on this issue, the
Minister was 
<?notus-xml column=164?>understandably reluctant to specify the particular circumstances in
which the high-level aims of the general duty to co-operate, as set out
in Clause 6(5), should apply. He felt that there should not be an
exhaustive list of circumstances, such as discharge plan management, in
which the power should be used, and said that he expected authorities
and their relevant partners to co-operate when an individual was
discharged from acute care under this clause. He asserted that Schedule
3 to the Bill sets out clear steps to ensure the safe discharge of a
patient from an acute care setting, and that an assessment for care and
support should be made before the patient is discharged, not
afterwards. Clause 12(1)(b) already allows for regulations to specify
other matters to which the local authority must have regard in carrying
out an assessment. Given that this involves setting out procedural
detail and related matters, he felt it more appropriate to set out such
detail in regulations rather than in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T21:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0002.htm#13100981000059">While
I agree with much of that, my main point regarding the importance of
discharge being included as part of admission planning into an acute
care setting may have been misunderstood. The subject of discharge
should be considered as part of the admission process, long before the
actual discharge is instigated. That is the important point here, and I
remain firm in my belief that it should be included in the Bill. The
most important thing is the idea that discharge planning should be part
of the admission process. We have all heard a large number of stories
of people who have been discharged inappropriately because everything
is decided too late in the day and no one is ready for the discharge. I
personally could talk about two or three relatives aged 80 to 90 who
have been dumped out of hospital in the middle of the night. Such
instances are horrific, but I am afraid that they will continue unless
we get this

12 is not relevant here because it refers to a need for a care
assessment as being an essential part of the discharge process from an
acute setting into either supported home care or longer-term
residential care. I want to ensure that it will be facilitated
by eventual discharge being part of the admission assessment, which is
a very different process that is gone through at a different time by
different clinical staff. Including such a duty in Clause 6 would
ensure that this happens, so that the eventual discharge stands more of
a chance of being

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross, for allowing this debate. This is an
important question and I agree that ensuring that an assessment is made
around the time of the admission of a patient to a hospital or other
acute care setting would help the process of the appropriate discharge
of that person when the time comes for them to leave. One has to say
that the context in which we are debating this is one in which 
<?notus-xml column=165?>the health and social care system is under extreme
strain. The Minister will know that the accident and emergency
performance, and the issue of the four-hour target, is proving to be
problematic for a number of trusts, including my own, in September and
October. Clearly, if the health service is having difficulties in
September or October, in pretty clement weather, it does leave one with
some foreboding about what is going to happen later on in the
winter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000062">The
Government have injected a certain amount of resource into the
system—I think it is £250 million—which is
labelled on the tin “to A&amp;E departments”. The
Minister will know that the money has not gone to A&amp;E departments;
it has tended to go to the clinical commissioning groups. While limited
amounts have gone to A&amp;E departments, in the main, this has been
dealt with through urgent care boards. My understanding is that in a
lot of areas they still have not decided how to spend the resources.
This is partly because CCGs seem to be slow to make hard decisions, and
partly because some are not spending the money because they say that
they have not received it yet. The problem is this: if by the middle of
October you still have not spent or committed yourself to those
additional resources, it could take another three months. If, for
instance, it was a series of care packages or it was extra resource for
employing more nurses, it could take an awfully long time from the
decision to spend the money to it actually being in place, and then for
the money to be
spent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000063">I am
really using this as an opportunity to say to the noble Earl, Lord
Howe, that there is a real issue at the local level of actually getting

we are
seeing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000064">What
is the cause of the issue of A&amp;E performance? There has been some
debate about whether it is partly due to the lack of accessibility and
primary care. No doubt, there are serious issues involved which would
suggest that that is a problem. However, the noble Earl may have seen
some work undertaken by Matthew Cooke, who used to be the adviser to
the Government on urgent care and was a consultant in my own trust at
Heart of England. His work would suggest that the problem is discharge;
that there is simply not the capacity in the community or among
personal social services departments to provide the support that is
required. However much the Government want to beat up A&amp;E
departments, unless we can sort out the capacity in the
community, these problems will
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000065">The
noble Baroness’s amendment is really trying to get to the heart
of this. She is saying that it is a real problem—not just for
older and more vulnerable patients, but it is probably more directed at
those patients—if the first time you start to worry about
discharge procedures is when they have spent quite a few days in
hospital. First, it takes a long time for the system to intervene; and
secondly, it may mean that the patient stays in hospital too long. We
know all the problems of institutionalisation, when people have greater
difficulty in going back to their own home or into low-level community
provision as opposed to having to go into care homes.</hs_para>

Howe, will no doubt say that this is not the stuff of legislation.
However, because of the seriousness of the current problems in our
health and social care system, it would send a very powerful signal to
people working at local level about the absolute importance of starting
discharge planning almost as soon as a person comes into A&amp;E, and
of the need to have an integrated approach. It would also give a signal
to local authorities. At the moment there is a real problem because
local authorities often play around with discharges by saying that they
are not convinced that a person is ready for discharge. That is simply
trying to ration expenditures. A signal to local authorities that that
is also unacceptable would be very
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000067">I am

to get them to understand that very often voluntary organisations are
and can be the answer to managing people’s admission to A&amp;E

that voluntary organisations have any role to play in their work. As

do that. It shows that you can create capacity. My point is, that was

Baroness, Lady Greengross. I want to do so by telling a story and then
putting a suggestion to the Minister. Like my noble friend Lord Hunt
and me, he will have done his time touring hospitals as a Minister. We
are usually shown the high points of the hospital’s
achievements. Life changes a bit when you cease to be a Minister and
you visit your friends and relatives in hospital. On visits to
hospitals to see friends and relatives, because I am a nosy sort of
person I have always looked to see whether there is a date for
discharge on the charts. Some of these discharge dates are great works
of fiction. When I have asked nurses about these discharge dates, quite
commonly they say that managers have told them they have to have a
discharge date—so it something they have done for internal
compliance
purposes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000074">Although
the suggestion of the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, may not be right
for the Bill, it is at the very least important for guidance. Planning
on admission for discharge is needed. Present arrangements fail to
communicate that to the social care world. It is now an internal
mechanism for the NHS, not a mechanism designed to get people out of
hospital into an appropriate placement as soon as they are ready to go.
It would be a good idea to put this in the Bill, but at the very least
this issue needs to be covered in some detail in guidance so that the
NHS and the social care world are clear beyond peradventure what they
are supposed to do when a person comes into hospital. If we went along
that path, the world would be a better place and we would deliver some
of the objectives of this
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000075"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Finlay of Llandaff" PimsId="3238" UID="13100981000142" xid="1634" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000142">Baroness
Finlay of Llandaff:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be brief since the
hour is getting late. This amendment makes a very important point,
though it may be better in guidance. One of the problems is that the
pinch point is always A&amp;E, and getting patients out is really
difficult. At the moment, there is tokenism in planning discharge. It
needs to be much more embedded in trying to predict people’s
needs and having things in place. Until discharge planning really is
part of looking ahead at the aims for the patient we are still going to
have backlogs, because we are still going to be waiting for somebody to
come in and do
something.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000076"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13100981000143" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000143">Earl

Lady Greengross, for tabling Amendments 29 and 125, on what is
undoubtedly an extremely important issue, not just for the system but,
most importantly, for the patients themselves. When someone is
discharged from an acute care setting, care and support must be joined
up to prevent unnecessary delays and readmissions that can be
distressing to patients and their families and carers. The noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, was absolutely right on increasing pressure on acute trusts,

joined-up, person-centred and co-ordinated care in a way that stops
patients falling through the gaps in the system is of key importance to
improving their outcomes and experiences. I believe it is
incontrovertible that local authorities and relevant partners must
co-operate in order to ensure safe and timely transfers of care.
Indeed, the Bill already requires that. Clause 6 requires that local
authorities and relevant partners co-operate with one another where
this is relevant to care and support. Subsection (5) of the clause sets
out some key examples of when this duty should be used. There can be no
question that this duty would apply also to ensuring safe and timely
discharges, and we do not see the need to add further detail to such
broadly worded provisions. New guidance on discharge planning and on
how local authorities should perform co-operation duties under Clauses
6 and 7 will be issued following the passage of the Bill.</hs_para>

the Bill sets out a process around ensuring the safe and timely
discharge of acute hospital patients. This not only requires the local
authority, following notification from the responsible NHS body, to
assess a patient who it appears may have a need for care and support
before they are discharged but requires the authority to have the
necessary care and support package in place before discharge takes
place. The duties to co-operate apply to that process as well. In fact,
to come back to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Warner, raised
about guidance, the current discharge guidance, <I>Ready to Go</I>,
makes it clear that discharge planning should start before or on a
patient’s admission to hospital. We know that that does not
always happen, but it is best practice, and has been best practice for
some considerable
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100981000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-0003.htm#13100981000085">Amendment

am also grateful to all those noble Peers who, over the summer, gave me

you’ll still get plenty of amendments”. They were right.

Government’s adoption reform programme is to reduce delay for
children needing adoption so that they are able to move in with their
potential adopters earlier than they currently do. Fostering for
adoption has the potential to achieve this. Clause 1 imposes a duty on
a local authority to consider placing a looked-after child for whom the
local authority is considering adoption with foster carers who are also
approved prospective adopters. This is a fostering placement that,
subject to a placement order or parental consent, may become an
adoptive placement. Highly respected organisations in the adoption
field, such as Coram, Barnardo’s and the British Association for
Adoption and Fostering have expressed their support for this
policy.</hs_para>

tried to draft the clause in the way we consider most appropriate,
concerns about it were raised during the debate in the other place.
Many felt that the clause disapplied the duty to give preference to a
placement with family and friends and that, as a result, it would
encourage social workers to overlook this type of placement. Ministers
made clear that it was not the Government’s policy to exclude
family and friends, whose role in caring for these children we highly
value. The Government have carefully considered these comments, as the
Minister for Children and Families said he would. I now seek to amend
the clause to put beyond doubt that before a local authority considers
a fostering for adoption placement, it must have explored placement
with relatives and decided that it is not the most appropriate
placement for the child. I hope noble Lords will agree that this
amendment is appropriate. I beg to

concerns adoption. Clause 1 would enable agencies, as the Minister
said, to place a child in a fostering for adoption placement. This
would apply to any child coming into care for whom a family placement
is not possible and before any decision to move towards adoption has
been approved by the adoption panel or the court through a placement
order. We certainly share the Government’s concern 
<?notus-xml column=3?>that where adoption is the best option for a child, any delay in
matching and placing the child should be reduced to a minimum. We share
the Government’s overall intention. I am also pleased that the
Government have listened to the debate on kinship care and brought
forward Amendment 1 today, which addresses that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100973000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000010">In
introducing the amendments from the Opposition Front Bench, I would
point out that some of the amendments were placed in respect of the
original Clause 1. Those are Amendments 4, 6, 8 and 9. Since then, we
have seen the Government’s Amendment 1 and we have tabled
further amendments, Amendments 2, 3 and 10. It is to those
more recent amendments that I am predominantly speaking at the

Government’s amendment, I still think there needs to be further
improvement to the measures proposed in two important respects. The
first is kinship care, by which I mean care by a relative, friend or
other person connected with the child, as defined by Section 22C(6)(a)
of the Children Act 1989. The requirement in government
Amendment 1 to consider kinship care as a first step appears to
be—I will listen carefully to what the Minister says about
this—a weaker prescription than that in subsection (7) of the
current legislation, which requires local authorities not just to
consider, but to give preference to, kinship placements where they are
possible. Furthermore, Amendment 1 still disapplies subsections (7) to
(9) in their entirety. These are requirements in the current
legislation to place the child near their home, not to disrupt
education or training, to enable siblings to live together, to
accommodate any disability the child has and to be within the local
authority’s area. We think that those are all sensible
requirements that enhance the stability of the placement for the
child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:52:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, our Amendment 3 simultaneously requires that stronger
requirement on kinship care to take preference and retains those other
criteria for placement, including keeping siblings
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:52:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

current legislation, many people share a strong belief that local
authorities could do more to explore the potential for kinship care, so
Amendment 10 proposes the introduction of pre-proceedings work and
family group conferences, designed to ensure that, at an early stage
and in a systematic way, the family is encouraged to identify
possibilities for the child within the wider family
network<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:53:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

understand why family members might not initially come forward at an
early stage to suggest options without such structures and support.
They might be concerned not to upset the parents who
are—obviously, by definition—their relatives. Many often
feel, certainly, that they have to wait for the decision of the court
as to whether the child is free for adoption, but by then it is too
late. Therefore, Amendment 10 would build into the process an early
examination under professional guidance of kinship care
possibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:54:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the clause, as it would be if amended by government Amendment 1,
is about the extension of fostering for adoption placements potentially
for all children coming into care through whatever route. As currently
formulated, Amendment 1 would 
<?notus-xml column=4?>require the local authority to consider a fostering for adoption
placement for every child for whom kinship care was not
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:54:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

favour, as we all are, of reducing delay in achieving quality
alternative permanent placements for children who need them. I have
supported the development of concurrent planning adoption, which is the
template for fostering for adoption placements. Concurrent placement
has undoubtedly been beneficial for the children placed early on with
foster carers approved to adopt. However, we need to be clear that
concurrent planning has so far been used only for babies under two born
into families where it is already well known that the parents have
serious and chronic problems, such as long-standing drug addiction,
which interfere with their ability to parent, and who have often
already had to relinquish previous children.</hs_para>

the pilot run by Thomas Coram that the Minister mentioned, 61% of the
children were referred for concurrent planning placement at or at about
birth and 95% were under one year old, so this is a very special group.
In the 11 years of that pilot, only 59 children were placed
by this method, so carefully selected are the children for very good
reasons. Of those 59, two were returned to the birth family and
57 were adopted, with their original foster carers having
been approved for adoption, and they had very good outcomes. However,
opening up to the whole diverse range of children coming into care a
model conceived specifically for a very small and tightly drawn group
of babies seems to be dubious, not least because there is no evidence
base as to the possible outcomes for children and families with
different characteristics, particularly for older
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:56:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

requirement to consider a fostering for adoption placement would apply
also to children placed into care voluntarily by their parents under
Section 29 of the Children Act. By definition, these parents have not
relinquished their children for adoption, nor have the local
authorities applied for a care order. I do not think it is appropriate
even to consider placing such children on a pathway to adoption without
the fully informed and independently witnessed consent of the parents,
as is required by current legislation. That is why our Amendment 2
would make it clear that the requirement to consider a fostering for
adoption placement would apply only to children for whom the local
authority had a care
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:57:31"></hs_TimeCode>. Indeed, I
think that the unintended consequences of not exempting from this
requirement children who come into care voluntarily may be to deter
parents in the future from approaching local authorities with a view to
voluntarily placing a child into care when they are in
difficulty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:57:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

number of other issues on which we should like to hear the
Minister’s views before deciding whether the Bill might need
further amendment on Report. The main issue is that there is still a
lack of clarity, including in the draft guidance that the Minister
helpfully issued last week, as to when in the process a local authority
may be judged to be considering adoption. We welcome the intention
outlined in the guidance to require the director of children’s
services to approve a decision to use a fostering for adoption
placement and to inform parents and prospective adopters in writing. 
<?notus-xml column=5?>However, as the draft guidance makes very clear, the local authority
will be required to consider a fostering for adoption placement even
when the first priority for that child is to be rehabilitated with the
birth parents. I think that that is very questionable. When will
considering adoption come into play? The guidance says that this will
vary from case to case. That is not nearly tight enough and a defined
trigger may be needed, possibly as suggested in the amendment tabled by
the noble Baroness, Lady
Hamwee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:59:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T15:59:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there is very little emphasis in the guidance on matching. Thinking
about fostering for adoption placements, that is a very important
issue. It is worth noting that under the current arrangements it is
very often during the fostering phase that detailed knowledge about the
child comes to light with professional and expert foster carers. They
may learn additional things about a child’s disability or
behavioural problems, or the child may disclose experiences to the
foster carers that were not previously known, and all this goes into
the matching process to try to ensure that the adoptive placement, when
it occurs, is as secure as possible. I am concerned that in a fostering
for adoption placement, outside of the narrow range of the babies I
talked about, of whom knowledge is probably pretty full, issues may
come to light during that placement that deter those potential adopters
currently fostering a child from proceeding with the placement any
further because of the nature of the issues that come to
light<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:00:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100973000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000020">Finally,
there is an important issue of timely planning for permanency across
all alternative permanent options and I regret that the Bill as it
stands does not say very much about those other options. However, we
look forward to hearing the Minister’s response on these issues.

concept much supported by members of that committee, although we all

Committee urged the Government to widen the scope of the duty to
include it in options for all children for whom adoption is the
permanent plan. I appreciate that that is why the Government made an

first amendment is to probe both the meaning and the weight of the term
“consider”. It is not a technical term. When I first saw
it, thinking very much as a non-professional, I wondered where on a
spectrum of thinking about something—from something casually
crossing one’s conscience all the way to making a
decision—“consider” comes in terms of considering
adoption. I then discovered that many professionals were also
concerned. BAAF and the Family Rights Group, endorsed by other
organisations, say that there is a wide spectrum between adoption
considered as one possibility when all options are open and a formal
decision that a child should be placed for adoption. Things follow
automatically, step-by-step, when one is in the formal process. This
suggestion is made that unless we link this provision to the statutory
review process, we are not centring it properly as part of that
step-by-step sequence. In defining a more precise trigger point, they
suggest it when the local authority considers that adoption is the
likely permanence plan. I accept that I have failed to bite the bullet
by not offering an alternative.</hs_para>

was fussing unnecessarily because if one looks at new subsection
(9A)(a) of Section 22C, all that will be required is for the local

take the point about work with families being difficult. On the

necessary for an emergency to preclude the steps which are spelt out. I
also wonder how this would relate to Section 47(5)(a) of the 1989 Act,
which requires the ascertainment of a child’s wishes and
feelings. I suspect that everything else in that section is subject to
that anyway but perhaps the noble Baroness might say a word about

finish by putting on record my huge admiration—and not just
mine—for both foster parents and adopters. Above all, to be
prepared to foster with a view to adoption, and therefore necessarily
with a view also to not adopting, is particularly admirable. In the
somewhat technical approach that we may have to take to some of this,
it is appropriate that we should not lose sight of the enormous

Walmsley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to add a couple of
comments to those of my noble friend Lady Hamwee, with whose words I
totally concur. I have a great deal of sympathy with Amendment 10, and
I urge the Minister to consider it and perhaps come back to us at a
later stage with some further thoughts about it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13100973000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000032">When we are considering
all this, we need to bear in mind that adoption is not the only form of
permanence, and we must not lose sight of that fact. It is not
appropriate for many children. When it comes to considering placement
with family and friends, on whatever basis, in my view you cannot do
that early enough. A briefing that I received from the College of
Social Work pointed out to me—I had not realised this
before—that there is currently no duty on a local authority to
consider family and friends before the child is taken into care. Given
the 26-week limit that we are about to bring in, it would be very wise
for the Minister to consider this amendment. It would mean that family
and friends were considered even before the child was taken into care,
and the concern that people have raised, that 26 weeks may not give
family and friends time to come forward, would be averted if family and
friends were being considered even before the child went into care.
This amendment has merit, and I hope that the Minister will consider

Massey of Darwen (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I have two brief points.
First, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I am concerned about the
issue of consideration, and I would like to know at what stage this
consideration kicks in.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=8?><hs_para UID="13100973000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000034">Secondly, I have the
greatest respect and admiration for family and friends carers, who do
such a remarkable job, sometimes in very difficult conditions, and I
take on board the issue that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, raised
about timing. I am curious about the dropping of the preference for
looking first at family and friends carers as appropriate to a child. I
am surprised that that is not being strongly supported by the
Government. I believe that something like 86% of kinship care
proceedings are initiated by the prospective kinship carers themselves,
not by social workers, and surely that is quite the wrong way
round.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13100973000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000035">I am
also surprised that the Government do not seem to consider the costs of
kinship care and care by friends. I believe that a foster care
placement costs something like £40,000, while the average cost
of care proceedings is more than £25,000. I hope that the
Government will look again at the whole issue of placing family and
friends care at the head of the proposals. I am aware that it is not
always appropriate and I accept that, but to have dropped the idea of
preference, if appropriate, is a
mistake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:14:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100973000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Howarth of Breckland" PimsId="1029" UID="13100973000113" xid="1642" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000113">Baroness
Howarth of Breckland (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I have three points.
I begin by saying that I believe that legislation should enhance and
underpin practice. I declare an interest as being a member of the
Select Committee on Adoption Legislation, along with my colleagues who
have already declared that interest. It was quite clear to us that,
were we able to improve practice in a number of areas, the legislation
would simply not be necessary.</hs_para>

return to thinking about that issue, particularly in relation to the
practice of social workers and the difficulties they face at the
moment, and the pressures of local
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:14:51"></hs_TimeCode>.<I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:14:53"></hs_TimeCode></I>
I am sure the Minister will want to concentrate on what he has before
him but unless the Government take a more strategic and broader view of
children’s needs, we will simply add to the legislation and the
difficulties that local authority social workers are experiencing
rather than meet the needs of the
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:15:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13100973000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000101">4.15

second point is that I have twice heard the Minister say something that
I have not understood; namely, that the Government wish to enhance
kinship care. He said it at the beginning of his speech today and in a
meeting yesterday. It may be my lack of comprehension but I cannot
quite understand how that links to the amendment. I have not quite
gathered the Government’s intention in all
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:15:56"></hs_TimeCode>. We should
remind ourselves that special guardianship, to which we will come
later—I think the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, alluded to the
fact that many families come to the court themselves and ask for
special guardianship—in some ways has a better position than
adoption. We know that the Government wish to maintain family
relationships where they can; special guardianship maintains that
family relationship, while giving the child permanency. As the
Committee goes on, I do not think that it should be under the illusion
that there is not a great deal of good, solid, permanent placement
happening; it is happening under a different
name<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:16:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

deeply concerned about my third point. I do not understand, and nor I
think do my colleagues, the suggestion that all children, whether they
have come into care voluntarily or under a care order—the noble
Baroness, Lady Hughes, spoke to this—are included. There must be
a fundamental misunderstanding in those who have put this together
because the two are so different. If you are a mum in trouble through
no fault of your own and you need help, and you ask a social worker for
help and they say, “We can take your child into care for a few
weeks while you get over having your second child and you are a single
mum”, you do not expect that child to be immediately placed in
fostering for
adoption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:17:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13100973000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000039">Under these rules, I
know what will happen because of the situation in which local
authorities find themselves: these children will find themselves
placed. When the mum has got herself together and the case comes to
court, the child will be settled. A judge may believe that the mother
should have her child returned but the court’s responsibility
will be to look at the paramount needs of the child. If the child is
settled in a placement, a judge will sadly—I know of
cases—make the decision against the best interests of the family
because they think the child is settled and has
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>.
We need to look at that extremely carefully or we will find ourselves
placing a large number of children when we have no intention of
removing them from their primary
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:18:29"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
think that anyone really thought through the fact that the parents of
these children are still their parents. They are not sharing care with
the local authority. The local authority is accommodating the children
on the parents’ behalf, unlike when a care order is in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:18:50"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
some fundamental difficulties.</hs_para>

also endorse the point about matching. You may place a child in a
placement for fostering. I have been a social worker for many years and
I know how difficult it is to find a placement quickly to meet all the
requirements of timescales. You may then discover issues around
matching that are not appropriate. I could give examples but I will not
waste the time of the Committee on too many anecdotes. I hope that we
can look at some of this. I am very unhappy to agree to the
Minister’s amendment. I am sorry about that because, like the
rest of the Committee, I am committed to improving the speed of
adoptions and the placement of children. These are unfortunate ways to
take that forward.</hs_para>

Perry of Southwark (Con):</Member></B> I am reluctant to query the
noble Baroness because I am aware of her huge expertise in this area
and have enormous respect for her, but in my amateur ignorance I do not
see in the Bill or the amendment anything which assumes that the local
authority must consider adoption. The amendment refers only to where
the local authority is considering adoption; it does not say that it
must consider adoption. If I have missed the wording somewhere else, I
hope that somebody will put me right, but the noble Baroness’s
third consideration seems not to appear in the

Earl of Listowel (CB):</Member></B> I, too, welcome the Minister to his
first Grand Committee day of a Bill and thank him for his time over the
summer in dealing 
<?notus-xml column=10?>with some of my concerns. As I listened to the debate, my mind went back
to a meeting four months ago with women whose children had been taken
away from them in the 1950s and 1960s. At the time, they were single
women and were strongly encouraged to give their child away. Those
women bitterly regretted having done so and were campaigning for an
apology from government. It is unlikely that this Bill will result in
women campaigning in 20 or 30 years’ time for an apology from
Parliament for what is being done now, but we really have to raise our
game. It is clear that if we took a more consistent approach towards to
some of these vulnerable families and helped a few more parents off
drugs and alcohol, as we could well do, we would not need to take their
children away. We must not be too optimistic and allow children to be
kept in those families and be harmed, but we see through the
effectiveness of Louise Casey’s focused work with troubled
families and through District Judge Crichton’s work in the
family drug and alcohol court that, where a real effort is made and
where central government is prepared to step up and take
responsibility, we can make a difference with those families. I welcome
what the Government are doing, but some of these children would not
have to be taken into care if we raised the overall quality of our
child and family
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:22:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100973000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000043">This
debate highlights the great judgment required of child and family
social workers. They are in the position of making that lifetime
decision: will a child stay with its birth family in kinship care or
will it be removed for adoption? I welcome the huge investment that
this Government and the previous Government have made in raising the
status of child and family social work through the social work college,
the new post of Chief Social Worker and the Munro review. Despite those
all being very helpful inputs, a social worker who was training in
London—an intelligent woman—said to me last week,
“I was bitterly disappointed by my training. I didn’t get
the feedback. Many of my fellow students felt the same way. I’m
now going to Bristol to carry on my training in social work”.
There is therefore an awfully long way to go in the nuts and bolts of
getting the social work profession to where it needs to be to serve
those families

progress are we making in the retention of child and family social
workers? People are saying—I heard it said again

people? Are we managing to retain experienced social workers close to

have one final question for the Minister, which he might care to write
to me about. It is a concern raised in the past by the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and raised today by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, about the outcomes for children in
adoptive placements. We need robust evidence about outcomes for
children in adoptive placements. We have them already for children in
kinship placements. We need to compare, contrast and make good policy
decisions based on those. I hope that the Minister can give an
assurance that, if that cannot be produced at 
<?notus-xml column=11?>the moment, research projects will be put in place so that in future we
know how stable those adoptive placements are. The worst outcome would
be for a child or children to be placed for one or two years, to be
settled, and then to be rejected again by their new family. I am sorry
to have gone on so

collecting money for the National Children’s Home, which has
changed its name a few times. I think I am now an ambassador for it. I

were different in those days was that most children who were placed for

I did an adoption supervision and took it to court. I was very

about going to a further stage, where the parents are not placing the

Minister that the Government have done the work to ensure that the
family court will not then come back and say, “Actually, we are
not convinced that the rights of this child and its natural family were
properly considered in your decision around permanence and therefore
around placing for fostering up to adoption”. That means that
when the case gets to court for adoption, the judge may then be tempted
to say, “I’m not convinced that this is in the interests
of the child or that the process has ensured that the rights of the
child, which are expressed very clearly in all sorts of places,

wanted to know why it had gone wrong; they wanted to know why they
could not live back at home; they wanted to know who their father was;
they wanted to understand it. When I was talking to social workers in
either Germany or Denmark—I cannot remember which—about
care, they said that they involved natural parents much more in the
care experience. I would go into a children’s home in the

would say, “We are not pretending to be the children’s

years, and I would just say: be cautious and deal with local
authorities as partners, not as people you threaten to get them in

such a way that you get the best out of them. From bitter experience,

say that as an ex-Chief Whip; you cannot go back to the usual channels
and say, “That’s what they wanted”. This should be
a matter of government determination. These two Bills should be seen as
complementary and, therefore, the people who have a commitment to them
and an interest in them should be able to contribute and to vote. They
are not able to do so at the moment, and I hope that the Minister will
take that away and come back with a better answer than we have had to

speak to this group of amendments but I want to make one point: in my
experience, the use of parallel planning for younger children is
extremely beneficial. The far more experienced magistrates and district
judges who I sit with have told me many times over the past year how
effective parallel planning can be. I heard what the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, said about the problems of extending parallel planning and
how it needs to be carefully looked at, but from what I have seen there
would be far more benefit in doing that. It is certainly the case, and
I am sorry to have to say this, that you come across wider family
groups who have a lot of experience of the family courts and—I
use this expression deliberately—know how to play the system.
They know how to extend it again and again before the courts make their
final decision. If you can have an element of parallel planning in
this, that is for the benefit of the child. I will leave it there. That
is the point that I wanted to make in support of Amendment

to the first point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, local
authorities have a duty to place a child with the most appropriate
placement available 
<?notus-xml column=14?>and one which best safeguards the child’s welfare. If a local
authority is unable to make arrangements for the child to return home,
then it must look for someone else who is able to care for the child.
This might be through a placement with friends and family. At this
point, the local authority must give preference to suitable family and
friends
carers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100973000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000060">Where
there are no suitable family or friends carers able to care for the
child, the local authority must make alternative plans for the child
outside the family. If adoption is a possible option, then the clause
requires the local authority to consider a placement with approved
adopters who are also approved foster carers. They will foster the
child until the court makes a placement order. In some cases, the local
authority will be working to rehabilitate the child with the birth
family, with adoption as the alternative if that is not successful. If
it is successful, the child will leave the FFA placement and return
home. The clause specifically requires that the local authority must
first consider family and friends care before going on to consider FFA.
At this point, the clause disapplies the duty to give preference to
family and friend carers because before considering fostering for
adoption, the local authority will already have considered whether the
child can return home and, if not, have considered suitable family and
friend carers.</hs_para>

friend carer emerges at this stage or after the child has been placed
in an FFA placement, the local authority must consider them. If
placement with these family or friend carers is the most appropriate
for the child, the local authority must move the child. We must
remember that this is a duty to consider fostering for adoption, not to
place. It will not be suitable for all children but for those for whom
it is right, it allows them to move in with their potential permanent
family much earlier.</hs_para>

noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, propose a duty to seek to
identify a family or friend carer when a local authority has concluded
that a child should be looked after but before applying for the care
order. There is the potential that this could lead to a delay in making
a care order application for a child who may be in danger of
significant harm. This would be contrary to the duty of the local
authority to safeguard and promote that child’s welfare. It is a
principle of the Children Act 1989 that the local authority must first
look to place a looked-after child with a family and friends carer, as
I have said, if they are unable to be returned to their parents. It is
of course right that the child should be kept safe while arrangements
are made for an appropriate placement.</hs_para>

establishing what family support is available is essential in
pre-proceedings. Family group conferences are one particular way of
achieving this. This Government are committed to the use of family
group conferences at all stages of the involvement of children’s
services with families. We are currently funding the Family Rights
Group over a two-year period to implement a framework of accreditation.
However, we would not wish to make them compulsory as they will

understandably so, that the noble Baronesses’ proposed clause
has been prompted in part by the concern that more rapid proceedings
might make it difficult for family members to put themselves forward to
care for a child. However, we have put in place the necessary measures
to allow for extensions to care proceedings and for them to be resolved
justly. There is no limit on the number of extensions that can be
granted. I hope that the noble Baronesses will feel reassured by this

regarding placements with siblings, I spoke briefly about the first
part of this amendment. With regard to its second part and the points
made by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, about
siblings, it might be that in some circumstances it would be in the
child’s best interest to be placed with or near a sibling.
However, we are talking about the placement of a child with foster
parents who may go on to adopt him. It will not always be the case that
adoption is being considered as an option for the child’s
sibling. It may not be in his or her best interests to be adopted
together with a sibling. It must be for the local authority in each
case to decide what is in the best interests and what is the most
appropriate placement for each child in a sibling group. I hope that
the noble Baronesses will agree that Amendment 8 would therefore not be
appropriate in this context.</hs_para>

point for the duty to consider fostering for adoption. A number of
arguments have been put forward about the point at which the duty
should bite. Your Lordships will have seen that the government
amendment enables a fostering for adoption placement to be considered
from the point when the local authority starts to think about adoption
as an option for the child to the point at which the local authority is
authorised to place the child for adoption with prospective adopters.
We believe that this will enable local authorities to consider
fostering for adoption for a child at any point during the care journey
for children for whom this type of placement is appropriate. This is
consistent with other early placement practices such as concurrent
planning—a practice that the Select Committee recommended should
be promoted more widely.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13100973000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100973000067">What
is meant by “considering adoption”? The term comes from
the Adoption Agencies Regulations 2005 and its concept is very familiar
to adoption agencies. “Considering adoption” means
considering it as an option for the child. A local authority may be
considering adoption at different stages during a child’s care
journey. In some rare cases, it might even be before the child comes
into care or, as in a concurrent planning scenario, where the local
authority is working with the birth parents to return the child home
but has adoption as the alternative plan should rehabilitation fail. In
some cases adoption will be the only option being considered and in
others it will be one of several.</hs_para>

appreciate the concerns raised about the term “considering
adoption”, which some feel might be misinterpreted and lead to
rushed decisions about whether adoption is an appropriate option before
all other options have been carefully assessed. The clause requires
that when a local authority is considering adoption as an option it
also considers fostering for adoption. It will be for the local
authority in each case to decide whether the chances of the child going
on to be placed for adoption are sufficiently high for a fostering for
adoption placement to be the most appropriate one for him or her. Cases
where there is robust evidence and background history about the
child’s birth family could support the need for such radical
intervention. Using “considering adoption” as the trigger
would also cover concurrent planning cases.</hs_para>

share the concerns raised about the application of fostering for
adoption to this group of children. That is why we are proposing to
introduce regulations which will require the local authority to notify
the child’s birth parents in writing that the local authority
has decided to place the child in a fostering for adoption placement as
soon as possible after the decision is made. Underpinning statutory
guidance will require that letter to include advice on access to legal
advice and on the birth parents’ right to remove the child from
local authority care. We will consult on the illustrative regulations

now turn to the comments made by my noble friend Lady Hamwee and the
arguments put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, about the
importance of the matching process. I share the view of the noble
Baronesses that the suitability of a specific placement must be
carefully considered and that it safeguards the child’s welfare.
In considering a fostering for adoption placement, local authorities
will need to consider the carers’ capability to be the
child’s foster carers while keeping in mind the possibility that
they may become the child’s
adopters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:47:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

remember that these are fostering placements, while matching is a
feature of the adoption process and a precursor to the child being
placed for adoption. It is the process by which the adoption
agency’s decision-maker, assisted by the recommendation of the
agency’s matching panel, decides which prospective adopter would
be the best people to become the child’s adopters once the
agency has come to the conclusion that the child should be placed for
adoption. For those reasons, we do not think that it is appropriate to
require the local authority formally to match the child and the carers
in the same way for

Baronesses that the regulations will provide for the local

the decision that the child should be placed in a fostering for

fostering placements and expects the local authority to consider the
suitability of a placement in the light of the child’s needs.
Should the placement become an adoptive placement, the formal adoption

I think all those contributions testify to the importance of trying to
maximise the possibility of kinship care and of recognising that, while
at the moment the law requires that local authorities give preference
to such an option, the reality is that—often for very good
reasons, as I and others outlined—those possibilities often
become evident, if at all, too late in the judicial process to act upon
them. That is why Amendment 10 specifies pre-proceedings work. It is
important that that is done in a structured way under the stewardship
of an experienced professional. It involves handling very difficult
issues within the family, and family group conferencing has been proven
to be the safest way to do

pre-proceedings activities and family group conferencing compulsory; it

authorities to “consider” the kinship care option is
weaker than “giving preference to”, as specified in

contributions from, in particular, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, my

speak from great experience. My noble friend Lady Armstrong made a
point, which echoed my own, about concurrent planning. At the moment,
it is restricted. You see adverts in newspapers and in the trade press
from local authorities offering concurrent planning, and it is all for
babies aged nought to two. Coram has a restriction of age two. In fact,
the evidence that I cited showed that in practice 95% of babies who
have been referred and placed through that route have been under one
year old. This is not a situation in which one can imagine that a seven
or eight year-old or a teenager will present the same issues. A great
deal is already known about the babies who have been placed by that
route. They are very young, so they are unlikely to have a lot of
negative experiences as older children may have done, and there is
therefore a great deal of certainty from the outset about the child
whom the fostering for adoption parents are taking on. That would not
be the case with older children or children who are known to
have had difficult
experiences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:53:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to the question of whether we should have a specific trigger for

outcome of this. As my noble friend Lady Armstrong and the noble

the Minister replied to the comment, “What does
‘consider’ mean?”, by rehearsing the arguments in
the draft guidance that it can mean different things to different local
authorities in relation to different children. Another way of saying
that is that it can mean almost anything at any time. I worry about
that, because for the local authority to have to consider a fostering
adoption placement for all children, including those going into care
voluntarily, is a very serious change. He said that adoption might be
one of several options; there might be a list of options and adoption
might be on it. Why, then, if there is a list of  
<?notus-xml column=19?>options, is fostering for adoption the one that the local authority has
to consider first? That is the effect of the Government’s

comment that concerned me most was what the Minister said about
matching. He said—I wrote this down and I hope I have got it
right—that in a fostering for adoption placement, the local
authority is not required to consider matching in the same way as it
does for adoption. If the fostering for adoption placement looks like
it might proceed to adoption, then it will undertake the formal
matching process—by which time the child will have been there
for perhaps six, nine or 18 months. Given that this is supposed to be a
device to minimise disruption to children and to place them early with
parents with whom they may remain if they cannot return home, that
seems to be totally counterproductive. I urge the Minister to think
again, certainly in framing the guidance, about what is said about
matching. Clearly, if children can stay in a placement that started out
as fostering for adoption, then matching needs to take place right at
the outset, otherwise there is a real danger that children may then be
moved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:57:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

both elucidation and change. Perhaps I may also add how delighted I am
with the extra resources that have now been offered by the Government
toward the adoption process and post-adoption
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T16:59:50"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is an area about which I wish to speak in this debate and that is
Clause 2 of the Bill, where it is intended to repeal Section 1(5) of
the Adoption and Children Act
2002.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000003">The
opinion of the adoption committee that I chaired was that it was right
to start with the removal of the words from subsection (5). This is an
issue of ethnicity—an issue of race, culture, religion and
language. In Clause 2, the Government are removing it entirely from the
2002 Act. That is a step too far. In paragraphs 57 to 83 of
the adoption report, we said—putting it shortly—that we
agreed that the Government were right to take it out as a separate
subsection of the 2002 Act. It was given too great prominence. The
evidence that we received as a committee was to the effect that there
was a time when social workers elevated subsection (5) to
inappropriate heights and therefore they were trying to match in colour
in particular where it was not appropriate and moving children from
very good families who were not of the same colour, race or background.
However, we also had evidence, both from social workers and from the
adoption agencies, that that problem had largely receded; it had been
far less obvious in recent times and there was a counterdanger that, if
it were taken out altogether, the social workers who cared too much
about it when it was in would care equally when it was out. They would
say, “Now that it’s not in, we have to disregard it. We
must not consider race, ethnicity, language, religion or
culture”. That is an equally important
danger<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T17:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>. We had
evidence from the social workers and the agencies that there are social
workers and other people out there who might take that view. It is a
danger and one that must not be disregarded.</hs_para>

also had informal evidence from children; we had a group of children
who had been adopted and a group of children who were looked after who
came to talk to me and one or two other Peers at the request of the
then Children’s Rights Director. They were extremely interesting
groups of children, ranging in age from about seven or eight to about
19. The young ones were very vocal, and at least two of them said to us
that the question of ethnicity was extremely important to them, and
they were worried about being placed—or the possibility of being
placed—with someone who would not understand their background.
To me, this was very powerful evidence from the horse’s
mouth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T17:04:02"></hs_TimeCode>. I am very
concerned about the Government keeping this clause in the Bill, when in
fact we made it very clear in our report how concerned we, as a
committee, were. Our proposal was that it should not be set out on
its  
<?notus-xml column=21?>own, where it has too important an effect, but in among other matters

accepted, Section 1(4)(d) of the Act would require the court or agency

I understand it, the Government are saying that
“characteristics” includes that. It does in a sense but,
unless you highlight the relevant points somewhere, there is a great
danger that they will be overlooked. If you look at subsection (4) it

great many of them could be covered by one word or sentence, but the
legislators of the day thought it necessary to explain some of them. I
urge the Government to think very carefully about including, neatly
packaged in subsection (4)(d), those words as part and parcel of a

one wants children to be disadvantaged by delays caused by the search
for a perfect match, but the evidence of the adoption committee was
that while there had been pockets of poor practice in the past, this is
not a widespread problem. Indeed, it heard evidence from organisations
such as Barnardo’s, which believed that the current legislation
was adequate, and Coram, which also argued that, while there might have
been a problem in the past, the situation was improving
rapidly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T17:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
committee also identified that there were several other factors
affecting the placement of black and minority ethnic children,
including having fewer prospective adopters, the age of the children
being put up for adoption and a failure of social workers to promote
their availability.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T17:08:26"></hs_TimeCode> are concerned
that too much of the legislation being put forward on this issue is
being based on anecdote and there is in fact a paucity of evidence that

general view was that the current legislative wording was not a problem
per se. We therefore think that the Government have swung too far in
the opposite direction by seeking to remove any reference to ethnicity,
religion and culture. That is why we believe that putting these factors
in the welfare checklist, along with other 
<?notus-xml column=22?>considerations, strikes the right and proportionate balance in
addressing the issue. It would require agencies to have regard to these

achieve that. It removes the express duty to give consideration to
these factors, but we are concerned, in the same way as the noble and

his response to the Select Committee on adoption report, the

He said that in order to counterbalance the excessive emphasis, we had
to go to the opposite extreme to ram the message home to local

ethnicity. We referred to case studies and experiences in the UK and
overseas, and some DfE officials were also present. By and large, that
group of about 20 people also came to the view that it was both
important and necessary to consider ethnicity, racial origins and
culture when seeking to place for adoption. That is not to say that
anyone present thought that transracial adoption should never be
undertaken. However, it was considered that in our society cultural

factors. Perhaps the Government’s desire to effect a better
outcome for

recruiting more families from similar backgrounds to adopt or commit to

might be constructed by society; they are very real to the people who
experience them. Those kinds of experiences are very much heightened if
the child is raised in an area where they are highly visible and marked
as different at school and in their social life. More support should be
offered to adoptive parents and social workers to help their

changed the whole attitude to racism; some made social workers take a
particular view of race. I know that because I was the head of a social

Perry of Southwark:</Member></B> My Lords, the UN convention quoted by
the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, asks for respect for a child’s
ethnicity and cultural, linguistic and religious background. If I were
putting down an amendment to the Bill, which I am not doing, I would
want something that emphasised that. That does not mean that adoptive
parents have to be of the same ethnicity or religious conviction as
that of the child being adopted, but they have to be the kind of people
who genuinely respect that. If I may be allowed an anecdote, although
we have just been told not to rely on anecdotes, I can tell the
Committee that I lived through such a thing in my own family. When I
was a very little girl, my parents “adopted” a child of
the Kindertransport. Her parents had sent her away from Hitler’s
Germany just before the outbreak of the Second World War and my
parents, as Christians—my father was a minister—decided
that they would open our home and our family to this little girl,
Marrianna, who became my sister to all intents and purposes for several
years until her own family was able to take her towards the end of the
war. I remember well my parents straining every muscle to allow that
little girl to keep her religious identity—we learnt in our
family to respect all the Jewish customs and festivals—and they
were determined, although Christians themselves and very powerfully so,
that they would do that. What we are surely asking for is that kind of
genuine respect for the child’s religious, cultural or ethnic
background, and not for someone who has to be the same. The rationale
of the noble and learned Baroness’s amendment reaches towards
that, but I would like something that emphasised the wording of the UN
convention, which is “respect for” rather than
“the same
as”.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T17:29:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13100982000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000236">5.30

Committee an anecdote. I am sorry, but this is why I am so passionate
about believing that the well balanced solution of the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, to the perceived problem is much
better than taking the issue out altogether. It is the fact that my son
and his wife, in addition to having their own two white, blond boys,
have adopted a Chinese daughter. Cathryn is a wonderful little girl and
she is much loved by the whole extended family. For the past seven
years, she has been very successfully adopted and I very much hope that
it continues that way. Of course, when going out in public with her
family she might as well have a big sign on her forehead saying,
“I am adopted”, because she  
<?notus-xml column=28?>clearly looks different. It was so important that her adoptive parents
were sensitive to difference and its importance, and to the importance
of cultural, racial and ethnic identity. They are approaching the
adoption of their little Chinese daughter with all that in mind. That
is why I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, that we must ensure
that where there is transracial or transethnic adoption, the matching
is right. That is more important than the child and the parents having
the same skin colour.</hs_para>

Committee that ethnicity really matters; I absolutely agree with the
noble Baroness, Lady Young. That is why it is important that you find
the right adoptive family. If the race, culture and ethnicity are
different, they have to understand, be sensitive to and take account of
that as they help the child to develop into a fully fledged grown-up
with an understanding of their ethnic and cultural background. To throw
it out altogether puts the Government in great danger of the pendulum
swinging in the opposite direction and no account being taken at all of
the difference in ethnicity. If they did that, they would be in danger
of finding adoptive families who, although they were very well
intentioned, did not have that sensitivity to difference and to the
importance of the cultural identity of the child.</hs_para>

when you have a transnational, transracial, transcultural or
transethnic adoption. The fact is that we are going to have some of
those because there is a mismatch between the pool of children of
ethnic majorities who are waiting for adoption and the ethnicity of
families who are prepared to adopt them. Until we get equal numbers in
those two pools, we will have transracial and transethnic adoptions.
However, the important thing for the success of the adoption is that
the matching is right. The danger is that if you take out reference
altogether instead of putting it in the checklist, as has been so
sensibly suggested, you will get a mismatch and have unsuccessful
adoptions. Alternatively, the adoption will complete until the child is
an adult but that adult will be damaged by the lack of consideration
having been given to their background.</hs_para>

can convince me that such consideration by a court or adoption agency
when coming to a decision relating to the adoption of a child is not
important. Social workers need to be sensitive to this factor and to
work with parents, who need to be able to understand the identity of
the child they are adopting. This should not be a stand-alone but
should be included in the child’s welfare checklist along with
religion, culture and language, as so passionately put by the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and as recommended by the House of
Lords Select Committee on Adoption Legislation. It should not be the be

while 2% of black children in care are adopted. That is a fact that
should make all of us angry. The average length of time that it takes
for a child to be adopted from entering the care system is two years

though, because all the evidence is that, generally, the younger a
child enters the care system, the more likely they are to be adopted.
Black children in fact enter the care system four months earlier than
white children, on average as babies, contrary to what the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones, said about the age of children entering the care
system. We believe that with the best intentions in the world, social
workers are trying too often to make perfect matches and taking the

however, that Amendment 12 is more accurate since it recognises the
different position of Wales, whereas my amendment was entirely devoted

ethnicity, culture and so on is not just a question of black, white or
brown. I happen to know Kenya quite well and there are 45 tribes and, I
think, 47 languages there. It is totally different from Ghana or
Nigeria, and so different from Jamaica. It would be very difficult to
put a black child from Kenya with a black family from Jamaica. It would
be much easier to put them with a white family. I have experienced the
difficulties of a black family of whom the son, who is mixed race, is
my godson, of whom I am extremely proud, and his black mother in the
Cayman Islands had a very rough time because she came—according
to the people in the Cayman Islands—who were black, from the
trees. So when we are talking about ethnicity, we are not talking about
black, white or brown, or indeed people from south-east Asia, whether
they are Vietnamese, Malaysian or whatever it may be. What we are
looking at is their cultural background, their ethnicity—and the
ethnicity, as I say, of one black tribe. Indeed, those who come from

racial differences. These need to be understood and recognised, and

which I totally understand and with which I agree, that in the past
there have been efforts to put a black child with a black family,
regardless of their ethnicity, they are now saying that we must not
consider it at all. That is a step too far, and I am very concerned

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments
14 to 17 in my name in relation to Clause 3, which, as we have heard,
grants the Secretary of State a new power to direct local authorities
to outsource their adopter recruitment services to another local
authority or to a registered adoption agency by amending the relevant
part of the Adoption 
<?notus-xml column=36?>and Children Act 2002. We understand that the driver for the Government
seeking these powers is to tackle the shortage of people approved to
adopt. Certainly, we share this starting point with the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interest to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and it
is clear that there is deep concern about these provisions and where
they might be taking adopter recruitment services in the future. For
me, that is the key issue, as I will explain. I have no disagreement in
principle with the power for the Secretary of State to intervene in
individual underperforming local authorities as in subsection (3)(a) of
new Section 3A under Clause 3. As a Minister, I issued many such
directions. Indeed, my first point is that there already are
substantial powers of intervention, including the ability of the
Government to outsource services when local authorities are
underperforming. Perhaps the Minister will explain why these powers in
subsection (3)(a) are
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000082">However,
it is difficult to see how intervening in an individual local authority
can solve or address the wider problem of the national
shortage of potential adopters, which brings me to the powers under
subsection (3)(b) and (3)(c) and where our concerns lie.
Those powers would give the Secretary of State the power to remove
responsibility for adopter recruitment either from entire categories of
local authorities or from all local authorities at a stroke
completely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:18:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000083">There
are both practical reasons and reasons of principle why those two
powers are problematic. First, on the practical reasons, local
authorities currently recruit and approve about 80% of adopters. Moving
many or all local authorities from this task would seriously compromise
the adoption system when there is already an acknowledged shortage of
adopters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:18:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000084">Secondly,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, elegantly pointed out, the
voluntary and not-for-profit sector has made it clear that it does not
have the capacity to take on the recruitment of the numbers of adopters
that would be needed. The third reason is very important. Given that
local authorities would retain responsibility for the placement of
children and for seeing them through to adoption, it seems to me to be
wholly undesirable that they should have no stake in the adopter
recruitment process. We actually want local authorities to be more
willing to use adopters approved by other agencies. This is more likely
to happen if local authorities retain some responsibility for
recruitment and are still part of the adoption system so there are some
strong, practical reasons that I would like the Minister to
address.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13100982000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000085">In
discussion with the Minister this week, he said that the problem of
adopter shortage was not in any case primarily one of underperformance
by individual local authorities. In his view this was system failure at
the national level, particularly because of the disincentives for local
authorities to recruit more adopters than they need for their own
individual populations and the reluctance, as he perceived it, of
agencies to work collaboratively. Again, there have been really
positive moves in that direction, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee,
pointed out, albeit perhaps recently. That might be so: it might be
system failure, as the Minister said, and if the Government wish to
review adopter 
<?notus-xml column=37?>recruitment and propose a radically different system, they are of course
entirely free to do so. But if the Government wish to come forward with
a new system that would take responsibility for adopter recruitment
away from local authorities and give it to some new or different kind
of agency, I put it to the Minister that they should come to Parliament
with those proposals now for wider scrutiny and debate.</hs_para>

objections to subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c) are therefore fundamentally
ones of principle. It seems quite wrong to go partway along that path
to pave the way for wholesale outsourcing or privatisation of adopter
recruitment through the negative resolution procedure set out here
without spelling out for Members what the endgame here is. I asked the
Minister whether he had a vision of where he would like these services
to end up and he said no, he did not. However, I cannot see the point
of the power in subsection (3)(c) unless the Government have at least
some desire, if not the intention, to move towards providing the
recruitment of adopter services in a very different
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000087">In our
view, the powers in subsections (3)(b) and (3)(c) are a step too far
unless the Government set out their further vision. Our Amendment 14
would delete them from the clause. Amendments 15, 16 and 17 would
address the issues that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised were
the Government to retain the ability simply to intervene in an
individual authority by instituting: that it should be by the
affirmative resolution procedure; for the Secretary of State to give
reasons for direction and to allow the authority to ask for a review;
and for the Secretary of State to revoke any direction should he desire
so. Amendment 17 would address the point that the direction should be
based on the quality or performance of the local authority in providing
these
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000088">With
those amendments, this would be a reasonable and proportionate

Storey (LD):</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, it really is important that
we do what is best for the potentially adopted child or young person.
If we consider this carefully, we can see where some—I would use
the word “some”—local authorities have been very
poor in this respect. That is in the amount of time taken, the lack of
care and attention to detail and the way things are organised. Quite
frankly, that is not good enough but it is a very small proportion of
local authorities. As we have heard, 80% of placements are carried out
by local authorities, which themselves recognise the need for changes
to be made in how some of them operate. Many have been hallmarks of
good practice and have been highly praised by the Government and the
voluntary sector. So the notion that the Secretary of State is given
the power to say that all local authorities should cease placement is
concerning to me, and I wonder why it is there.</hs_para>

agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, that this is some plot by
the Government to privatise adoption—surely they would

<?notus-xml column=38?>everything to the voluntary sector, because we know that the voluntary
sector has said, “No, we don’t want to do that, and even
if we did we wouldn’t be able to cope with it”. I am
surprised that the noble Baroness would even consider such a daft
notion. No, I think that this is about the Government. I well remember
David Cameron, our Prime Minister, saying in the early days,
“Look, I am concerned at the time that some potential adopters
have to wait before all the paperwork and the processes are carried
out”, and he was right to say that.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:25:49"></hs_TimeCode> part of

you give the Secretary of State—maybe Michael Gove’s
successor in two, three or five years’ time—the power to
come along with these draconian powers is quite concerning, and
actually not in the best interests of children. I hope that, if we want
to ensure changes, the Government will look at how we learn from best
practice in local authorities and in the voluntary sector—not
all the voluntary sector is perfect in this, of course; we think that
because the tag is “voluntary sector”, they must be
fantastic, but not all the voluntary sector is. We must learn best
practice from the voluntary sector and from local authorities, and
constantly lift the bar and learn and disseminate those best practices

I may respectfully say so, are overly elaborate. I would have thought
that it would be a good idea, if the Secretary of State had to give a
direction, that such a direction gave the opportunity to the local
authority to judicially review the Government if it thought that the
direction was out of order under administrative law proposals. So I am
not at all happy about these current amendments. I believe that the

particularly in the light of the changes that are currently being made
in the adoption system.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:28:49"></hs_TimeCode> would put a
caveat next to that comment, because I think that we all believe that
an extra month taken to find the “forever family” for a
child waiting on the adoption list is a month too long. We do not want
to increase delays; indeed, we want to shorten the period as much as
possible, while at the same time getting it right. In the light of the
fact that so many changes are taking place—local authorities are
working together and the Government have already put changes in
place—the clause as it stands should not be implemented until
those changes have been allowed a reasonable amount of time to bed in.

those duties to someone else who can do it better in the interests of

long as there was some way for local authorities, first, to know what
was expected of them and, secondly, to be able to review in some
way—it could be a judicial review; I take the point made by the
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss—if they believed
that the decision was wrong. In natural justice, you have to have some
sort of appeal process. However, the idea of the Secretary of State

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I have listened with great
interest to this debate. I remember the last days of the previous
Government, when there was a great deal of concern from the Minister
responsible at the lack of uptake by local authorities of voluntary
adoption agencies. She repeated on several occasions, “The
evidence is there; the outcomes are better; but it seems that local
authorities have the perception that going down that route is more
expensive”. Again, there was some debate about the research, but
I think it pointed to the fact that in fact it was no more expensive
than using local authority adopters. This is just a detail, but I would
be interested to know what progress has been made—maybe the
noble Baroness mentioned this and I may have missed it in what she was
saying—in making better use of voluntary adoption agencies.

Benjamin:</Member></B> My Lords, much of Clause 3 is perfectly
reasonable. It would allow the Secretary of State to take action
against local authorities that were 
<?notus-xml column=40?>failing in their duties to recruit adopters by removing those powers
from them—quite rightly, too, as long as that is done in a fair
way and takes account of steps that local authorities might be taking
to improve. There is, after all, an adoption crisis in the country,
which the Minister has pointed out, and some local authorities are not
stepping up to the plate.</hs_para>

children’s charities such as Barnardo’s—I declare
an interest as one of its vice-presidents—as well as the Local
Government Association have concerns about the fact that the Bill as it
stands would allow the Secretary of State to remove responsibility for
adopter recruiting from all local authorities. This proposal has caused
alarm, which could lead to chaos in the adoption system. There is no
guarantee that external providers would be able or willing to take on
these services immediately, and any delays across the system will
severely damage the chances of some of the country’s most
vulnerable children of being adopted. Of course local authorities
should be held to account; it is right that the Government can
intervene if they are not doing their job properly. However, Clause 3
as it stands effectively allows the collective punishment of local
authorities, and this punishment, as Barnardo’s and others have
pointed out, would not even solve the problem but would make it worse.
I urge the Government to consider Clause 3 very carefully and remove it
from these
provisions.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_09_PT_1/DEACC2F0B50B6422A0D29C90AE587333B3F9C5DF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 October 2013">Wednesday,

Eccles (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, there are fundamental problems
with this clause. As has been said, there is no appeal against
directions; the recipient must comply, and promptly. There is no
parliamentary scrutiny of directions, and for these reasons directions
are usually confined to failures in administration, a point made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Hughes. I think we all understand that the
Treasury is very good at setting out directions about how you should
write your accounts. There is not much point in arguing with the
Treasury about that matter of administration, but in my view directions
are not suitable to implement a change in policy of this type. That is
exactly what this clause empowers the Executive to do—change
policy. The point has already been made that there is therefore a point
of principle here, and I would be grateful for the Minister’s
response. Given everything that has gone on, the dissatisfactions or
doubts that might emerge between central government and local
government could and should perfectly well be settled in the normal
course of business. As has been said, Clause 3 goes one step too far,
and I could not support
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000101"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13100982000272" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000272">Lord
Nash:</Member></B> I begin with the proposal to remove the clause, but
most of what I will say is also relevant to all the amendments. I think
that we would all agree that we have an undoubted problem in the narrow
but important function of recruiting, assessing and approving a
sufficient number of prospective adopters. The statistics are stark. As
I have already said, the average length of time that it takes for a
child to be adopted from entering the care system is two years and
seven months, and of course this conceals many children who do not get
adopted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000102">My
noble friend Lord Storey said that there is poor performance by local
authorities in only a minority of cases, but I respectfully suggest
that the figure of two 
<?notus-xml column=41?>years and seven months denies that. However, I agree with him that there
is good practice: in West Berkshire, for instance, the figure is a year
and a month. I question why many if not all local authorities cannot do

the end of March this year, there were 6,000 children with placement
orders waiting to move in with a permanent family. This is 15% higher
than a year previously. When compared with the 3,980 children adopted
from care last year, one can see that this is a very significant
backlog. Indeed, one cannot conclude from this backlog anything other

order to find families for all the children waiting to be adopted, we
have estimated that we would need around 2,000 more adopters than are
currently approved and waiting to be matched. We would then need at
least a further 700 additional adopters each year to meet the growing
demand from children waiting. Ofsted data tell us that in the year
ending March 2012 just over 25,000 enquiries about becoming an adopter
were received, but these resulted in only around 4,000 applications to
become an adopter—a 16% conversion rate, which I suggest is very

size of the recruitment gap requires us to take radical and immediate
action to resolve the underlying problems within the system. These were
set out in our January publication, <I>Further Action on Adoption</I>.
We currently have around 175 adoption agencies, many operating at too
small a scale to be efficient, yet they have no incentive to expand and
meet the needs of children outside their local area. Even worse, some
local authorities turn away prospective adopters because they do not
need them

further problem is that, while some local authorities work in
constructive partnerships with voluntary adoption agencies, too many
commission from them only as a last resort. In large part, this is a
consequence of local authorities acting as both a provider and
commissioner of adoption services. By this, I mean that they are trying
to find or commission adoptive parents on behalf of the child while
simultaneously trying to recruit or provide those same parents. There
are also issues around the level of fees that are paid to voluntary
adoption
agencies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000107">These
underlying problems have resulted in a system that fails us in national
terms; a system that is unable to make best use of the national supply
of potential adopters or respond effectively to the needs of vulnerable
children waiting for a loving home and a system that provides no
incentives to individual organisations to address a national shortage
of adopters. These problems are not the fault of the individual
adoption agencies concerned. Indeed, many are doing their best to rise
to the challenge and we know that there are some good examples of
partnership working between different agencies:</hs_para>

solution. It is not a solution in itself. As I said to the noble
Baroness earlier this week, there is no dark plan and no end game. The
fact is that the system is working poorly and erratically. There is
good practice and there is clearly bad practice. Adopter recruitment
could clearly be done more efficiently and on a greater scale, which
may involve working more closely together. Of course, the sector may
take time to develop and recognise that, which is why we have funded
voluntary adoption agencies substantially in order to stimulate them.

to Amendments 14, 16 and 17, Clause 3 is not therefore intended to
tackle cases of poor performance or service failure within individual
local authorities. Our recruitment problem is not the result of
individual failure and, if it was, the Secretary of State already has
substantial powers to intervene. We therefore do not consider that the
amendments, which would effectively use Clause 3 as an additional
intervention power for a small number of local authorities, are
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000113">I

substantial. I also acknowledge the view of the Delegated Powers and

the Committee that I am keen to continue to listen to views as to how

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a small amendment but it
concerns an important point. Clause 4 takes us to adoption
support services and the proposal for personal budgets. It requires a
local authority to prepare a personal budget if asked to do so by the
recipient of adoption support. My amendment would simply say: if asked
to do so “at any time”. That is because I wanted to put
before the Committee the possibility that problems may arise at any
time and may manifest themselves at any time—for instance, when
a young person who has been adopted as a child reaches adolescence.
There are Members of this Committee who are far better qualified than I
am to describe this sort of circumstance. My drafting is not very good
and I acknowledge that the clause as drafted does not limit the
timeframe, but I wanted to raise the issue and to ask the Minister what
reassurances he can give with regard to support being available for as
long as it is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

perhaps I could comment on Amendment 19, which either the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones, or the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, is about to
speak to, on the use of prescribed agencies. This amendment proposes
regulations regarding agencies from which adoption support services can
be purchased. I wondered whether that might be—while showing an
understandable concern about quality, which I assume is what this is
about—a bit too prescriptive. Personal budgets are about choice
and personal responsibility and I was not very clear whether this
actually fitted with the philosophy of personal budgets. I also
wondered whether paragraph (i), which deals with the conditions that
have to be complied with on direct payment, might not cover their
concerns. Personal budgets are increasingly used in various areas of
social care, but they are still developing as a way of working. It is
also right to put on record that the Local Government Association is
concerned that the clause is not commenced until findings from pilots
are available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:52:25"></hs_TimeCode>. I

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, we have two amendments in
this group, Amendments 19 and 270. Amendment 19 is about the principle
of personal budgets. Endorsing the view of the noble Baroness, Lady
Hamwee, we welcome the overall approach of making personal budgets
available to empower families and adopted children. The idea of
personal budgets has been common and has been extending in care
packages for children with disabilities for some time. When properly
funded and organised, they have the capacity to give families greater
flexibility and reduce the administrative burden on local authorities,
so we see their
advantages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:53:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment was attempting not to be too prescriptive but to widen the
scope of the use of the budgets. I am happy to go away and make sure
that we have the correct wording in that respect. We were concerned to
ensure that barriers would not be placed by local authorities on how
the budgets could be used. While agreeing that this is a positive
proposal, we are seeking clarification in new Section 4A(4) as to where
the services can be bought from. Many voluntary adoption agencies offer
adoption support services to their own adoptive families and presumably
to local authority services. Sensibly, Clause 4 would allow these
services to be bought by local authority adopters or by voluntary
agencies. As it stands, new Section 4A(4)(e) refers
to,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13100982000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000231">“the

this indicates that no restriction is intended, it would be clearer and

non-public sector agencies. Again, just for clarification, that is what
we are intending to do—to extend the
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T18:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>. We
believe that that would provide greater flexibility and choice for

use of personal budgets is welcomed in a broader sense, it does not in
itself address the lack of adequate available support, which can of
itself lead to adoption delays. For example, TACT has been in contact,
telling us that it knows of adopters who have delayed seeking a final
adoption order as they are unhappy with the support that they will
receive afterwards. While the child remains in the care system, they
have access to services that are not available after adoption.

our amendment as a point of principle—we want to offer more

adoptive parents will be able to purchase services from. These are
adoption agencies and adoption support agencies. As the noble Baroness
will know, an adoption agency is a local authority or a voluntary
adoption agency. An individual can also provide adoption support
services if they are under contract with a registered adoption support
agency, an adoption agency, a local health board or a primary care
trust. I hope that that reassures her in terms of

extra funding should give both local authorities and adopters a sense

to deliver these specialist interventions to some of our most
vulnerable children, as my noble friend Lord Nash referred to just now.
We will also be giving adoptive parents the choice to use their

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak first to Amendment
21, tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones. I
understand their concerns and must make it clear that these fostering
for adoption placements will be fostering placements, not adoptive
placements. This clause seeks only to improve the likelihood of local
authorities finding a potential fostering for adoption placement for
children for whom such a placement has not been found locally. It will
remain the case that a child cannot be placed for adoption without
parental consent or a court making a placement order.</hs_para>

that the details of children being considered for a fostering for
adoption placement will be held in a separate section of the register.
This is to ensure that their details can be seen only by the register
staff, social workers and approved prospective adopters who have
expressed a willingness to care for a child on a fostering for adoption
basis. Noble Lords may recall that the 2002 Act provides for the
register to assist with placing children for purposes other than
adoption, as well as for adoption. The inclusion of children who are
being considered for adoption in the register is one way in which this
original design can be realised. I hope that the Committee will be
reassured by our proposals and I therefore urge the noble Baronesses to
withdraw their amendment.</hs_para>

was also tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, I
can understand the desire to ensure that there is a parliamentary
debate before the regulations are made enabling approved prospective
adopters to search information on the register. The Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that regulations made under
proposed Section 128A in Clause 6(4) should be subject to the
affirmative procedure. The Government have listened to the concerns of
noble Lords. We have responded to the recommendation from the committee
by introducing government Amendment 22, so that the affirmative
procedure is used to make regulations for the first use of the power.
The safeguards relating to arrangements for approved prospective
adopters to access the register are included in the first set of
regulations that we intend to make, 
<?notus-xml column=50?>which I have published for your Lordships to consider. This means that
under the Government’s proposal, noble Lords will have the
opportunity to debate them in
full.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0001.htm#13100982000149">The
Government believe that any subsequent changes to these regulations
should be subject to the negative resolution procedure because those
changes should be minor in nature and will not represent significant
reforms. The reforms that we are introducing are in fact an extension
of arrangements already in place elsewhere in the adoption system.
Approved prospective adopters are already able to access the details of
children through hard copy and online publications such as <I>Be My
Parent</I>, published by the British Association for Adoption and
Fostering, or <I>Children Who Wait</I>, published by Adoption UK.
Professor Elaine Farmer’s investigation into family finding and
matching identified that in 30% of cases, delay was associated with
unwillingness to seek a family outside a local authority’s own
group of approved prospective adopters. We believe that these
improvements to the register, which allow approved prospective adopters
to be actively engaged in the matching process, will lead to a greater
number of matches being made more quickly, particularly for those
children who may be harder to place. The register already generates
around 10% of all matches nationally.</hs_para>

indicated that is not persuaded that the first set of regulations,
where we are content to use the affirmative procedure, is sufficient.
This is because the DPRRC considers that substantive changes may be
required in the light of the pilots. We will consider this advice and
return to the matter on Report. I therefore ask the noble Baronesses to

the Minister said about Amendment 21. We have common ground, in that we
all want to speed up the process of adoption, but our concern is that
if children are being placed on the register when no final decision has
been made, for those children there may be a period of stress and
unhappiness that premature decisions are being made on their behalf. I
am not sure that the Minister really addressed that matter. It is about
the psychology as much as the organisation of the register. We are keen
to make sure that people know their rights, are clear that decisions
are being made appropriately and at the right time and are being
followed through in the right way. We may want to return to this matter

light of the father’s unexpected death, this young man would
like to continue the search on his father’s behalf, and he would

of reasons why someone might want to have information. It is not just
that adoption has become much more transparent over fairly recent
years—it used to be a case of “leave well alone”.
It is understood not just that there are practical or medical reasons
but that the understanding of one’s relationship with

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that most of the
points have been made, but I want to go back to the days when some of
us were engaged in the 2002 legislation. The noble Baroness, Lady
Walmsley, will remember that when we were trying to get some of these
provisions through, this cohort of people were among those who had not
been prepared in the same way as those who have been prepared
thereafter. However, the world has changed significantly since 2002,
particularly in relation to health information, as both my colleagues
have pointed out. It is a human right for an individual to know about
their genealogy and therefore to be able to trace issues relating to
health. This will be particularly true of girls and breast cancer, when
different kinds of medical intervention will be available. Although I
understand the sensitivities, we are not asking for access for
absolutely everybody, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, pointed out;
we are asking for an intermediary. When that route is not taken,
individuals attempt to find out by other ways. I have a story of a man
turning up at the gate of his birth father—a very eminent
man—and saying, “I am your son”, having found out
by other ways, and being told, “You may be, but I don’t
want to know you”. One can see how an intermediary could have
made a real difference to that relationship and the hurt that can come
from that kind of situation.</hs_para>

put right. It is absurd that everyone else can find out except the
descendants—so you can go and get someone else to do it for you.
It just needs ironing out, and the arguments that I have heard so far
have

Nash:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend Lady Hamwee, the noble and

Howarth, for bringing this important matter to the Government’s

Select Committee on Adoption Legislation and through this proposed

entirely understand why the descendants of adopted people may want to
find out more about their biological heritage, particularly where there
may be a hereditary medical condition. The Government are open to the
possibility of reform in this area, but we believe that more detailed
thought is needed about the implications and practicalities of any
legislative change. For example, we must think carefully about how more
information might be provided to descendants, and we need to balance
this against the rights and wishes of the adopted adults themselves and
their birth families.</hs_para>

enable descendants of an adopted person to find out about the adopted
person’s background. It applies to those adopted before
commencement of the 2002 Act. Such adoptions were carried out privately
and secretly, with very little information shared with the adopted
child or his or her birth parents. If a mother, who may never have told
anyone about an adoption, was approached out of the blue by her son
asking about his adoption, that could have a devastating effect on the
individual and the whole family.</hs_para>

provision it could open the floodgates or that the new clause would
lead to unwelcome contact. The answer is that we do not have any

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may reinforce, if it is
necessary because I think that it will be clear enough in
<I>Hansard</I>, the point made by the noble and learned Baroness. The
Minister’s scenario is exactly that which we are seeking to
avoid with this amendment. I am sorry that the Minister has not been
able to explain the points about sensitivity and complexity on which
the Government are relying. He has told the Committee that the
Government will give the issue more detailed thought. I think I have
got it right that the Government will consider how detailed information
should be made available to the descendant of an adopted person. I do
not believe that it is for the Government to think and advise how
information should be made available to that person. Quite rightly, in
2002, the Government set up the structure of involving an
intermediary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0002.htm#13100982000178">Of
course, I cannot press the matter to a vote tonight because we do not
do that in Grand Committee. It would be remiss of me not to ask the
Minister if it might be possible for me to meet him following this
stage to reinforce and perhaps explain better than I was able to do in
what I appreciate might have been a rather rushed introduction. Perhaps
we may meet before Report to see if there is a way in which we can work
with him to be as persuasive as possible to the Law Commission, if that
is the way it is to go, that it should take on this work. I do not know
what private as distinct from public communications there may be with
the Law Commission. I certainly would not ask the Minister to say so
tonight, but it is morally and practically wrong not to sort out what
the noble and learned Baroness so rightly describes as an
anomaly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100982000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0002.htm#13100982000179"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13100982000295" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-gc0002.htm#13100982000295">Lord

I am announcing to the House that the six-week period of the Somerset
TB control pilot cull was completed on 6 October. Current indications
suggest that the pilot has been safe, humane and effective in
delivering a reduction in the badger population of just under 60 per
cent. We set ourselves a challenging target of aiming to ensure that 70
per cent of the badger population was removed during the pilot. The
Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) has advised that the 60 per cent
reduction this year will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a
4-year cull. However, Natural England are considering an application
from Somerset for a short extension of the culling period, as provided
for under the agreement with the Company. The advice of the CVO is that
further increasing the number of badgers culled would improve those
benefits even further and enable them to accrue earlier.</hs_para>

vessels have continued to make multiple illegal incursions into British
Gibraltar territorial waters (BGTW), a situation which has been ongoing
since April
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100955000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-wms0001.htm#13100955000067">These
actions and threats are wholly unacceptable. The impact of the border
delays has been felt most severely by local citizens, both
Gibraltarians and the thousands of Spanish commuters who benefit from
employment in Gibraltar. As well as having to endure long delays in hot
weather, people crossing the border have reported aggressive behaviour
by the teams of 
<?notus-xml column=32?>guardia civil officers brought from other parts of Spain to conduct the
enhanced checks. There have been disturbing reports of
Gibraltar-licensed cars being burnt or otherwise vandalised in Spain.
The ban on importing certain materials is having an impact on
infrastructure projects and the reduction in the number of people able
to cross the border has reduced retail sales, having a negative impact
on Gibraltar’s economic
prosperity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100955000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-wms0001.htm#13100955000068">These
measures are disproportionate and obviously politically motivated,
having been introduced immediately after the lawful creation by the
Government of Gibraltar of an artificial reef in BGTW. They are also
unlawful under EU law: the creation of the reef was legal and is part
of the Government of Gibraltar’s long-term marine environmental
management plan designed to improve fish stocks and regenerate habitat.
The use of inert concrete blocks to create artificial reefs is
consistent with international best practice and with the Government of
Spain’s own approach to artificial
reefs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100955000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-wms0001.htm#13100955000069">The

Government is publishing its response to the consultation today. The
Government is introducing amendments to the Financial Services (Banking
Reform) Bill to establish the new Payment Systems Regulator as a
separate body under the FCA. The Payment Systems Regulator will have
objectives to promote competition, innovation and the interests of
end-users. The Regulator will be able to oversee any payment system
operating in the UK that is brought into scope by being designated by
HM Treasury. Once a payment system is designated, the Payment Systems
Regulator will have a range of powers over its participants (operators,
infrastructure providers and payment service providers that provide
payment services using the system), in order to advance its
objectives.</hs_para>

Regulator will have powers to make requirements regarding rules for the
operation of designated systems, and to give directions to participants
in such systems. It will also have specific powers to require direct
and indirect access to designated systems, and to vary agreements
relating to such systems (including fees, charges and terms and
conditions). The Payment Systems Regulator will also have enforcement
powers to publish details of compliance failure, to impose financial
penalties in respect of a compliance failure, and to require owners of
payment systems to dispose of their interests in them, subject to HM
Treasury approval. The Regulator will also have concurrent Competition
Act powers to enforce the Competition Act 1998 prohibitions against
anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominance, and to make Market
Investigation References to the Competition and Markets
Authority.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13100955000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009-wms0001.htm#13100955000113">I

convened a meeting of international leaders to discuss what more

so. We will continue to monitor the state of religious freedom in these
countries, and in Iraq and Syria and will respond either bilaterally or
with other international partners—whichever we judge will be
most effective in each case. With EU partners we will also table a

line with the joint HIS NOMS strategy 'Making Prisons Work: Skills for
Rehabilitation' NOMS has introduced an outcome achievement payment
system in line with the mainstream learning and skills environment. The
payment and reward model is not based on hours per week delivered but
achievement of units and qualifications, and ultimately on job and
reduced re-offending outcomes. The 'Transforming Youth Custody —
Putting education at the heart of detention’ consultation paper
published on 14 February this year, set out the Government's vision for
Secure Colleges, ensuring that young offenders are equipped with the
skills, qualifications and self-discipline they need to stop offending

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl

supports a requirement to license nicotine containing products (NCPs),
including electronic cigarettes, under the medicines regulatory
framework, through European Union legislation. This position will need
to take account of the final form of any legislation. Pending the
adoption of a revised Tobacco Products Directive the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency continues to encourage companies
voluntarily to license NCPs on the basis of presentation and will
continue to decide on whether products are medicinal products on a case
by case basis. This is intended to ensure that products are available
that meet appropriate standards of safety, quality and efficacy to help
users cut down their smoking and to quit. The European Commission has
said it expects the new legislation to be adopted in 2014 and for it to
come into effect in the UK from
2016.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13100962000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131009w0001.htm#13100962000134">Unlicensed
