rural areas, where it can be a lifeline. That is why it is important
for it to be entrenched in the Postal Services Act 2011. For other
postal services such as access to posting parcels and so on, the
Government have promised to ensure that we maintain the network of more
than 11,500 post offices. That is in stark contrast to the closure of
thousands of post offices across the country by the previous

that the growth we are experiencing is balanced. We are now beginning

like to raise the issue of access to the House at busy times. Even on a
day like today, when we are about to debate interest rate swap
derivatives, there is a lot of interest among angry constituents. Have
you noticed that recently the queues to get into the House for meetings
with Members of Parliament have sometimes been an hour and a half to
two hours long? That is new. Will you get someone to look into why
these queues are so long? I am told it is not a matter of security, but
something else. The House should be more
accessible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102448000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0001.htm#13102448000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13102448000214" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0001.htm#13102448000214">Mr

am surprised to be back here 15 months after the first debate on this
important issue. I appreciate the Backbench Business

time to debate it. The first debate made a significant difference.

sector were refusing to acknowledge that there was an issue that needed
to be dealt with. A few days after the first debate, that changed and a
pilot scheme was announced.</hs_Para>

who have followed this issue carefully are aware that the pilot scheme
found that approximately 91% of cases investigated between July 2012
and January 2013 had a technical mis-selling, so the process has
highlighted the mis-selling of these products. The House should take
some comfort in knowing that securing the second debate has also
resulted in a significant concession from the banking sector. Members
of the all-party group on interest rate mis-selling have argued long
and hard that the redress scheme had a central flaw, which is that the
technical redress for the mis-selling of interest rate swap derivatives
and the consequential losses were linked within the redress scheme.
That gave the banks in question a significant advantage, because small
businesses facing heavy cash-flow problems were inclined perhaps, under
the scheme as it stood, to accept an offer of technical redress without
fighting hard over consequential losses, simply because they were
desperate for the cash.</hs_Para>

“Oh well, the 8% simple interest paid for the redress payment is
sufficient compensation for the consequential losses.” Does he
accept what must be blindingly obvious—that no bank seeking
redress for a loss that it had unfairly suffered and then seeking
compensation for consequential losses would dream of ever seeing the
two rolled up together? What is sauce for the goose must be sauce for

message that this debate needs to send out is that if a business wants
to request a suspension, it has to be in financial distress. Some banks
are stating that a business requesting a suspension is admitting to
being distressed and therefore needs to go into special measures. Any
small business would be loth to find itself dependent on a team of

delays are the reason that we called this debate, but I also want to
highlight other concerns that have been expressed about the redress

key issue is the sophistication test. I acknowledge the need 
<?notus-xml column=460?>for such a test. Huge businesses can derive benefits from these
products, and they will have the sophistication and expertise to
understand what they are being sold. However, there is concern about
the decision to introduce a sophistication test as part of the redress
scheme.</hs_Para>

who takes out a swap in excess of £10 million will be excluded
from the scheme because they will be deemed to be sophisticated. The
FCA has found that a key aspect of mis-selling involves banks
over-hedging loans taken out by businesses. In other words, a business
might have a loan facility of £5 million but a hedge in excess
of £10 million. In such a situation, the fact that the bank was
guilty of mis-selling would provide it with protection within the

when cases are accepted into the redress scheme, they seem to be taking
a long time. The banks would argue that businesses need to engage with
them, but I believe we still need to look carefully at this matter.

discrepancy involves the asset value. A business could be excluded from

could be argued that a business that had been lucky enough to invest in
property at the right time should be excluded from the redress scheme

is also a lack of consistency. In some cases, the banks are ignoring
the sophistication test because they believe that a customer would fail
it and therefore be eligible for the redress scheme. Instead, they are
moving the customer straight into the assessment of redress. If they
can ignore the sophistication test in some cases, where is the
consistency? <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T11:43:20"></hs_TimeCode>A

final point on the sophistication test is that, if a business spends
six months waiting to be assessed, those six months will be lost in
regard to the statute of limitations for taking legal action. The FCA

further concern relates to the alternative products on offer. It has
been said time and again that if these complex products are unsuitable,
it cannot be right to introduce a redress scheme in which a swap can be
substituted by a slightly less complicated swap. It is also 
<?notus-xml column=461?>important to note that a business will be offered an alternative product
only if it has failed the sophistication test—that is, if it has
been deemed to be unsophisticated. I find it difficult to understand

suitable.</hs_Para>

reason why the cap is the obvious alternative product is that if
businesses had been told clearly of the cost of the products they were
taking on board back in 2006-07, they would have seen that a cap would
have offered them significantly better value for money. Why was the cap
not offered? Probably because of the financial imperative of the banks
to sell something more complex and more rewarding. It is thus important
to highlight the fact that having a complex derivative rather than a
cap as alternative product is a real concern. If businesses have been
classified as unsophisticated, that issue should be recognised and we
should try to ensure that we provide a cap as the only acceptable

to provide an appeals process for another bank in it. That may not be
perfect, but it would help to avoid over-complicating what is already a
complicated redress process and it would give businesses the confidence
that there is an appeal process and that they can turn to somebody else
to argue their case. We should be very concerned about having a redress
scheme without any appeal process, as it goes against the principle of
natural justice, while opening up the door to litigation, when the
whole point of the redress scheme was supposed to be to avoid
litigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T11:48:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000054">Embedded
or hidden swaps, which are currently excluded from the redress scheme,
are another key issue to highlight and a matter of huge concern. If we
think about it, a hidden swap is quite possibly worse because
businesses were not even aware that they were also taking out with
their fixed-rate loan an interest rate derivative product. The American
author, James Riley once
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102453000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000600">“If

same point needs to be made about these hedging products. If the impact
of an embedded swap is the same as the impact of a separate hedging
product taken out with it, it is difficult to argue that the small
businesses that were sold those products should be excluded because of
a technicality relating to whether they are subject to the FCA
regulations. I ask the Minister to respond on that specific
issue.</hs_Para>

publican from Aberystwyth, Mansel Beechy, was sold one of these

in Aberystwyth, I was financially illiterate and used to cash cheques
in the pub. I used to do that on a Wednesday evening and pay 50p for
the privilege. On a Saturday evening, I would want to cash a cheque
again, and Mansel would say, “Well, make it one for £30,
and I will give you back what you gave me on Wednesday, only charging
you the 50p once.” Mansel Beechy thus showed me more respect and
consideration, in behaving properly towards me, than the bank that sold
him the hidden swap showed to him. That business had been built up over
a long period. If Mansel Beechy could show to me a degree of
responsibility that had not been shown to him, there is clearly
something wrong with our banking

issue of hidden swaps is important and needs to be addressed. We need
to know why businesses to which they were mis-sold have been excluded
from the redress scheme. Thousands of businesses have been mis-sold
these products, banks have admitted that the products were mis-sold,
and yet the redress scheme is not, as yet, performing as it should. I

mother. He has lost absolutely everything, and because his business was
a limited company, it is highly unlikely that even if the redress
scheme highlights the fact that he was mis-sold the product and is in
need of compensation, he will not benefit from that compensation
personally. I think it wholly wrong for someone to lose his business
not because he was a poor business man, not because he made a mistake,

has done a very big job to support, and I hope that today’s
debate will mean that if the FCA is listening and if the banks are
listening, they will do something about these people, and
quickly.</hs_Para>

wish to develop a couple of points, the first of which has started to
resolve itself. I am talking about the big question of the linking of
consequential loss to the technical redress. Clearly, the technical
redress is people’s money—that is an agreed thing, and it
is only right that it should be paid as soon as possible. The
consequential loss was always a separate issue, and to have linked it
was completely the wrong thing to have done. HSBC has broken ranks and
RBS is following suit, and Martin Wheatley is now coming on board,
saying that there should be no conditionality between the technical
redress and the consequential losses claims. That is a good thing; it
is excellent progress, and we can thank my hon. Friend for his work on

says. The banks made an incredibly cynical effort to persuade people to
enter into these contracts where, in many instances, they should not
have done so. Sometimes it was the right thing to do, and I think that
many businesses will agree that they just got it wrong, but we need to

Garnier:</Member></B> That is absolutely right. Part of the problem,
however, is that the banks have an incentive not to get in touch with
people, for obvious reasons. That relates to the second point I wish to
develop. It is a technical point, but it is incredibly important in
terms of why it is incentivising banks to delay technical redress for
as long as they can, and it has implications for the financial
stability of the banks.</hs_Para>

should not think of these things as stand-alone products, but should
recognise them for what they are. They are not stand-alone products;
there is another side of this trade. They are swaps for a reason, and
it is important to understand what a swap is. Any one of our victims
will have been persuaded to take out a contract with the bank that has
the beneficial effect of capping interest rate payments at a certain
level. That is a 
<?notus-xml column=467?>virtuous thing and we are all familiar with the financial planning
behind the thought process, through things such as fixed-rate
mortgages. But these are not fixed-rate mortgages; they are stand-alone
products that relate to a loan, but are not part of that loan.
Importantly, many people have paid off the loan but still have the
outstanding liability on the swap. The quid pro quo of having a fixed
cap on interest payments is the collar that has caused so many problems
for our victims, whereby they have to pay a relatively high rate of
interest in today’s terms. What is not fully understood is that
this is not a simple contract with the bank, as it first appears. The
bank is not taking a naked bet with its customers that, in the
environment of falling interest rates, it has won. It is not receiving
as profit the penalty in the increased premiums being paid in interest
rates by the victim, because for a swap to actually be a swap, there is
a matching trade with a third party on the other side. What the banks
receive in higher interest rate payments they are paying to an opposing
and third-party counterpart on the other
side.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000089">I
shall now go into a bit more detail. Businesses may want to make sure
that they do not pay too high an interest rate; that is why they are
persuaded, rightly or wrongly, to take the swaps. However, an
organisation such as a pension fund needs to guarantee its income
should a severe drop in interest rates, such as we have seen, occur. It
would want to take a position opposite from that of the businesses,
which are the victims.</hs_Para>

fund will forgo a rise in rates while winning the guaranteed floor rate
that it will receive. For a business to have a rate cap at, say, 7%, it
will guarantee to pay no less than 5%. For a pension fund to be
guaranteed to receive a minimum payment of 5%, it would agree to
receive no more than 7%. In that way, the business’s and pension
fund’s interests are perfectly aligned in opposition.</hs_Para>

pension fund and business are clients of the bank, the bank does two
simultaneous trades—one with the business, to cap and collar the
rate payments, and the other with the pension fund, to collar and cap
the interest rate receipts. The bank makes a small margin, but
essentially its liability, if everything stands up, is perfectly and
oppositely aligned. That is the symmetry of liability and the basis of
the swap

at all, and that is how a swap behaves. Now imagine that, having lined
up that 
<?notus-xml column=468?>trade, he takes the money from the buyer, so has a contractual agreement
with them, and agrees a sale with the seller. However, on the way to
deliver the car, he writes it off in a crash and is not insured. He
still has liabilities on both sides—he still has to deliver a
car to the buyer and has to pay the seller. That is the mess that the

factors—including, crucially, interest rates and time.
Similarly, time to run is a key component of the value of the other

run, the higher its value to the customer and the higher the liability
to the bank. As a result, we get a built in incentive for the banks to
delay settlement for as long as possible. With each day that goes by,

were being sold, allied to another product, that may or may not have
been suitable for the person buying them. The customer may or may not
have fully understood what they were buying, but they were left fully
with the consequences of having bought it, to the extent that we had
the situations highlighted in this debate whereby the banks pursued
customers to such a degree that they were put out of business.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:13:52"></hs_TimeCode>We should
recognise that hedging is not always wrong, and trying to insure
against risks is not always wrong, but a degree of understanding is
important. People have to understand what they are buying and the
product has to be suitable for them. When the lifetime of the hedging
product is completely different from that of the loan, there is a
serious problem about that product’s suitability.</hs_Para>

whether there has been a repeat of the pattern of behaviour that we saw
before in which there was first a refusal to face up to responsibility.
That was followed by increasing anger among the customer base and the
destruction of trust, followed by a redress scheme that might have
ended up being more expensive than the one that might have been put in
place earlier.</hs_Para>

Culturally, we should be trying to get to a situation in which the

developing products that are driven by a sales and bonus culture that,

That leaves a lot to be desired, because unless it is very carefully

is worth highlighting that the banks were able to cancel the
instruments in question when interest rates were going down, but the
customer was unable to cancel them when interest rates were rising. Not
only were sellers incentivised to sell them without much knowledge, but
the financial institutions made the vast majority of the money out of
them on day one, when they were sold. They sold them to the customer
and made money out of the derivative part of the product, and then sold

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr
McFadden), who was part of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards, has talked about the culture in banks and the pressure to
sell complicated products. If a customer buys a product that is not
properly explained, that is surely mis-selling and there should be
redress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:42:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000169">Customers
have been unable to seek redress, or to negotiate with their bank,
because the banks were able to sell on the products at great profit on
day one. The relationship between the customer and the bank therefore
broke down, because when a customer wanted to renegotiate the contract,
they were told that they would have to compensate the bank for not only
the interest rate lost, but the proportion of profit that it had gained
by selling the product on to a third party. The break costs were
impossibly high for many people even to contemplate 
<?notus-xml column=478?>buying their way out of swap products. That breakdown in the
relationship has got us to the position we are in today.</hs_Para>

policy of treating customers fairly, which most of our banks have

manager or anyone else in the banking sector, they are told that their
problems will be dealt with and that everything possible will be done
to resolve them. However, in many of the cases that my constituents
have brought to me, they have not been able to seek proper redress

welcome signs of starting to recover, and the Bank of England is
pushing cheap credit into it to  get the banks to lend, which

have a lifetime’s work in their business—more than one
lifetime in the case of many family businesses, which are the bedrock
of our constituencies. Those people have been key members of the
community and employed many people. Today’s debate is therefore
important, as we need to give the FCA and the Government a strong
message that the authorities must get the banks to get on with it.
Things are going too slowly. As we heard earlier, the banks have put
forward some billions of pounds for compensation, but they have dealt
with only 0.2% of cases. Of the £3 billion that is potentially
available for redress, only £2 million has been paid out to 32
businesses, which shows that we need to speed things
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:47:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000178">In
many cases, first the capital was sucked out of businesses and then the
break clauses were such that many people could not afford to get out of
the contracts. With most normal capitalist activity, if someone felt
they could not make a go of it, they would sell their business on.
However, nobody will buy a business that has the poison pill of an
interest rate hedging product because they know that it is a major drag
on the business. It is not free enterprise as we know it, and I rather

is so tragic about the products in question is that people have no way
out. We need to get on with achieving compensation. Members have made
some good contributions today, and behind every story they have told is
tragedy and worry. People cannot sleep at night because they are not
sure how to deal with the problem. I say to Ministers and the FCA that
we need to get some speed up and get compensation paid. We need to deal
with people fairly, and to support and cherish serial entrepreneurs,
who should be playing a major role in the economy’s recovery,
rather than being put in a position of not knowing what will happen in
a week, six months or a year. We need to give them our

<?notus-xml column=480?>involved in our banking industry, who will be as horrified as everyone
else at what happened with the sale of these products. With the sale of
interest rate hedging products, however, banks allowed their desire to
make a profit to override the need to be open and transparent with
their customers. The sellers of those financial instruments blinded
customers with a snowstorm of financial gobbledegook. They presented a
complex and risky financial product as something that, if people signed
up to it, would be to their benefit. In reality, nothing could be
further from the
truth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000182">Small
companies in my Bury North constituency have been affected, and I want
to outline briefly one particular case—understandably, and for
obvious reasons, many constituents are reluctant to allow their cases
to be made public. Lavender Hotels owns and runs a small chain of
hotels in north-west England. In January 2007, it took out a loan from
Barclays to finance the purchase of another hotel. A couple of months
later, the bank—which Lavender Hotels had banked with for more
than two decades—suggested that it fix its interest rates on the
grounds that no one could predict where interest rates were
heading.</hs_Para>

mentioned rate fixing, collars and caps, and stressed that those were
not a profit earner for the bank but merely designed to give the
customer protection. The bank told the customer that the agreement
could be transferred to another bank, and that it would not create any
obstacle to changing banks. Although the term “rate swap”
was initially used, it was quickly replaced by the term
“fixing”, suggesting that the bank was fixing the
interest rate, rather like a fixed-rate mortgage. The term
“fixing” certainly suggests certainty, not risk, which I
submit was misleading.</hs_Para>

meeting with the relationship manager was followed by a further meeting
with a salesman—although he was never described as
such—who amplified the fears of rising interest rates. At no
point was any explanation given of the penalties that would be payable
if the customer wanted to terminate the agreement. The bank did say,
however, that to fix a cap or collar an upfront fee would have to be
paid, which could be as much as £20,000. Since most customers
thought that such charges were excessive, they decided to go with an
interest rate swap agreement that meant that if interest rates went up,
no charges would be paid at all. The salesman never explained that he
would be earning commission on the deal. Indeed, it was stressed that
it was just a service that Barclays was providing for the benefit of
its
customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000185">The
managing director of the company agreed to fix—as he
thought—the interest rate of around 40% of the company’s
total loans. When interest rates started to reduce, what should have

paid back to Barclays rose dramatically. When the company sought a loan
to purchase another hotel the following year, it was forced to enter
into a 10-year rate swap. The managing director said:</hs_Para>

financial advisers, who would advise on the best course of action for
their business. People were not so naive as to assume that the bank was

regulators, yet we have another scandal that should have been

rack up commission for the bank and its managers—is the cause of
the problems we are discussing today. A shift in culture is welcome,

owners of London and Westcountry Estates Ltd, a company owning several
business parks across the south-west, which is now, after a
lifetime’s work and through no fault of their own, in
administration. In July 2008, RBS insisted that if the company wished
to have its borrowing facility renewed it must enter into a swap
arrangement on the alleged imminent threat of rising interest rates. My
constituents are experts in property, not finance. They were given no
alternative by RBS, so they signed up to a three-year loan and a
10-year swap arrangement. How does that work? It turns out that they
had been persuaded to enter into a swap arrangement for 10 years at a
rate of 6.4%. Although they had been told that the deal contained a
break clause after three years, it transpired that this would enable
the bank only to withdraw, not the customer. They later learned that
breaking the swap arrangement would incur a penalty that seemed to
fluctuate on a daily basis, but would be millions of pounds. None of
this was known to them at the time  of signing the agreement. I

mis-selling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:04:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000205">It
got worse. The loan was bundled up with a number of other troubled
loans and sold on by RBS to a new company, Isabel Assetco Ltd, which
was 25% owned by a US venture capital company called Blackstone and 75%

and funded with £550 million from RBS. A bank owned by the
taxpayer transferred my constituents’ company’s debt at a
discount to a third party company, lending it taxpayers’ money

that my taxpaying constituents had spent years building up. That is an

However, in another constituency case, involving a company established
in south Devon in 1925, the financial ombudsman determined seven weeks
ago that Barclays had mis-sold a swap to the company and ordered it to
put the company back in the same position it would have been in if the
swap had never been sold. Imagine the disappointment on the part of my

last time we debated this subject, I was aware of only three
constituents affected by interest rate swap agreements and described it
then as a niche problem. Since then, however, the number of
constituents affected—that I am aware of—has doubled to
six. While the problem affects only a small number of constituents, the
figures involved are eye watering—for two of my constituents,
the sums run into several million pounds—but what has struck me
is the features they all have in common: they are all small business
people working hard to build up and expand their businesses. Whether in
student lets, the leisure industry or farm diversification, they have
all sought, ostensibly with the help of their banks, to grow their
business, provide more employment and greater opportunity in the local
area and, of course, help our economy. Some have quite impressive
premises; others are literally run out of a garden shed or a room above
the garage, but until they were unwittingly sold a product quite
unsuitable for their circumstances, they had all enjoyed good
relationships with their banks—those frankly are now in
tatters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:15:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000223">Over
the last few days, undoubtedly like other Members, I have suddenly
started receiving updates from the banks about the progress they are
making, setting out how they are compensating customers mis-sold these
products and in my view trying to gloss over what have to date been
quite unacceptable delays. I cannot repeat what the managing director
of the Landish Group, which operates in my constituency and the
constituencies  
<?notus-xml column=487?>of other hon. Members, said to me about the update I forwarded him from
his own bank. Its language was quite unparliamentary, so I will not
repeat his words, but I can understand his frustration.</hs_Para>

heard, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:16:34"></hs_TimeCode> banks
have collectively spent more than £500 million on their own
administrative costs, but in nearly 16 months they have delivered only
a handful of decisions; and only 32 businesses have received any
payments at all. It strikes me that a number of key issues must be
addressed. First, on the speed of redress, I would like to reiterate
what my hon. Friend the Member for North Herefordshire (Bill Wiggin)
said about the snail’s pace of payments. It is painfully slow,
but it was notable that as this debate drew close, there was a flurry
of updates and self-congratulatory crowing from some of the banks about
how they had made contact with 96% of their customers. Well done! How
about paying back some of the money?</hs_Para>

need to separate direct and consequential losses. One of my
constituents had his decision from Barclays on 8 July. The bank
admitted that he had been mis-sold and said that the swap would be torn
up and exchanged for a simple cap at a cost of
£29,000 and that, allowing for the cost of the cap,
his direct costs—£1.35 million—would be returned,
but four months on, he has seen no sign of that money. He placed a
consequential loss claim at the beginning of August, which has not yet
been accepted, declined or even discussed, and Barclays will not return
the £1.35 million that it acknowledges it owes him until it has
agreed the consequential losses, which it will not even talk about.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:18:09"></hs_TimeCode>I entirely
endorse the call from my hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy for the
direct and consequential losses to be separated, so that the banks can
crack on and refund some of the money owed, allowing businesses to
invest, employ people and carry out redevelopment that might best take
place at this time of year.</hs_Para>

there is the thorny problem of what constitutes a sophisticated
customer. Two of my constituents were judged to be sophisticated and
so, along with 10,000 others, were excluded from the FCA
redress scheme. One was deemed to be sophisticated despite his having
no finance director; having never heard of a swap before he was sold
one; doing his own accounts on a spreadsheet; having no in-house

am here because I want to talk about two constituency cases. Many
Members have raised individual points, and each case seems slightly
nuanced in different ways. My constituents simply went to their banks
for a loan and came away with a product that they did not expect to
come away with—a loan and a swap, or just a straightforward
swap. In the first debate we had on this subject, I mentioned a
constituency case involving a gentleman called Philip Derbyshire of
Spirit Motors. He banks with Lloyds and was sold a product not just as
a loan or a swap, but as a protection for his business—if he had
subsequently sold his business or passed away, the product would have
become an asset for him.</hs_Para>

number of people have talked about not understanding the product that
was sold to them—that was well disclosed previously—but
many were also unaware of the magnitude of the break cost or
mark-to-market, as it is called. Banks said when the product was sold
that they were unable to provide indicative figures for breakage costs,
but it is absolutely obvious that this was not the case. The banks
simply chose not to provide a scenario at that time. In the cases I
have dealt with, my constituents took bank advice on what were very
complicated products.</hs_Para>

Derbyshire has had an interesting time of late. He has been dealing
with the lawyers from Lloyds, because he, like many others, had an
interesting waiver—a disclaimer—in the hedge confirmation
letters he received. Lloyds’s lawyers have denied all liability
and hidden behind the waiver, which has a cash value in his contract of
about £5,000, against a claim of well over £1 million.
Slater and Gordon, Mr Derbyshire’s solicitors, have described
the case of mis-selling by Lloyds as unbelievably shocking.
Lloyds’s lawyers’ comments in response to Mr
Derbyshire’s claim were quite interesting. They said that the
account of the meeting at Mr Derbyshire’s home with a Lloyds
representative was inaccurate and that he had “put a gloss on
it”, vehemently denying that it had been asked whether Mr
Derbyshire’s company was likely to breach any of the bank
covenants at the 
<?notus-xml column=489?>end of the financial year, which ended on 30 November 2009. Mr
Derbyshire completely contests this. He remembers the question with
complete clarity—and I believe him completely—and his
response to it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:23:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Indeed, in the end, Mr Derbyshire did not breach the terms of the
covenants, but by then the damage from the waiver in the contract was

the Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes) described.
Mr Derbyshire has told me his level of education. He is a fantastic
businessman; he might not have been the world’s most educated
man. As such, he is ineligible, because he is
“sophisticated” in financial matters for the purposes of
the FCA review—obviously that is a matter of judgment on the
part of his bank and himself. Mr Derbyshire has been a pressing
individual. He wrote a personal letter, putting his case directly to
the Lloyds chief executive—and of course, no one ever gets a
reply to such a letter. Mr Derbyshire believes he has been treated with
utter contempt by his bank—a bank that he used to have a huge
amount of respect for and with which he had dealings for a long
time.</hs_Para>

second case involves my constituent Mr Solanki, who owns Ashdown House
residential care home, a small home that serves the aged local
community with a specialised and dedicated dementia unit. Back in early
2006, he was approached by the manager of his bank, Barclays, who
convinced him that, as interest rates were more than likely to rise, he
should buy a 20-year interest rate hedging product to protect the
business. The product was way beyond Mr Solanki’s technical
understanding and abilities, so he was referred to an
“expert” at BarCap, who convinced him that rates would
rise significantly and that the product would protect him. Neither the
BarCap salesman nor the bank manager explained the risks of the
product; however, Mr Solanki was advised that it was transportable and
easy to exit. Mr Solanki and the adviser never physically
met—everything was done over the phone—which must in some
way be non-compliant.</hs_Para>

after Mr Solanki had taken out the product, interest rates fell
sharply, and we all know what happened from there. Because of the cost
he was paying for the product, which ended up being more than the
mortgage he had taken out on the business in the first place, he was
unable to maintain the level and standard of the home. As occupancy
fell, the company was forced to lay off staff and carry out patchwork
repairs wherever
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:26:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Much
has happened since 2009, but essentially he is in a terrible place

people redundant simply to take cost out of the business and raise cash
to pay their banks; and of company managers enduring sleepless nights
and desperate worries. I have even had a case where a company was put

know that the problem has been recognised and that the redress scheme
has been created, but I do not think that that is good enough. More
needs to happen. The speed with which the scheme is proceeding needs to
get a lot faster, because we need a swift resolution to this issue.
Businesses are haemorrhaging cash, and they are still facing the
problems that I have outlined. In the vast majority of cases,
resolution will result in a judgment of mis-selling. It will also bring
clarity and, consequently, an ability to plan for the future.
Businesses are in a state of near-suspended animation until they get

one way to deliver that speed is to bring an end to all payments during

publishing some data, which is a help. As  of 27 September, the

banks seem to have adopted a herd mentality. When one of them discovers
a profitable financial product, all the others have to pile in as well.
It makes me wonder what work the banks actually did, before interest
rate swaps started to be sold, to set out the risks to their customers.
They might well have done some work on their risks themselves, although
taking a turn on both sides of a swap and putting none of their own
resources at risk probably involved very little risk to them. There
might be more risk now that they are to be held to account and might
have to pay for consequential loss.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>I am sure that
there are many people in the banks who do the important work of horizon
scanning. It would be interesting to know whether they examined the
scenario of how very low interest rates would affect their
clients.</hs_Para>

also want to pay tribute to Bully-Banks. It is a self-help group that
has brought people together and given them more confidence to take on
the banks and pursue their rights. I attended a Bully-Banks meeting in
south Wales, which gave me an indication of the scope and scale of the
problem, and of the different businesses involved. It became clear that
a particular class of business that seemed more likely to be targeted
by the banks was the well-established business with a fair degree of
security, often in the form of property. That description certainly
applies to a constituent of mine, Mr Evans from Ystradgynlais. He is
seeing his way through this process at the moment, and his business is
now secure, but he is still desperate to ensure that Barclays, which he
believes has treated him very badly, puts his business back into the
same condition that it was in before.</hs_Para>

Evans managed to get a facility with Barclays, and he was just about to
sign it off when a salesman appeared. His name was Mr
Shafto—never has a man been more appropriately named. Mr Shafto,
who was very active in south Wales and the west of England, told Mr
Evans that he had better sign up quickly because there were lots of
victims—he probably used the word
“customers”—who were desperate to see him, and he
needed to get on a train to go and see some more.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>Mr Evans signed
off on that agreement after only a short discussion. Surprisingly, he
did not have to make use of the facility, so he ended up with the swap
without having used the facility. We have seen instances of these swaps
being mis-sold in the past.</hs_Para>

Evans runs a highly successful packaging business that deals with many
of the pharmaceutical companies in this country. He
has often had offers to buy the business, but he has resisted because
he sees it as a family business that has given him security and that
will give his family security in the future. Little did he know that
the biggest danger of him losing his business would be created by the
bank with which he had such a good relationship in the past.</hs_Para>

there is a bit of good news to come out of this debate, it is that HSBC
has announced that it will separate the technical redress from the
consequential loss. I hope that all the other banks will come together
and agree to do that as well. Mr Evans has been reluctant to accept an
offer of technical redress because he thinks that it might compromise
his consequential loss. He might now be in a position to take that
money, however, and pursue his consequential loss at some point in the
future. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:37:28"></hs_TimeCode>I shall

want to speak about the context in which we need to view this issue,
based on my own experience. I believe that this is the end of a banking
boom-and-bust and bail-out, which speaks volumes about the role of
banking in the economic crisis that we face. On the basis of my
previous career in small businesses in East Anglia, it seems to me that
the big bang, along with all the many good things, triggered a major
cultural and financial neglect of the real bread and butter economy on
the ground. Over the last 15 or 20 years, Norfolk has certainly seen a
wave of bank closures, a “computer says no” culture, and
a neglect and undermining of what was traditionally viewed as the
backbone of our local economy, but what became in recent years,
particularly under the last Government, rather unfashionable and, dare
I say it, boring for the bankers of today.</hs_Para>

now sits on the cusp of a major economic renaissance—in life
sciences, in engineering and in energy. I thank the Government for
investing in the infrastructure but in that sector the banks have
largely been irrelevant, in my experience, to such early-stage
companies because they are too risky. Those companies usually rely on
venture finance from angels, and corporate venturing from
customers.</hs_Para>

thus need to ask ourselves some big questions about the banks’
role as our economy goes forward. Of course the banks play a crucial
part. America has 20,000 banks and a new one is started nearly every
week, and I believe that our banking sector and our financial services
sector is one of our greatest and most innovative sector. We sometimes
talk about the City as 
<?notus-xml column=495?>if it comprised just four or five big banks; in fact, it is a fabulous
crucible of financial innovation that should be celebrated and
encouraged. The problem lies with the few big banks
at the top that were bailed out by the last Government in such a way as
to see them sitting on too many real businesses in the real economy
that we need to grow and support.</hs_Para>

entrepreneur who built up a number of companies—in this case, a
successful 13-year-old company with 30 local employees, which is about
to be sold for £3.5 million. When Mr Keats decided that he
wanted to move his banking from RBS to Barclays, RBS stopped passing on
the sales income from credit and debit card sales in the business. The
business went insolvent within six weeks, and for the last four years,
he has had to deal with RBS and NatWest and has had to face a series of
major issues and challenges, to which I have been party. I have seen at
first hand banks not responding and when they do, ignoring previous

to the Treasury. It has led directly to the loss of 162,000 jobs, and
to the inability of SMEs to create

I spoke in our last debate on this subject, I shall not repeat
everything that I said then, but I do want to say something about the
question of advice. Small businesses typically have an accountant and a
bank, and in the past have typically relied on both to be on their
side. However, it is clear from the mis-selling scandal that they
should have been given independent financial advice, because the banks
were no longer on their side, and were now treating them as potential
consumers of sophisticated products.</hs_Para>

insist on not being on the side of small businesses and on treating
them primarily as sales prospects, we should be thinking about the
regulations. We should be thinking about what sort of advice the banks
should be telling their clients to seek, about what disclosures of
commission they should be making, and about other matters that would be
the norm if the banks were selling to private individuals. After all,
many of the businesses that we are discussing are not much bigger than
the affairs of a private individual. I hope that the Minister will
respond to that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:53:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

constituents, like those of other Members, are following today’s
debate closely. Theirs is a very familiar story. Stephen Lilley wanted
a loan, and stated explicitly that he wanted to pay it down as quickly
as possible. However, he found himself locked into a long-term fixed
deal involving a fixed amount of money. Roy Myers turned up to sign the
papers for a fairly large loan, only to find that clauses were being
inserted at the point of signing. He had no time to consider what was
happening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:54:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0002.htm#13102453000288">A
point that I do not think has emerged clearly today is that the
businesses that are involved in such arrangements are effectively
locked into their existing banks, and cannot get out. There has been
some predatory behaviour on the part of banks in those circumstances. A
business in my constituency which, partly because of the banking
arrangements, was in heavy weather financially, found itself having to
pay an extra £500 a month for a “special relationship
manager” who did not actually do anything. That was merely a way
of extracting yet more money from the business. In another
case—we heard of a similar example earlier—a life
insurance policy was forced on a constituent who did not need it.

their existing

welcomed last year’s decision by the FCA, but progress has been
painfully slow. I was present when Barclays turned up at the all-party

moving on, and things are happening to them. A couple of months ago,

small business is up against. People can call me cynical if they like,
but much of this selling of swaps was going on in 2006 and 2007, when
interest rates were 5.5%, but by 2009 they had dropped to 0.5%, and I
believe that many of those banks knew that interest rates were going to
fall. Why were they so keen to go out and get everybody tied up in
these swaps? Under the terms of the swaps, the higher interest rate
could probably be capped at around 6.9%, but if they started to fall
below 4% or 3%, people immediately got clobbered for huge amounts of
money. It was therefore very much in the banks’ interests to get
people into these schemes. That is where I do actually say that what
went on was criminal. That is why we expect our great Minister, along
with the FCA, to do something about this. The fact that only 32 or 33
cases in the whole country have been dealt with is an absolute

theft. That is exactly what it is, because people entered into these
agreements in good faith, and that brings me to another point I want to
make. Throughout my business and farming career, I had a good
relationship with my bank. I trusted my bank manager, and when I spoke
to him or her, I expected them to give me good advice. That trust in
our banks has been broken by this affair. If people in small businesses
and in business generally cannot trust their bank when they want to
raise finance to build up their company and employ more people, where
on earth are we going to build a recovery? We are building a recovery,
of course, but we could build it so much better if we could restore
that trust. The

a large successful farm and the other is a hotel. They have all been
put under enormous pressure and have paid enormous amounts of money,
and this is stopping them expanding. One of the businesses was not
given much choice about whether to take out the deal. Basically, they
were told, “You either take the money with a swap, or you
don’t have the money at all.” That is the kind of
coercion that went on. We need to deal with this issue, because we need

that it is absolutely essential that he, along with the FCA, gets hold
of the banks and makes them compensate people for what they have
mis-sold and what they have done. Until that is done—until we
have rectified the situation and compensated these businesses—we
will not restore confidence in the banking system, which we badly need
to be restored in this country. We must ensure that we move forward at

powerful speech touching on all the different elements of the redress
scheme, which have been causing problems to small businesses throughout
the country. He reminded the House that the banks were telling us they
cannot promise that the date for full redress will be much before 2015,
despite having spent £300 million and recruited around 3,000
staff to deal with this problem. The number of claims settled to date
is pitifully small. The record on that is nothing to write home about

again of the link between this scandal and the corrosion of

scandal has highlighted shocking abuse of small and medium-sized
enterprises; banks saw an opportunity in firms wanting to take out
loans and they attached complex hedging products to them, in many cases
giving the impression that this was a requirement of the loan itself.
When interest rates plummeted, businesses were forced to pick up the
punitive downside of the hedges. We know that in many cases banks had
the option to cancel the loan. So, presumably, at any stage when
interest rates might have gone up and the business would have benefited
from having the hedge, the bank could cancel, but in the reverse
situation the business could not exit the hedge when it became
unfavourable to it without incurring punitive costs and charges. Not
only was that an extremely unfair set of terms and conditions, but that
behaviour violated the important relationship of trust between the
banks and our small business community. Well run, long-established
small businesses, which are the engine of our economy, have paid the
price.</hs_Para>

rehearse the history of how we have got to the redress process that is
in place, but suffice it to say that many concerns with this scheme
require urgent action. I hope the Minister has heard all those points
today and will take them away with him. I hope also that the FCA and
the banks have been listening carefully to today’s debate. The
biggest issue, about which we have heard a great deal today, is the
time that this is all taking to resolve. Time is of the essence for the
businesses concerned, yet figures show that banks paid out just
£1.5 million in compensation in September, with 22
offers being accepted. That brings the grand total to a mere 
£2 million having been paid out, with 32 settled claims. In
September, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses

issues with the redress scheme is the complete lack of

Friends the Members for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) and for
Chesterfield (Toby Perkins) wrote to the chief executive of the FCA
about the delay in compensation payments and requested that a strict
deadline for settlement be imposed on the banks taking part in the
scheme. Unfortunately, the imposition of a deadline has been resisted
by the FCA. That is deeply disappointing, given the necessity of
achieving a faster rate of progress for businesses that are in
financial difficulty and the fact that the Federation of Small
Businesses has indicated that some reviews of the interest rate swap
products could be completed in as little as four to six weeks. I am
sure the Minister will agree that firms that are due redress must
receive it as quickly as possible if they are to survive; they need
certainty and clarity so that they can plan for the future. Does he
agree that a deadline would help matters? I hope he will respond to
that point. Will he outline for us what he might do to bring that

redress scheme, will the Minister confirm that he will follow it
closely to ensure that the evolving process will still allow for a fair

share the disappointment of fellow hon. Members about the progress made
under the FCA review to date. I stood up in a Westminster Hall debate
about four and a half months ago to discuss this very issue, and the
fact that the FCA has not made any significant progress since that
debate is, frankly, not good enough. As we have heard today, the FCA
said in January this year that the full review process would begin, but
it has since confirmed that the full process did not start until May
this year. That delay has been disappointing, and the FCA should have
been much clearer about exactly when this full review actually started.
However, the review is now up and running, with the large majority of
cases being looked at. I understand from the FCA that it believes that
about 85% of cases are now under review, but hon. Members are
absolutely right to say that it is time for the banks and the FCA to do
more to speed up the process and get redress out the door. As such, the
Government will continue to push the banks and the FCA to complete the
process as quickly as possible. As the motion says, the redress
scheme’s progress has been too slow. That is costly and has
caused further undue distress to the businesses involved. The FCA and
banks need to get on with the
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000326"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr McFadden" PimsId="4815" UID="13102453000787" xid="909" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000787">Mr

number of Members have mentioned redress payments. Of course we need to

consequential losses.</hs_Para>

that the FCA, as an independent regulator, should decide such details.
However, I agree that it is sensible for the initial payment for basic
redress to be made to provide much-needed relief to the businesses.
That is why I welcome the announcement this week, from HSBC and RBS so
far, that they will now make an initial redress payment to businesses
and then discuss consequential losses separately. Back Benchers should
take credit for that move. Under the leadership of my hon. Friend the

Members have also voiced concerns about the large number of businesses
that have been assessed as sophisticated and so fall outside the
scheme. My understanding is that the FCA used as a starting point the
criteria for non-sophisticated customers set out in the Companies Act
2006. As such, the test reflects the fact that larger businesses would
have greater resources to seek advice on the products in question, both
at the time of sale and subsequently. Moreover, I understand that the
FCA then amended the sophistication test in January to ensure that
certain companies, which were classified as sophisticated under the
Companies Act test but which might reasonably be considered to be
non-sophisticated, were also brought into the scope of the
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000334">Throughout
this debate, the Government have been clear that when a business lacked
the necessary skills and knowledge to understand fully the risks of the
products, it should receive the appropriate redress. We do not agree
that all businesses should have access to the FCA review; there needs
to be a defined cut-off 
<?notus-xml column=505?>point beyond which more sophisticated businesses take responsibility for
understanding the products that they entered into. I am confident that
the FCA has found the right balance to ensure that all
non-sophisticated businesses fall inside the scheme.</hs_Para>

able in the time available to address all the questions raised, but I
might be able to help with a couple in particular. Some Members asked
whether insolvency could be a reason for banks to try to delay the
redress process. I assure the House that that could not be a reason. No
one wants businesses to go insolvent, but if, sadly, they do, they will
still be part of the review process. If mis-selling is found to have
happened, banks will still be liable and on the hook—they will
gain no advantage from the insolvency of a
company.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000336">Hon.

few concluding remarks. This has been a positive and necessary debate,
and we have seen significant progress as a result of it. Members from
across the House have made it clear that they want a step change in the
progress made by the FCA review process. That is necessary; we need a
significant increase in the number of businesses offered redress. There

pretty obvious thing from this debate is that we need the banks to
provide support for the businesses while they wait to be reviewed. We
want the banks to show forbearance and to understand that the
difficulties faced by many businesses were created by the banks’

as a result of the mis-selling of these products, which were
inappropriate in the vast majority of cases. This has been a positive
debate, but we still need to see the proof of the pudding in the way in

am pleased to have the opportunity to debate aviation strategy in the
UK, which was the subject of a Transport Committee report published in
May. A decision on capacity in the south-east has been in the
“too difficult” box for too long. The independent Davies
commission set up by the Government has been asked to submit its final
report after the next general election, but the Transport Committee

main focus was inevitably on the controversial subject of runway
capacity in the south-east. We concluded that the expansion of Heathrow
was the best option, because that recognises the importance of aviation
to the UK’s economy and the need for more hub capacity to
maintain international connectivity, and reflects consideration of the
feasible options. The report considers future demand forecasts for
aviation, the impact of aviation growth on the global and local
environment, the importance of hub airports in securing connectivity,
the role of airports outside the south-east, and aviation taxation,
especially air passenger duty, and I will refer to all those issues
during the debate.</hs_Para>

is vital to recognise the importance of aviation to the economy. In
2011, the UK’s aviation sector had a turnover of some £53
billion and generated about £18 billion of economic
output. It employs more than 220,000 workers directly, and
it has been estimated that the total number of jobs supported could be
as high as 921,000. Aviation is also important for the lives of many
citizens by providing transport, and trade and leisure, links to the
rest of the world.
Demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:31:52"></hs_TimeCode> for
aviation links is growing. In 2012, UK airports handled 221 million
passengers, which was 1.4 million more than in 2011. The latest
passenger forecasts predict that demand at UK airports is set to grow.
Unconstrained forecasts—those in which there are no airspace
constraints or capacity limitations—show that passenger numbers
will grow to 320 million a year by 2030 and 480 million a year by 2050.
It is likely that there will also be greater demand for air connections
to new destinations.</hs_Para>

UK has direct air links to more than 360 international locations. There

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:33:03"></hs_TimeCode> lack of

also threatened the UK’s position as an international hub. If

of the proposals for a new hub airport would locate it to the east of
London in the Thames estuary area. There are significant challenges
associated with building such an airport, including the difficulty of
designing airspace in an already crowded environment, and the need to
mitigate bird strike and to deal with environmental challenges such as
future sea-level rises and the risk of flooding. Noise would also
become an issue for the many people who inevitably would move into the

commissioned specific research into the options and it became clear
that, in addition to the factors I have mentioned, the first option
would inevitably lead to the closure of Heathrow, threatening more than
100,000 jobs, which would be devastating. It would also require a
significant public subsidy of up to £30 billion towards surface
infrastructure and compensation for the closure of Heathrow, which
would be on top of the tens of billions of pounds that it would cost to
build the new airport

second option is to link existing airports through high-speed rail to
form a split hub, perhaps involving Gatwick and

connection times for transferring passengers, especially compared with
the transfer times of competitor hubs

acknowledged the need to address the very real environmental objections
that may arise. In particular, noise in excess of 55 dB is a major
problem for more than 700,000 people in the airport’s vicinity.
We have suggested a number of steps that could be taken to mitigate
that serious issue. Planes are getting quieter, but aircraft
manufacturers must continue to develop quieter aircraft. To facilitate
that, we recommend that the Government, through their involvement with
the International Civil Aviation Organisation, try to influence global
noise standards. Airports themselves should encourage airlines to take
older, noisier aircraft out of service at the earliest opportunity, and
people living under the flight path who are affected by excessive noise
should be adequately compensated. We have called on the Government to
develop a comprehensive, nationwide approach to noise compensation. The
Civil Aviation Authority should review existing flight paths and
landing approach angles to reduce noise
pollution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000365" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000365">Local<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:39:52"></hs_TimeCode>
air quality is also important, and the Government should draw up plans

especially concerned about unnecessary emissions that are generated due
to the stacking of aircraft over London. We recommended that NATS, the
air traffic controllers, should carry out modelling work to identify
the extent to which stacking might be reduced if an additional runway
was built at Heathrow.
Ultimately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>, any

better marketing or the introduction of an unrestricted open skies

of the study by the Roskill commission, the last great body to study
airports policy, that none of the inland sites, whether Cublington,
Nuthampstead, Stansted, Willingale or any other, should be developed,
and that if we were

hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman), the Chairperson of
the Transport Committee, that we need a hub airport for our major city.
There has been much talk of late of that being old hat, as everything
is now point-to-point. Everything is not point-to-point. Point-to-point
becomes increasingly possible when traffic increases and routes become,
in the language of the trade, thick routes, meaning that so many
flights a day can be justified between those points. That is fine and
that will go on, but it will be a long time before there is a daily
flight between Denver, Colorado and, say, Naples. There will be a need
for passengers to interline at an airport and it would be to our
advantage commercially, not just for the businesses in London but for
the airlines, if British Airways, Virgin or any other British carrier
had part of that business.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>The argument for
the split hub, suggesting that interlining is not important, overlooks
the fact that many passengers are now not coming through London. They
are going to airports in Europe where interlining is more conveniently
executed.</hs_Para>

believe that there needs to be a hub in London and I accept that it is
perhaps inevitable that that will be Heathrow, but to build a third
runway, possibly a fourth runway and a sixth and seventh terminal for
that airport will not make it anything like the new airport in Hong
Kong, or Changi in Singapore, or the airport in Beijing. It will still
be a confusing mass airport. I do not think that that serves London
best, but it might be the best that can be achieved in the
circumstances.</hs_Para>

am also concerned, as I have a northern history, about balancing this
country. I saw the effect of deciding to develop Stansted. One can
still walk around the towns and villages of north-west Essex and find a
variety of regional UK accents, as people were drawn down to the area.
That is all part of a problem that post-war Governments have contested,
unsuccessful by and large—that is, the drift from the north to
the south. I think that is a great shame.</hs_Para>

to Manchester for a time, and I saw the potential for the development
of Manchester airport. It has two runways, so why can that potential
not be seen? Why not promote that as at least one other gateway into
the country? Most air traffic has to do with leisure, and from
Manchester not only can the business community be served in that part
of the country—going both west to Liverpool and east to
Leeds—but there is access to north Wales, the Derbyshire peak
district, the Yorkshire dales, Yorkshire moors, the lake district and
so on. We ought to encourage those who visit this country to see parts
of it other than just London and the home counties. That would take
some of the pressure off London, without—of
course—excusing the need for a proper hub. I tell my
constituents who occasionally ask, “Should we be spending all
this money on HS2?” that when I hear that HS2 would bring
Birmingham airport within 36 minutes of London, my eyes water because
it is an average of 47 minutes from Stansted airport into
London.</hs_Para>

me to a point about infrastructure. Over the years, our one consistent
failing—there have been many—is that we have not been
prepared to back airport development with suitable infrastructure for
people to get there. So what happens? Well, I can speak for Stansted
with some passion. On the back of an airport that we were unhappy to
see develop, we did not get the compensation of a good railway system.
In fact, we got one that is worse because priority was given on a
two-track railway to the Stansted Express. I am all in favour of a good
service to Stansted airport, but that must not be at the expense of all
the commuters whom Government policies over the years have encouraged
to live in the M11 corridor. They get the worst of both worlds and that
is
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000393" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000393">On
compensation, we have been niggardly over the years in the amount of
money we are prepared to give to people—it is all spent on long
public inquiries, fighting the case and so on, instead of being paid to
those people who might feel most affected by the project. We should
provide those people with at least some compensation so that if it is
necessary in the national interest to bring about a major project, they
will at least get some advantage from that. We must do more on that if
we are to get people to settle for whatever strategy—if we
actually succeed in getting one at the end of all the further
deliberation through the Davies

extremely erudite and knowledgeable speech by the right hon. Member for
Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst). I learned most of what I know
about aviation and Stansted during the air inquiry in the run-up to the
1985 White Paper on aviation. At that time, as leader of Manchester
city council, I was a director of Manchester airport. We put together
solid arguments against the expansion of Stansted airport, which we
believed would contribute to a continuing imbalance in the
country’s economy. I should tell him that I have not shifted far
from those views, although some of my then colleagues, who could not
have envisaged that Manchester airport would end up owning Stansted,
have shifted quite a long way from their views. That is for a more
detailed future
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000398">I
agree with the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:00:15"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Gentleman—I shall put it in slightly different
words—that this country has been hopeless, not only in aviation
infrastructure, but all infrastructure. We have the lowest motorway
density in what used to be called western Europe; we have one small
high-speed line, which, symbolically, goes out of the country; we have
built one new runway—at Manchester airport—in the whole
UK since the second world war; and we have poor broadband speeds. We
have been very poor indeed at
infrastructure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000399" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000399">I
believe that the recession was caused by bankers and the
euro—Government Members might have a different
perspective—but, nevertheless, productivity  has fallen,
and if we are to earn our living in the world, it must increase. One

the country’s competitiveness, is by ensuring that we have good
infrastructure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000400" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000400">That
brings me to the main point in the Transport Committee’s
aviation strategy report. We have been through some of the arguments,
but there is no shortage of runway capacity in this country. Figures in
the written submissions to the report show that, at the main airports,
only a third of runway capacity is used, and that, throughout the UK,
we have 21 times the runway capacity we need. However, we are
extraordinarily short of hub capacity. Heathrow is full, and what
happens there cannot easily be replicated directly at Gatwick,
Stansted, Birmingham or, unfortunately, Manchester.</hs_Para>

given by Heathrow—we are not falling for its public
relations—was the Seattle service. There are insufficient
passengers in London to provide a daily service to Seattle from London.
The British Airways Seattle service flies daily because of transfer
passengers. Approximately a third of passengers at Heathrow are
transfer passengers. I have chosen the Seattle example, but there are
many others. Heathrow enables routes to connect London and the UK to
the rest of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000402" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000402">The
constraints on the hub capacity come in because, when we consider the
number of serious destinations served, we realise that it is not just a
numbers game. At the time of the report, Heathrow served 128
destinations, although there might be fewer now because it is declining
all the time. At the same time, Amsterdam served 131 destinations;
Frankfurt served 149; and Paris served 155. It is not good for the
business of this country if our European competitors are connected to
more parts of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000403" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000403">In
the emerging economies, it is not the cities to which London and the UK
are connected that stands out, but the fact that we are not connected
to places such as Jakarta and Manila. We are not connected to huge
mega-cities in China, such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, Chengdu, Guangzhou and
Xiamen. One thousand more flights go from Frankfurt to China per year
than from this country, excluding flights to Hong Kong. That cannot be

describe spending £30 billion on an airport in east London, with
all the environmental problems that that would cause. It is said that
fewer people would be affected by noise, and that would be true to
start with. However, once an airport is built out there with all the
jobs that would be created, people would, as

duty was abolished completely the Treasury would collect more finance
and 60,000 extra jobs would be created. I accept that in any report
consultants know who they are working for and include assumptions that
are often helpful to the conclusion. The Minister said that she did not
accept the assumptions, which is fair, but she needs to explain why,
and that was not part of the debate. I hope that the Minister
responding to this debate will explain why the assumptions are not
acceptable,

report by York Aviation has also been mentioned, and I would be
interested in a response from the Minister. The report did not look
into the current situation, but it did study how many more passengers
could be attracted to airline travel in long-haul, interregional,
non-congested airports if there was an APD holiday. For
Manchester—there are similar cases for other regional airports,
such as Birmingham and Bristol—routes to Bangkok, Hong Kong,
Delhi, Mumbai and Beijing would become viable if there was an APD
holiday for two or three years. There would be no loss to the Treasury,
just gain when people arrived in this country and spent money, because
the routes do not currently exist. Will the Minister respond to the

many people make an environmental argument against aviation. We have
heard about the perverse situation of air passenger duty, which is huge
for people travelling from China and for those on other long
intercontinental routes, forcing people into Paris and thus losing us
business, but it also forces people to multi-ticket. For a long
journey, it is much cheaper for someone to take a plane from Stansted,
Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester or Birmingham to a major European hub and
then to fly on. By doing that, a family can save hundreds of pounds,
but it leads to a 5% to 16% increase in carbon dioxide output and an
increase in NOx gases, most of which are produced on take-off and
landing. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:11:38"></hs_TimeCode>If
someone changes in the middle east—increasingly a major
competitor to Heathrow, alongside the European hubs—on their way
to the far east, the result is a 37% increase in fuel usage. The case,

is actually having a perverse effect.</hs_Para>

do not want to rerun yesterday’s debate either, but during the
debate on air passenger duty,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:13:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer) referred to the loss of
business to Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle—he might have added
Frankfurt—and several other locations in Europe. This is crucial
for the economy of the UK. We cannot gainsay the fact that the economic
hub of the nation is in London. There is much good business in
Manchester, Birmingham and Scotland, but the place that people have got
used to interlining through, and therefore also doing business in, is
London.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:14:14"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

people just change planes, but equally frequently they stop over.
Because they are coming through London, they take the opportunity to
take in a show or do business in the City of London. It is not just the
thousands of jobs at Heathrow or Gatwick that are at stake and which we
could lose to mainland Europe; this is about all the other, ancillary
jobs, and the tourism and business that go with them. The cost to the
country from the loss of aviation business in the south-east to
mainland Europe is almost inestimable.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst) when I
championed the cause of the airport at Stansted. I remember saying
then, “It’s not Heathrow or Stansted; it’s
Stansted or Schiphol.” That is even truer today than it was
then. If I need to underscore that point, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Air France are now flying from Manston, in Kent, twice daily to
Schiphol, as they are from a number of other regional airports. They
are not doing that for fun; they are doing it because they can see
there is business to be taken, from the south-east of England in
particular, to Schiphol to interline and to go on to all the other
places in the world—literally, anywhere that it is possible to
fly to from Schiphol. We cannot afford to sacrifice that
business.</hs_Para>

is about aviation strategy, but
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:15:44"></hs_TimeCode>my worry is that
there is no aviation strategy. There is a commission, and Sir Howard
Davies will do his job and report by 2015. Then there will be a debate
and more discussion, and there will not be another strip of tarmac or
another building, or a Boris island, for 20 years. That is how long it
will take. We are losing business today—not tomorrow, in a
year’s time or in five years’ time, but today. As we
speak, business is transferring from the United Kingdom to the mainland
European airports. We cannot afford to sustain that loss.</hs_Para>

the doorstep of London there is a place called Manston, in Kent. It has
the fourth longest runway in the country—it has taken Concorde
and wide-body 
<?notus-xml column=518?>jets—and it is available now. I am not suggesting for one moment
that Manston could or should be another London airport, but I believe
it could have a major role to play. In, I think, 2005—I stand to
be
corrected—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)
published his White Paper on the future of aviation in the south-east,
but since then nothing at all has happened in any meaningful or
constructive form, apart from perhaps another terminal at Heathrow. I
put it to him at the time that Manston was available, and I was told,
“No, it’s too far from London”—76
miles.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102453000420" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000420">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>
us think about that. Manston is quite a long way—it is further
than Gatwick and Heathrow. Actually, it is not, at least not in time. I
hope we will eventually finish High Speed 1—my hon. Friend the
Minister might have a hand in that. Indeed, I have travelled on the
existing line, with old rolling stock, in under an hour from central
London to Manston, and if that was possible then, with High Speed 1, it
is even more possible today. We can get the journey time down to about
50 minutes. It takes more than 50 minutes to get from
central London to Heathrow and almost as long to get to Gatwick.
Therefore, in terms of time rather than distance, which is what matters
to the traveller, Manston is
viable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:18:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000421" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000421">So
what do we have? We have an airport sitting in Kent, out on the
peninsular, relatively out of harm’s way in terms of overflying,
available today and under new ownership—Manston was sold and
bought last week. Its future was in a bit of doubt because it was on
the market, but it has now been bought, so it is secure, at least for
the foreseeable future. Manston is there and I say to my hon. Friend
the Minister and the House  that we have to buy time if we are
not going to lose more jobs. Manston is never going to be another
London airport. What Manston can do is take traffic from Gatwick to
release capacity, allow Gatwick to take traffic from Heathrow and free
up the capacity there, which is what we need in the short term while
the Government take long-term decisions. Manston is a national
asset—not a regional or local asset—and we need to use it
now. This country cannot afford to  waste
it.</hs_Para>

increased runway capacity and increased scope for aviation in the
national interest—a point made forcefully by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:20:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman). Secondly, I agree
with the vital importance of a hub and the inadequacy of the other
options, which do not provide a hub solution.</hs_Para>

am afraid, however, that the Committee has made a mistake in opting for
Heathrow as the location of Britain’s future hub. I fear that it
has not learned the lessons of history.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:20:26"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst) gave us a certain
amount 
<?notus-xml column=519?>of that history, and I shall now amplify it a bit more. I suspect that I
am almost as old as he is, and I recall the Roskill committee. Like
him, I was attracted to the concept of an estuary airport at the time,
and I was disappointed when the project initiated by the Heath
Government was cancelled by the incoming Labour Government in 1974 as
an austerity measure. There are echoes of recent history there, too.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>Cublington was
the wrong solution—I entirely agree with the right hon.
Gentleman that the idea of an inland airport was wrong—but the
crucial point is that Heathrow is in the wrong location. It might have
been right in 1947, when we were looking for a new airport immediately
after the war, but by the 1970s it was clear that, because of its
location in an area of dense population, it was not the right location
for the long term.</hs_Para>

subsequent history of all the inquiries into airport expansion included
the Layfield inquiry into terminal 4 and the Vandermeer inquiry into
terminal 5, as well as the sad history of the third runway proposal in
the 2000s. Every one of those projects was bitterly opposed, which
produced dishonest responses from the airport operators, in saying that
that was as far as they would go. I remember BAA stating emphatically
at the time of the terminal 5 inquiry that that was it, and that if
approval were granted, it would not seek any further expansion. Public
confidence and trust in the airport operators was totally destroyed,
and people were further infuriated, when it came back seeking further
expansion only a few years later.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:22:10"></hs_TimeCode>That history has
undermined public confidence in the veracity of the people responsible

inappropriate because around 700,000 people are seriously affected by

operate as a proper international hub that can receive aircraft at all

Raynsford:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point
about bird strike, but it occurs at Heathrow. A number of aircraft are
affected by bird strike at Heathrow—and, indeed, at other
airports internationally, including Hong Kong, which is in a waterside
location—so these problems have to be addressed and are
addressed by airlines at the moment. It is not at all
inconceivable—indeed, it is absolutely feasible—to take
appropriate measures to provide safeguards against that particular
hazard and some of the other hazards that might be
encountered—instances of fog in the estuary, for example.
Although evidence suggests that there is no greater incidence of fog in
the estuary than there is at Heathrow, it is an issue that needs to be
taken into account. Practical issues certainly need to be addressed,
but I do not accept that this problem is a showstopper, which prevents
us from considering the option.</hs_Para>

hugely important issues for future planning include the way in which
people get to an airport. Heathrow’s problem is that is located
very close to the M4-M25 junction, which is already a heavy generator
of air pollution and traffic congestion. The modal split in respect of
access to Heathrow is heavily dominated by the motor car. One of the
great advantages of the estuary airport, which I am afraid the Select
Committee did not recognise in its report, is that it would effect a
very considerable modal shift by having a far greater proportion of
passengers—estimated at 60% by advocates of the Foster-Halcrow
scheme on the Isle of Grain—coming by
rail.</hs_Para>

Davies commission has a hugely difficult task to perform. It must take
a strategic view, and that means taking a long-term view. I think that
the Select Committee has inevitably fallen victim to the pile of
evidence shunted in its direction by business. Yes, we should listen to
business, but business does not tend to take a view that covers more
than about seven to 10 years—perhaps a maximum of 15. We need
the Davies commission to take a 50-year view. The chief of
Ryanair—bless his cotton socks—and, indeed, the chief of
British Airways are not taking a 50-year view; they are taking a much
shorter view than that.</hs_Para>

significant that the Select Committee has not come up with a long-term
solution to our airports question, but has merely suggested, rather
tentatively, that there should be one more runway at Heathrow, and then
probably another. If the Committee wants a four-runway hub airport at
Heathrow, why did it not just spell that out? I think that it has been

a single objection has been raised to a Thames estuary
airport—not cost, not bird strikes, not sea level
rise—that is a showstopper; and then there are the advantages of
a Thames estuary airport: it is achievable, and achievable within a
predictable time frame; and its connectivity is better than that of any
other possible site for a four-runway hub, and that almost includes
Heathrow. Because it is already almost on the HS1 route, it has better
rail connections to European onward destinations than any other
possible site. It is also closer to the City of London by rail time
than Heathrow. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:35:50"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

better than any other possible site, so that puts it firmly on the

is the visionary approach that should be adopted by the Davies

because a bird habitat that would be affected can be replicated and
replaced—or even doubled—elsewhere, and the Ramsar sites
can be moved. It is the best safety option, because there would be no
more flying over populated areas, and it is the best noise option, too.
Some 750,000 people live under the 50 dB-plus noise footprint of
Heathrow, which is why a decision there is impossible. Almost no people

been done before, it can be done again, and this is the vision the
Davies commission needs to have to deliver on its remit. It must not
get sucked back into a shorter-term view and propose a patch-and-mend

Manston will have a big role to play, particularly in the interim,
because it will take time to build a four-runway airport in the Thames

the Member for Liverpool, Riverside set out, but I will say that
aviation is responsible for a turnover of £28 billion
and 120,000 directly employed jobs, and that it raises  
<?notus-xml column=525?>£9 billion in tax and duty. In addition, most of the 
£18 billion achieved through tourism is raised from air
passengers. All that demonstrates the importance of aviation to the
UK economy and UK plc. It has been clear that the
vast majority of the speakers in the debate have underscored the
importance of a hub airport in that regard. However, there are also key
concerns to address—noise and the big problem of
emissions—and recently we have seen the noise health study and
the report on impacts on human health. Both the 2003 aviation White
Paper and the third runway proposal addressed those issues, as does the
Select Committee. It is important that they are addressed—they
cannot be ignored—so that residents under flight paths and near
airports are reassured.</hs_Para>

was political opportunism. I am not criticising that; I suspect that we
probably would have done the same thing if we had been on the other
side. I would hope that we would not have done, but we did not have the

years since a Government White Paper highlighted the need for action on
London’s airport capacity—10 years of dithering and
hand-wringing, of refusing to make difficult decisions about aviation
and of inaction—so I welcome this debate as an opportunity to
highlight the urgency with which this issue must now be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:54:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000497" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000497">In
the time that successive Governments have pushed this problem into the
long grass, London and Britain have lost out. The number of
destinations served by Heathrow has dropped by a fifth in the past 20
years and it now has connections to just half the number of cities
served by Amsterdam Schiphol. We have been overtaken by our
rivals—that is for sure. Schiphol, Charles de Gaulle and
Frankfurt all now outrun
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Delays to

clear: it is beyond doubt that London and the south-east vitally need
increased air capacity. I am pleased that the Davies commission has
also reached that conclusion, as, of course, has the Transport
Committee. Our capital and the surrounding area face an air-capacity
shortfall of £16 million by 2030 and £57 million by 2040.
The Department for Transport forecasts that demand for UK airports will
double by 2050—an increase of more than 100 million

are no easy choices in tackling this problem, but not tackling it is
simply out of the question. Last year, Germany overtook the UK for new
investments, which is hardly surprising given that it has significantly
more connections to developing markets in China, India and Latin
America. In fact, London has fewer weekly flights than its European
rivals to most of the emerging market economies. Heathrow has nearly
half as many flights as Frankfurt to China’s airports, despite
the fact that Britain’s trade always increases 20 times over
when we have direct flights to that country. That is why, if London is
to have a next chapter in its ever-evolving success story, measures
must be introduced to increase its airport

am especially clear on one thing: one of London’s biggest
success stories must not simply be wiped off the map. Heathrow airport
is the busiest airport in the world on the basis of passenger numbers.
It directly or indirectly employs 230,000 people. The contribution of
the western wedge of London and the home counties accounts for 10% of
the country’s GDP. The percentage of GDP that is contributed by
London, at 21.9%, is the highest that it has been since 1911. We
therefore ought to be very careful in talking about the idea that
Heathrow could somehow be shut overnight with no

was right that the last proposal for a third runway at Heathrow was
rejected, but that was largely because it took no account of the
population in the wider west London area. The recent proposals contain
more consideration of how to minimise noise levels and disruption to
residents. It is obvious that the expansion of Heathrow is one of the
main options that the Davies commission must
consider<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:01:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000509">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:01:32"></hs_TimeCode>

be clear: any strategy that results in closing one of Britain’s
most successful and important infrastructure locations should be

country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102453000510" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0003.htm#13102453000510">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:01:52"></hs_TimeCode>
includes the idea of a new hub airport in the Thames estuary. It is
clear that building a new hub airport in the east of London would
require Heathrow to be closed. That would decimate the west London

city<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>. If that
option ever was on the table, it should be taken off the table right
now. Not only is it economically and technically unfeasible; it would
mean closing Britain’s best and most successful airport.

more than 230 airports in China. If my maths is correct—I am an

new airports over five years, an average of 11 a year. I know that it
is a developing nation, that is much larger than us and has the

sobering fact that I have found in considering the matter is that more
flights leave Frankfurt for cities in China in a week than leave
Heathrow for the whole world in a weekend. That must tell us something.
Figures from the International Air Transport Association show that due
to the lack of capacity at Heathrow, between 
<?notus-xml column=532?>2005 and 2011 there was a 49% growth in the number of passengers flying

business connectivity, but we come top of every poll on business
connectivity. The answer to

not bigger, but better, which is exactly what the

respect. The Minister has been to Humberside more than once, and will
know that Humberside airport would be ideally located if only there
were better connectivity between the various modes of transport. A
railway line runs within a quarter of a mile of the airport terminal,

know the importance of aviation. I fly probably more than any other
MP—at least four times a week and sometimes six times a week. At
least, I did until flights in my constituency were vandalised by the
local council, which axed 60% of inter-island flights between Stornoway
and Benbecula and Barra and 100% of flights to the most vulnerable
island community. That was all the more strange given that they were
public service obligation routes. While the council can make arguments
about rurality and peripherality in Edinburgh, London or Brussels, the
arguments hold no weight it seems once it secured the money within its
own corridors of power. Indeed, flights used by people going for cancer
treatment have been described by the council leader as 10-minute
tourist flights, which is very disappointing. The flight was not 10
minutes and the councillors he dragooned into voting to axe flights to
these communities have not been to visit them since their election. The
upshot of this transportational vandalism is that travel from one end
of the Outer Hebrides to Edinburgh, London or Brussels is faster for
most of the week than going to other end of the Outer
Hebrides.</hs_Para>

Heathrow should all get together and look at that proposal. Failing

me update the House on some significant aviation policies before
dealing with a number of points that were raised during the debate. We
appear to be in broad agreement about the importance of maintaining the
United Kingdom’s position as a leading global aviation hub for
the UK economy. Freight volume and terminal passenger numbers were
higher in 2012 than in the previous year. We have the third largest
aviation network in the world, after the United States and
China<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:51:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The five
airports serving London offer direct services at least weekly to more
than 360 destinations worldwide, which is more than Paris, Frankfurt or
Amsterdam. We are determined to take the necessary action to maintain
the UK’s position as Europe’s most important aviation
hub<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000028">Aviation
capacity is important for the economic growth of the UK, and that vital
issue requires long-term thinking and consensus-building. The UK
continues to have excellent aviation connectivity, both on a
point-to-point basis and through the London hub, but our major airports
face a capacity and connectivity challenge in the medium and longer
term. Heathrow is operating to capacity today, Gatwick is expected to
be full in the 2020s, and Stansted, which currently has considerable
spare capacity, is expected to be full by the early
2030s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:52:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000029">The
Government accept that aviation capacity, especially in the south-east,
has been a controversial and difficult issue for many years. The only
way in which we can end the years of indecision and inaction is by
taking the approach that we have adopted, which I hope establishes
cross-party support and political consensus. That was an important
factor in our decision to create the airports commission and to make it
independent of the Government. Led by Sir Howard Davies, the commission
is examining options, and it will make recommendations that will
maintain the UK’s status as a leading global aviation hub in the
long

Selous</B> (South West Bedfordshire) (Con):</Member> I am grateful to
Mr Speaker for giving me the chance to raise the important issue of how
we can raise share capital for our nation’s businesses. All hon.
Members will be well aware that we do not have to spend long in either
Treasury questions or business questions before Members from all parts
of the House get up to talk about the difficulties that businesses have
in gaining access to finance. Every time that has happened over the
past couple of years when I have been in this Chamber the complaint
raised by Members has been that the banks are not lending. Indeed, we
still have a partially broken banking system, which is why the banks
are not able to lend in the way that British business, large and small,
would ideally like them to do.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102456000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000048"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:00:12"></hs_TimeCode>Of
course, loan finance is only one way in which businesses of all
sizes—although I am thinking particularly about small and
start-up, fast-growing businesses— can raise the capital they
need. The other way is through equity or share capital. I find it odd
that that type of capital—that way of helping businesses to
start up, grow and expand—is a subject so rarely raised in this
House, and I wish to remedy that this afternoon. So I stand here on
behalf of the nation’s 4.5 million smaller businesses—the
small and medium-sized enterprises that do so much to power our economy
and grow the larger businesses of tomorrow—and on behalf of the
men and women who work in the “small- cap” market sector
of the City of London, who try to raise that much-needed and incredibly
important share capital, or equity finance, for our nation’s
businesses.</hs_Para>

wish to pay tribute to some of the people who work in that sector in
the City and who took time out, at no remuneration to themselves, to
write the Drury report. They are: Tony Drury, Roger Hardman, David
Scott, Michael MacDougall, Simon Webber, Robin Stevens, Brian Hibbert
CBE, Charity Walmsley, Laura Keeling, Teresa Quinlan and Paul Quade. I
had the pleasure of working with them and helping them. Indeed, I took
them all to meet the previous Financial Secretary to the Treasury, so
that they could outline what was in their report.</hs_Para>

is not a new issue. The Macmillan committee report of 1931 identified
what became known as the “funding gap” as far as British
businesses were concerned. Our Government, in March 2012, commissioned
the Breedon taskforce to write a report, “Boosting Finance
Options for Business”, examining these very issues. In our
relatively recent history, we have been quite successful in getting
stock markets, large and small, to raise equity capital for small and
growing businesses. Between 1998 and 2008, the Alternative Investment
Market—AIM—and the PLUS market provided many hundreds of
UK companies with early-stage equity finance. It is the belief of the
Drury report that if the small-cap sector was rejuvenated in the way it
suggests, a further 200,000 people could be found work as
the businesses were helped to grow in the way that those behind the
report believe they can.</hs_Para>

have to tell the Minister that, sadly, all is not well in the small-cap
market in the UK. Between 2009 and 2012, there was de-listing of 722
companies on the AIM. Indeed, the amount raised on the AIM in 2012 was
barely 17% of the £16 billion raised on that market in 2007. Let
me quote one small paragraph from the Drury report. It
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102456000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000094">“For
us the small-cap sector is ‘Middle England’: the millions
of people trying to run and grow their businesses against all the odds.

officialdom, bullied by bigger brothers and misunderstood by some

people are not even aware of all the markets that enable smaller
businesses to raise funds. In addition to the AIM, we have the
ISDX—the ICAP Securities &amp; Derivatives
Exchange—formerly known as PLUS markets. Currently, 112
companies are listed on it. That story is not happy either, I am
afraid—there have been 35 de- listings from the ISDX
since the ICAP relaunched the exchange in October last year, but only
eight
additions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000054">There
is also the GXG, on which 106 companies  are listed; again,
that could be larger. At the moment, 859 UK companies are listed on the
AIM, whereas  in 2007, before the great recession, there were
1,347. Companies de-list for a number of reasons, one being the cost of
being on a market; I will talk about that and regulatory issues, which
we need to consider, in a
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000055">Today
I was given some stunning figures—they really jumped out at
me—by the London stock exchange. In the United States of
America, bank lending as a percentage of external, long-term funding,
is 19%—that is, under a fifth. In the European Union, however,
the figure is 81%, or more than four fifths. Those figures are
stunningly divergent. If the Minister and his officials take back only
one set of figures from this debate, I ask them to consider why there
is such a different financing model in the US and why so much more
share capital and long-term investment are put into businesses there
than here in the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000056">The
European Commission green paper on the long-term financing of the
European economy has been published and the Government will respond to
it. It has some sensible suggestions. The London stock exchange has
urged a “think small first” approach and asked the
Commission particularly to assess the regulatory impacts on access to
capital for smaller companies, the costs of capital and the fiscal bias
against equity, which I shall come
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000057">For
the sake of completeness, I should say that there are three other,
smaller equity markets: Sharemark, AltCapX and BritDAQ.</hs_Para>

there is a funding gap for British industry and many businesses. Banks
are increasingly nervous of lending to businesses that do not have
strong balance sheets. I am not setting up equity capital against loan
finance; if a business has a strong balance sheet and a decent amount
of share or equity capital, it is more attractive for a bank to lend
to. The two issues go
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000059">As
we know from recent research from smallbusiness. co.uk, one in
six small businesses has had to resort to a payday loan and just one in
10 was able to secure a loan from its bank in the first year of
trading. The Minister’s Department, the Department for Business,
Innovation 
<?notus-xml column=551?>and Skills, has said that it estimates the current funding gap facing
British industry up to 2017 at anywhere between £84 billion and
£191 billion, of which between £26 billion and £59
billion relates to smaller businesses. Those are huge figures. It is
clear why we need to consider how share capital can help bridge some of
that gap. Many smaller businesses are simply unaware of even the
possibility of raising share capital and how they would go about doing
it. I shall come to that in a
second.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000060">It
is worth putting on the record that the tax treatments of share capital
and debt are very different. Debt interest payments are tax deductible,
whereas share capital is taxed four times—on purchase, for stamp
duty; when profits are declared, through corporation tax; when profits
are paid out, through income tax on dividends; and when shares are
finally sold, through capital gains tax.</hs_Para>

credit is due—the Government have reduced stamp duty on AIM
shares, which is excellent, and we are lowering corporation tax. The
Government have already helped in some areas. However, the Minister
will see that there is a significant difference between the tax
treatments of share finance and loan finance.</hs_Para>

regulatory costs of raising share capital are significant, and the
Government need to look at that issue very closely. I am delighted that
we have here not only this Minister, who is an excellent Minister for
whom I have the very highest respect, but a BIS Minister. I sometimes
wonder who in Government is looking at this issue, not just from the
investor’s point of view in making sure that every box is ticked
as regards regulation, but in being the champion for these 4.5 million
small businesses as regards their need to raise share capital. I would
love the Minister, as well as dealing with the very many important
tasks he has to deal with, to be that champion. I am throwing down the
gauntlet to him and hoping that he will take up that challenge as part
of his many important responsibilities.</hs_Para>

Conduct Authority costs are high in this regard. One broker who deals
in the small-cap market in the City, in a relatively small firm,
estimated that the regulatory costs are about £10,000 per member
of staff. A company that has large volumes of business can cope with
that, but for one with relatively small volumes of business the whole
thing will border on being unviable. Yesterday morning, at a breakfast
meeting, I put that point to Martin Wheatley, the chief executive of
the FCA. He acknowledged that the costs of raising share capital for
smaller businesses are high and that regulation is onerous. He did not
disagree with me, but I am not sure that we quite worked out what we
can do about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:11:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000064">I
am convinced that we need to have a proper campaign of education for
businesses up and down the country about the advantages of raising
share capital rather than just going to a bank for finance. I would
like chambers of commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, the
Institute of Directors, the CBI, accountants, lawyers and other
business advisers to work together in our communities explaining to
businesses how they can raise share capital if they are having
difficulty raising loan finance. They could explain that having outside
shareholders in a company does not mean that it
loses  
<?notus-xml column=552?>control. Many businesses think that if they have an outside shareholder
they lose control of their business, but they do not; if they still own
51% of the equity, they retain control. Yes, their standards of
corporate governance may need to improve a bit, and that is generally a
good thing, but they retain control. That is often not understood, and
changing that would further open up the possibility of raising share
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:12:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000065">It
is important to give praise where praise is due. I was delighted when
stamp duty was removed from AIM shares earlier this year; indeed, I was
one of the people who lobbied very hard for that. AIM shares can now be
included in individual savings accounts. It is not generally understood
that if someone is lucky enough to have an estate that might breach the
inheritance tax threshold, any money they have in AIM shares is not
counted towards that threshold. That is another good thing that will
encourage vitally needed investment in this important and growing
sector of the economy. Indeed, I understand that the Share Centre
reported an increase of over 106% in AIM stock purchases on the day
that the policy was

are some tremendous success stories; I would not want the Minister to
think everything was bad. Let me give him an example. Abcam plc is a
business involved in cancer research that sells antibodies to
researchers. It listed on the AIM in 2005 with a £58
million flotation. By the summer of 2012, it had grown to a market
capitalisation of £770 million. Its revenue rose from £12
million to about £100 million, and the number of staff grew from
78 to 600. The company has significantly expanded, opening up offices
abroad, and it is now looking to join the main stock market. That is a
huge success story, and we want many other businesses to do the
same.</hs_Para>

is telling, as my hon. Friend has pointed out, that during Treasury and
Business, Innovation and Skills questions we tend to get more questions
on access to finance than on any other subject. There is some evidence
that access to finance is improving, although it is still not in a
strong position. Thanks to the tough choices we have made since 2010, I
think it is widely recognised that the economy is, broadly speaking, on
the mend. It has not fully recovered by any means, but it is on the way
back. That is reflected in the number of businesses, not only in my
hon. Friend’s constituency, where businesses are creating jobs,
but across the country. Companies House records show that there were
480,000 new incorporations in 2012-13, which is the highest figure on
record. If I may correct one of my hon. Friend’s
figures—I do so as gently as possible—yesterday’s
figures show that the number of SMEs in this country is now 4.8
million, not 4.5 million. I hope he is not too disappointed by that
minor

accept my hon. Friend’s challenge to be, along with the BIS
team, a champion of smaller businesses in their quest to access
finance. Our programme is vital. The Breedon report made a series of
recommendations, many of which have been acted on, including the
introduction of the business bank, which my right hon. Friend the

know that it has been much harder for businesses to access finance
since the crisis. One of the lessons of the crisis was that the economy
had become too reliant on one source of finance, namely bank finance
from the four big banks. The business bank will help to solve that
problem, but it is by no means the only solution, because we need to
increase the supply and diversity of finance available, which brings me
to the subject of equity
finance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:19:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000074">I
will take on board all of the points my hon. Friend has made and if I
miss any out I will read <I>Hansard</I> and make sure they are acted
on. I would stress that when talking about equity finance, we need to
be cognisant of the importance of the wider availability of both
private equity finance and public equity finance. Although it is
difficult to measure with precision, in recent times, the amount of
private equity finance, whether through angel investing, venture
capital investing or bigger private equity financing, has been greater
than the amount of public equity finance. Both are important. It is
important to have diverse forms of finance, not only so that if one
form struggles, others can take up the slack, but because different
forms of finance are right for different
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:20:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000075">It
is true that we have extended tax relief, not only by cutting
corporation tax, removing stamp duty on AIM shares and allowing
individual savings accounts to invest in AIM shares, which is a tax
relief in a sense, but through the extension of the enterprise
investment scheme and the introduction of the seed enterprise
investment scheme, both of which are extremely popular schemes 
<?notus-xml column=554?>for investing in small and fast-growing companies for those who pay UK
income tax. The encouragement of equity finance, in whatever form,
through tax relief is an important part of our programme to solve the
problems that my hon. Friend
highlighted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000076">Tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:21:22"></hs_TimeCode>
treatment plus regulatory costs, whether in the public or private
sphere, make up the gap between the equity that an investor can put in
and the investment that a small business receives. I hope that drilling
down on both will bring more liquidity and finance where they are

them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000077">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:21:43"></hs_TimeCode>
was struck by the figures that my hon. Friend set out. In the United
States, 19% of this kind of finance comes from the banks, compared with
81% in Europe. The UK is one of the more friendly destinations in the
EU for non-bank finance, but the figures are striking. When I was in
the United States last week, I was struck by the powerful fact that
more venture capital is available in the skyscraper in which the
British consulate in Boston is housed than is available across the
whole of Europe. That shows the difference between the two continents
not only in the amount of finance that is available, but in the number
of people who have started and grown a business and are now
reinvesting. The United States, whether on the east coast or the west,
is a generation ahead of us. Part of our job is to catch up as fast as
we can. That challenge is real; the good news is that the opportunity
that it presents is
great<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:23:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000078">My
hon. Friend spoke eloquently about the various small exchanges. I urge
him to look also at peer-to-peer finance, whether equity or loan,
because that is a small but growing part of the market that companies
can look to when trying to access
finance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:23:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000079">As
well as bringing tax relief and bearing down on regulatory costs, the
Government make direct interventions. In the business angel sector, the
Angel CoFund makes equity investments of between £100,000 and
£1 million in SMEs. It does that alongside syndicates of
business angels. It encourages greater levels of angel investment and
syndication, and provides companies with experience and expertise
alongside the capital. I echo my hon. Friend’s remarks that when
finance comes into a small business, it brings not only pure capital,
but better governance and advice from people who have skin in the game
and who therefore take care in the advice that they
deliver.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000080">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:24:20"></hs_TimeCode>
the Budget this year, we announced that another £50 million
would go to the Angel CoFund, doubling its size. I hope that it will
help to strengthen the whole business angels sector, because it invests
only when appropriate due diligence has been undertaken and a deal is
structured properly. The UK Business Angel Institute, founded by the UK
Business Angels Association and AngelNews, is creating standards of
professionalism in UK angel investing, which by its nature often
involves investing early in quite high-risk companies. If we can have
more quality in training courses for private investors, such as those
that the UK Business Angels Association is delivering, that will
strengthen investing skills in that important area of the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:25:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000081">My
hon. Friend made the point that equity is taxed four times whereas bank
debt is tax-deductible. A number of non-tax factors have an impact on
whether a business decides to use debt over equity financing, so tax is
not the only issue. Different companies look to different 
<?notus-xml column=555?>forms of finance, and debt can be quicker to obtain and less complicated
to use. Of course, there is the also the question of the amount of
ownership that is given up in return for equity
financing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:25:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000082">I
turn to deductions for interest as a business expense. To protect the
UK Exchequer, a number of rules limit how much interest a company can
deduct from its tax liability. My hon. Friend made the point that
dividends are paid out of a company’s tax profits. However, they
are exempt from tax in the hands of the company receiving them. In the
case of an individual shareholder in the income tax system, the
combination of dividend tax credit and the lower rates of tax for
dividends ensures that dividends are taxed at broadly the same level as
other forms of income, even after corporation tax is taken into
account. It is important to take into account not just the number of
different taxes that apply to a piece of income but the rates of them,
so that we can work out the relative rate on each form of finance.
Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:26:59"></hs_TimeCode> said
that, it is clear that the Government are moving in the direction that
he wants, for instance through abolishing stamp duty on AIM shares and
other growth markets, making investments eligible for ISAs and so
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:27:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102456000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/debtext/131024-0004.htm#13102456000083">I
wish to mention one other area of tax, which is the
entrepreneurs’ relief. That is a valuable incentive and reflects
the fact that entrepreneurs take risks and are often the beating heart
of growing businesses, which should be recognised in the tax system. We
have increased the amount of relief that can be used and allowed it to
be used in more situations, so that more businesses and entrepreneurs
can benefit from the 10% capital gains tax rate rather than the normal
28% or 18% rates. Over 
<?notus-xml column=556?>a number of Budgets, there has also been an increase in the lifetime
limit for entrepreneurs’ relief to £10 million, so shares
acquired from the enterprise management incentive can qualify for a
lower capital gains tax rate.

the localism policy. The Government’s policies on the green belt

steps back to normality. I learned that in almost all cases,
homelessness is caused not by a property shortage but by other factors

shortage of houses. In an answer to a recent parliamentary question

houses with planning permission that are not yet built and the figure

course, there are in fact shortages of two kinds of housing: affordable
homes, which are scarce in the village where I live, and privately
rented properties, partly because it is hard and often undesirable to
be a landlord. There are shortages in those two sectors for reasons
other than a shortage of houses as such. For example, it is getting on
for 2 o’clock, yet any one of us could go out into London or
anywhere else and find houses to buy this afternoon. I question the

the next 20 years—or, to be strictly accurate, over the next 18

Tewkesbury’s housing need for the next 20 years been assessed as

Tewkesbury borough for the next 20 years is not the 10,900 I refer to,
high though that is, but 18,800, which is 150% higher than for the last
20 years. Why? Partly because it is deemed that Cheltenham and
Gloucester cannot find land for 
<?notus-xml column=149?>their housing growth needs, so the houses will be dumped in Tewkesbury
borough, potentially causing housing stock in Tewkesbury to increase by
54% over the next 20 years and causing the councils to build
on green-belt land and in other undesirable areas.</hs_Para>

the question of the duty to co-operate. Gloucestershire has six council
areas, not just three, and the duty to co-operate goes beyond county
boundaries. Why, then, will the houses that Cheltenham and Gloucester

green-belt land in Tewkesbury? That cannot be fair, and it demonstrates
the paucity of the current planning guidance, which says that plans
will be considered unsound if the councils concerned have not
co-operated. However, it is the councils that are not involved in the

that all councils join in, and there has been obstinacy on the part of
some of those involved in the joint core strategy, but whatever the
case, it is a really strange situation to have three councils getting
together while others each have their own plans. The whole system is
very confusing and difficult. As for Tewkesbury’s allocation,
even if we accept the Cambridge assessment of 10,900 homes, we will not
have that figure; we propose to have 18,800, even though we built only
7,500 in the previous 20 years. The situation is very

for the Government to engineer a recovery in such a way. Surely the
market will determine in which areas there will or will not be growth,
so why not leave local councils to determine how many houses they need
over any given period and to make their plans accordingly? The Minister
may reply that that is indeed happening, but it is not. The three
council areas I cover have all told me that they have to make plans for
a high number of houses, because the Government will reject plans as
unsound if they do not plan for such large numbers. If that is wrong, I
want the Minister to say so. I will then go back to those councils and
tell them that their view is wrong. I do not, however, believe that

granted too freely on appeal by the Secretary of State. I have examples
of that in my area. Appeals have been granted that will allow the
building of many houses at Bishop’s Cleeve and Winchcombe,
against the wishes of local people. On the face of it, those appeals
were allowed because the council has been deemed to have an
insufficient five-year land supply. What is that assessment based on?
Is it based on the number of houses built in the past, on some
arbitrary and undefined calculation, or on figures in the regional 
<?notus-xml column=151?>spatial strategy? The strategy for the south-west was never signed off,
and that whole policy has been scrapped in any case. Once again, this

Government’s policy on the green belt is confused and

Government assess how many houses will be needed in the future? Why are
they following the predict-provide approach? Why are estimates for
future housing need so high, and why are they so much higher than what
was needed for the last 20 years? As a slight aside, much of the
population growth in the past 20 years has been caused by immigration.
Given that the Government are intent on reducing net immigration and
claim to have done so already, how can housing need be predicted to
increase? Why is the localism agenda being ignored? Why is pressure
being put on local councils, causing them to build on green-belt land?

proposed by the Greater London regional planning committee, under the
leadership of Herbert Morrison, one of whose relatives is in the other
place. In 1947, under the main Town and Country Planning Act, councils
outside London became able to control the use of, and to develop,
undeveloped land. In 1955, the green-belt policy was established,

what I am used to, it was called planning policy guidance. There were
lists of criteria of what could and could not be built on the green

will have to put up with this phone mast, as there has been no
compromise from Vodafone. Indeed, Vodafone is planning to extend the
height of the mast. There were many sites for the mast—I have
been in discussions with Vodafone—but the company insists that
it wants to keep it on the high street. It is an eyesore, and because
of a simple mistake, my constituents are affected. Furthermore, with
the new permitted development rights these phone masts can be extended

problem is that planning authorities can give themselves planning
permission to develop sites that they own. I was a city councillor in
Oxford for 17 years, until 1997, and during that time, on many
occasions, the council gave itself planning permission, sometimes in
preference to other applicants. I am certainly not suggesting that my
colleagues at the time did anything wrong or even anything
questionable. However, if people own a site and are responsible for
giving themselves permission to develop it, it is hard to ensure that
there is no appearance of impropriety. We all know that appearances are
important. We need to make sure that people have faith in the planning
system. I know that this issue troubles people across the country;
indeed, a number of people have raised it with me on the Isle of
Wight.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000085">I
am not sure what alternative procedure we could or should follow.
Perhaps it would be appropriate for neighbouring authorities—if
there are neighbouring authorities—or a totally separate body to
take decisions about council-owned land, or in cases where the local
authority would benefit in some way. I should be grateful if the
Minister shared his thoughts on this issue and said whether he believes
it to be a problem that the Government should address that a council
may give planning permission for land that it owns, where it would
benefit from doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000086">Local
development plans were introduced in 2004, so they postdate my
experience as a councillor. I do not claim to have any particular
knowledge of or expertise about them. However, I know that writing them

they replaced a system that was seen to be inflexible, the intention
being that they could more easily be amended, having spoken to Bill
Murphy, head of planning services at Isle of Wight council, I am not
convinced that changes to the core strategy document can be made as
quickly and easily as was envisaged when the plans were brought in. It

local
authority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000087">To
provide an example of certain problems, on the Isle of Wight the core
strategy document sets out that we should have 520 new dwellings every
year. It is not a secret that I think that is far too many, but it was
not a decision for me to make; it was made, quite properly, by an
elected council. However, it is now clear that the existence of that
target may make it more difficult for the Isle of Wight council
effectively to oppose inappropriate developments, such as
Pennyfeathers, a proposal to develop a 55-hectare greenfield site just
outside Ryde. There are many problems with that proposal. Not least of
them is that Monktonmead brook already floods. Also, there are a number
of brownfield sites available in and around Ryde that should be
developed before greenfield farm land. Putting between 800 and 1,400
additional houses on Pennyfeathers farm land is quite wrong. I
sincerely hope that the council will find the grounds to reject this
development; if it does, I will be pleased.</hs_Para>

should be able to change the rules, because the people have voted. That

Monday, Cherwell district council agreed its local plan for submission
to the Secretary of State at a meeting of the full council, which
endorsed it with a unanimous vote. No responsible local authority could
have produced a local plan more quickly. The agreed plan makes robust
provision for housing until 2031 and envisages 16,750 new houses being
built in Cherwell district during the survey period up to 2021. That is
in a robust and deliverable local plan that has been adopted
unanimously and without any significant local opposition. Moreover, the
House might be interested to know that more than 50% of the planned
houses are already being built or are subject to planning applications
under active consideration by the district council. Cherwell not only
has an agreed local plan, but is doing all that it can to deliver on
the provisions of that
plan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000117">The
whole point of local plans, however, is to enable local councils and
local communities to decide where new housing provision should go.
Cherwell’s local plan focuses development growth on the towns of
Banbury and Bicester, while avoiding coalescence with villages by
introducing new green buffers around the towns. That seems to be a
wholly commendable policy aspiration on the part of district
councillors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000118">One
of the recent planning appeals decided by the Secretary of State,
however, drove a complete coach and horses through that policy
aspiration of developing green buffers, by allowing development in an
area that the district council had allocated as a green buffer in the
local plan. In effect, the Secretary of State has allowed a policy of
first come, first served, with planning permission being given to
whichever house builders or developers happen to get their planning
applications in earliest. This is not plan-led development; this is not
central planning policy—this is planning
anarchy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000119">My
hon. Friend the Minister will say that the Secretary of State, having
granted planning permission, now has no locus on those decisions. In
law, that is correct, although Cherwell district council is not
surprisingly considering with leading counsel whether there are good
grounds to take the Secretary of State to the High Court for judicial
review of his decisions. Ministers may no longer be legally accountable
for their decisions, but they are politically
accountable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000120">Ministers
say that one reason for allowing the appeals was because, at the time
the planning applications were made, the district did not have adequate
five-year housing supply. One of the main reasons why the district did
not have adequate supply, however, was because, on a number of
significant sites where developers had been granted planning
permission, they had simply not started building 
<?notus-xml column=164?>work. Local authorities and local people, having granted permission on
significant sites, are not to blame if the house builders decide not to
build until some time in the future, for whatever commercial reasons of
their
own.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000121">From
what the Secretary of State decided in the four appeals, it appears
that the local plan will have no weight until it is actually adopted.
It cannot be adopted, however, until after the process of examination
in public. District councils such as Cherwell are in no way in control
of when the Planning Inspectorate will undertake and complete the
continuous improvement plan. Until then, we are all vulnerable to
continuing opportunist planning applications by developers who strongly
suspect that they will be allowed by the Planning Inspectorate or by
the Secretary of State on
appeal.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13102452000243" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000243">2.33

local green space designation. I helped to author that policy, and I
was proud when it made its way into the coalition agreement, and from
there into the “Natural Environment White Paper” and then
the national planning policy framework. As the Prime Minister said to
the director of the National Trust, I think, it would be a tool that
local people could use to protect not vast tracts of countryside, but
those local spaces that were not necessarily the most beautiful or the

“At last, we have a Government committed to localism, which I am
proud to be part of and a supporter of”—Conservative
colleagues were equally proud—and that the Government were
actually going to deliver on such promises, rejecting the very
unpopular, top-down regional spatial strategies that seemed to be
imposing numbers from above. The regional spatial strategy in the

being formulated in the joint core strategy goes through. Almost
everything in the plan is greenfield sites, and almost all those sites

such things—all of which were recognised by inspectors in the

the right hon. Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)
rightly said, it is as if the rest of the national planning policy
framework, which we celebrated at the time of its second draft, did not
really exist. There were elements that discussed balancing economic
growth with environmental and social factors, and things such as the
local green space designation to protect what people really cared
about; among the core planning principles were meant to be respect for
the environment and sustainability, and prioritisation of open spaces
and, if possible, brownfield over greenfield development. In practice,
however, at local level all of that appears to count for absolutely
nothing. We are told that the objectively assessed housing need
dictated by the econometric model must be observed
absolutely—that the developers must get absolutely everything
that they are demanding, because otherwise unelected inspectors will
declare the whole plan unsound.</hs_Para>

around—many Liberal Democrats and some Conservatives voted for
it, while others voted against. The result was that councillors were
put between a rock and a hard place. They were told that if they voted
things down and did not move on at least to the next stage of

think all hon. Members here greatly welcomed the abolition of the
previous housing regime and everything in the new national planning
policy, including abolition of the regional spatial strategy housing
targets. However, I see all around, particularly in my area, that it is
pretty much business as usual for planning departments, for the
Planning Inspectorate and certainly for developers. Some key aspects of
the current regime seem very similar to the old regime and are being
interpreted and treated similarly—for example, the requirement
to find the local need. It is not a target, but it must be established
based on complicated methodology. Consultants in my area have come up
with four or five different scenarios, all wildly different, about
local housing need. It is supposed to be objective, but councillors
will have to choose the figure that they believe is most likely to be
accepted by the Planning Inspectorate. That does not strike me as
wholly
objective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000139">We
must put together a local plan that specifies deliverable land over a
certain number of years and then developable land. There must be
objective evidence of whether it really is deliverable, and I
understand that. We cannot have local councils saying they want to
build all their houses on what is currently a lake because that would
be a good way to get around having building done. In the world of
planning, however, what is deliverable is entirely down to argument.
The big unit developers may see the four or five attractive green
fields that are left in a borough, and argue that they could put their
bulldozers on there tomorrow, that the development would be in single
ownership and that that would be a good deal with a percentage going to
the farmer. No one could argue otherwise—it is clearly
developable tomorrow.</hs_Para>

in practice over the last decade and during the previous
Government’s regime is that land was banked and there was not
enough work done or pressure put on the little brownfield sites in

they see and
appreciate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000141">I
urge the Minister to put as much pressure as he can on councils when
interpreting and putting together their plans. In the national planning
policy framework and the recent guidance, which I greatly welcome, it
is clear that our councils have the power to do something about small
sites, which may be in multiple ownership with some planning
constraints. They can knock heads together and encourage local people
to suggest such sites. That would save us from losing the fields that
we 
<?notus-xml column=167?>all love and appreciate. However, that is a big ask for a constrained
planning department. Everyone is feeling the pinch at the moment, and
the planning inspector is breathing down councils’ necks to get
the local plan completed. It is a lot more work and takes a lot more
time, but it can be done. For example, if we want to build houses, we
are much more likely to get small local sites up and running. If we
told the local scrap metal dealer, who has gone bust because we have
changed the law and he cannot take cash, that he could build five or
six starter homes on his land tomorrow, he would not do what the big
unit developers do and wait until the time is right or build only one
or two homes because he does not want to flood the market; he would
sell straight away and houses would be built there.</hs_Para>

change what we are doing and target smaller and less popular sites that
have local owners, who will use local builders and local estate agents.
We would then have a much more popular local plan for residents, and we
would not have the big household-name developers acquiring 600-unit
sites where, if they got around to building houses on them, it would
not be in the time frame we want, and would market them out of town and

is the problem with the current planning regime, and we desperately
need the Department to tell councils that it expects them to plan
positively. Planning positively under the national planning policy
framework does not mean more green-belt sites with many houses on them.
It means they should find out where they want houses, and make that
happen. We must get that message across, because it is in the national
planning policy framework and it is good stuff, but out there on the

will have a real bottom-up approach to planning.</hs_Para>

about local communities deciding what, where and when development
should take place. There has been a real appetite and interest in my
constituency in being involved in the planning process. Groups such as
Wharfedale and Airedale Review Development and Aireborough Civic
Society have campaigned long and hard on the issue. In addition,
residents have turned up in their hundreds at public meetings when
these issues were discussed. Organisations such as Horsforth town
council. Rawdon parish council and Aireborough Neighbourhood Forum have
all worked incredibly hard to engage with the whole community, bringing
residents, schools and businesses together to develop a vision of
future development that is sustainable, realistic and seeks to preserve
our natural surroundings.</hs_Para>

not just about building houses but about creating places that people
want to live in, work in and play in: real place-making. Something is
jeopardising all that work, and is still seen by my constituents as a
top-down major influence: the housing targets that we have heard so
much about today. We all know that the original regional spatial
strategy placed huge burdens on local authorities, but despite
abolition of the RSS, little has changed with the targets. In my
constituency, the core strategy of the city council is being examined.
It includes a plan to build 74,000 homes over the next 14
years, and it arrived at that figure with a host of scenarios ranging
from 27,500 to 92,000. That means that the council has gone for the
high end because it believes that the Government expect it to be far
more ambitious than can reliably be achieved. I, local councillors, and
all the groups I have mentioned have argued, ever since the document
came out in draft form, that the figures are far too high. Despite our
logical arguments, the council has kept the target, fearing that the
inspector will force it to go even higher. The problem is that the
council is far too ambitious.</hs_Para>

consequence? The council then has to prove that it has the land to
supply such high targets. Even with the existing permissions of 20,000
dwellings, 
<?notus-xml column=169?>there is still not enough land, so the council is now looking at
greenfield and green belt, meaning that in my constituency up to 80% of
all new homes will be built on green-belt or greenfield sites. The
precious places that are the lungs of our communities, the natural
barriers between the towns and villages, and the green borders between
the cities of Leeds and Bradford, will all be gone. They are now all
under threat and my constituents are clearly not happy. Even in the
best of the boom years, we never managed to build so many houses, and
developers want to go even higher, saying that the brownfield sites in
the city centre are not viable. That is because they are lazy and do
not want to be ambitious about creating places where people want to
live in our city centres.</hs_Para>

day, I asked my hon. Friend the Minister what happens if the inspector,
in the process of looking at these figures, agrees to such a high
amount. If it is approved, I fear that the brownfield sites in city
centres will be abandoned, that the developers will cherry-pick the
green belt, and that residents will be stuck between the Government
saying that local councils can set high targets and the council saying
that the Government expect high targets.</hs_Para>

the Minister will say that the target needs to be objectively assessed,
but what happens if those figures are approved? Is there any appeal
process for my constituents to present their case? They are doing so
brilliantly at the hearing, but if we are saddled with those housing
targets, our green belt will be ravaged, and future residents will not
be able to do anything, because the period will already have been set
in stone. Worst of all, however, it will send a message that some
already believe: localism goes only so far, but not far enough where it

Bruce</B> (Congleton) (Con):</Member> I am here as a voice for my
constituents, who feel grievously let down by the lack of clarity of
the planning policy, practices and procedures of local and national
Government. Only one thing is clear: despite more than 20 action groups
representing thousands of people across my constituency, despite many
public meetings, the most recent of which was held last night in
Congleton town hall, despite my bringing successive leaders of Cheshire
East council to meet Ministers for clarity on these issues, and despite
countless letters having been sent to Ministers on behalf of
constituents, we still have developer-led development in our area and
unsustainable, unplanned development. It ignores town plans, places no
weight on the emerging local plan and makes a mockery of
localism.</hs_Para>

planning policy framework, with its presumption of sustainable
development, contains an inadequate definition of that—in fact,
it is barely a definition at all—which certainly does not equate
with my constituents’ definition. Sustainability means there
being enough schools, roads, medical centres and facilities for local
people, and there simply will not be enough if the rate of development
continues in our towns.</hs_Para>

alone, which is a town of some 5,500 houses, applications
are in the pipeline for 3,000 dwellings. This is a town recently
described by the chief planning officer of Cheshire East council as
“currently unsustainable”. In Sandbach, which is a town
of 8,000, some 6,000 applications have been granted or are in the
pipeline. Just last week, two consents for Sandbach were granted, in
Abbeyfields and Congleton road. That makes the consents already granted
for Sandbach sufficient to cover one third of its 20-year supply. And
those are on greenfield sites. This is countryside. This is prime
agricultural land. The mayor of Sandbach is in the Chamber today,
having come directly from 10 Downing street, where he presented a
petition objecting to the Government’s policies.</hs_Para>

the unclear procedure surrounding the requirement for a five-year
supply of housing. That is simply unjust. The primary reason for the
two appeals granted last week was that Cheshire East apparently is
unable to demonstrate a five-year housing supply, and yet the council
told residents months ago that it had developed a robust strategic
housing land availability assessment, which would satisfy requirements
for a five-year housing supply.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102452000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000160">Who is
right—national Government, through the inspectorate, or local
government? How was it that Cheshire East could say that it had
demonstrated a five-year supply if clearly it had not? Is there no
means by which such statements can be validated with central Government
before they are made? Surely the only way cannot be for the strength of
such a supply statement to be tested on appeal, because it adds insult
to injury for thousands of pounds of local taxpayers’ money to
be spent on such appeals, when it could be spent on meeting local
people’s needs. There is so much confusion regarding the
requirements that injustice is being introduced into our communities,
particularly because there are other sites—brownfield and
non-brownfield, including in Sandbach—that the local community
have already said that they will accept for development.</hs_Para>

me to my next point. It is wholly wrong that people in the towns of
Alsager, Congleton, Middlewich and Sandbach in my constituency were
offered the opportunity and funding under the Government’s
neighbourhood plan front-runner schemes to develop neighbourhood plans,
only to find that those town plans count for absolutely nothing, in
terms of the Planning Inspectorate’s decisions regarding appeals
against developments.</hs_Para>

is also producing inconsistent decision making. Just last week, when
two developers’ applications were accepted for Sandbach, we had
a refusal for a site at Sandbach road north in Alsager. That was
despite the inspectorate acknowledging the lack of a demonstrable
five-year supply of deliverable housing in Cheshire East, and
apparently, according to my interpretation, giving weight to the draft
Cheshire East local plan, which other decisions
refused to do. It stated:</hs_Para>
<hs_brev UID="13102452000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000234">“It
would seem wise in this part of the borough not to proceed with

inspectorate also rejected the developer’s appeal on the grounds
that it is in open countryside, and that harm to it would be
significant and demonstrable. But so it would be to Abbeyfields,
Congleton road and Hind Heath in Sandbach, which have already been 
<?notus-xml column=171?>granted. We really need clarity on these issues. How long should a local
plan realistically take to develop? We pride ourselves in this country
on clear and speedy delivery of justice. We say that justice delayed is
justice denied. We talk about the rule of law. And yet, in planning, we
could not have murkier, muddier waters. That is simply
unfair.</hs_Para>

authority has been working for three years on a local plan. What has
gone wrong? Why does the draft plan that was prepared last year, which
was the subject of a six-week public consultation, now have to be
radically altered and be the subject of a further public consultation,
while all the time, developers rub their hands with glee and take
advantage of that void? Will the Minister provide whatever assistance
is required for Cheshire East council from a senior planning adviser to
ensure that there are no further delays or confusion regarding what is
required to get our local plan through? My constituents have had

past two years, Warwick district council has been seeking to create a
new local plan that will guide the development of our community for the
next 18 years. That is a hugely important document, but  it has
been mired in controversy and opposition since it was put forward. That
highlights some of the problems 
<?notus-xml column=172?>in the current planning system. The local plan has been controversial
because of the number of homes that have been proposed by the council,
as well as their concentration and location. First, the scale of the
proposed housing development is enormous. The local plan
outlines  the building, during the next 16 years, of more than
12,000 homes, in addition to the 6,000 that we built between
2001 and 2011. That would increase the number of dwellings in Warwick
district by about 20% during the next two
decades.</hs_Para><hs_76fChair UID="13102452000006" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000006">[<SmallCaps>Mr

“Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment” compiled
by the council has indicated that the total capacity of the district is
about 13,000 dwellings between 2014 and 2029, so the proposed local
plan would use up 91.8% of the total capacity. Planning is something
that we must consider over the long term. Once homes are built, we
cannot turn back the clock to change the mistakes that we have made, so
we must consider the long-term sustainability of our planning decisions
as a whole. How can it be sustainable to build so many new homes and to
use up so much
capacity?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000172">The
concentration of development is also a deep concern and raises
questions of fairness. The majority of the new properties will be in
the area south of Warwick, Leamington and Whitnash, with 70% of the new
homes being placed in that part of the district. That is despite the
fact that there has been, and continues to be, a considerable amount of
housing development in that part of the district and there are already
concerns about the impact that the proposals will have on local
infrastructure. I do not believe it is fair that such a concentration
is allowed in that part of the district. Residents of those areas are
rightly angry about the sacrifices that they are being asked to make in
order to allow the development of so many new
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000173">I
shall take this opportunity to urge Warwick district council, once
again, to pause the local plan process and start discussions with local
residents so that we can build a consensus on creating a sustainable
future for our community. During the process, in the lead-up to the
preferred options being outlined by the district council, it was clear
that residents did not want to have that number of homes and that they
wanted development to take place primarily on brownfield land, rather
than greenfield land as is proposed. That will have an impact on the
wonderful Warwickshire countryside. Our area has a large percentage of
green belt, and I do not believe that we should develop on green-belt
land. However, that does not give the local authority an excuse to
concentrate developments on non-protected greenfield sites. If our
district was 95% green belt rather than  80%, would that mean
that all development would be concentrated in the unprotected 5%?
Surely it would make sense to adjust the scale and ambitions of the
development, rather than to ram through such large developments, which
take no account of this
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000174">However,
the views to which I have referred have not been consistently accepted
by the council to date. As a result, public confidence in it has been
damaged, and that will undermine future efforts by the council to
undertake consultations on new developments or infrastructure. I
appreciate that councils have an obligation to ensure that there is
enough housing to meet demand in the future, but I also think that we
need to ensure that 
<?notus-xml column=173?>that obligation is met in the right way. I do not believe that Warwick

believe that the Government have done the right thing through the
Localism Act 2011 to try to ensure that communities have greater
control over planning matters. However, we also need to ensure that the
process is carried out in the right way, in empathy with such localism,
that councils do not ride roughshod over the desires of local people,

ground.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000176">The
best way forward would be for the Government to get each local
authority to sign up to a national planning compact that outlines how
councils are expected to carry out their consultations on planning
matters; the role that local communities should have in co-producing
proposals such as the local plan; and best practice in terms of
planning processes that have been carried forward and that have brought
communities with them. Having such a compact would ensure that each

under threat from the misguided plans of the local authority. The City
of York council published its draft local plan in April of this year
and, to the utter dismay of many of my constituents, the plan proposes
to take 1,400 acres out of York’s green belt and build 16,000
new homes on that land during the 15-year life of the plan. As if that
was not enough to satisfy the council’s appetite for green-belt
land, a further 1,000 acres will be removed from the green belt and
safeguarded for future development. Sadly, the plan does not stop
there. The council has also proposed more than 80 additional Traveller

land, in quiet rural communities such as Dunnington, Knapton and
Huntington in my

development should always be
sustainable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000186">York

am deeply concerned that the plan will push our already creaking local

guarantees that it will help secure the investment we need in our local
infrastructure. It clearly believes the local plan will result in
economic growth for York, but having investigated the issue, I fear
that putting the cart before the horse and failing to guarantee the
infrastructure investment York already needs will lead many of the

York is still a suitable base for their businesses.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) that the
requirement for infrastructure must be considered when granting
planning consent—something that, to be frank, is blindingly
obvious. I was reassured by the pledge from the former Minister of
State at the Department, the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells
(Greg Clark), that the requirement would form part of the
planning  
<?notus-xml column=175?>guidance. I hope, therefore, that the omission will be rectified, as

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000189">Local
authorities that press ahead with unsustainable housing plans must be
stopped and compelled to consider whether they have the necessary
infrastructure in place; if not, they should change their plans
accordingly. Equally, we must ensure that the important principles of
sustainability and green-belt protection remain central to the national
planning policy framework and that our local authorities understand
that that is the case. Otherwise, I fear that the towns and cities we

the tension between our local planning authorities and the planning
inspector is twofold. Where councils produce reasonable, appropriate
and sustainable local plans, we face the problem of planning inspectors
overstepping the mark and making unreasonable demands. In areas such as
York, however, we appear to face the opposite problem, because the
local authorities propose to decimate our open countryside and change
it out of all recognition. I therefore reiterate that it is vital that
we have a strong and fair Planning Inspectorate to protect our
communities and countryside from unsustainable development. That means
that infrastructure must be at the heart of any
considerations.</hs_Para>

local planning decisions to councils, which makes so much democratic
sense, has raised a range of issues. I particularly welcome the
Government’s introduction of neighbourhood planning. In the

discuss planning, however, one thing that strikes me is that the
beautiful villages we all love—in my area, I have the villages
around Bredon Hill, the town of Pershore and the towns and villages of
the Malvern Hills district—all grew up without our current
planning regulations. Ironically, however, we would not be able to
build those communities under today’s planning rules. Their
growth tended to be more organic and more bottom up; people built their
own homes on their own land, which they had bought for that purpose.
When the Victorians became concerned that Great Malvern was encroaching
far too much on the Malvern hills, 
<?notus-xml column=176?>they established the world’s first conservation area by Act of
Parliament in 1884. Since then, the hills have been owned for the
common good by the Malvern Hills Conservators charity. That organic
approach has worked well for this country for the thousands of years
there have been settlements in Worcestershire and elsewhere. That is
why I am so supportive of the recent changes to the planning system,
which move us back in the direction of the village and the
neighbourhood, while embodying the countryside protections pioneered by
the Malvern Hills Conservators.</hs_Para>

Worcestershire, we may be a bit further ahead on our local plan than
other colleagues are on theirs. Our three local
councils—Worcester City, Malvern Hills and Wychavon, which my
hon. Friend the Minister visited recently—have been working in
partnership for many years to develop an ambitious and sound local
plan. After the 2010 election, they presciently commissioned expert
projections of population growth and perhaps got a head start on some
other council areas. Their evidence base is now more up to date and
fresher than those in some other parts of the country.</hs_Para>

local councils democratically agreed the plan last December. I can
assure hon. Members that that was not without a great deal of
controversy, but one factor that encouraged councillors to vote in
favour of the plan was that it would allow them to be in control. The
south Worcestershire development plan has much more up-to-date and
adequate five-year land supply numbers and such ambitious plans for
employment land that we are getting complaints from Birmingham
councils.</hs_Para>

the plan was democratically agreed last December, people complain that
a bit of whipping was involved. Well, I hate to tell my local
councillors this, but Whips are often involved in democracy here in
Westminster. However, despite the vote last December, it took a further
five months to send the plan to the inspector for the examination in
public and another few months for him to decide on his inspection plan
and timetable. The inspection has just got under way, and I would not

council in my area have written to him. I have also written to the
local planning inspector urging him to respect the local plan unless
there are actual factual inaccuracies in it. The inspector has written

wish list of four things I would like to ask the Minister for. First,
as he finalises his latest national planning practice guidance, which
will set out the exceptional circumstances in which a refusal may be

democratically agreed plans that have emerged will get almost full
weight in any decision making, allowing the fresh evidence base and the
numbers in the plan to be used, unless the inspector sees actual errors
of fact, rather than just a divergence of opinion?

may I ask the Minister for his thoughts on how we as MPs can best
support emerging neighbourhood plans? I love neighbourhood planning,
which is an excellent way of giving power to local people and bringing
back an organic approach to planning, reducing the need for vast
swathes of land to be swallowed up by urban extensions. Thirdly, can we
reassure villages that, once they have agreed their neighbourhood plan
and won a vote on it in a referendum, it will take precedence over the
local plan, even if that has been
adopted?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000202">Finally,
what can the Minister say to the octogenarian farmer in my local area
who lives in a draughty five-bedroom home and who wants nothing more

his life? Under today’s rules, such building is prohibited in

getting the housing supply right—we have a growing population,

our natural assets—and they are assets. Our countryside helps to
define our communities, making them distinctive. It provides
agricultural land and draws in visitors, which boosts tourism in towns
and villages. Those things are valuable assets and need to be
protected. It is important to underline the point that the debate is

elected representatives and clearly expressed their views. I know that
the final local plan will be much better for that. We recognise in
Cheshire East, and in Macclesfield in particular, that the local plan
urgently needs to be signed off to stop unwanted speculative housing
developments, as my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton,

defining what housing is required in our five-year housing supply. At
the moment that is holding us back. As my hon. Friend the Member for

that can be developed. There is a difference of opinion between the
councils and the inspector as to what the figure should be; that is
what needs to be unblocked so we can move forward. I urge the Minister

all the hard work that has been done to shape the plan, there are other
questions that urgently need an answer. Like many Macclesfield

that its focus was on housing developments to 2030. I think that the
Minister may be a little surprised to know that I found out a few
months ago that Cheshire East council officers were now under the
impression that they had to work towards a planning horizon not of
2030—which by most people’s standards is, I think, quite
a long time horizon—but 2050. That has completely slowed down

requirements have major implications, particularly for the northern
part of the borough. In communities such as Macclesfield and Poynton,
which I am proud to represent, the news led the council to highlight
green-belt land as supposedly “safeguarded for
development”—not to be confused with safeguarding 
<?notus-xml column=179?>it from development, which is very different. The designation could be
applied to large areas such as south-west Macclesfield, where up to
3,000 houses could be
developed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102452000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102452000211">We

Minister will understand the strong local concern—including
mine—at the proposal to safeguard green belt “for
development” to achieve housing targets for not 2030 but 2050.
That situation is made even worse by the fact that there are no
exceptional or compelling circumstances, which are a clear requirement

a requirement for approval of a local plan? If it is not, will he also
confirm that it will not be necessary to safeguard land for
development, particularly in the green belt, beyond 2030? Macclesfield
residents will be grateful for his views on those issues. They will
affect green-belt areas that are vital to the fabric of the community,

Hinds</B> (East Hampshire) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to
see you in the Chair, Mr Brady, and to follow my hon. Friend the Member
for Macclesfield (David Rutley). I congratulate my hon. Friends the
Members for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), and for St Albans
(Mrs Main), and my right hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South
Downs (Nick Herbert), on securing this important debate, which is
particularly important to residents of East
Hampshire—especially, at present, residents of Four Marks, the
parish of Medstead, Liphook, Alton, Petersfield and the area in and
around Bordon and Whitehill. I want to focus on two aspects of the
issue that my right hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs
set out clearly and convincingly: the need for recognition of
in-progress plans; and the insistence on accompanying infrastructure
where permissions are granted.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000002">Like those of
many other areas, our plan was stopped in its tracks. In our case it
was stopped at the stage of the joint core strategy between East
Hampshire district council and the South Downs national park authority,
and we now find ourselves in the void period that many hon. Members
have spoken about, which can last a long time. The concern is that in
that long time, until things are finalised, there is a risk—we
already see the signs—of a flood of speculative
applications.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000003">I should say
that East Hampshire district council is not anti-development, and nor
am I. There is concern that the average first-time buyer in East
Hampshire is 40 years old, and that the average home costs
£321,000. We also recognise the need for market towns and
villages to have vibrant, diverse communities. If we want to save what
is left of our village pubs and shops, we need people to work in them,
and our small primary schools need young families with children to go
to them. The council also supports a substantial development on 
<?notus-xml column=180?>former Ministry of Defence land at Whitehill and Bordon; my hon. Friend
the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) spoke about his area’s
eco-town, and this is ours. In the case of Bordon, the development will
add 2,700 homes. East Hampshire also has a very ambitious self-set
target for affordable homes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000004">In its
interim housing statement, in this void period, East Hampshire reflects
the revised strategic housing market assessment, or SHMA—I think
I am the first speaker this afternoon to say that, although I know that
my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) mentioned the
SHLAA—the strategic housing land availability assessment. The
SHMA called for between 500 and 650 homes per annum, and East Hampshire
is working towards the figure of 582, which is of course in the top
half of that range.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000005">In some
places, the speculative applications and pre-application interest shown
already exceed the targets in the areas and villages concerned for the
period until 2028, and in my constituency that is especially true in
Four Marks, the parish of Medstead, Alton and Liphook. There has also
been significant interest in Petersfield, where a neighbourhood plan is
in development; we expect the referendum on that next year. I suggest
to the Minister that where a council is making proactive efforts, once
the number of houses called for in the interim housing
statement—in our case—has been reached in a particular
area, it ought to be possible to say, “No
more.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000006">A
complication is that part of my constituency is in a national
park—the relatively newly formed South Downs national
park—and other parts have special protection area status, which
leaves people who are in neither feeling somewhat exposed. We need a
balance of development and a balance of community throughout the area.
I strongly suggest that the elected local council is best placed to
determine how the balance should be struck, and the interim housing
statement seems to be a good way to express that. In general,
residents’ concerns are twofold: first, they are concerned about
the general scale of development and its implications for the character
of an area; and secondly, they are concerned about the infrastructure
deficit. Already, certain parts have seen significant infrastructure
deficit. Four Marks has experienced a great deal of development, and
needs commensurate infrastructure to ensure safety on the main
road—the A31—sufficient primary places, and so
on.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000007">The approach
is meant to be plan-led, so Ministers rightly say that the best thing
that everybody can do is get on and make their plans. That is of course
correct, but the plan process seems to take inordinate amount of time,
from beginning to end, and there must be ways to accelerate elements of
it. We must recognise that many councils are not at the end of the
process and find themselves in this void period. A large proportion of
plan submissions in the first year of the national planning policy
framework were found to be not sound. I therefore join strongly in the
calls to make it explicit that infrastructure requirements should be
met if permission is to be granted, the calls for emerging plans to be
recognised, and the calls to find ways to speed up the whole
process.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000008">I shall
strike a slightly different tone on the overall need for housing. I
recognise that we need housing—the Office for National
Statistics figure is 232,000 homes per year—but what is not
necessarily well understood is that that is not all, or even nearly
all, about immigration. If we strip out future net migration, the
projected 
<?notus-xml column=181?>requirement is still 149,000: people are living longer; households are
smaller, for all sorts of wider social reasons; kids live away at
university and have a place at home; hardly anyone has a lodger
anymore; and so on. There are lots of pressures, and they will not go
away. The south-east will over-index on that pressure, and we must
accommodate it but also mitigate
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000009">I
encourage the Minister to work with councillors on how, on a relatively
small scale in our local areas, we can do more about the conversion of
redundant agricultural buildings; make granny flat conversions easier;
work on empty properties, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury
said; and take up small-site opportunities, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Castle Point (Rebecca Harris) said clearly. An interesting
point in the Portas report was about the opportunity to concentrate
town centres. That has the benefit of freeing-up space on the relative
periphery for residential development. On a bigger scale, there are new
towns, but perhaps the biggest opportunity of all is the one touched on
by my hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew): we should not
only build higher-density, in-town living, but make it attractive. Some
of the most sought after areas of the country are high-density, which
proves that it can, in principle, be done. I see that I am out of time,
Mr Brady, so I will stop there.</hs_Para>

Bingham</B> (High Peak) (Con):</Member> I congratulate my hon. Friends
on securing this debate. We can tell by the attendance today, and from
our postbags, that the subject is of great importance to Members and
our constituents. It follows on from a 30-minute debate held in
Westminster Hall some time ago, in which, because of sheer weight of
numbers, the time limit was very restrictive. Today we have been given
double that limit— six minutes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000011">I spent 12
years on the local council, and planning exercised my residents more
than anything else, and as an MP, I find a similar situation. The
creation of the NPPF has simplified the planning laws, which had become
complicated and burdensome. Like many others here today, I supported
sending the power to rule on applications down to local authorities. As
a councillor on the planning committee, I felt many times that we were
rubber-stamping central Government policies on development. That was
frustrating to me and my residents, because they believed, as I did
when first elected, that the local authority was the sole arbiter on
applications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000012">As
previous speakers have said, I look forward to a brave new world under
the new NPPF and local plans, where locally elected representatives
make the decisions that impact so much on local people, but I, too, am
concerned about recent events. My constituency, High Peak, is the most
beautiful in the country, though I am biased. I am sure that others
will disagree. As I said in the previous debate, there has been a
proliferation of significant applications for development on greenfield
sites. They have been refused by the local authority’s planning
committee on perfectly legitimate grounds. This is not a case of
nimbyism at all. The decisions were met with great approval, and in
some cases relief, by local residents, who felt that their views had
been represented by the people for whom they had voted.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=182?><hs_Para UID="13102454000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000013">I want to be
clear: the High Peak is a great place to live. I am lucky, as are my
constituents. We know that many people would love to live in the High
Peak. We are not of the mind that says, “We have our housing and
we’re going to pull the ladder up. We’re all right,
Jack.” We acknowledge that there is a need for some housing. My
constituents have young children and teenagers. There are people in
their early 20s who want to stay and live in the High Peak. There is a
housing need, which I touched on in my Adjournment debate last week on
the challenges facing rural businesses. We need houses for people to
live in, so that they can work in the High Peak. No one I have spoken
to disputes that there is a need for housing. My constituents would
accept development, provided it was proportionate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102454000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000014">Recent
decisions by local councillors, who, I remind everyone, are elected by
local people, have been overturned by the Planning Inspectorate, which
is not. That flies in the face of everything that we believe about
localism. I have spoken to many residents, who are seeing more
applications coming forward, with the threat of ever larger
developments. In my previous speech on the subject, I highlighted the
area of Harpur Hill and the concerns of its residents’
association. I will not repeat the statistics, because time is short
and they are in<I> Hansard</I>, but as I said in my previous speech,
the problems facing Harpur Hill are mirrored in other areas of my
constituency. As the Minister knows, Chapel-en-le-Frith parish council
now objects to every significant planning application, after several
applications have already been given the nod. If all of them were
built, the size of that small village, where I live, would increase
significantly, beyond what many believe the infrastructure could cope
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000015">I
could run through a list of applications in different parts of my
constituency, but we are not at a planning meeting today. My
constituents are asking questions about the applications and the method
of approval. Are they powerless to prevent approvals? Can they at least
ensure that there is some sense of proportion? Proportion is what they
are asking for. I am sure that the Minister will respond that local
plans should be drawn up, and planning policy should be defined in
documents and properly evaluated. My local council has yet to product
its local plan; indeed, it has delayed its anticipated completion. In
2011, the controlling Labour group rejected proposals from the
Conservative group to use some underspend to bring forward brownfield
sites. It has now belatedly allocated some extra resources to that.
Delaying the local plan has created a window of opportunity for
developers. I could easily turn my contribution into a tirade against
the Labour group and its management of the local authority. I have met
the executive member to discuss the situation; he has his views and I
have
mine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0001.htm#13102454000016">I
want to deal with the harsh realities of the here and now. No local
plan has been completed, and developers are submitting speculative
applications time after time—applications that may have been
refused in the past. They see from previous examples, which I
highlighted today, that the Planning Inspectorate appears to be unmoved
by local representations. I repeat that this is not nimbyism; my
constituents and I are not against development. It is about proportion.
A well-constructed local plan should bring in proportion, but at the
moment the Planning Inspectorate does not listen to our
views.</hs_Para>

that the Minister has agreed to visit the High Peak. I promise him a
warm welcome in the hillsides. We can have an interesting day. There
has been a dearth of houses built in the past few years, and that has
created the shortage facing us today, but I am concerned that in our
eagerness to deal with that, we are being too hasty, and will be left
to repent at leisure. I have asked the Minister this question
previously, and I will repeat it today: will he not seek to give more
weight to emerging plans? I know that that may amount to making up for
the shortcomings of the council, but I am looking to assist my
constituents.</hs_Para>

at the clock; time is short, and I could go on to several other issues.
A consultation on the latitude in permitted development rights for
agricultural buildings closed recently. The Peak District national park
covers a large chunk of my constituency. I value that national park
greatly, as I know the Minister does—he has gone on record on
this. People are concerned about that proposal. There was also a
consultation on catching up on housing deficits, and having to reduce
them in the first two or three years. That will cause huge problems to
local authorities if we are not careful.</hs_Para>

the Minister: listen to what we have all said today. We are all on a
common theme: we need houses. We know that under the previous
Government, the numbers were woefully low, but let us get some
proportion. The essence of localism is local decisions made by local
people. That is not happening in the High Peak, and, from what we have
heard today, it does not appear to be happening in other areas of the
country. I would therefore like some assurance from the Minister that
something can be done for my constituents. Harold Wilson once said to

serve under your chairmanship again, Mr Brady. This debate is primarily
for Back Benchers, so I had intended to keep my remarks fairly short. I
think I should do that and give the Minister lots of time. I
congratulate the hon. Members for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson) and for St

hon. Members will forgive me if I do not go through their contributions
individually, because that would take up a great deal of time. They
spoke 
<?notus-xml column=184?>passionately about their own areas. There clearly is a major issue
across the country. I was pleased that a number of their remarks were
not based on just being anti-housing. There was a sound recognition
that we need more housing, but concern was expressed about the sites
that have been identified for building houses. I was pleased to see a
commitment to plan-making and place-shaping, because they are an
important part of the solution to some of the issues that have been
raised today. Hon. Members also produced a wish list. I am probably
going to add to that a little bit, but I hope not too much.</hs_Para>

we need more housing, including in rural areas. In order to secure a
typical mortgage, a rural resident needs to earn £66,000. With
the average rural income standing at just over £20,000, there
clearly is a problem with affordability. That exists partly as a result
of insufficient supply. The situation in rural areas is part of a wider
problem. For decades, under successive Governments, house building has
stayed low relative to demand. I will hold my hands up to say that the
previous Labour Government did not see enough houses built, but neither
did the previous Conservative Government. Private house building
completions in England have been relatively static for more than
30 years, averaging about 130,000 per annum. That is below
the peak average of 180,000 per annum in the 1960s, and well below
potential.</hs_Para>

housing associations, which averaged more than 130,000 per annum in the

ever-growing gap between supply and demand, which means that millions
of hard-working people are increasingly priced out of buying their own

nine times larger than the average wage. The average low-to-middle
income household would now have to save for 22 years to accumulate a
deposit for the typical first home, compared with just three years in
1997. So-called second steppers are also being affected, with

of our housing stock. That is especially important in rural areas,
national parks, areas of special scientific interest and so on. I am a

that you are delighted to see so many of your flock here. I wish I
could pretend that I thought so many of my hon. Friends were here
because I am so popular in the party or because I am a compelling

hardship that the crisis is visiting on millions of our fellow

others have referred to the situation in their constituencies. The hon.

Boles:</Member></B> I will just recap some of the figures mentioned by
the hon. Member for City of Durham and others. In the past year, the
percentage of first-time buyers in England who were able to buy a home
without their parents’ help fell to its lowest level ever, under
one third. Two thirds of all first-time buyers in England last year
required a subsidy from their parents. By definition, that means that
they came from a relatively narrow social group—those from
relatively well-off families. Until we introduced the Help to Buy
policy, the opportunity to become a first-time buyer had been denied to
a large number of our fellow citizens.</hs_Para>

fact also mentioned by the hon. Member for City of Durham is that the
average age of first-time buyers has crept up and up, and is now
nudging 40 in many parts of the country, although of course there are
parts of the country where the crisis is not so acute. It is intense
within the south-east and the south, but there are also pockets in
parts of Yorkshire, and it is just as intense elsewhere, around certain
big

Boles:</Member></B> If I may finish, we also know that the size of the
homes in which families are forced to live has fallen steadily for
several decades. The number of overcrowded families has risen and the
amount of space in which young people must grow up has fallen for
several decades for a simple reason: our population has grown and we
have not built enough houses to keep pace with it.</hs_Para>

in population has had two main sources. One, which is contentious in
the House and elsewhere, is immigration, which was uncontrolled for a
long time. We as a party rightly criticised that, and are now doing
something to control it. However, it is important to remember that the
majority—about two thirds—of the growth in population and
in the number of households in the country has resulted not from
immigration but from ageing. One way that I ask people to think about
it is by considering how many people now are part of families in which
four generations are alive. Quite a lot of them are. It used to be rare
to have a great-grandparent or great-grandchild in a family; it is now
common, because people are living longer, and they do not all want to
live in the same house. I could go on, but I know that time is
limited.</hs_Para>

is intense. I accept that my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr
Robertson) does not share my view, but many hon. Members do, and there
are a lot of statistics to prove it. How are we going to solve the
problem? My hon. Friend, whom I congratulate on securing this debate,
referred to the country having 700,000 empty homes, which, he said,
should be a priority for meeting the intense need for housing. Although
I agree with the sentiment, unfortunately his figure does not give a
true picture. The figure of 700,000 homes captures every home that is
empty right now, including every home that is between buyer and seller
and every home in probate.</hs_Para>

therefore, give him the true figure for homes that have been empty for
more than six months, which I think we can all agree is probably the
right figure for an empty home that could meet somebody’s
housing need in the long term. That number is 260,000 for the whole of
England. It has fallen by 41,000 since this Government came into office
in 2010. We are spending a great deal of money, and we and local
authorities are working hard, to bring those empty homes back into use.
It is important to recognise that many—not all, by any means,
but many—of those 260,000 are in parts of the country where
demand for housing is not as strong as it once was, not in parts of the
country where demand for housing is great. I do not believe that a
Government can tell people to go and live somewhere with no jobs and no
future, just because houses have been built there. Empty homes can make
a contribution and are doing so under this Government, but in the scale
of need explained so vividly by so many, they are a small
contributor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000053">We
need to move to the question of brownfield sites. If it were possible,
everybody in this country would prefer every new house to be built on a
brownfield site. We would all love not to develop a single scrap of
greenfield land if we did not need to. Therefore, the question is
whether there is enough brownfield land to do that. The Campaign to
Protect Rural England often bandies about the statistic that 1.5
million homes could be built on the available brownfield land. I am
afraid that that figure is not entirely a fair representation, because
more than half of that brownfield land is already occupied for another
use—for example, with a house or factory on it. In theory, it
might make good sense to use it for converted housing, but the people
currently occupying and using it for another purpose would, by and
large, have a view on that: if they own or use the property, they will
probably not want to give it up immediately, and if they did give it
up, where would they be employed? Having taken all that out, a large
number of the remaining brownfield sites are in places where demand for
new housing is not so intense. In many areas of most intense demand,
the number of brownfield sites that have not been developed is
relatively
small.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000054">I
reassure hon. Members that nearly 70% of new houses in 2010, the last
year for which figures are available, were built on brownfield land. We
are still building more houses on brownfield land than on greenfield
land. We are approaching the point at which the number of brownfield
sites that are in the right part of the country and are vacant and
available for housing development is too small to supply more than a
small, although significant proportion—nearly 70%, but not
more—of our
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000055">Another
subject raised here and elsewhere by many hon. Members, including my
hon. Friend the Member for St Albans (Mrs Main), is the amount of land
banking in the country. We all know individual examples of sites that
have been bought and for which planning permission has been given, but
on which development has not happened. The question we have to ask is:
why has that happened, what is the scale of that problem and what
contribution would fixing that problem make to solving our intense
need?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000056">We
must first recognise that that is true of many sites because developers
bought them before the financial crash, secured planning permission in
anticipation of 
<?notus-xml column=189?>the economic environment pertaining at the time and, frankly, could not
raise the money to build out the site or, even if they raised the money
to do so, could not find people to buy the houses. Ultimately,
developers are businesses. Certainly in my party, which so many hon.
Members here represent, we believe that businesses need to be free to
make investments and bring forward projects, but should be forced to
complete such projects only if they have a reasonable prospect of
getting their money back and perhaps gaining a small return. That
problem grew during the recession not because of developers’
greedy behaviour, but simply because they do not want to build houses
if there is nobody to buy
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000057">That
situation led to an expansion in the scale of land banking, but let me
tell hon. Members about the current position, because it has been
reduced by the recovery in house building. The latest estimate is that
the total number of units of housing in land banks throughout England
is 500,000, but only half of that is on sites where building has not
begun. From our constituencies, we all know that most housing
developments of a scale greater than a dozen houses are not built out
in one year, but sometimes in three or five years, because it is
natural to do so. If all the houses were built in one place in one
year, it would result in a strange development in which half the houses
were sitting empty. That is how the house building industry works, and
unless any hon. Member in the Chamber wants to nationalise house
building, we have to live with that
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000058">Only
250,000 units are on sites that have not been started. That is a
significant number, but the point is that it covers the whole country,
including some places where demand is not sufficient to pull through
supply. The Labour party has proposed to confiscate that land from
developers, but will such compulsion really solve our housing crisis or
lead developers to build more places where we want those houses? I am
sure that that might make a contribution, as empty homes may, but I do
not believe that it could solve the problem on its
own.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000059">On
the whole question of local plans and the process that local
authorities are asked to go through in putting them together, the
fundamental basis of the national planning policy framework, about
which many hon. Friends and other hon. Members have been generous, is
that local authorities are in control because they have put in place a
local plan. Doing the work of producing a local plan puts the local
council, as the representative of the community, in control. The local
plan has a very simple concept that is very difficult to deliver, which
is that the authority has to provide a five-year land supply of

Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) referred to an econometric model, and other

unreasonable, however, for the Government to tell an authority, which
is representing the people and has a duty to serve them, “Work
out what’s needed, and make plans to provide it.” That is
what we do with schools. We do not tell local authorities, “You
can provide as many school places as you feel like”; we say,
“Provide as 
<?notus-xml column=190?>many school places as are needed.” We do not tell the NHS,
“Provide as many GPs as you feel you can afford right
now”; we say, “Work out how many GPs are needed.”
The same is true of housing sites: we tell local authorities,
“Work out how many houses will be needed in your area over the

of population, of the number of households in which ageing is taking
place and of the historical record and, therefore, the likely future
trend of inward migration. That is the definition. The immigration
figures are based on the past record. They are not just plucked out of
the air as the number of people in the whole world who would quite like
to live in Cheltenham. The model is based on an understanding of the
pressure of demand from people who actually want to come to Cheltenham.

add up to a figure that is too low to meet the overall population
growth of England. It is not, therefore, the

will be able to require the local council to demonstrate to the

that it is ambitious or that it is going for growth. If it has no good

great many of my hon. Friends are concerned because they see that, in
the absence of a local plan that has been fully adopted after an
examination in public by an inspector, many decisions are being made
that local people are not content with and their local authorities have
opposed. It will be of no reassurance to them, but it is interesting
that there is not a single person who has spoken in this debate who is
from an area that has a recently adopted local plan. There is a reason
for that: once there is a recently adopted local plan, the authority is
then in the driving seat. It may well have gone through a process, as
my hon. Friends the Members for Cheltenham, for Tewkesbury and for West
Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin) have—<I>[Interruption.]
</I>No, let me finish my sentence. It may well have gone through the
process of putting together that plan, which would be painful because
it requires someone to carry out the contentious job of identifying the

authority decisions—<I>[Interruption.] </I>I hear lots of
rumblings. If I could just finish the argument, I promise to take some
more interventions. At that point, the authority will find that appeals
are not going against it. I accept that there is a certain amount of
scepticism about the figures, but I am giving Members the facts. In
2012-13, the number of planning appeals in which the inspector backed
the local council and rejected the appeal was 67%. In 2011-12, it was
68%, and so far this year it has been 67%. In two thirds of all
appeals, the inspector is backing local decisions, because the council
has made local plans that meet the requirements, so it can be trusted
to make its
decisions.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_24_PT_1/65747F81F066A771FAE18DC8F710CCACDB20F316" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="24 October 2013">Thursday

Tony Baldry:</Member></B> The Minister knows that, for historic
reasons, almost half of all local planning authorities in England do
not have an up-to-date local plan. They 
<?notus-xml column=192?>started to get that going with the introduction of the national planning
policy framework. I suggest that most of them are doing so with all due
speed, as is evidenced by my local authority, which adopted its local
plan on Monday. My concern, and the concern of many Members, is that
the Minister and the Government are not giving any protection or taking
any notice whatever of emerging local plans. As a consequence, they are
not giving any consideration to the efforts by local communities and
local councillors to ensure that they have robust local
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000075"><B><Member ContinuationText="Nick Boles" PimsId="5590" UID="13102454000146" xid="1085" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000146">Nick
Boles:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that. I understand what
he is saying. It is difficult and painful, especially in an area of
high demand, to produce that local plan. Many local authorities have
been making excellent progress, which is why the number of local plans
has risen from about 30% when the national planning policy framework
was passed to more than 50% now, and many more will be adopted over the
next few months. The difficulty is that there are cases—I am
afraid that some of those cases are represented in the
Chamber—in which the local plan, despite what the local
authority might have said, does not meet the requirements of the
Localism Act 2011 and of the national planning policy framework, and
does not provide a five-year land supply.</hs_Para>

cases, that is because local authorities put too many eggs in one
basket. They identify one big site to which they attach a lot of hope
value, and which might make a fantastic development, but which, in
reality, has no immediate prospect of being developed. It therefore
cannot count as a site in a local plan. Sometimes, they make estimates
that a site will build out over two years, when it clearly will not do
so in less than five. It is not surprising, therefore, that the
inspector sometimes says, “I’m sorry, but that is not a
robust plan, because the sites you have identified will not deliver
what you say they will deliver in the established time frame.”
Then he asks the local authority to go back and revise the plan. That
is happening in many local authorities represented in this Chamber, and
is causing some of the
frustration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102454000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000077"><B><Member ContinuationText="Harriett Baldwin" PimsId="5572" UID="13102454000147" xid="1194" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/halltext/131024h0002.htm#13102454000147">Harriett

particular case—one would hope that that would happen in about
nine months. If it could be six, that would be great. It certainly
should not be more than 12. In some cases—I am not suggesting
that it is happening in West Worcestershire—the inspector,
rather than saying that the plan will not meet the requirements, says
that the authority needs to do a bit more work on it and then suspends
the plan. That can be a good thing, because we do not want to see a lot
of good work thrown away because one part of the plan has not been
properly completed. That is sometimes what causes it to be delayed
beyond the time frame. If everything is in order, it should be done

Boles:</Member></B> There are many questions that I have not yet
answered, and there are only so many minutes left. I want to come on to
the point of prematurity that some Members have raised. There is a
difficult balance to be struck. One extreme would be to say that it
does not matter how early stage a local plan is; as soon as an
authority has started on a local plan, the draft policies, which have
not yet been examined, consulted on or tested, should determine
decisions. That is at one end. I understand that no one is suggesting
that it should be at that extreme end. At the other end, we say that no
weight should be accorded to a plan until it has absolutely finished
the process.</hs_Para>

that we have put out in the draft guidance is that once a local plan
has been submitted for examination—not completed or
passed—it should carry significant weight if there are no
substantial unresolved objections to parts of it. A neighbourhood plan
has to pass a referendum, which is a big moment at which it might fail,
and it starts to acquire weight when it has been presented to the local
authority for what is called the local authority publicity period. I
accept that both those stages are towards the end of the process.
However, the difficulty if we try to move them earlier in the process
is that—I promise you—developers will go to court, they
will seek the judge’s interpretation and they will say,
“This plan hasn’t even been consulted on. It
hasn’t even been tested by examination. How can it be the basis
for a decision, when in every other way this proposed development meets
all of the policies in the national planning policy framework?”
That is the argument that they will make, and indeed it is the argument
they are making in cases right now.</hs_Para>

is not simply in the gift of Ministers to move that decision point
through guidance; we cannot do that. We have to put it at a point that
the courts will find reasonable as an interpretation of the
requirements for a plan to be sound and robust. We have set it where we
have because we think that is the most reasonable position, but I am
very happy to invite colleagues here in Westminster Hall today to meet
my officials to discuss whether there is a way of finding another time
frame that would stand up in court. However, I would simply share with
them the view that the bar that would stand up in court is a very high
one, and I have concluded that the position that we have outlined in
the guidance is the one that will not only stand up in court but
provide some protection for those plans that have reached an advanced
stage of development.</hs_Para>

is nothing in the Localism Act 2011, in the NPPF or in any aspect of

specifically, development must be sustainable, and sustainable in many
ways. Infrastructure is one of the ways in which it needs to be
sustainable. However—the however is quite important—to
say that the current infrastructure is insufficient to support a level
of development that otherwise would be “sustainable” in
other senses of the word is not quite enough, because someone has to be
able to say that it is incapable of being made sufficient to support
that level of development; in other words, that the local authority
either could not bring the financial resources together or could not
physically and geographically make arrangements to make that
development sustainable. Just to say, “The road is too narrow;
we can’t do anything more there,” is not quite enough. To
say, “The road is too narrow and can never be widened, because
it’s between two ancient forests that have the highest
status,” could be sufficient and that tends to be where the

he would imagine, by some of the answers he has given, particularly
about this so-called “housing crisis”. He said that we
are an ageing population. Of course we will age during the next 20
years, but we aged during the past 20 years as well, so I am not
convinced that the projections should jump up so much because of that
single factor. Of course, families go their own separate ways and
people unfortunately have divorced, but again I am not aware that the
projection will go up in the way that it would need to in order to
justify the additional housing figures that are being talked

was perhaps talking about people being unable to buy houses, and
ignoring the financial constraints. In my experience, it is not
necessarily that the houses are not there. We went through a situation
where some lenders were lending 125% of the house price, which had the
effect of inflating those house prices. Now we have the opposite, where
there is a very tight lending policy, and that is making it difficult
for people to borrow. I accept the philosophy of price elasticity, of
course—demand and supply—but there is more to it than
that, so I am a little concerned that the Government are still clinging
to the “housing crisis” phrase.</hs_Para>

July 2013, following consultation, the Secretary of State for Transport
issued safeguarding directions to local planning authorities (LPAs)
along most of the route of phase 1 of HS2, between London and the West
Midlands. Safeguarding directions protect the route of HS2 from
conflicting development. At that time we were consulting separately on
fourteen design refinements on the phase 1 route. In particular, the
Secretary of State proposed that there should be bored tunnels rather
than a surface route at both Northolt and Bromford. As the nature of
safeguarding in these areas would be very different depending on the
option chosen it was decided to delay safeguarding these areas until
the Secretary of State had reached the final decisions on the tunnel
proposals following

purpose of safeguarding is not to prevent development along the route

Department has an ongoing dialogue with industry to discuss proposals

security of fuel supply while maintaining safety. Around 230 of the
tankers are in operation in Great Britain and account for around 12% of
the fleet of vehicles delivering road 
<?notus-xml column=26?>fuel. Some of these tankers have been on the road for over seven years
and collectively they have travelled millions of miles without a
serious incident. We are not complacent about the risks and it is
important that this remedial work is carried out as soon as is
practical. This would involve tankers over six years old being taken
out of service first, with modifications on newer models to allow a
staged withdrawal of these vehicles over subsequent months. Some
haulage firms have already placed, in total, orders for about 100 new
tankers.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="219"><?date 2013-10-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_24_PT_1/593DAA12FB2FFFE23F6E78CA0071AA69E8ADD652" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 October 2013">Thursday

Ofcom measures aimed at preventing broadband, media and mobile
telephone companies from charging vulnerable customers for receiving
billing and statements through the post. However, a range of measures
exist to protect vulnerable consumers, in particular, from charges
associated with paper billing and statements. For example, across the
telecoms sector, blind or visually impaired consumers who have
requested paper bills in an accessible format such as large print and
Braille, and consumers on social tariffs such as BT Basic and in
receipt of certain means-tested benefits, are not charged for paper
bills.</hs_Para>

other cases, Ofcom rules require that suppliers should make sure that
terms relating to charges for itemised and paper billing are presented

However, the Government has no current plans to resettle Syrian

should be to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced people in
partnership with neighbouring countries and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees. The UK has now increased its pledge for the
Syrian relief effort to £500 million. This represents the UK's

were based on fieldwork carried out in autumn 2012 and were the best

winter were made jointly by NHS England, Monitor and the NHS Trust
Development Authority (NHS TDA). They were made on the basis of a
number of factors including risk to delivery of the A&amp;E
standard, challenging local circumstances and the needs of local
populations. This gave a picture of those facing the greatest compound
risk and identified the trusts thought most likely to benefit most from
additional
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102471000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/text/131024w0001.htm#13102471000164">Where
trusts, such as Hull and East Yorkshire Hospital Trust, have not been
identified to receive a share of these winter monies it is because NHS
England, Monitor and NHS TDA believe there are other organisations that
face greater risks and are most likely to benefit from the additional

receive funding will receive the constant support of NHS England, NHS
TDA and Monitor to make some of the lower-cost changes that can still

requested. Information is collected centrally on the average (median)
time to treatment for category A calls at individual ambulance trust
level. Treatment is defined as the arrival of a health professional
dispatched by the ambulance service for immediately life-threatening
calls. Category A calls are divided into Red 1, immediately life
threatening, and Red 2, serious but less immediately time critical;
however average response times are only collected at the level of
category A. It is not statistically correct to combine medians to get

all the requirements of the Convention, in the main through the Bribery

extradition, mutual legal assistance and international police,
prosecutorial and judicial co-operation. The Government intend to

Vara:</Member></B> The responsibility for judicial training, including
magistrates, lies with the Lord Chief Justice and is exercised through
the Judicial College. Magistrates are advised in court by their legal
advisers who, as professional lawyers, will keep themselves up-to-date
with legal developments. The Judicial College assists with this by
providing regular updates on any changes to the law via a
jurisdictional electronic internal newsletter. It did so in respect of
these provisions in June 2012. Additionally, the Justices' Clerks
Society, the professional body for legal advisers, circulated a
news-sheet in December 2012 dealing with the new
offences.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13102471000070" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131024/text/131024w0002.htm#13102471000070">Victims'

energy users who invest in small-scale, low-carbon electricity
generation systems for the electricity they generate and for unused
