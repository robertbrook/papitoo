from small, local provision to regional and national schemes. There are
no official figures for the number of food aid organisations or the
number of people using them in the UK. The Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs has commissioned research to assess publicly

Cunningham:</Member></B> I congratulate the Minister on his
appointment. In the past year, several new food banks have been opened
in my constituency and the neighbouring constituency of Stockton South
by excellent organisations like A Way Out and the New Life church. Some
are supported directly by the Trussell Trust, which states that the
number of people relying on food banks has gone up from 41,000 to
350,000 since this Government came to power. What does the Minister
think has caused that explosion in

those changes and nobody is quite sure. That is one of the reasons we
commissioned this report. The use of food banks has been going up for

Berger:</Member></B> I welcome the Minister to his new post, but I hope
he will have time to refer to the facts and figures of the matter.
Under this Government, the use of food banks has rocketed, and I hope
he will read carefully the report from Oxfam and Church Action on
Poverty that came out in May and shows that, this year alone, half a
million people will access emergency food aid. I think that is a
national disgrace. Does the Minister

Eustice:</Member></B> As I said, the reasons for the increase are
complicated. The hon. Lady asks about the facts and figures, so let us
look at them. The accepted way to measure household expenditure on food
is by looking at the bottom 20%. We know that in 2008, when the
previous Government were in power, the lowest 20%—the most
disadvantaged households—spent 16.8% of their income on food.
That figure is now 16.6%. If we look at the facts, spending on food as
a percentage of household income for the most disadvantaged is no more
than it was in
2007<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T09:37:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

It is difficult to underestimate what is happening. The International
Society for Human Rights, a secular organisation based in Germany,
estimates that 80% of all acts of religious discrimination in the world
today are directed at Christians. The bishop of the Coptic Church in
Egypt, based in London, has said that there is almost ethnic cleansing
to eliminate Christianity and Christians in Egypt, so this is an issue
to which we must all—the Church of England, the Foreign Office
and civil society as a whole—give the highest priority. Whether
it is people being murdered in Peshawar or churches being burnt in
Baghdad, this is a terrible issue which must be addressed
collectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000173"><Member ContinuationText="Kerry McCarthy" PimsId="4810" UID="13101061001109" xid="812" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061001109"><B>Kerry

worth recording that this one single parish church has had to spend
tens of thousands of pounds so far just to get to this position. We
have to improve the whole situation in relation to bats in churches. It
is not a joking matter. Churches are not field barns; they are places
of worship, and it cannot be right that bats can be excluded from
reopened railway tunnels and the living spaces of domestic homes, but
it is so difficult for active community buildings such as churches to
resolve such an
issue.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13101061000036" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000036">Church

link parish churches to local credit unions to offer support where any
is available. The second is to set up an archbishops taskforce to work
with the credit union movement and the local banking sector to produce
credible alternatives which offer financially responsible products and

the introduction of the Act, because although we still have some way to
go, the reduction in the incidence of metal theft has been substantial.
Although churches of course still need to use CCTV, SmartWater and so
forth, the fact that scrap metal can no longer be traded for
cash—people can no longer rip lead from roofs and sell it the
next morning for cash to a local dealer; it is now a cashless
business—is clearly already having a considerable impact on
ensuring that our heritage does not continue to be ripped

funding. If he has an opportunity to speak in today’s debate, I
am sure that it will be relevant. I will say two things. First, while
small local authorities have a valuable role in ensuring that democracy
is accessible and relevant to their populations, many such public
authorities have successfully explored ways of sharing costs and
back-office services with other authorities, and that is very useful.
Secondly, the BBC survey discovered that it is possible to secure more
and better services with less money. That point will be important in
this afternoon’s debate. It illustrates how public services have
responded to the tough times that we inherited from the Labour
Government and is a credit to those who are running local
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000236"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T10:44:37"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dave Watts" PimsId="4539" UID="13101061001146" xid="624" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061001146"><B>Mr

should not have a free-for-all in markets, because of the tendency
towards monopoly. We must have effective competition regulation to make
competition happen, and this Government have been keen to ensure that
it is in place. To be fair to the previous Government, they also did
that under competition and enterprise Acts. This country has

There have been reports that there will be no wage increase next year,

Lansley:</Member></B> My hon. Friend will be aware that pay in the NHS
is the subject of independent pay review. Therefore, to that extent,
the recommendations on future pay will wait on the results of
independent review. It is quite proper that the Government, in that
context, should provide evidence to the pay review, which has happened.
The affordability of any pay rise must have a bearing on that evidence,
bearing in mind the overall Government approach, which is for the
overall increase in pay to be of the order of 1% in the year ahead. As
I know very well, there is contractual pay progression in the NHS. When
I was Health Secretary, that was something of the order of 1.4% per
year in terms of pay. I believe it has increased recently. As he will
understand, there is an obvious relationship between the affordability
of progression pay of that kind and any headline basic pay
increase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T10:56:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000257"><Member ContinuationText="Robert Flello" PimsId="4776" UID="13101061001166" xid="891" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061001166"><B>Robert

Government time on Government Departments selling buildings that

Under-Secretary for the work she did, which has taken us into a new era
in public health. We are protecting the real value of the resources
within the NHS budget, which we are increasing in real terms, but a
larger increase is going to public health, because, as he correctly
identifies, if we can anticipate future illness and act to prevent it,
it is important that we do so—in the case of diabetes, early
diagnosis and intervention has successful outcomes. Health and

health, will look at how they can ensure that people access diagnoses

consider it worth her while to raise this issue then. We must be
careful in this context. It is important to ensure, as we have, that we
strengthen the local or community voice in the establishment of local
development frameworks and—as I have seen done very
effectively—through neighbourhood plans, to create a framework
so that those who exercise their right to bring forward development on
land they own or have acquired do so in the context of the
community’s view about the use of land in their area. Otherwise,
we might run the risk of a chilling effect on development as a
consequence of subsequent rights of appeal for the community against
planning permissions that have been
granted.</hs_Para>

with the consequences of the reduction of wealth in this country by
7.2% under the last Government, in the most serious recession we have
faced in a century. It is inconceivable that such a reduction in wealth
would not have consequences across society. Fortunately the number of
workless households is now at its lowest level, and those who are in
work are increasingly finding that their tax bills are going down.
Inevitably and rightly, there are charitable and other endeavours to
help those people who are in hardship, just as the benefit system
should. We will have further opportunities to debate how we can target

have been very clear that public services should not use premium rates
so that people can access public services without paying a premium
price to do so. If I may say so, when I was Secretary of State for
Health, the roll-out of 111 as a service could be distinguished in a
number of ways from its predecessor service NHS Direct, including being
free to those who use it. There is a wider issue about the use and
impact of premium rate services, particularly from utility companies

whether the community would be able to bid for that. It is important
that assets of community value can include sports fields and sports

facility in Cambridge, and I do not think for a minute that it is in
the same market as some of the multiplexes outside the centre of
Cambridge. The job of the Competition Commission is to identify markets
and act to restrict monopolies in those markets, but I do not think we
are talking about the same market here. The point my hon. Friend makes

that literacy rates for school leavers have shown little change in

thank the Backbench Business Committee for granting us the time for
this debate, which raises a matter that many Members of the House feel
passionate about For everyone fortunate enough to be able to read the
Order Paper without any trouble, adult literacy might not seem like a
pressing issue. It is certainly easy to take the ability to read for
granted without thinking about it from day to day, but for the millions
of functionally illiterate adults in the UK, the inability to read will
define and limit their whole lives. The loss goes far beyond missing
out on the delights of the Order Paper, with everything from bus
timetables to important medication leaflets remaining a
challenge.</hs_Para>

fluently as you have never heard them say otherwise. In reality, a

illiterate.</hs_Para>

should probably take the time to remind the House what illiteracy and
innumeracy mean, as they are not always the most helpful terms. There
is a spectrum of ability. For example, the one in six figure is not for
adults who are completely unable to read but for those who have a
reading age no greater than that expected of an 11-year-old child.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:32:38"></hs_TimeCode>According to the
most recently published Government survey, there have been welcome
gains for many of those at upper levels, but the big worry is that
those at or below entry level—that is, those with the poorest
skills—appear to have increased in number, at around 15% of the
adult population. That is a staggering 5 million adults. Those people
might be struggling on, desperately trying to hold down a job or manage
a household without the basic skills every person in the UK deserves.
That could be anyone we know, from a fellow parent at our
child’s school to a friend who seems always to forget their
glasses.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>Numeracy figures
are an even greater cause for concern, with almost 50% of the adult

to research released by the OECD this week, some 16.4% of adults living

people—score at the lowest levels of proficiency in literacy. We
must 
<?notus-xml column=318?>address that issue if we are to build a skilled economy that will drive
Britain forward in the global race. The figures get worse for those
aged 16 to 24, where we bump along at the bottom of the league tables

many social consequences of our collective failure to give people the
help they need, but, more than that, this is a crisis for individuals.

twice as likely to be unemployed as those who are competent, and more
than twice as likely to have children while still in their teens. Those
with the lowest numeracy skills are twice as likely to miss their
repayments and risk losing their home. Children who struggle with
numeracy are twice as likely to be excluded from school. Tackling that
is the first step to raising aspiration, increasing self-confidence and

Mark Williams</B> (Ceredigion) (LD):</Member> I congratulate my hon.
Friend on securing the debate. I have a background in private
education. Does she agree that the best education that we as parents
can offer our children is a partnership between what we do in school
and what we are able to do in support of our children at home? That
reveals a deep problem—the effect that illiteracy and innumeracy
have, not just on community but within families. A few years ago I was
lucky enough to run a scheme for parents to help them support their
children in numeracy. It revealed starkly the problems that my hon.

support their
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000332"><B><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Dinenage" PimsId="5684" UID="13101061001228" xid="1097" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061001228">Caroline

It is often where parents have weak literacy and numeracy skills that

is worth pointing out strongly that just because someone is illiterate
or innumerate, it does not mean they are stupid. Just think how sharp
they have to be to get through even a day without these skills. Some
people are incredibly bright but they just missed an opportunity
somewhere in their life. That is the situation for one in six adults in
the UK, and there is no quick fix to overcome
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000334">Literacy
and numeracy rates have shown little change, despite numerous
initiatives by successive Governments. Between 2001 and 2011, Labour
spent £9 billion on adult literacy programmes, with little

innumeracy are not problems that can be tackled simply by a Government
throwing money at them.</hs_Para>

improvement, and now over 80% of the adult population exceeds level 1.
However, we now need to make great strides in literacy, so there will
be a constant effort to drive up standards. Will she acknowledge the

improvement in
numeracy?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000336"><B><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Dinenage" PimsId="5684" UID="13101061001230" xid="1097" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061001230">Caroline
Dinenage:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that
intervention. Sadly, the OECD report relates only to England and

for Wales, but it is fascinating to hear those
statistics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0001.htm#13101061000337">There
is a social stigma in being unable to read or write, which prevents
individuals from seeking the help that they desperately need. Between a
third and a half of adults with poor literacy and numeracy want to
improve their skills, although less than 5% have actually been to a
class. If we are to boost literacy and numeracy rates in the United
Kingdom, we must first help learners to overcome the barriers created
by social norms, and provide the help that people need right in the
heart of our most vulnerable communities.</hs_Para>

two years, I have raised this issue at Prime Minister’s
questions. I have posed numerous oral and written questions on the
subject to the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills, the Ministry of Defence and the
Department for Education. The responses tend, almost without exception,
to direct me to the great work that is being done via formal adult
education providers, such as further education colleges. But literacy
and numeracy are not further education; they are basic education. If we
are to make them accessible to the most hard-to-reach individuals, we
must think about where, and how, we deliver them. In many cases, a
formal educational environment did not work out very well for these
people the first time around, so the prospect of going back as an adult
is, quiet literally, terrifying.</hs_Para>

of a formal education provider tackling this issue is in my Gosport
constituency. The Out There project, which is funded by Hampshire
Learning in collaboration with St Vincent college, provides courses for
those wanting to extend their basic skills. These courses are delivered
in community centres right on the doorstep of some of our most
vulnerable—and valuable—residents. It is the friendly,
informal environment, the free courses and the access to free child
care which break down many of the frequently cited barriers to adult
learning. This is what is giving individuals the confidence to go out
and transform their lives for
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:40:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
Between 2012 and 2013, the Out There project attracted 2,427
hard-to-reach learners, making it the most effective scheme of its type
in Hampshire. It has even been used as a case study of excellence in
the EU-REALM Platform against Poverty initiative. I am proud not only

the problems of illiteracy and innumeracy begin in schools. A crucial
component of raising standards of literacy and numeracy has to be
getting children to think that it matters: 25% of kids do not believe
there is a link between reading and success. This failure to value
literacy at a very young age has a profound impact on someone’s
life chances. Once someone starts down this path, the problems become
deeply embedded, and part of the experience is the problem of parents.
If a parent has weak literacy or numeracy skills, a child is less
likely to be imbued with an aspiration to learn. I agree with the
National Institute of Adult Continuing
Education—NIACE—which suggests that all schools should
develop a family learning policy and all local authorities should form
strategies for child and family
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:41:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000342" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0002.htm#13101061000342">The
percentage of children who, at 16, lack basic literacy remains
stubbornly high at around 19%. Of course, ensuring that our children
leave school with good literacy and numeracy skills is essential and it
must be a priority, but we cannot leave behind a generation of adults
who have been failed by the education systems of the past. Low skill
adults need a second chance and we must recognise that skills can be
developed outside formal education. One way of doing this is through
peer-to-peer

literacy that he witnessed while he was an inmate in Dorchester prison,
and he was inspired to help others less fortunate than himself. Under
the ethos of “each one teach one,” Andy and his
volunteers at Read and Grow use a reading tool called “Yes we

local library discovery centre. This book is the brainchild of a
brilliant author, Libby Coleman, a former head teacher in some of
England’s most challenging schools. “Yes we can
read” is a book which facilitates peer-to-peer learning. The

literacy and numeracy skills are the foundation for an adult’s

likely to be in full-time employment by the time they are 30. That
failure has a dramatic impact on business. A 2011 CBI study showed that
42% of employers were unhappy with literacy among school leavers and
44% were investing in remedial classes to improve basic skills. That is
in line with my experience. I have owned a small business for the past

closing, I reiterate that the focus must be on grass-roots learning.
Community learning is a great way to promote skills development, and I
welcome the Government’s support for that progress so far. I
firmly believe that courses aimed at improving literacy for families
and individuals who are most disadvantaged and furthest from learning
are one of the best ways to tackle the absence of fundamental skills
among our adult population. Adult literacy and numeracy problems cannot
be solved by top-down Government policy and investment; our action must
be bottom up, from the grass roots of society. If we can raise
standards in schools and embed programmes that help right in the heart
of our local communities, we can provide hope and opportunity to
millions.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/D958136D6011918A5F2523AEADD57E33CDDA86F4" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="10 October 2013">Thursday

“What is the evidence?” I have discussed adult literacy

some think they know the answer intuitively. They will immediately say,
“The reason is this”, and then give a simplistic

matter. It has dogged this country for decades under different
Governments, and we have to look harder for the solution. It is about
making people better not simply so that they can get better jobs but so
that they can fulfil their ambitions and lead better lives for
themselves. It is a quality of life thing, and that is vital.
Millions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:03:06"></hs_TimeCode> of

savings, it is shocking that one of the first and easiest targets they
choose are libraries. “Let’s close the
library”—well no; let us ensure that the libraries stay
open, encourage more people into them, and use them for adult education
classes so that people can become more literate and see the wealth of

million pupils who leave school after GCSEs are ill-equipped for life,
and as I said, about 40,000 of people in prison are illiterate, and
55,000 are innumerate. We must do more to make education in schools
more relevant to pupils so that they see why they need to read and
write. Nothing surprises me more than when I go into a pub and see
youngsters playing darts. They are able to add up what they have just
scored and deduct it from, I think, 360. I am there with chalk and a
board trying to do that, but they do it in their heads. They are so
much better at it because it is relevant to them and that is why they
are able to do it. On literacy it is the same with texting, and people
substitute certain words for letters and so on. That may be okay, but
life is not Twitter and we do not lead our lives in 140 characters. It
is much richer than that, and we must ensure that people get the full
wealth of knowledge and culture that is denied to them if they are not

have failed them because they are unable to read and write. It is not
their stigma but ours, and we—rather than those

people opportunities to be able to read and write. Lifelong

must recognise that millions of people have come in who cannot do that.

learning dates back to the 19th century, with the establishment of
colleges for working people. More recently, the union learning fund,
set up in 1998, distributed £150 million towards training and
education, which helped to recruit many union learning reps and expand
the number of people in training and education. The fund, which has
supported more than 50 unions in more than 700 workplaces, has several
key goals: to embed learning and skills so that they become a core
strategic objective of all unions; to help unions form active
partnerships with employers, which I will mention later; and to raise
demand for learning among the low skilled and other disadvantaged
groups. Colleagues have mentioned people using their peers to access
learning. When people are vulnerable and find themselves in adult life
without the ability to read and write properly, peer groups are a
crucial tool to making that first step into learning.</hs_Para>

much more than their own name, but who have tremendous other skills
that have enabled them to get through a workplace and end up at a
senior level. One of the most alarming and surprising things I learned

successful cross-party campaign—235 MPs signed up—and I

national curriculum. The key driver behind the campaign was the fact
that 91% of people who get into financial difficulties say, “If
only I had known better.” My hon. Friend the Member for Gosport
pointed out that 50% of adults struggle with even primary
maths skills, so it is no wonder that people get into financial
difficulty. The campaign focused on four strands—schools,
further education, higher education and the crucial vulnerable group,
work on which is led by my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Fiona
Bruce). That group is crucial because although we are bringing in the
changes in schools, further education and higher education, 
<?notus-xml column=331?>some people will still slip through the net. The report will be

mentioned in previous debates, I had the honour of the Minister for
Schools coming to visit after I had set out just how good the school
is. To put it in context, it is in one of the top 5% most deprived
areas and it was formerly a failing school. To give credit to the
previous Government, money was provided to rebuild the school, which
was the beginning of the process, but the fundamental changes came from
the school reforms, which gave its inspirational head teacher the
ability to make a real difference. Some 70% of the children are on the
pupil premium and that money has been used—now that the class
sizes have been almost halved to 17—to work with the community
to get volunteers to come in and read one on one with the children.
That has been done by providing a free Sunday roast on Wednesdays to
the Penhill luncheon club, who work one on one with the children on

coming through have simply been abandoned in front of the

own time in schools how teachers who make the extra effort can make a

difference. She feels that school holidays undo the great work that is
done. Some of the children are upset that they will not be able to come
into school. Before teachers start thinking that I am advocating a
52-week term, I should say that the idea is to open up the schools in
holidays for summer camps on sport, literacy or numeracy, or for the
Scouts and other volunteer organisations to use. PFI schools often have
expensive charges for outside groups, which removes the opportunity for
constructive work. The head teacher thinks that some of the children
benefit from the almost family environment in the school, and should
perhaps be held back beyond primary school age—perhaps up to 14
or when they are in a position to go to the local FE college 
<?notus-xml column=332?>or start an apprenticeship—because they need that sort of
environment, perhaps because of their family background. As they go off
to the traditional secondary schools, the influences and temptations
away from the right path prove too great without family

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000418" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0002.htm#13101061000418">The

Perhaps job centres could utilise the libraries to provide

should try to have one-to-one teaching for adults with numeracy
problems. I have done some coaching and have found that it is often the
simple things that fox people. Not everybody is gifted at mathematics,
but sometimes people are puzzled because they do not realise that a
division sum can be expressed in different ways: by having one number
over another, or by having two dots on either side of a line. People
get confused, but it all means the same thing. How many times does 10
go into 100? Whichever way we write it down, it will always be 10. We
have to have one-to-one tuition. During my coaching and teaching I have
seen the light that appears in people’s eyes when they
understand something that has mystified them all their lives.</hs_Para>

comfortable with mathematics, can handle numbers and feel at ease with
them. A deeply worrying statistic from 40 or 50 years ago was that 60%
of primary school teachers had failed O-level maths. I am not saying
that O-level maths is the acme of success, but it showed that they were
uncomfortable with the subject. If teachers are uncomfortable with the

the feedback I hear frequently from businesses in my constituency. As a
member of the Select Committee on Business, Innovation and Skills, this
is a matter of concern. It is raised with me by businesses in Worcester
on a regular basis. On a national level, the CBI is concerned about the
literacy and numeracy of school leavers, and how that feeds through to
the challenge of Britain competing in the 21st century. We also face
the specific challenge of improving the English language skills of
first generation immigrants and ensuring that women, particularly those
at risk of isolation, are able to access adult education—an
important point we should not overlook.</hs_Para>

the Member for Gosport said, 5 million are at the same level

a primary school leaver. After over a decade in which education
spending rose sharply, that is a shocking statistic. The latest CBI
employment trends survey showed that 35% of employers were
dissatisfied with levels of literacy among school leavers—higher
than it was in 2003, at the beginning of that period of

anyone who is complacent about this issue. In particular, the worrying
figures for 16 to 24-year-olds suggest that the problem has been
getting worse in this country rather than better over the last decade
and that the UK is falling further behind its competitors. For England

Our Select Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the

research shows that adults with at least basic numeracy—level 1
or above—earn on average 26% more than adults with skills below
that level. When controlling for education level, social class and type
of school attended, there is still a 10% earnings premium for basic
numeracy. These figures show how, if people were earning more money, we
could reduce the deficit, help to raise tax revenue and help pay for
public services. The research also showed that over two thirds of
prisoners at the start of their custodial sentences had numeracy levels
below level

to the National Research and Development Centre for Adult Literacy and
Numeracy, adults with poor numeracy are two and a half times more
likely to report having a long-standing illness or disability and are
roughly twice as likely to report several symptoms of depression.
Adults with poor numeracy are more than twice as likely to have had
their first child while still in their teens. Dealing with low levels
of numeracy can therefore help to reduce welfare dependency, crime and
mental health costs.</hs_Para>

we do about it? We need to empower employers to work more closely with
target groups in the adult population, as well as with school-age

schools, but at every level of education and skills. Campaigns such as
the Reading Champions campaign, bringing sports personalities into
primary schools to talk about the value of reading, do great work on

“Yes, we can find new 40 and 50-year-olds to replace the people

crystal-ball-gazing skills, as I was just about to come on to the issue
of libraries. The local library in my constituency, provided by
Staffordshire county council, offers free books to help adult readers.
A local volunteer organisation, DIGIT—the dyslexia information
group in Tamworth—provides support to those adult learners by
providing them with reading buddies. DIGIT does even more by providing
help for Tamworth’s young children falling within the scope of
the dyslexia spectrum to improve their reading, writing and arithmetic
skills. Academisation has also helped. My local head teachers now have
more scope to decide what to teach, how to teach it and whom to employ.
GCSE results at the Rawlett School, for instance, have improved

supported by money so that young adults can be helped to learn, but I
must ask the Minister to consider two other issues. The first is the
teaching and knowledge of dyslexia in our schools, which is at best
uneven. Tamworth has some good dyslexia teaching schools, such as
Wilnecote high school, but others are less good. That is because there
are not enough teachers with the right skills, and not enough head
teachers who know enough about the scope of the dyslexia spectrum to
deal with young people who suffer from the condition. We also need to
ensure that there is as much dyslexia teaching in primary schools as in
secondary schools, so that dyslexia can be recognised and dealt with as

second issue, which I hope the Minister will consider during his
discussions with his colleagues in the Department for Education, is the
need for more

students in my constituency go to secondary school at the age of 11
with a reading age of seven. They are doomed to failure at GCSE the
moment they walk through the door of their secondary school. We need
secondary schools to know as early as possible which kids face
challenges so that they can help the primary schools to help those
children, and the children can go to secondary school with a higher
reading age and improve their chances of obtaining better GCSEs. We
must ensure that children do not walk into a cliff face at the age of

warnings issued by the OECD in its report make it clear that Britain
faces a considerable challenge in aiming to raise the literacy and
numeracy levels of, in particular, the most deprived people in the
country. The report is unequivocal in identifying the need for England
and Northern Ireland to address social inequalities, especially among
the young, as a key reason for the fact that we are falling behind in
that regard. It emphasises that although we in Britain make good use of
our highly skilled talent pool, there is a stronger association between
higher levels of literacy and good social outcomes here than in most
other

also suggested giving jobcentres a mandatory role in dealing with
illiteracy and innumeracy. I believe that, if jobcentres are to play
such a role, they will need to change their relationship with the
people whom they see as customers. Many people come to see me after
visiting jobcentres, and it is clear to me that the current
relationship is not likely to enable them to feel positive about
jobcentres’ sending them in the direction of literacy. However,
the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education has said that
there is a potential role for jobcentres, and I think that the idea
could be considered if the culture within them were to

have been cuts to local authorities and Sure Start centres, and further

would our approach be? First, we need to identify those groups in
society who are most vulnerable to being illiterate or innumerate and
put in place a series of guarantees to ensure they are not simply
thrown into the job market and expected to sink or swim without the
skills they need in numeracy and literacy. Any step that would see more
children educated by unqualified teachers would be retrograde. We need
to see steps to support people who are at greatest risk applying to all
school leavers. Those who are not achieving the standards of literacy
and numeracy that they should by the age of 16 will be given a chance
to catch up with a guarantee of further study in those areas until the
age of 18.</hs_Para>

also need to support Army leavers more. About 39% of Army recruits join
with literacy and numeracy skills at level 1. The Army’s

improving the literacy and numeracy of many of those people, and one

answers to the problems are not purely pedagogical, however; they are

me set out some of the actions the Government have taken. The focus on
numeracy and literacy in primary schools is crucial, but, as well as
time spent on these issues, we have to make sure we have high
expectations of children at a young age. We need to make sure that
grammar is taught properly and that mental arithmetic
matters—that we do not rely only on calculators, and instead the
understanding of basic maths is inculcated deep in pupils. Then we must
reform GCSEs and have a more stretching curriculum for teenagers, and
then, for those who do not get the crucial C or above in GCSE, make
sure they continue to learn English and maths. The introduction of the
tech level and the tech bac will drive that among those who do not go
down the A-level route. As announced this week, we are introducing a
core maths paper that is somewhere between a GCSE and an A-level so
that for the 40% who get a C at GCSE but do not continue to study maths
there is a qualification that is not as big as a full A-level but
allows them to continue studying
maths.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000495" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0002.htm#13101061000495"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kelvin Hopkins" PimsId="1016" UID="13101061001272" xid="286" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0002.htm#13101061001272">Kelvin

using—that is what the evidence shows—and move away from
what he called an “utterly misguided” philosophy of

schools we will not solve this generational problem. I hope that the
OECD report will have helped to build a stronger consensus behind our
school reforms, which remain opposed—inexplicably—by some
people who otherwise describe themselves as
“progressive”. As the shadow Minister said, the OECD
showed the problem of the link between deprivation and education being
greater in England and Northern Ireland than elsewhere, but the problem
is that poor education entrenches deprivation. Education needs to be
the foundation of social mobility, and in the UK that is not happening
nearly enough now. The hon. Gentleman did not mention the collapse that
the OECD study showed in the results among 16 to 24-year-olds, where
this country has gone from the top to very near the bottom. We are
driving forward on making sure that we reform our schools system, bring
in free schools, give head teachers powers under academisation and
improve the standards of teachers. However, we have opposition, and I
do not understand why people who otherwise call themselves
“progressive” say that they are opposed to these things.
I wonder whether we are going to get a change of heart from the
Opposition Front-Bench team on so-called “unqualified

the forgotten 50% and they were indeed forgotten. That is no longer the
case. Educational reform has to be about making sure that everybody can
reach their potential. I was going to say that an intellectual error
has been made in the past and we have to put it right. I am talking
about the argument that because someone has a low level of education or
they are undertaking a low-level qualification—level 1 or level
2—what they are doing does not have to be rigorous, stretching
and high-quality. At every level of education we have to make sure that
we get as much improvement in pupils as possible. We are trying to put

low-quality and sloppiness.</hs_Para>

someone has dyslexia does not mean they cannot have decent English and
maths. It makes those things harder to teach and we need different
techniques for teaching them, but we should not have low expectations
just because people find something difficult. He also mentioned the
importance of the context for learning and, as the Minister responsible
for apprenticeships, I often find that people who failed in English and
maths in a formal setting thrive in them as

important point to come out of the debate is that this is not a party
political issue. It is much more important than that. We must work on
the problem for generations to get it right. There is no quick fix and
it will not be solved overnight. We must have policies that will get it
right far into the future. It cannot be solved quickly and it is not an
issue that should be tackled by just BIS and the Department for
Education, as the situation is cross-departmental. For example, the
Department for Work and Pensions has plans to get as many people as
possible off welfare and into work. That is a noble aim but one that
must take account of the vast levels of illiteracy that prevent people
from getting and holding down a job. We must put the

tackle illiteracy and innumeracy.</hs_Para>

of 2012, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
recognised the penalty for rural authorities—that is, that the
formula for allocating funds to local authorities disadvantaged those
in rural areas—and improved the sparsity weighting for the
formula for the local government financial settlement for 2013-14. That
was the good news for rural authorities, and the Government must be
commended for recognising that historical inequality and for seeking to
improve the funding formula for local authorities to take into account
the higher costs associated with delivering public services in rural

the Government seemed to have a little wobble. The damping model that
the Department chose to minimise the swing in funding for councils
wiped out all the gains from the improved formula for rural
authorities, and as a result their total funding actually fell faster
than that of urban local authorities. I am not seeking to steal money
from urban authorities; I seek a fair deal for rural authorities as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0002.htm#13101061000532">The
Department allocated a further £8.5 million to the most sparsely
populated authorities after the rural fair share campaign. MPs pressed
the Department and made our case. However, that is still only a one-off
grant for 2013-14, and it distributes the £8.5 million to 95
local authorities in amounts ranging from £649,000 to
£856,000. Is the Department considering ensuring that we have a
little bit more money than that next year? In fact, I would like
another £30 million at least. I probably cannot horse-trade too
much, but it must be recognised that the rural authorities are not
getting their fare share. Although welcome, the one-off grant makes no
material change to funding disparities within the overall £22
billion settlement. That is a very big sum of
money.</hs_Para>

West Somerset, which my hon. Friend knows well, is the most sparsely
populated part of England, with the smallest council. As he knows from
his days in Somerset county council, we have never been able to catch
up with the deficit, simply because the rurality of the area means that
there is no way, with our ageing population—it is the same in
Axminster—to do that. Perhaps we should look at the future size
of these councils to see whether they could provide a joint service to

Even though it is a sort of coalition, because one is Liberal

at officer level. Even though adjacent councils may be of different
political persuasions, they can share resources. If it is possible to

Stocksbridge, which straddles two metropolitan local authorities,
Barnsley council and Sheffield city council. It is an incredibly

much of the north-eastern aspect of the peak district national

functions other than children’s and adults’ services, and

It is to the credit of the Government that they have recognised that
divide. As my hon. Friend said, the challenge is in getting the
Government to “get on with it”. It is clearly
inappropriate that urban authorities have 50% more to spend than more
rural authorities. There is a big job to

challenge is to ensure that, in rural areas, we get the job done. As
has been mentioned, there are problems with the way in which the
Government define rural—whether we should use the shire
definition, the rural-80 or the rural-50—and with how
damping was applied. There are questions to be asked about whether that
was done in an appropriate way. As has also been mentioned, there has
been some top-slicing of the new homes bonus, so some money that would
have gone to local government is going to local enterprise
partnerships. Those are all issues that the Government could sensibly
look

Government have said that rural areas must do the right thing. They
have said that what they proposed for rural areas was fair because
there was still fat to be cut. In Devon, council tax has been frozen
for the past three years, 3,000 staff have been lost, spending has been
cut by £100 million and 98% of council tax is being collected.
Fraud accounts for only 0.003% of the budget, which is a very small
amount in the grand scheme of things. Our reserves are also relatively
modest.

us walk the walk and not just talk the talk. Let us be honest that
there was something not quite right in the funding formula and look at
it again. Let us also be honest about the top-slicing of the new homes
bonus. My concern is that LEPs have not been running for very long.
Although I am sure that some of them are more than capable of sensibly
using a top-sliced chunk for infrastructure projects, there are others
that are very early in their development. Many councils have been
planning infrastructure projects for a long time, but now find that the
funding is being moved to another body. That should give us pause for
thought<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:17:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000620" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000620">The
two areas of dissatisfaction in the ICM survey were potholes and care
for older people. Devon has £700 million-worth of work on the
roads that has not been done, never mind the problems that are caused
by the winter. If we are to reform local government spending, we must
look at the Bellwin formula. The way in which it was calculated meant
that it gave Devon only half of what it needed to get the roads back in
order. As my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:17:28"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton mentioned, that was
partly because we have 8,000 miles of road to deal

are another key issue. As my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and
Honiton said, bus passes costs us £10 million and we then have
£5 million left to spend on public buses. He said that many
people rely on public buses to get to work. Indeed, whether it is to
get to work or for any other purpose, more people use the buses than
the trains, so it is short-sighted to fail to provide funding for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000622">Of
course, we cannot forget education and schools. Devon is almost,
although not quite, at the bottom of the league table. It is 145th out
of the 151 local education authorities. It receives £395 per
pupil below the average. Given the additional costs because of
transportation and the size of the schools, that is untenable. The
Government have recognised that, but we need them to do
something<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:18:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000623" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000623">The
Government have promised to put some money from the NHS into local
government. However, there is a lack of clarity about how that will
happen and how much money it will be. Without that information, it is
difficult for local government to sort out its
finances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000624" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000624">Finally,
although it is absolutely right that communities should work with local
authorities to do what they can together, leaving it to the local
community to pick up all the work that cannot be afforded is not
realistic. A number of community transport groups have come to 
<?notus-xml column=362?>me because demand well outstrips supply. They are struggling to cope
with the number of people who are trying to get to hospital
appointments, many of whom have wheelchairs. There are simply not
enough drivers or vehicles. We applaud those in the voluntary sector
for the fantastic job that they do, but, as the squeeze
comes, we need to recognise that they cannot completely fill
the gap and that they need help and support in trying to do
so.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:19:24"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13101061000970" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000970">2.19

Ministers somehow feel that the services that people receive from
libraries, sports centres, environmental health, parks and street
cleaning are less important than anything else? I suggest that they are
not. Do they believe that local government is somehow less efficient
and therefore has more ability to make cuts without damaging services?
I do not think there is any evidence of that—indeed, the
evidence has shown the opposite over the years. Local government has
generally been more efficient and more effective in bringing about
efficiency savings. Or, in the phrase that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:21:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) used, is it
simply about the Government contracting out the responsibility for
making the cuts to somebody else, namely local councils? I suspect that
that is probably the reality. Why have local services been picked out
for larger cuts than anything

second point is about the distribution of the cuts. We can argue about
that, and everyone will have their own view, but it seems slightly
unreasonable that Sheffield, despite all the demand for local services
from local people and all its problems and challenges, should have
received cuts of about £200 per head of population, whereas down
in Windsor the cuts are £40 per head of population—five
times less. I know the Minister will say that it is because cities such
as Sheffield get more in grant, so they have more grant to cut.
However, why have they had more grant than elsewhere in the past? We
can argue about fine amounts, but essentially it is because they have
more problems, more challenges and less resources than areas such as
Windsor. That is true of many northern cities, which are the ones that
we expect to be the powerhouse for growth and for rebalancing our
economy. They are receiving the largest percentage
cuts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:22:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000629" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000629">We
can add in the cuts to the fire service, and there are also the new

comments have been repeated by Conservative authority leaders such as

because no libraries will remain open. That is a serious situation in
Sheffield, which is mirrored in other parts of the country. It is not
about one authority somehow failing, it is a potential failure of local
government as a whole, not through its own fault but simply because it

me move the debate forward in a slightly different way. We are where we
are, but where will local government go in the future? A bit ironically
I suppose, the one good point that might come out of this is that local
government is now less reliant on Government grants for funding.
Government grants have been cut by nearly half, so a bigger proportion
of money comes from taxes that local authorities raise. If we are to
look forward to vibrant local government, a less centralised state, and
localities being less dependent on central Government 
<?notus-xml column=365?>for funding, and if we are to be localist and look at the balance of
power and the things the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee
is doing, we must not simply go back to where we were and recreate the
grant systems. We must also consider how we can make local government
more financially independent in the
future.</hs_Para>

always be an element of redistribution—we have great
inequalities in our country so redistribution will always be
necessary—and there will always be a case for some element of
Government grant. One problem is that, at present, that element all
comes from business rates. Because of that, some sensible ideas the
Government have had about localising business rates have become
convoluted and complicated because those rates both reward development
and try to redistribute from those areas with greater resources to
those with the greatest need. In principle, however, that is to be
welcomed, although in future we will still need an element of
Government grant for
redistribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000643" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000643">Why
not take up the LGA’s proposals, give the money to local
authorities and allow them to distribute it? That would stop councils
simply complaining to the Government that they do not have enough money
while others have too much. That happens in Denmark, which has a
grown-up system. They sit down and negotiate between local and central
Government about the amount of money to be passed over, and local
government then makes the redistribution between different local
authorities. That has worked for a long time. I would have thought most
Ministers would welcome with open arms the idea that they would not be
responsible for every allocation to every council in the country. Let
us see how radical Ministers can be. The LGA was brave in putting
forward that proposal, so let us at least look for radical
solutions.</hs_Para>

local government spending. The idea that central Government should have
to call a referendum if they want to change income tax or VAT is
clearly nonsense and no Government would ever allow it. Local councils

the services it provides cost more and are more important to local

percentage of income tax for local councils. That is a step forward,
but why can councils not vary things? If councils want to vary services
and local people want better services and to pay for them, why can
there not be differences in different parts of the country? That is a
challenge and a debate to be had. There is no one solution at this

There are not only cuts on local government, but on local services that

situation and that we have a challenge for the future. How do we
address it and make local government more financially independent? How
can we give local government greater means to raise resources for their

always going to take a big hit from cuts to public expenditure—I
am on message now. Local government has shown great skill in reducing
budgets. Committed local authorities under all parties have protected
front-line services. I should like to put on the record that that is a
credit to many councillors throughout the country, particularly given
that satisfaction in council services has increased. Many hon. Members

for specific services; it is a difficult situation. Currently, the
county council is consulting on the future of bus services, and it is
possible that some of my constituents in villages will not be able to
get to work or to access health or leisure services. The price of
school transport has rocketed in price for the over-16s. That is
compounded by the rising age of participation. I shall keeping making
the point on the Floor of the House that relatively poor hard-working
families in the rural areas in my constituency are faced with bills of
£450 or £750 per year for their 17-year-old to get to
school. Members on both sides of the House have been remiss in allowing
the age of participation to increase without putting finance in place

Government frequently use the figure of a 2.3% cut for 2015-16. They
give the impression of a certain level of cuts, but it is all much more
complex. We are told that local government will get extra money for
health and social care, but then we discover that that is not all new

business-like fashion if they do not have that certainty? One of the
biggest threats has to be the escalating cost of adult social services.
I represent an area with an ageing population, and local government has
to be given enough support to bring health and social care budgets
together to innovate. Local government has not been backwards in

councils—a county council and two unitaries, for

points regarding my region, the north-east, and my local authority,
Durham county council. It is 
<?notus-xml column=371?>tempting to characterise the debate in terms of urban against rural and
north against south—I can see
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:54:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Tiverton and Honiton is smiling. We are not allowed to refer to
pictographs, but when we analyse the figures produced by the Local
Government Association and the Association of North East Councils, it
is clear that it is not simply a rural versus urban issue—and
particularly not a north-south issue—because many of the
affected regions are in the south-west. Many inner city London boroughs
are badly affected, as are our great northern cities.</hs_Para>

shall make some general points to begin with and then get down to some
of the specifics about my own area. The Minister on the Front Bench is
responsible for the fire authorities so I thought it would be
remiss—given that we met representatives of our fire authorities
this week and found that they were extremely concerned about the
implications of the settlement—not to mention that issue. The
scale of cuts that the fire authorities are going to have to make will
amount to taking out an entire brigade from the north-east region. I am
not suggesting that that would happen, but taking out the whole of the
County Durham and Darlington brigade would be the consequence if the
cuts fell on a single brigade in our region. The level of cuts is
unprecedented. My fear is that austerity is failing, not just our
region but Britain. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the evidence
of cuts to local government funding.</hs_Para>

local authority has made written representations to the Minister, and I
hope he will consider very seriously the points it has made. Indeed,
after the comprehensive spending review of 2010, local authorities
faced significant spending cuts in the emergency budget. We knew, and
warned at the time, that these would inevitably impact on services,
jobs and growth. Various figures have been quoted, but for the record,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:56:42"></hs_TimeCode> local
authority, which is Durham county council, has needed to make savings
of £123 million during the course of this Parliament. That has
resulted in nearly 2,000 job losses—approximately 20% of the
work force—and it has certainly hit front-line services and
vital support for the local
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000680">Along
with all local authorities, mine understood that local government would
be expected to contribute to reducing the national deficit, but as a
number of Members have pointed out, the consequences of this level of
cuts have been astounding. Local authorities certainly did not expect
to be targeted for disproportionate cuts when the Government were
unable to address the problems that had to be faced in any other
way.</hs_Para>

am worried because the Government have missed a number of economic
targets that they set for themselves and because the very slow recovery
we have seen—probably the slowest for over 100 years—is
being exacerbated by the scale of the cuts in local authorities,
particularly when it comes to discretionary expenditure. There is no
money left for economic development. I see some Government Members
shaking their heads, but I am afraid that that is certainly the case
for Durham county council. As a large unitary council, it had a
successful track record of working in partnership with both public and
private sector organisations to deliver major infrastructure projects
and to make a contribution towards jobs and growth. Its capacity to do
so, however, has been completely taken away by the scale of the

hard-pressed local authorities, particularly in regions such as mine.

because of demographic changes, an ageing population, and the fact that

Stewart</B> (Penrith and The Border) (Con):</Member> It is very easy to
feel that the debate about rural and urban funding is somehow trivial
or unjustified. Those of us on the Government Benches who have been
fighting on this topic for nearly two years often face scepticism from
officials and slight scepticism from Ministers. The implication is
almost that what rural areas are asking for—0.25% of funding to
be shifted year by year—is either based on faulty statistics or
will have no impact. I wish to challenge
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:07:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

feels from London as though the request we are making is very small. It
feels like the tiny tip of a lever, but when the lever is 350 miles
long and the fulcrum is right here in Westminster, that 0.25% makes an
enormous difference, because rural areas are in an especially fragile
position—more fragile than those in almost any other county in
the world. This was, of course, the first country to industrialise, and
the first country to develop a truly urban population. In the mid-18th
century, a sixth of the entire population of Britain lived in London.
As a result, this is not France; we do not have vigorous, rich rural
communities and local democracies and huge local populations. We do not
have, as they do in France, 10% of the total population working on the
land. Instead, we have been struggling for a very long
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:08:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000697" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000697">We
must add to that the current perfect storm, which is to do with not
simply the Minister’s portfolio, but what is happening to rural
areas in health, where we are being significantly underfunded, in
education, where we are being significantly underfunded, and in terms
of our demography: we tend to have an older population, and we tend to
face greater struggles with fuel poverty, with unaffordable housing,
and with problems that other colleagues have raised to do with bus
services. The Minister is dealing with a situation that is extremely
dangerous, therefore.</hs_Para>

0.25% matters because rural areas are precious. They are precious and
they are fragile, and they have never been so fragile. They are being
depopulated; we can walk across the English and Scottish borders and
see houses abandoned and see parishes that in 1850 had 2,500 people but
now have just 300. In those valleys are the very last traces of our
history and of our landscape, which we in this House do not wish to
turn into a wilderness.</hs_Para>

like a very grand statement to come down to 0.25%. It sounds as if it
is perhaps being a little petty to say that rural areas should not make
this small demand just because they pay more in council tax, receive
fewer services and earn less. But it is a demand that is very
consistent with the traditions of my party, of this House and of this
country. What I believe we all share in this House is the sense that
rural areas should not be seen as marginal victims. Just because we
mostly live in cities and just because 97% of the population tend to
live in more densely packed areas than almost anywhere else in Europe,
we should not patronise those
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:10:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000700" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000700">Eden
district council is the most sparsely populated council area,
containing the most sparsely populated parish in the whole of England.
When we see the kinds of things that Gordon Nicolson, the wonderful

that they what they are struggling with is not simply being victims,
but the possibility of being the future of this
country—somewhere we can be proud of, somewhere the Minister and
everyone in this Chamber can visit, and somewhere where 9 million
tourists a year come to see living Britain. They wish to see not a
wilderness but a rich community of houses, schools and living people.

in the north-east. I also wish to support the words of

the Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris) in the case he made on

of deprivation that are put in more danger because of the
cuts.</hs_Para>

Association of North East Councils has found that, nationally, the
north-east has suffered the biggest cuts and has experienced much
higher reductions in spending power than the national average. That has
been said before. In North Tyneside the spending power per household is
the worst in Tyne and Wear, as at £2,048 per household it is
£468 per household less than our best-funded north-east
neighbour, Newcastle. Moreover, North Tyneside council will have to
make efficiency savings of £20 million for next year’s
budget, which equates to 11% of the net revenue budget. At the same
time, it will see a £12 million reduction in the revenue support
grant—a reduction of just under 20% for the year. Announcements
made in the Government’s spending review mean a 10% cut to core
funding for councils in 2015-16, but the Government are now proposing a
further £l billion cut for the north-east. For my borough that
means a 40% cut in revenue support grant over two
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000703" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000703">The
Government’s intention to protect council tax freeze grant might
be good news in affluent areas that have higher council tax bases, but
it is not in North Tyneside, especially as council tax support grant
funding is being considerably reduced. I am not attempting to paint
North Tyneside council as a whingeing council; on the contrary, the
council has implemented savings over the first two years of the
spending review totalling £32 million. By the end of the year,
the efficiency savings will be £45 million. Furthermore, the
council has implemented many of the saving ideas included in the
Department for Communities and Local Government’s “50
ways to save” publication. Further cuts can only mean cuts to
services, which will hit the most vulnerable in our communities hardest
and will cost jobs in our region that we can ill afford to
lose.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000704" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000704"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>Like
so many councils across the country, North Tyneside is seeing the rise
in demand for adult social care that has been mentioned by so many
Members today. The fact that young people with complex needs and many
older people are living longer is to be celebrated, but that means that
councils have to spend more of their budgets on adult social care. The
DCLG must work with other departments and organisations to find a
sustainable solution for funding adult social care so that increased
life expectancy equates with a good quality of life for all those with
social care needs.</hs_Para>

new homes bonus has benefited North Tyneside, providing specific
funding to help the council’s economic growth priorities.
However, the way in which the scheme is operated has resulted in the
redistribution of funding from more deprived to less deprived areas of
the country. 
<?notus-xml column=376?>The effect of that redistribution is that North Tyneside will lose about
£1.6 million next year. Furthermore, the council is concerned
about the recent technical consultation on the new homes bonus and
regional growth fund to transfer 35% of the new homes bonus to our
North East local enterprise partnership in two years’ time.
Surely the Minister will agree that that goes against a core rationale
of the new homes bonus scheme, which is to incentivise local
authorities to encourage the building of new homes and to tackle
long-term empty housing. That prompts a question for the Minister:
where is the localism in making less money available for councils so
that they have to make decisions on their spending
priorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:17:03"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000706" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000706">North

am as committed as anyone on these Benches to the Government’s
drive to get the deficit under control. It was inevitable that local
government would play its part in the deep cuts that had to be made to
public services in the course of the past three years. Local government
has played its part; big cuts have been made. In my county, Devon, we
have seen cuts to bus services, children’s services, libraries,
social care and many others. As the polls to which other participants
in the debate have referred are showing, we have just about got away
with it. The public are still with it and are still expressing
confidence in the services that local government is providing, but,
looking at the funding settlement for this year and what that will mean
for councils in the next three, I sincerely doubt that another poll
taken in three years’ time would show anything like that
satisfaction level. I believe that councils up and down the country,
regardless of their political leadership and of whether they are in
rural or urban areas, have set about driving down their costs, have
done everything they plausibly can to secure better value for money and
have struggled, as far as they are able, to do so without damaging
front-line services. But we have got way past the point where they can
be expected to do so again without its having a profound impact on
front-line services. I simply do not think that the Government will get
away with this if they go through with it on the scale they are
currently planning.</hs_Para>

a Government together, the Department for Communities and Local

meant to damp the effect of a change that was being made. It was, in a
sense, a transitional relief so that the adjustment would be made in
stages, but the difference that damping has made in these circumstances
is that it has completely reversed the effect of what the Department

Kawczynski</B> (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</Member> I remember
clearly in 2004 when Carolyn Downs, the then chief executive of
Shropshire council, presided 
<?notus-xml column=379?>over an increase in council tax of 16.6% when the council was controlled
by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Carolyn Downs has gone on to be
chief executive of the Local Government Association, but when she was
the chief executive of the council her salary was £160,000. I
make that point at the outset because I feel strongly that we need to
get back to a system in local government in which there is close
scrutiny and checks of individuals’ salaries. A salary of
£160,000 for chief executives was unacceptable. There was a
massive number of managers involved, and I would go so far as to say
that there was a certain amount of empire building. We have
to get back to ensuring that the money spent goes directly on providing

is doing well, I hope we will not go back, having the comfort of
economic prosperity, to the bad old days as was the case under Labour,
when money was poured into local councils without some form of

Kawczynski:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, because he
leads me succinctly to my next point, which has already been made. An
ICM survey has revealed today that six out of 10 people think services
are better now than they were in 2008. That raises the following
question: how is it possible that the majority of people in the United
Kingdom think that services are better today than they were five years
ago, when massive amounts of funding were going to local government? I
will outline the situation in Shropshire later in my speech, but we
must not forget that important survey finding.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish) on
securing the debate and agree with him wholeheartedly. I would like the
Minister to take away our message that more needs to be given to rural
authorities. The cost of providing services is massively greater in
rural areas than it is in cities and inner-city areas. I have made that
point repeatedly to the Prime Minister, because it is something I am
passionate about.</hs_Para>

Shrewsbury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:30:03"></hs_TimeCode>

<?notus-xml column=380?>£4,200 per child each year for their schooling. Other parts of
the country get £7,000, £8,000 or £9,000. Of
course we understand that children in very deprived inner-city areas
might need a little more than we get in Shrewsbury, but not double. It
is completely unacceptable in this day and age to have such
discrimination against children in one part of the country. They are
receiving less than half what children in other parts get. There are
schools in my constituency that have nothing like the facilities that
schools in inner-city areas have. There are leaking roofs, problems
with insulation and all sorts of other problems, which I think is
absolutely disgraceful. I will not stop until the funding mechanism is

pay tribute to the leader of Shropshire council, Mr Keith
Barrow, who has managed to grapple with the massive cuts imposed by
central Government. He has had to cut £87 million from spending,
and there are more cuts to come, but he has done so by cutting waste,
reducing the number of senior managers and reducing salaries. All that
has been done while council tax has been frozen, which is an
extraordinary accomplishment. I receive very few letters from
constituents complaining about local council services. Actually, as

point I want to make most strongly to the Minister is one that the
leader of my council has told me. It is now starting to sell assets in
order to reduce the massive debts to the Government that were racked up
under Labour. A large percentage of the council’s expenditure
goes on servicing those debts. At the moment, if a council wishes to
reduce some of its debts to the Government, it will be financially
penalised by the Treasury, because it invokes certain clauses on early
repayment, just as paying off a mortgage early incurs certain financial
penalties. I think that is wrong. The Minister has to look at the issue
and negotiate with the Treasury. If a local council is attempting to
reduce its historic debt and pay it off slightly earlier by making
difficult decisions on sales and streamlining various services, it is
very important that the Minister does everything possible to encourage
the council by helping it negotiate with the Treasury on those early
payments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:35:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000730" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000730">I

incomes are found in rural areas, so there is a social justice argument
along with the data that we rightly focus on. That social justice
argument is hard to rebut, and Ministers in successive Governments have
hidden behind an obfuscation of numbers and data. As he said, the
simple truth is that people on lower incomes are paying a higher level

their income on transport. They are suffering too, and local government
funding starts from a much lower base. Is the population more or less
resilient? In my constituency, the population in rural areas—in
marked contrast to the hon. Gentleman’s constituency—is
much older. There are vulnerable elderly people on low incomes who are
remote and without access, and who have a council with massively less

the deep freeze for seven years, to 2020. The Prime Minister and the
Deputy Prime Minister have been led to believe that there is no
fundamental injustice, which they repeat, but the Government recognise
the injustice. Perhaps it was just the magic dust, but they saw the
injustice last summer. By Christmas—poof!—it had gone.
Remarkable! They damped it away, which is inexcusable and cannot be
defended.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000762" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000762">That
is why I am delighted to see this brave and excellent Minister in the
Chamber, a man who effortlessly survives a reshuffle, who grows in
power and influence, and who works for an even wiser and more sagacious
man than he—the Secretary of State. It is those two honest
fighters for truth and decency in whom I put my trust, almost entirely.
There is no need to nudge such fine people, but if a nudge were
required, I can tell my hon. Friend that, as far as my office knows,
115 constituencies have parliamentary petitions calling for
a 20% reduction in the rural penalty from 50% to 40%. Many colleagues
have spoken today, but many who are not in the Chamber are strongly
onside with that campaign. No nudges whatever are necessary to
Ministers such as this one. However, I say to him that the patience,
even of the most trusting and loyal people such as the hon. Members to
whom I am referring, can know a limit. We do not want it tested. We
want the Government to do what they said they would do last summer,
when the magic dust reigned. Can we return to
that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000763" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000763">The
Minister smiles, and I trust in him to do the right thing. We cannot
allow the freezing of that injustice and inequity until 2020. Having a
slow unwinding of a situation that the Government have recognised is
wrong will not undermine the move to business rates retention. I
therefore hope he does not repeat the suggestion that it
will.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000764" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000764">I
have one final request of the Minister before the end of my
speech—I have not quite had my 10 minutes. Will he produce an
analysis of the rural/urban funding split? The Rural Services Network,
which we work with, has worked hard attending meeting after meeting.
The Minister has been in meetings in which he has asked civil servants
to produce such an analysis, but for some unknown reason it never quite
comes out. I would like to ensure that, whatever the Government decide,
we are at least technically on the same page and can agree on where the
money goes, as in the percentage that goes here or there and the amount
per head, using whatever classification he wants, as long as it is on a
rural/urban split. So far, we have heard the Government say, “We
don’t split it like that. We don’t recognise your
figures.” We ask, “Are you saying that our numbers are
not true?”, and the Government say, “We don’t
split it like that,” which is nonsense. We now have such
experienced and first-class 
<?notus-xml column=386?>Ministers in the Department that we can expect action. I want to ensure
that we are on the same page technically, then we can have the
political argument on the right thing to do. All hon. Members,
whichever constituency we represent, whether it is Kingston upon Hull
East or Beverley and Holderness, want a just settlement that ensures we
have decent local services and that supports people, not least those
with
least.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13101061000979" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000979">3.59

councils—especially in rural areas—have made the

two such eloquent speeches by my hon. Friends the Members for Beverley

topic of how we fund our local authorities may sometimes seem
arcane—a matter for policy wonks or political

it is in fact intensely practical, with real and direct implications
for services in all our constituencies. I am grateful to my hon. Friend
the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart) for making such a
strong case in principle for this small amount of funding that could
make a very big difference in rural areas.</hs_Para>

this subject, we touch on the very machinery of the country and the
whole range of services on which our electorates depend. I do not make
the case for endlessly increasing local government funding, as perhaps
some Opposition Members have tended to do. My constituents are clear in
the belief that local government needs to bear its share of the burden
in reducing the deficit and restoring our economic credibility, which
was so damaged under the previous Labour Government.</hs_Para>

council and Worcestershire county council have managed to do in the
past few years. In recent surveys my association has been conducting
across Worcester, the vast majority of my constituents believe that
local councils can do more to reduce waste and improve efficiency. Even
a substantial majority of those who assign themselves as Labour voters
agree with that statement.</hs_Para>

I will make the case for is fairer funding. Each area should get its
fair share and should have the best opportunity to deliver services
fairly. I am not making the case for each area to pay the same council
tax, but it 
<?notus-xml column=388?>is noticeable that in general, as many colleagues have pointed out, the
very rural authorities that are getting funded less are on average
paying higher levels of local taxation than urban authorities. Surely
it should be a matter for local decision makers to decide what should
happen with regard to council tax and to bear in mind the wishes of the
people who elect them.</hs_Para>

county council has done an admirable job of keeping council tax frozen
for a number of years, but it is noticeable that our council tax payers
bear a higher share of the burden of the cost of vital public services
in our part of the world than they do in urban authorities elsewhere in
the west midlands. Worcester city council has made millions of pounds
of savings in the past couple of years, but it fears that further cuts
will be necessary in the years ahead as a result of not getting a fair
share of funding.</hs_Para>

want both our councils to have the best chance of keeping council tax
frozen for as long as possible, but to do so we need to ensure that we
are getting our fair share of funding from Westminster. I want councils
such as Worcestershire to be able to continue to have no library or
Sure Start centre closures because they have managed things properly,
and to receive fair funding from the Government. As others have already
set out, as it currently stands the local government funding formula is
not fair and it disadvantages rural areas. The huge gap—on
average approximately 50% between rural areas and purely urban
areas—is shocking and unjustifiable.</hs_Para>

a member for a city seat it may seem strange that I should be concerned
about this, but Worcester, like many county towns, suffers a double
penalty by being an urban district in a rural county authority. The
vast majority of our funding is granted on the basis of the county
unit, with little or no account taken of the many specific urban
problems we face. Within Worcester, there are super output areas in the
top percentile of deprived wards in the country, yet the overall
funding that our local authority receives reflects what might be
expected for a green and leafy prosperous county. As other Members have
pointed out, rural does not necessarily equate to
prosperous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000781" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000781">Worse,
and as other colleagues have pointed out, there are additional
pressures on all rural authorities, with extra travel costs for almost
every part of local government, smaller units covering wider areas and
particular challenges for social care. Where these costs are shared
among all areas of a county, it is not surprising that the
urban core can sometimes miss out. I therefore strongly support a
better deal for rural areas and believe it is in the interests of all
my urban constituents for the challenges of rural sparsity to be better
recognised in the funding system. The local government funding formula
is by no means unique in disadvantaging rural areas, as other formulae
in education and health do the same. Unfortunately, these effects do
not exist in isolation for each individual department, but have a
cumulative
impact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:08:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000782" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000782">In
other debates, I have regularly made the case for fundamental reforms
to the school funding formula, and I am grateful for the support of
both Liberal Democrat and Conservative colleagues. I shall continue to
make the case, but as the majority of funding for schools still passes
through local authorities, this is not irrelevant to today’s
debate. In fact, the growth of academies and the diminution of local
authorities’ role 
<?notus-xml column=389?>in allocating school funding has created additional pressures as lower
funded local education authorities struggle to achieve the same
economies of scale as they once did.</hs_Para>

has been withdrawn at a national average rate while these areas tend to
receive much lower than national average funding. In
Worcestershire’s case, this means that we are giving £116
back to the Treasury for every academy pupil, even though the actual
funding that it would have spent in maintained schools was £101.

shares staff and resources with the broader children’s services

additional pressure on other aspects of children’s services,

by a number of Opposition Members. As a long-standing supporter of the
f40 campaign and having met Ministers many times to discuss it, I know

Walker:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right; it is exactly
the problem I was about to move on to. As I mentioned earlier, health
funding is another area of major concern. Rural areas tend to have
higher numbers 
<?notus-xml column=390?>of elderly people and a higher life expectancy than the major cities. As
so much health funding is allocated according to life expectancy and
targeted towards areas of high perceived deprivation, it means that the
population of big cities is generally much better funded than that of
rural areas.</hs_Para>

an ageing population and more people living with long-term conditions
that require regular treatment, this creates enormous pressure on all
rural health services, particularly on community health services.
Worcestershire as a whole gets lower health funding per person than do
more urban areas of the west midlands, but it has an older population,
placing greater demands on our health service. Shifting the balance of
health funding from mortality to morbidity would help to address this,
as would having a more activity-based formula for community health. In
health as in education, however, the local structures do not exist in
isolation from local government. There are close links between the
health and the social care systems, while pressures on both the acute
and the community health systems create additional pressure on local
authority-run social care. The fact that we are underfunded for health
means that our underfunding for social care is a more serious challenge

else could we do to improve the situation? Our councils, whether they
be city councils such as Worcester or great county councils, did not
grow up as organs of central government. As my noble Friend Lord
Heseltine pointed out in his “No stone unturned” review,
the great cities of England were not grown through the diktat of
Westminster or the spending of Whitehall. The councils that directed
their growth and success raised their own funds locally, invested
locally and built up services according to the demands of their own
local constituents. We need to rebuild some of that independence and
self-reliance. Although there was a great deal with which I disagreed

is not something that can be done overnight, and there would be
significant risks in allowing some areas to raise taxes much higher
than others, but it 
<?notus-xml column=391?>should be a stated aim of the Government to provide councils with more
of their own resources over time and to give them greater opportunities
to raise local funding. Such has been the growth in responsibilities of
local government over the decades that there is little chance of it
ever returning to being entirely self-funded, but there is a role for
Westminster in re-allocating funding from the richest areas of the
country to the more needy, including rural areas. Increasing the
proportion of local government funding that is in the control of
councils will give them greater flexibility to manage the challenges
they face and to deliver localism.</hs_Para>

of it. That is largely because councils are funded at different levels.
Councils such as Cambridge city council in my constituency, which has
received low funding for many
years—<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:14:52"></hs_TimeCode>the
hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart) will be well aware
of that, having been a member of the council himself—have
trimmed off fat again and again. What is left is muscle and bone, and
we are already cutting into that. Cambridge city council faces a
cash-terms cut of 
<?notus-xml column=392?>almost 15% in 2015-16. That figure is much higher than the national
average, and it obviously hits residents’ expectations: 15% is a
huge amount of muscle and bone to cut off.</hs_Para>

have a particular problem in Cambridge, because the Department for

That would normally appear to be a good thing, because we normally

population of Cambridge completely and utterly wrong. For the last
census, in 2011, it estimated that the population had shrunk by 5,000
in the last 10 years. We said that it had grown by 15,000, and the
census proved that the council was correct: Cambridge had, in fact,
grown. Anyone who has been there lately will have seen all the new
houses and flats being built. It is absurd to suggest that Cambridge is

won that argument, and the census figures have been used. However, the
ONS is still forecasting that Cambridge will “continue to

many more houses, and we expect to see even more than 15,000.</hs_Para>

number of people for which the Department is funding us and the number
of people who are actually there. That does not take account of the
fact that new growth costs much more money, and the money never arrives
ahead of time. Moreover, it comes on top of the existing financial
constraint caused by the Department’s settlement. The
Communities Secretary is apparently over-eager to cut his own

are also constraints governing what local government can raise
separately. Council tax is an awfully designed tax. It is deeply

lowest payers, and the tax shot up massively under the last Government.
I do not like council tax. It was encouraging to hear comments in

is a further problem with the change in the target rent system.
Cambridge took on a debt from the Treasury of many millions of pounds
on the basis that it would be able to repay it from the rent. Cambridge
had been debt-free and was having to pay a huge amount of, in effect,
tax from council tenants in Cambridge to support council housing in the
rest of the country. We made a deal with the Government based on the
idea that we would move average rents towards the target rents. The
Government are now threatening to freeze that process. When a house is
empty we have been raising the rent to the target level, as it should
be assuming the energy standards are all right. If that is frozen,
different rents will be charged for identical neighbouring council
houses when new people move into them. That simply does not make sense
on a practical level and it would also cost the council and the housing
account £22 million over the period of the business plan. More
importantly, it breaks the faith that existed. This debt was taken on
with an understanding of what the rules would be. If the Government are
going to change those rules, it is very hard for us to keep our side of
the
understanding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000814" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000814">Education
is a key local authority responsibility. Cambridgeshire county council

Cambridgeshire is right at the bottom of the funding tables for

average—that is £250,000 out of the budget of the typical
two-form-entry primary school. That is not acceptable and it lets down
our pupils. I do not know what pupils in Cambridgeshire have done to
deserve it. That underfunding has gone on for three decades; it has
been a long-term problem. State schools in Cambridgeshire have a much
tougher job than those anywhere else. They do a great job given that
background, but the lack of spare resources makes it far harder and we
are now seeing greater problems, with people from more disadvantaged
backgrounds struggling to keep up. The pupil premium helps and free

let me touch on health care, because Cambridgeshire is also grossly
underfunded in that area. Most clinical commissioning groups get more
than £1,000 per head to spend on health care, but Cambridgeshire
and Peterborough is one of the few areas that gets less than
£1,000 per head. Is that a fair allocation? Has it just been
worked out that we do not have people who need health care? Helpfully,
the Government did publish the outcome of their fair shares formula for
health allocation, which takes into account 
<?notus-xml column=395?>factors such as population, age, deprivation and much more. They
published the figures, which showed that the amount that Cambridgeshire
and Peterborough should be getting will be £46.5 million more
than the current figure. We do not want to be right at the
top—we would not even be at the average—but give us that
£46.5 million and we could start to improve health care in an
area where the health economy is really struggling. Today is world

costs of looked-after children and social care, which are rising. The
demands on local authorities are going up while income is coming down
significantly—so much so that, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:33:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield South East said, the LGA’s Conservative
leader, the highly respected Sir Merrick Cockell, has called the cuts
“unsustainable”. The Tory leader of Kent county council
states that his county cannot cope with further reductions and is
“running on 
<?notus-xml column=397?>empty”. As

know that local government is the most efficient part of the public
sector—the Prime Minister has said so—but they decided to
reward councils for that efficiency by cutting more from them than from
any other part of the public sector. The Institute for Fiscal Studies
is clear that the total cuts to local government spending will outpace
those in the public sector as a whole. The situation will get worse
rather than better. The LGA’s excellent report, “Future
funding outlook for councils”, incorporates the additional 10%
cut in this year’s spending review, which came on top of the 33%
cut that councils face over this Parliament.</hs_Para>

Minister will tell us that the cut amounts to 2.6%, but councils do not
recognise that figure. It does not stand up to scrutiny. The LGA
estimates that there will be a £15 billion black hole in
finances by 2020, but the Secretary of State has called the cuts to
councils “modest”. No wonder the Conservative council
leaders of Essex, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire, Lincolnshire,
Leicestershire, Kent, East Sussex and West Sussex wrote to the Prime
Minister to complain about the language that is being used by
Communities and Local Government Ministers, because the cuts that
councils face are not modest; they are
massive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000830" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0003.htm#13101061000830">The
National Audit Office warned that cuts are having a direct impact on
front-line services. It warns that 12% of councils are at
risk of being unable to balance their books in the future, with
potentially disastrous consequences. The recent Public Accounts
Committee report on the financial sustainability of local authorities
found that there had not been a proper analysis of the impact of the
cuts. The Committee highlighted the unfairness of the cuts to different
areas of the country, and it raised serious concerns about some
councils simply not being viable, such as Tory-led West
Somerset.</hs_Para>

impact falls on both statutory and non-statutory services. Too often,
it is assumed that statutory services will be safe because they are a
legal requirement, but the truth is that councils already, throughout
the country and increasingly, are restricting eligibility criteria, so
older people in my constituency and those of my hon. Friends who have
spoken today are losing their care. Children are losing their transport
to school. The brunt of the cuts will fall on the non-statutory

cultural and leisure services, street lighting and libraries.</hs_Para>

understand that it is not an issue of rural or urban, or Conservative

coming, as the forecasts show, and which the Chancellor has identified
in the spending review, and making prudent decisions on how to spread
the money available over a number of years in order to try to do their

local council that, before my time, had seen council tax increases of
18% and 16%—they were regularly in the double figures—and
in a country where council tax doubled under the Labour Government, I
believe that hard-working people think that council tax should be kept
low and that councils should be looking at how they spend their money,
not just building up 
<?notus-xml column=402?>reserves and then pleading poverty. If they believe that they are short
of money, they should use the reserves they have to invest for income

the Government, because an area such as my county of Norfolk, which
would usually be classed as rural, has within it urban areas such as

slightly different calculation. I would be happy to go through the

want to be clear that behind all our thinking is that it is vital for
councils to continue to play their part in tackling the budget deficit
we inherited from the previous Government, making sensible savings and
delivering value for money for the taxpayer, as many good councils are
doing. We are providing direct financial incentives for councils to
promote growth and jobs in their area. This year’s local
government finance settlement set out how authorities can now directly
retain £11 billion-worth of business rates and keep the growth
from them instead of returning them to the
Treasury.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000877" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000877">More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, and perhaps more relevantly to this debate and the points
made by hon. Members from all parties, in the current settlement we
accepted, based on the available evidence, that rural areas are
comparatively underfunded. We have therefore ensured that there is
proper recognition of the additional costs of delivering services in
rural areas. We adjusted the relative needs formula to reflect those
costs. That was one of only three formula changes in the
settlement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000878" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000878">Members<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:54:46"></hs_TimeCode>
have noted the changes, but I will reiterate them. We have increased
the weight of super-sparse areas in the formula; doubled the sparsity
weight for older people’s social care and district-level
environmental protection and cultural services; reinstated the sparsity
adjustment for the county level; and introduced a sparsity adjustment
for fire and rescue. As a result, funding per head has been reduced by
less in predominantly rural authorities than in predominantly urban
authorities within all classes. There was a 4% reduction in the gap 
<?notus-xml column=404?>between 2012-13 and 2013-14. I know that some Members have an issue with

Walley</B> (Stoke-on-Trent North) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for the
opportunity to debate disabled access to Kidsgrove railway station. It
is no disrespect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, if I say that I
had rather hoped that Mr Speaker might have been in the Chair, because
he visited Kidsgrove recently and attended the Kidsgrove youth
parliament. I am sure he would have remembered that our young people
gave great weight and priority to public transport. Today’s
debate is dedicated to them and to those who have set out just how
unacceptable it is that, despite the Disability Discrimination Act 1995
and the subsequent Equality Act 2010, services at Kidsgrove railway
station are still not compliant with that disability legislation. The
debate is intended to put that
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:01:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000894" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000894">I
am pleased to see the Minister in his place, and I hope he is as
committed to integrated transport as his predecessor was. I wish him
well in his new role. I hope that by the time he responds, I will have
convinced him that when he decides which railway stations across the
country are to benefit from the welcome £100 million next phase
of the Access for All fund, Kidsgrove railway station should be on the
list of successful
bids<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:01:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000895" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000895">I
will give a little of the background to the debate. When Kidsgrove
moved—it did not actually move, but it moved in terms of
boundary changes—back into the parliamentary constituency of
Stoke-on-Trent North at the last general election, I looked at the
issues that needed my support. I quickly identified the importance of
making Kidsgrove railway station accessible to all my constituents. I
brought together the county council, the borough council, Kidsgrove
town council, the train operating companies and Network Rail to see
what we could do. At that meeting, I was really disappointed to find
that no one appeared previously to have thought about how to include
Kidsgrove station in the bids for Access for All funding that were
launched back in 2006.</hs_Para>

stations had got their bids in and received brand-new disabled
facilities. I was particularly impressed by the wonderful architectural
design at Denmark Hill station, which had new ramps and had been
refurbished. I believe that Long Eaton, in my own region, received
£1.6 million to install two new lifts, providing step-free
access to both platforms. Sadly, Kidsgrove station did not feature. No
bid was made, and as I was told in replies to my letters to the
previous Minister, and in meetings that I had with him, the money
allocated for station improvements for those with disabilities was all
spent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:03:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000897" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000897">I
then set about arranging further follow-up meetings, with the intention
of being ready as soon as the next tranche of funding was announced. It
was duly announced that bids were being invited for the 2015 to 2019
period and should be received by 15 November 2013, with a ministerial
announcement expected in April 2014. I therefore believe that the
debate is timely so that we can leave no stone unturned in securing
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:03:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000898" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000898">I
say to the Minister that sometimes it is when one does things for the

needed in Kidsgrove? It is a town where, in 1777, probably the largest
civil engineering project ever carried out in Britain up to that time
was completed—the construction of the Harecastle tunnel for the
Trent and Mersey canal, which was the combined vision and achievement
of James Brindley and Josiah Wedgwood. Subsequently, the railways
linked up with the development of the area’s industries. In such
a town, one can imagine the frustration that today our otherwise
well-kept and much-loved railway station lacks access to three out of
four
platforms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000900" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000900">I
called into the station as recently as last Friday, and I was struck by
the staff and volunteers who are working so hard to make the station
one of which we can all be proud. Volunteers tend the gardens and the
public spaces with great care. They keep it spotlessly clean, freshly
painted and well lit—Councillor Elsie Bates is doing a wonderful
job. The station has a functioning train information display, ticket
machines and notice boards—all the things we would expect. It
has a spacious well-laid out car park with bike racks and integrated
transport, and there is scope to extend that and adjacent land into a
public transport hub—something much championed by local
councillors and Jon Honeysett MBE, whom I thank for his work on
integrated transport. The station also has efficient and friendly
staff, and I saw all those things when I visited last Friday.</hs_Para>

was rewarded when it deservedly won the best small station award at the
community rail awards in 2011. Outside its entrance there are two
disabled car parking spaces, clearly marked in yellow paint. If someone
is disabled, however, or simply young or old, or if they experience
difficulty going up and down the flights of stairs that link the four
platforms, perhaps with buggies or heavy luggage,
they simply would not be able to get access to three out of the four
platforms. That is why it is so important that the Minister responds to
this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000902" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000902">Services
from platforms 2, 3 and 4, to Manchester, Derby,
London—including for getting to Parliament—and Crewe,
cannot be accessed. To get to Manchester, for example, someone must
catch a train to Stoke, change, and board another train to Manchester
that goes through Kidsgrove. That leads to the absurd situation whereby
anyone who is disabled ends up half an hour later exactly where they
started.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000903" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000903">It
is not only about direct travel to those destinations, but about onward
travel, including to the north Wales coast—a particularly
popular holiday destination for people from the Potteries—the
south coast, Scotland, regional airports, and even to towns and cities
with clubs in the premier league and the first division, which are
increasingly popular destinations for local football supporters. A
further point concerns direct and connecting services to Crewe and
south Cheshire, and I thank Jenny Baker of Friends of Sandbach Station,

Bruce</B> (Congleton) (Con):</Member> I thank the hon. Lady for
initiating this debate. Her constituency neighbours mine, and news of
her effective campaign has reached the Friends of Sandbach Station, who
confirmed to me how much it highlights that this is not an isolated
problem. I support—of course—her campaign for Kidsgrove
station, but may I say that Sandbach station is in a similar situation?
It has flat access to one platform, 
<?notus-xml column=408?>and footbridge access only to three. Therefore, if someone is disabled,
they can travel only to Crewe. We have one advantage over Kidsgrove,
however, because we have nine disabled parking spaces, not two. Will
the Minister also consider Access for All funding for
Sandbach?</hs_Para>

Walley:</Member></B> The hon. Lady’s intervention is helpful
because she makes the point to the Minister that the campaign is
supported by Members on both sides of the House. The criteria state
that it is important that the investment, when it comes, should not be
concentrated in London and the south-east. I hope it comes first to
Kidsgrove, and secondly to Sandbach and other connecting stations along
the
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000906" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000906">On
the criteria, let us look at the disability and age demographics.
Staffordshire county council’s profile of adult disability in
the county from February 2012 shows that there are a total of 4,540
claimants on incapacity benefit and severe disablement allowance in
Newcastle-under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>-Lyme.
Newcastle has the highest number of service users in residential care
and supported accommodation in Staffordshire. That and the proportion
of the 16-and-over population claiming disability living
allowance—6,720 is well above the national average—gives
a good indication of the demographic profile, which is an added reason
to prioritise Kidsgrove station in the forthcoming bidding
round.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000907" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000907">No
bid will be signed off without meeting the station footfall criteria. I
have mentioned the history of the railways. Jobs in the heavy
industries that gave us the local railway have declined, but they have
been superseded by jobs in other areas. That has resulted in Kidsgrove
becoming a key commuter station to Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent and,
as we have just heard, Crewe, Sandbach and elsewhere. Accordingly,
footfall at Kidsgrove railway station has gone through the roof, from
just 32,192 in 2005-06 to 158,478 in 2011-12. Furthermore, passenger
numbers are expected to grow at 21% per year in the coming years.
Moreover, there is every indication that that trend will continue.
Staffordshire county council has agreed in principle to allow the
former Kidsgrove goods yard, which it owns, to be used for extra car
parking at the station, increasing the number of places from 55 to
200—a 400% increase in spaces for a car park that tends to
operate at
capacity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000908" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000908">Closer
integration of rail and bus services is proposed. Currently, the
nearest bus stops are at least 250 yards from the station, and their
location is not obvious to rail users. Re-routing the four local bus
services to within sight of the station forecourt will greatly benefit
the station. I am hopeful that that will happen. Getting the direct
service to Manchester airport reinstated would drastically increase
footfall at Kidsgrove and could be the subject of another debate in the
House. All in all, I believe that the demographics of Kidsgrove match
the
criteria.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000909" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000909">On
local support, which has to be shown if the bid is to go ahead, I can
tell the House that the proposal is fully supported by Staffordshire
county council, Newcastle borough council, Kidsgrove town council, the
local enterprise partnership, East Midlands Trains and London Midland
Trains. East Midlands Trains confirmed to my office this morning that
Kidsgrove station is its top priority in the next tranche of funding.
Virgin, which does not go from the station, has indicated that ramped
access would have indirect benefits for its services.</hs_Para>

this. It

top of that, a significant number of local people support the bid. I
thank the mayor of Kidsgrove, Kyle Robinson, and his fellow councillors
for helping with the petition, which I am sure will get even more
signatures as awareness of the campaign grows. I also refer the

have one final point to bring to the Minister’s attention. When
I set out on this campaign, I was led to believe that it was down to
the train operating company to make the bid for departmental funding.
Many meetings and phone calls later, I seem to have gone around in a
circle, because I am now told that the remit rests with Network Rail.
The local delivery group and county council also have a role, and the
Minister has the final say when the submissions have been made. The
whole system is at the very least opaque. It leaves me feeling that
those stations that sit within a defined passenger transport executive
area stand the best chance of a successful
bid.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101061000914" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/debtext/131010-0004.htm#13101061000914">Kidsgrove
must not be penalised because the station is a junction on the edge of
the Staffordshire-Cheshire local authority borders, under the
jurisdiction of no passenger transport executive and a long way down
the line from the headquarters of its train operating company, East
Midland Trains. It is also unclear from the guidance issued how
complete the business case, costings and designs have to be at the time
of the actual submission, and who actually has responsibility for
submitting the bid. I do not mind whether it is submitted by East
Midland Trains, Staffordshire county council, as the highway authority,
or Network Rail. They have all indicated support for the bid. What I do
mind is that no one understands the process so the bid is not made on
time.</hs_Para>

delivery groups have an enormous say in how the bids are made. I would
like to hear what communication the Minister has had with those groups
and what more can be done to make sure that when the decision is

come from, but I am happy to sit down with the Minister to discover

tonight in the House and, like my predecessor, I am committed to
ensuring accessibility. In recent years, expectations about

stations were chosen to ensure a fair geographical spread across the
country. We took into account the views of train operators and the
proximity to facilities such as hospitals, schools for disabled
children and military rehabilitation centres—factors that the

the hon. Lady, and both Network Rail and East Midlands Trains are

for All is clearly an important part of the funding, but it is also
important to remember that improved access could be achieved by using
relatively small amounts of funding, combined with some innovative
thinking by the industry. That would be particularly important if
Kidsgrove’s application were to prove unsuccessful, when the
hon. Lady might like to consider some of the alternatives I am about to
mention. There is an annual small schemes fund of around £7
million a year. It is allocated between the train operating companies
and is based on the number of stations they manage and how busy those
stations are. Since 2006, more than £100 million of investment,
including contributions from the train operators and local authorities,
has seen projects delivered at almost 1,100 of the country’s
2,500 stations. A variety of projects have been supported under the
small schemes, including better provision of accessible toilets,
customer information services, blue badge parking spaces and features
such as induction loops at ticket

background to this debate goes back to an Environmental Audit Committee
debate in 2004, when we called on the then Government to restate their
commitment to tackling wildlife crime and criticised their refusal to
accept it as an issue deserving of committed policing resources. Our
2004 report made a real difference. It led to the setting up of the
wildlife crime unit. When the Committee decided in the current
Parliament to return to the issue, it was natural for us to stick to
broadly the same remit as the previous Committee report. We wanted to
concentrate on areas where we hoped our unanimous recommendations could
make a
difference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000012">In
a relatively short time, wildlife crime has gone right to the top of
the national and international agenda. I believe that it was right for
the coalition agreement to refer to wildlife crime and the importance
of tackling smuggling and the illegal trade in wildlife through the new
border police force. Events have moved so rapidly that we now have a
far greater understanding of how 
<?notus-xml column=130?>global wildlife crime and illegal wildlife trafficking are growing

our current report began its life with a call for evidence in January
2012. In response, we received 57 separate written submissions from
organisations and individuals, a relatively large number of submissions
for a Select Committee, which reflects the importance that the public
attach to the issue. We followed up the written submissions with seven
oral evidence sessions, which, as might be expected, included
Government agencies, Government and non-governmental organisations. We
finally published our report in September 2012 and got the Government
response in March 2013, so it all seems quite a long time
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000014">It
is worth putting on record that we are disappointed by how long it took
the Government to respond to our report’s recommendations; I see
all my fellow Committee members nodding their heads. I suspect that one
reason—the new Minister might help us on this—may have
been some delay by the Home Office in getting back to what the
Government were doing. I hope that in future, our recommendations will
have speedier responses. After we got our response, it was some time

does not matter that it has taken so long to have this debate, as there
have been many significant developments in the short space of time
since we reported. One is that the links between wildlife crime and
serious organised crime are now being widely recognised around the
world. It is clear that the poaching of endangered species has rocketed
since 2007. The illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be the fifth
most lucrative illicit transnational activity worldwide, worth up to
£10 billion a year. We are told that increasingly, it is the
preserve of organised crime gangs: international criminal networks with
links to terrorism, drugs and rebel militia. It is a huge

the UK supported the proposal for a UN special envoy on wildlife crime.
During that meeting, the President of Gabon commented that illicit
wildlife crime is, exactly as she said, not just an environmental

Environmental Investigation Agency, Humane Society International UK,
the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds, Whale and Dolphin Conservation, the Royal Society
for the Protection of Animals and WWF UK. They are all saying exactly
what my hon. Friend said: what we do on the world stage must be matched
by what we do here. That is important.</hs_Para>

organisations have been very vocal and robust in their work, and
supportive of the UK Government’s leadership bid to tackle the
illegal wildlife trade by hosting a high-level meeting on 12 and 13
February 2014. An action plan will be developed, which will work
alongside the Duke of Cambridge’s United for Wildlife
foundation. There has been a huge amount of action since we produced
our report, which leads me to say that our debate today is perfect
timing. I hope the new Minister will lead by showing best practice at
home, and the best way he can do that is by revisiting each and every
recommendation in our report. That way, he will have total integrity,
based on a sound track record at home, at the high-level meeting that
the Government are organising. He has everything to gain from reviewing
the work in detail, because, with the new wave of activity, some of the
Government responses in March are out of date. There would be nothing
wrong with the Government saying, “We have revisited it and
we’re thinking about things differently.” I hope he will
be able to do that cross-cutting and revisit our
recommendations.</hs_Para>

recommendation relates to the national wildlife crime unit. All the
evidence told us that it is strategic and co-ordinates wildlife crime
enforcement. No one had a bad word to say about it; it was universally
praised, which is unusual in a Select Committee inquiry. It obviously
has good relationships with UK police forces, Interpol and
international enforcement agencies. It has a lot of expertise and is
doing a good job in respect of the trade in endangered species, illegal
taxidermy and auction sales, bat and badger-related offences, marine
species, reptile smuggling, wild bird netting and egg collecting. I
cannot get my head around the fact that the sums involved in the unit
are very small. DEFRA and the Home Office each contributed
£144,000 in 2011-12, £136,000 in 2012-13—the
amount is going down—and £136,000 in 2013-14. Those are
very small amounts of money, which are making a huge
difference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000022">Given
the range and effectiveness of the NWCU’s work, the Committee
concluded that it is excellent value for money and punches above its
weight, but how can such an agency be run on an ad hoc, year-on-year
basis? It cannot plan future expansion, it cannot keep good 
<?notus-xml column=132?>staff, and every year it spends all its time making the case to DEFRA
and the Home Office for the funding to be agreed in the comprehensive
spending review, because the money is not in the baseline budget. Why
not? It should be. The Committee recommended that the Government
reinforce success by implementing long-term funding arrangements for
the NWCU. The previous Minister did well to get a one-year extension,
but we need permanent
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000023">Another
issue of a little concern relates to the then newly appointed
Association of Chief Police Officers lead on wildlife crime, Chief
Constable Stuart Hyde. He gave evidence to the Committee, and we were
looking forward to seeing how his ideas on wildlife crime enforcement
would pan out in practice. He was suspended from duty in September 2012
following allegations of misconduct, unrelated to the wildlife crime
brief, I hasten to add. How has the work that he was to do been taken
up and carried on in his
absence?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000024">Staying
with enforcement issues, we identified the need for reviews of Crown
Prosecution Service wildlife crime prosecutions and the penalties for
wildlife crime, the introduction of sentencing guidelines for the
judiciary and training for magistrates. Most of those featured in our
2004 report. Despite the Government saying in their response to the
report that they would not follow those recommendation, the time for
the Government to give them a fresh look is long overdue. There are
also issues with invasive species, which some of my colleagues took a
great interest in, which we must return to and keep under the scrutiny
of the
Committee.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/93C7FFEEDC33CAB1E1BB100EE91C167A849C44FB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="10 October 2013">Thursday

from enforcement, I want to discuss the hen harrier briefly. It is
arguably the species most at risk of extinction in England and Wales. I
notice that DEFRA has a target in its business plan of no extinctions
in England and Wales. It is important that Departments do what
departmental business plans say they are going to do. We are looking at
a range of departmental business plans, but DEFRA has the target in its
business plan, so what is it doing?</hs_Para>

at length about the different views that witnesses who gave evidence to
our inquiry had on the cause of the decline in hen harriers. We felt
that persecution is a key factor in the decline of the hen harrier. I
draw the Minister’s attention to five academic studies, by
Redpath, Natural England, Summers, Etheridge, and the Joint Nature
Conservation Committee. The JNCC found that the most common form of
persecution is deliberate nest disturbance, which is why, after a
lengthy discussion, we felt that the Government should evaluate the
effect of an offence of vicarious liability in relation to the
persecution of birds of prey, as the Scottish Government did in 2011,
and consider introducing such an offence in England and Wales, to make
landowners responsible for the activities of their gamekeepers. The
Government said that they would review the matter as soon as statistics
were available, and I can tell the Minister that when the Select
Committee visited the Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh, we had a
brief discussion with MSPs and put that on their agenda. Are the
statistics on the impact of the offence of vicarious liability in
Scotland available? Will the Government look at the Scottish experience
and report back?</hs_Para>

international wildlife crime is serious. We heard that the tiger, the
elephant and the rhinoceros all face extinction in their natural
habitats due to demand for 
<?notus-xml column=133?>illegal wildlife products derived from their body parts. Most
troublingly, we heard that those body parts are not, as some had
previously assumed, mostly used in traditional Asian medicine, but
being traded as investments for their scarcity value. My hon. Friend
the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) has done a great deal to
publicise that. As those species draw closer to extinction, the value
of their body parts increases. We even heard about a Chinese bank that
runs an investment fund based on elephant ivory.</hs_Para>

response to our report, the Government agreed that “investment
and conspicuous consumption” are emerging as significant drivers
of demand. We were encouraged to hear how the UK is combating such
trends domestically by strictly applying the criteria for the re-export
of antique animal products, such as ivory billiard balls of all things,
but we could question why those criteria were not applied strictly in
the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000029">We
can make significant inroads only through international co-operation.
We therefore recommended that at the March 2013 CITES—convention
on international trade in endangered species—conference of the
parties, the Government take the lead in encouraging all CITES member
states to enforce wildlife law. In particular, we urged the Government
to focus attention on the damaging effect of one-off sales of impounded
illegal wildlife products, such as elephant ivory, which serve only to
stimulate the market and ultimately drive poaching, and we urged the
Government to make the case for an unequivocal ban on all forms of
international ivory trade. Will the Minister set out the negotiating
position adopted by the Government at the CITES conference earlier this
year, and the extent to which it was successful?</hs_Para>

Minister comment on decision 16.55, which directs that a
decision-making mechanism—sorry to be technical—for a
process of trade in ivory be adopted at the next conference of the
parties? Why does he not call for an unequivocal international ban on
all forms of ivory now? As part of the CITES working group, of which
the UK is a member, will he call for the suspension of discussions on
the decision-making mechanism? As was suggested in the earlier
intervention, the agenda has moved on fast, even since we took
evidence. We were heartened by the destruction in the US of stockpiles
of ivory, which demonstrates that President Obama and others are taking
a serious stance on the matter. We are talking about something that
might have been considered impossible last May; the question now is not
whether it will happen, but how it will. I do not think there is any
harm in reviewing the Government’s
position.</hs_Para>

illustrates that if international leaders decide to take a lead, drive
the agenda forward, and show true 
<?notus-xml column=134?>leadership, it is possible to start to deal with these issues. Returning
to biodiversity, which is inextricably linked to the concerns that the
hon. Gentleman mentioned, it is important that we
do not lose momentum. We understand a lot more than we did six months

Walley:</Member></B> That intervention highlights the potential for a
constructive debate following the publication of a Select Committee
report that looked at the question in detail. The hon. Gentleman has
great experience on the Antarctic—and, indeed, following our
report on the subject, the Arctic—and he has admirably
illustrated that there is real scope for leadership. Events in the
Antarctic have demonstrated that what happens there affects all of us;
what happens in any part of the planet affects all of us. The issues
that we are discussing should not be placed in a box labelled
“the environment”; they affect everything from governance
and war to money laundering. All these things are interconnected. The
sooner environmental questions are placed at the heart of international
issues, the better.</hs_Para>

apologise for the fact that our report is about the detail of what we
found in our investigation. We identified a number of absurdities in
the implementation of CITES in UK law. Why, for example, should a vet
be present when samples are taken from any animal that is suspected to
have been trafficked into the UK? That is a reasonable stipulation in
the case of a living animal, but given that we cannot even afford to
guarantee funding for the national wildlife crime unit, it is a huge
waste of resources to require a vet to be present in cases involving
taxidermy. It does not make sense. We even heard that a vet would have
to be called out before a sample could be taken from a table made from
Brazilian rosewood, which is a CITES-listed species of tree. It is
difficult for the Government to provide credible international
leadership on tackling wildlife crime if they do not put their house in
order.</hs_Para>

response, the Government said that they would attend to the issues
relating to the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement)
Regulations 1997, which implement the international agreement on
endangered species, but it would be helpful to know from the Minister
what the timetable is. How far has the consultation progressed, and,
most importantly, when will a statutory instrument be introduced? I
hope it will be before the 2014 high-level summit.</hs_Para>

on, I want briefly to mention tigers. We were concerned about the
poaching of tigers, and, as with all endangered species, we recognise
that attitudes must change if those animals are to survive. We
desperately need new ideas to challenge demand for such illegal
wildlife products.</hs_Para>

conclusion, I hope that the Minister, and his new colleagues in other
Departments following the recent reshuffle, can see the impact of
wildlife crime. As we 
<?notus-xml column=135?>have heard in interventions, that impact is huge, and it is growing by
the day. The new urgency requires a clear lead from Government as they
prepare for the high-level summit that they are organising in London in
2014, which we welcome. If the Government revisit our
recommendations—this is the nature of Select Committee
scrutiny—they could go into that meeting in a much stronger
position. Not least, they could think again about our final
recommendation relating to the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife
Crime. PAW, as it is aptly known, is a multi-agency representative
body. Its current membership of 140 organisations includes all
significant UK conservation and trade bodies with an interest in
combating wildlife crime. It is co-chaired by a DEFRA civil servant and
a senior police officer. We called for a DEFRA Minister to take an
active interest and give political direction by chairing the body. Our
suggestion was dismissed out of hand in the Government response, on the
grounds that devolved Administrations were not likely to collaborate in
the way that we envisaged—perhaps I am taking a little bit of
poetic licence there.</hs_Para>

in this short debate we can set out the need for the Government to be
bolder in response to all our recommendations, and not simply the one
relating to PAW. WWF UK has expressed concern that the Home Office and
the Ministry of Justice are falling behind, while other
Departments—DEFRA, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office—are forging ahead. DEFRA is
the No. 1 Department, with lead responsibility for ensuring that all
Departments protect biodiversity. Only by giving further consideration
to our recommendations—we would be happy to arrange to discuss
them with the Minister—can the Minister demonstrate clear
strategic direction and leadership in his new career at DEFRA. I am

that the debate covers an enormous range of subjects, but I would like
to focus my remarks on the illegal trade in ivory. Hon. Members
probably know that up to 40,000 elephants, on average, are killed every
year. That equates to one every 15 minutes. If that rate were to apply
continuously, it would render the species extinct in the wild within 10
years. It is a tragedy, by any 
<?notus-xml column=136?>standard, that Africa has already lost some 90% of its elephants in the
past half-century. What makes it an even greater tragedy is that the
world so nearly put an end to that madness a few decades ago. In 1989,
a worldwide ban on the international trade in ivory was approved by
CITES, levels of poaching fell dramatically—not completely, but
dramatically—and the black market prices of ivory
slumped.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101057000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000043">However, only
10 years later, malignant interests were able to have their way, as
ever, and so-called “one-off” sales were allowed. For
example, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were allowed an experimental
one-off sale of more than 49,000 kg of ivory to Japan. In 2002, a
further one off-sale was approved, which resulted in 105,000 kg of
ivory being shipped to China and Japan. With so much legitimate ivory,
if there is such a thing, on the market, illegal ivory was easy to pass
off, and demand simply rocketed. More elephant tusks were seized in
2011 than in any year since 1989, when the trade was banned. Sierra
Leone lost its last wild elephant in 2009, and Senegal has only a
handful or two—between five and 10—elephants left. Congo
has lost 90% of them. I could go on through all the African elephant
range
states.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000044">This
intelligent, thoughtful creature is being wiped from the earth, and not
for noble reasons. By and large, they are being butchered so that
mindless people—mostly, I am afraid to say, the middle classes
in China—can buy trinkets, chopsticks, toothpicks, combs and the
like. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent North has pointed
out, they are being hunted down for purposes that are even more
sinister, if that is possible, with ivory tusks and rhino horns being
hoarded as investment opportunities that rise in value as the species
are depleted. It is hard to imagine anything more revolting, but it is
happening.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000045">Blood
ivory is big business, and it is increasingly sophisticated. In May, 26

al-Shabaab’s funding is thought to come from ivory. The issue
therefore affects everyone. Blood ivory has helped to finance al-Qaeda.
It has funded Joseph Kony’s abhorrent Lord’s Resistance

the good news is that opposition to the illegal wildlife trade in China

pangolins—I do not even know what they are—and shark fin
are on that long list. That big step would not have happened were it
not for a changing tide among Chinese consumers. However, progress
clearly is not fast enough. I imagine that the Chinese premier, by one
stroke of his pen, could shut down the ivory carving factories. I urge
the Government to use every diplomatic lever available to accelerate
such a process and to prevent the annihilation of a magnificent

My wife is incredibly passionate about this

reality is that the number of forest elephants has fallen by 62% in 10
years, with the kill rate higher than the birth rate. As a layman, I
initially focused just on ivory, but there are trades in big cat pelts,
rhinoceros horns, bush meat, scales, antelope wool shawls, tortoise
shells, bear gall bladders, shark fins and caviar. The list of
unimaginable horrors goes on and on. Animals are used for culinary

shockingly destructive and historically shameful it would be if we did
nothing while a great species was criminally slaughtered into
extinction. And yet, here we are in the midst of one of the most tragic

put the issue in context, the ivory trade has doubled since
2007 and the price of ivory is now $2,205 per kg, while the
price of rhinoceros horn, from an animal which has been brought to the
edge of extinction, is now a staggering $66,139 per kg. That is greater
than the cost of gold or platinum; a rhinoceros horn the size of a bag
of sugar would cost approximately
£20,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000058">My
hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park was spot on when he spoke
about links to terrorist groups. Criminal groups, warlords, militants
and terrorist groups are all taking advantage by utilising their
drug-smuggling routes. This is large scale; it is a huge problem. The
WWF estimates that the trade is worth somewhere between $15 billion and
$25 billion, but compared with other transnational criminal activities,
it carries a low risk of detection, small penalties and minimal
consequences, which are attractive incentives and drivers for groups of
smugglers. For example, fines are just £300 in India and
£900 in Nepal. We are talking about a $25 billion industry, with
the equivalent of a bag of sugar costing £20,000, so it is a no
brainer that there are drivers and incentives for going into the trade.
Groups are taking advantage of their networks and exploiting local
people in abject poverty, because the financial incentives prove so
compelling. Smugglers are also corrupting officials, and killing the
rangers paid to protect these vital animals. There have been more than
1,000 deaths of rangers in 35 different countries over the past
decade.</hs_Para>

chances of combating global and terrorist organisations? The Government
have made a start, but we need to consider a long-term commitment to
the national wildlife crime unit. We do not want it to have to lobby
every year to secure funding; we want it to get on with the task in
hand. We have an incredible opportunity to build on the forthcoming

consider how we can provide viable alternatives for communities in
abject poverty. There are opportunities, I suggest, within the foreign
aid budget 
<?notus-xml column=139?>to create sustainable alternatives. We need to look for commercial
opportunities. A good example is the work that the International Fund
for Animal Welfare has done with whaling in Iceland. Tourists are now
flocking to see whales in real life. It would not help that commercial

meat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000061">Working
with IFAW, we want to see that wildlife crime is treated seriously, on
a par with drugs and human trafficking, and that requires international
pressure. We want to see other countries prioritise the matter, too. We
need to co-ordinate international action, especially on law enforcement
capacity and developing effective judicial systems, which come
naturally to us but perhaps not so naturally to some other countries
where such crimes are
prevalent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000062">We
need to encourage, develop and implement regional strategies in areas
such as central Africa and the horn of Africa, and recognise the new
challenges that come from China. Huge Chinese investment into many
African countries brings with it Chinese workers, thereby bringing
demand to the heart of the country and removing the need to smuggle the
goods. We must take action in those countries and address the growing
demand and availability of ivory, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Richmond Park highlighted. We saw demand drop, but now it is coming
back strong. Worryingly, 80% of Chinese people do not realise that an
elephant has to be killed to get
ivory.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000063">Yesterday,

needed. Next year, additional funding has been found, which is a good
thing in such straitened times. In evidence, we were told that it was
difficult to recognise the products and when they are recognised it is

good debate. We have gone over many aspects of the original EAC report,
but I still have a few issues to highlight. First, there is a need for
the Government to clarify their position on controls of the possession
of certain pesticides, in view of the effect that they can have on
wildlife and the way they are used in wildlife crime in this country. I
refer to the supplementary evidence that was submitted to the Select
Committee by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and
particularly want to draw it to the attention of the Minister.
Currently, offences occur as a result of improper storage and use of
approved pesticides contrary to the statutory conditions. The improper
storage and use of pesticides that have had their ministerial approval
removed is, of course, an offence. There are also examples of people
storing legitimate pesticides specifically for attacking wildlife in
this country, and they are escaping the law at the moment.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101057000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000067">Carbofuran is
an example of a pesticide that has had its ministerial approval for use
removed, but can still be properly stored in England. Section 43 of the
Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 creates an offence
of possession of pesticides harmful to wildlife prescribed by the
Secretary of State. That is a method of ensuring that we capture the
storage of those pesticides for illegal purposes—where they are
being used to kill wildlife. An order listing the prescribed pesticides
could be made, which would deal with that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000068">In
Scotland, a list of eight pesticides has been
prescribed—aldicarb, alphachloralose, aluminium phosphide,
bendiocarb, carbofuran, mevinphos, sodium cyanide and
strychnine—under the Possession of Pesticides (Scotland) Order
2005. We need such legislation in England. We have the provision for it
under the 2006 Act, and the RSPB, in its supplementary evidence to the
Committee, made a strong case for legislation. I hope the Minister will
look at the matter seriously. It is one way in which the pesticides
used in poisoning wildlife in the UK could be brought under control. A
full enactment of section 43 NERC controls would be a powerful tool in
the fight against wildlife crime and the illegal poisoning of wildlife
in particular.</hs_Para>

said, that offence in Scotland has shown its value with at least 10
successful prosecutions involving at least four of the products on the
current list, one of which involved the possession of 10.5 kg of
carbofuran. Let me put that in perspective. That amount of carbofuran
is enough to poison the entire Scottish population of birds of prey six
times over. I recommend that the Minister considers such legislation.
It is a remedy that is easily available to him. It has proved its
efficacy in Scotland and should be replicated in
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000070">On
the subject of birds of prey, I want to echo the wise words of the
Chair of the Select Committee about raptor persecution and vicarious
liability. No one should underestimate the true effect of raptor
persecution on some of the UK’s most endangered species.
According to the Government-sponsored joint nature conservation
committee report on hen harrier conservation, 2013 was the first year
in which there was not a single successful breeding pair in the UK.
That is extraordinary, and I know that the Minister, although new to
his position, will take the matter seriously. There is enough
appropriate habitat in the UK to support 324 to 340 breeding
pairs of hen harrier. Today, we have zero breeding pairs.</hs_Para>

peregrine falcon, the goshawk and other raptors, it is absolutely clear
that someone is more likely to see a peregrine falcon from the terrace
of the House of Commons than they are on a walk through the north-west
Peak district. Why? That is a question that the Minister should ask
himself. The Committee was entirely right to focus on vicarious
liability, because without vicarious liability we will lack a key piece
in the puzzle—highly intensive, driven grouse moors with
irresponsible owners. At this point, I will say that there are many
grouse moors that are sensibly, properly and responsibly managed.
However, we all know that there are also irresponsibly managed moors,
and the evidence shows that they are having a devastating effect on the
populations of some of Britain’s most iconic birds of
prey.</hs_Para>

with regard to hen harriers, which he referred to—is not
restricted exclusively to areas where there are either amateur or
professional gamekeepers. Indeed, I also hope that he will concede that
even RSPB reserves have failed to establish any breeding pairs of hen
harriers. So, I hope that he is not implying that this problem is

are pressed for time and I want to leave the Minister enough time to
respond to the debate. Four key points have been raised today by
colleagues. First, which chief constable is currently responsible for
the national wildlife crime unit? We need to know that, because the
person we all thought was responsible has been suspended. Secondly,
will the Minister give an assurance that the NWCU will continue beyond
2014, and will he consider incorporating it into the
Department’s three-year funding cycle as part of its base budget
and stop this nonsense of one-year roll-on? Thirdly, will he commit to
running a more effective convention on international trade in
endangered species regime domestically, under the Control of Trade in
Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1997? Fourthly, there has
been an impassioned plea to stop the illegal slaughter 
<?notus-xml column=142?>of elephants, as the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith)
pointed out. Incidentally, I just say to him that the pangolin is a
scaly anteater; it is Manis manidae. However, it is a mammal, even
though it has scales. The hon. Gentleman pointed out, quite correctly,
the connections with al-Shabaab, Janjaweed and the Lord’s
Resistance Army. This is big business, and it is big criminal business.
For that reason, I heartily endorse his remarks and hope that the
Department will take this issue very seriously indeed. If it does not,
its staff will look very silly next year at the meeting next February
to discuss international wildlife crime, which we are
hosting.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/2AAFDBFD011B1912B8EF2E1E6278C0822F8F736D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="10 October 2013">Thursday

it. She explained to me earlier that part of the reason for that was
that, with the summer recess coming, it was not easy to get a slot. She
also made the point that it took the Government some time to respond to
the Committee’s report. I am able to say that that was nothing
to do with me, because I was not in the Government at the time.
However, what I can say—a number of people have said this
already—is that my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for
Newbury (Richard Benyon), was absolutely passionate about these issues,
so I do not think anyone should read into that delay that there was any
lack of interest in the issue of wildlife crime on his

crime have moved forward hugely in the last 10 years, thanks to the
commitment and enthusiasm of successive Governments, the enforcement
agencies and the many non-governmental organisations that willingly
share their expertise and experience. We should take a moment to

change the law. There is a perfectly sensible provision, under the NERC
Act, that would allow a list of chemicals to be drawn up that can be,
and are being, used in this way. The Scottish experience shows that by
putting chemicals on that list and applying the law, and then

point—I probed it when looking into this issue—but
approval for the majority of pesticides linked to wildlife poisoning
cases has been revoked, or they have never

difficulty in or lack of enforcement, not that the law is falling short
in allowing prosecution. There is no material difference between being
able to find that somebody is storing a chemical or having it hidden

committed across the UK, the unit works with Government Departments,
police force intelligence bureaux and scientific and other
organisations to produce an intelligence-based assessment of current,
emerging and future wildlife crime threats, with recommendations for
action. That approach ensures the best use of the unit’s time

Friend the Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner). He rightly raised
the issue of carbofuran, to which the Committee gave a lot of

issue out of hand, and they have been unwilling to consider introducing
an order under section 43 of the Natural Environment and Rural
Communities Act 2006. As in Scotland, we believe there should be an
order of possession. Is it all right for a gamekeeper to have

report that we are debating was the result of our second inquiry into
the Work programme. The first, in May 2011, was on the contractual
arrangements of the programme just before it was introduced. At the
time, we said that we would return to the subject, to see how things
were working out in practice and whether the Work programme was
delivering on its promises. As a result, we carried out a further
inquiry into the experience of the people on the Work programme; as
that inquiry progressed, we realised that while the programme might be
delivering sustained job outcomes for some people, it was not effective
in helping those who have major barriers to work, such as those who are
homeless, have drug or alcohol problems or, in particular, have a
disability or health problem, diagnosed or
undiagnosed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000118">The
report is therefore called “Can the Work Programme work for all
user groups?” The question mark is important. In short, the
answer is no. To be generous, I could say that the answer is not yet,
but there would have to be major changes to the way in which the
contracts are delivered, and to how the differential pricing structure
works, if the Work programme is to begin properly delivering job
outcomes for those with the highest barriers to
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000119">My
Committee’s starting point was one of broad support for the
programme’s policy intentions and innovative approach. It was a
replacement programme—a single one, instead of all the various
welfare-to-work schemes introduced by the previous Government. It was
to focus on sustained job outcomes and to be a payment-by-results
system. Elements such as the differential pricing structure were meant
to encourage providers to focus on those who were furthest from the
world of work, not just those who were easiest to help.</hs_Para>

also to be a prime provider model, in which large
providers—predominantly from the commercial sector—would
bear most of the financial risk of operating

subcontractors to deliver services, in particular to meet the
requirements of jobseekers with more complex
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000121">The
debate is timely, in that the Department for Work and Pensions has just
published its latest set of statistics on Work programme performance;
it is the third set of statistics, covers the period between July 2012
and June 2013 and was published at the end of September. The statistics
bear out the conclusion of our report: the performance levels for
mainstream jobseekers have continued to improve—some
commentators say that they are plateauing, but they have improved after
a shaky start—and are now above the Department’s minimum
performance
levels.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000122">For
those claiming employment and support allowance, however, the results
remain very poor: only 5.8% get work, which is way below the minimum
performance levels, set at 16.5%. Only six people out of every 100 in
that group are getting a sustained job. In fact, for that group of
claimants—the group that the Government said they would not
leave languishing on benefits as the previous Government did—the
Work programme is delivering a worse outcome than the previous,
specialist welfare-to-work programmes for the recipients of incapacity
benefit, such as pathways to
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000123">Pathways
to work varied in different parts of the country, but the programme had
job outcomes of between 10% and 30%. The coalition Government, on
coming to power, said that those results were simply not good
enough—but if the 30% was not good enough, the 5.8% must be a
cause for shame. That is why our key conclusion was that differential
pricing had not had its intended impact. Creaming and parking persist,
and we believe that segmenting jobseekers into payment groups according
to the type of benefit being claimed is proving ineffective. We also
have concerns about how the prime provider model is operating in
practice, having heard evidence that smaller niche providers with the
experience to support more disadvantaged jobseekers have received far
fewer referrals than anticipated, and in some cases none at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000124">Our
inquiry was hampered by a lack of transparent data. We were unable to
assess from official statistics the level of specialist
advisers’ involvement in the programme, or how effective those
providers are. Publishing official referral and performance data at
subcontractor level would not only aid effective scrutiny, but
facilitate the development of a more effective welfare-to-work
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000125">As
this debate is about the Government’s response to our report, I
would like to turn my attention to some of our concerns about the
process for formulating Government responses. The quality of the
Government’s response is poor and includes some perfunctory
responses to individual recommendations. There is no explicit
indication of whether the Government agree with the overall thrust of
the report. Some of their actions suggest that they share at least some
of the Committee’s concerns, but that is not mentioned in the
response, or is mentioned only perfunctorily. I will give a few
examples.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000126">The
response alludes briefly to a pilot in which Work programme
participants who are undertaking or recently undertook treatment for
drug or alcohol dependency attract increased outcome payments. That is
exactly the sort of pilot we recommended. Clearly, the Government 
<?notus-xml column=151?>share to some extent our concern that the Work programme pricing
structure does not sufficiently incentivise providers to help some
groups of harder-to-help claimants. A fuller description of the pilot
and how it will be evaluated would have been appropriate. We are aware
of a further pilot that tests closer working between the Work programme
providers and treatment programmes to support participants with a
history of drug or alcohol problems, but that is not mentioned at all
in the Government’s
response.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000127">The
response gives the strong impression that no official in the Department
for Work and Pensions has read the report in full. In some cases, it
addresses only the text of the individual recommendation paragraphs,
instead of engaging with the preceding evidence-based discussion and
argument in our report. A particularly egregious example is the
Department’s reply to the Committee’s concern that
smaller specialist providers seem not to be involved in the Work
programme to the extent anticipated. The Department
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13101057000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000149">“In

sounds good, unless our report has been read. The official who drafted
that sentence seems ignorant of the fact that in the paragraphs
preceding the recommendation the report casts serious doubt on the
usefulness of that stocktake exercise. It notes evidence that many
organisations included in the 43% cited by the Department for Work and
Pensions have received no Work programme referrals at all.</hs_Para>

highlights the results of a BBC “Panorama” survey of
voluntary sector organisations listed as Work programme subcontractors,
but 40% of those organisations did not even consider themselves to be
part of the Work programme when they were approached, and 73% had
received fewer referrals than expected. The stocktake seemed to us to
be merely a list of organisations named by prime contractors as being
part of their Work programme supply chains, regardless of whether those
organisations have received a single client via the Work programme. It
was clear from evidence to our inquiry that the stocktake tells us
nothing about the availability of specialist support within the
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000130">We
had other concerns about responses to some of our recommendations. The
response to our recommendations on minimum performance levels does not
engage with the Committee’s concern that the Government’s
calculation of minimum performance levels seems to be based on
unrealistic economic forecasts made prior to the launch of the
programme. Paul Lester’s independent review, which the
Department holds up as evidence that it has dealt with this issue,
seems to have concerned itself only with how data on performance are
presented, and not with how more realistic performance expectations can
be
calculated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000131">The
Department’s primary concern seems to be that performance in
year one of the Work programme looked low to commentators and the
media. Our concern, which was not addressed in the Government’s
response, was that performance was in fact low—it did not just
seem low; it was low—when measured against the
Department’s unrealistic expectations.</hs_Para>
<?notus-xml column=152?><hs_Para UID="13101057000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000132">This is
fundamentally important in a payment-by-results programme. If
contractual performance expectations are set too high, they risk
starving providers of funding, with inevitable consequences for service
delivery. Our recommendation that the Department explore, with
independent experts, new methods for setting minimum performance levels
that are more responsive to economic conditions and can be more
transparently calculated and applied deserved a more considered
response from the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000133">We
also made recommendations about jobseeker segmentation. It is clear
that the Department knew from the outset that segmenting participants
predominately by benefit type and using that as the basis for the
differential pricing structure was a risk. Everyone accepted that
benefit type was only a very rough proxy for claimants’ level of
need. There is now strong evidence that segmenting claimants in this
way ignores important information that is crucial in making an accurate
assessment of claimants’ distance from the labour market.
Participants most at risk of not having their needs recognised or
addressed include homeless people, those with unrecognised health or
disability-related barriers to work, and people with a history of drug
or alcohol
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000134">The

more details about the Department’s work and the approach it is
considering would have been appreciated. We believe it should pilot an
initial assessment along the lines of the Australian jobseeker

hope that in that way the specialist help will go to those who are
furthest from the labour
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000136">Another
recommendation was that the money that was returned to the Treasury
because of the year one underspend should have been redirected to the
Work programme. Due partly to the underperformance I have referred to
in terms of the data, £248 million was unspent in year one of
the Work programme. That could have been used to address some of the
programme’s clear shortcomings over the course of the current
contracts. The recommendation received the most dismissive of
responses. The Department simply told
us:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13101057000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000151">“All

that it was short-sighted not to use that money to help those
jobseekers who are currently being failed by the Work programme. The
Government should not lose sight of the fact established by Lord Freud
in his 2007 review of welfare-to-work that well-targeted and effective
employment support for those furthest from the labour market has the
potential to achieve large savings for the Exchequer in the long
run.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000139">We
welcomed the establishment of a best practice group looking at minimum
service standards, which are so vague in some cases as to allow
providers virtually to ignore some Work programme participants, if they
so chose. However, it is unfortunate that the Department appears to
have ruled out a single set of core minimum standards on the grounds
that it would in some way 
<?notus-xml column=153?>inhibit providers’ ability to innovate—the black-box
approach, I suppose. We simply do not agree. It is
perfectly possible to establish core minimum standards that offer all
participants protection and service assurance without being overly
prescriptive about the services providers
offer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101057000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101057000140">There
is no attempt to address the problem of high adviser case loads.
Average case loads are between 120 and 180 participants per adviser,
which is far too high to allow an acceptable level of service for all
participants. Advisers have no choice but to prioritise certain
participants to support. The Department’s response to our
recommendation that it, together with providers, consider ways of
reducing case loads amounts to fewer than four lines of text. Its

plausible. Addressing high case loads means finding resources for more
advisers or offering alternative provision for some participants. It is
not just that the differential payment structure is not delivering for
those furthest from the labour market, but that an assurance of service
quality is not built into the system, which makes it clear why many

also took evidence about the Merlin standard. Much of it was from
subcontractors, many of whom felt they had been unfairly treated by
primes. Most had received far fewer referrals than they had been
promised; some had received none at all. A number had withdrawn from
the Work programme altogether. Many felt that, far from shouldering the
burden of financial risk, prime contractors were passing the risk
involved in payment by results further down the supply chain. We are
concerned that the Merlin standard—the regulatory regime
intended to monitor the quality of supply-chain
relationships—appears incapable of addressing these very real
issues. A review of the Merlin standard is necessary, so we welcome the
news that the Department for Work and Pensions, together with the
Merlin advisory board and the accreditation service provider, is
seeking views from across the sector on the regime’s
effectiveness to date. Our strong view is that changes are required to
strengthen the regulatory

should be the future shape of the Work programme? The

mainstream jobseekers, but that it is unlikely to do so for those
facing more severe barriers to employment—has been borne out by
the published data, and particularly the most recent data. In line with

also acknowledge—this has been acknowledged by the National
Audit Office, for example—that the fact that the statistics were
collected at a very early stage has resulted in media stories claiming
that the programme has failed. It is worth noting that, of those

important to understand that we—I say “we” because
I feel passionately that the coalition Government should be proud of

constituency. More importantly, success is being delivered at a cost

£2,097, compared with about £7,500 under the previous

hindsight, would he agree that the cliff-edge approach of shutting down

Bebb:</Member></B> In view of the fact that we were looking to shake up
the way we were supporting people into work, I am not sure there was
any other way around that. The summary to the Select Committee report
highlights the fact that it was an achievement on the 
<?notus-xml column=155?>part of the Department to deliver the Work programme so soon after the
announcement in Parliament and after the legislation was passed.
Despite the circumstances, the programme was delivered.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101070000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000009">The key
problem with the statistics that people originally looked at is that
there is a natural delay in the system before we can talk of a positive
outcome in terms of generating a job for somebody. That delay has
allowed the statistics to be used to try to make a political point
about the programme. I know for a fact that the trade body representing
Work programme providers has been particularly annoyed and upset at the
way in which some of the statistics that have been released, which
often have not indicated the time lag in the programme’s
performance, have been used to try to make a point about the way the
programme is performing.</hs_Para>

interesting, key point highlighted in the report’s summary is
about the importance of the relationship between Work programme
providers and jobcentres. That relationship is highlighted as a
weakness of the programme, but I have to say—I can speak only
from personal experience in the area I represent—that one of the
key factors behind the success of the Work programme in north Wales has
been the positive relationship between jobcentres and Work programme
providers. A key recommendation in the report is that different areas
of the country, with different providers, should learn from each other.
If providers in other parts of the country are having difficulties
co-operating with their local jobcentres, and they want to learn some
lessons, they are more than welcome to come to north Wales, where the
relationship is working particularly well. That is not to say that the
figures in north Wales are particularly good, but I will come to that,
because there are problems facing the programme in different parts of
the country that are not necessarily of the programme’s making.
That is something I need to put on record.</hs_Para>

I want briefly to touch on is whether the Work programme can support
all user groups. One of the programme’s crucial successes is in
supporting young people back into employment. We have a youth
unemployment problem, although it is not as bad as in some other
European countries, and we should be thankful for that. There is no
doubt that the youth contract and the financial support we offer
employers to engage with young people looking for a job who are on the
Work programme have been a success.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101070000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000012">The report
also highlights the fact that there is sometimes a lack of publicity,
and of appreciation of what is happening and the support available to
employers who want to recruit young people and to understand the Work
programme. There is an obligation on Members of Parliament to highlight
the support that is available. It does not matter what political party
a Member represents; they will obviously prefer the Work programme to
be a success. I wrote to hundreds of businesses in my constituency
about the Youth Contract, highlighting the financial support available
for young people on the Work programme who were job-ready, and willing
and able to work, and explaining that if there were opportunities in
those businesses the Work programme providers were ready and willing to
help. I am glad to say that the initiative resulted in at least 20
young people securing jobs; I know that because employers have
contacted me. 
<?notus-xml column=156?>That might be a small contribution, but as well as highlighting failures
politicians have an obligation, where there is lack of publicity or
understanding, to let employers know what support is available; because
they are the ones who create jobs.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101070000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000013">We have
identified those under 24 as needing particular support, because of the
challenges that they face in getting access to work. As everyone knows,
it is easier to get into a job from a job. A young person without
experience on their CV needs support to get a position. The Youth
Contract has been a significant benefit to many young people, certainly
in my part of the world, but perhaps there is a need to extend such
support to other hard-to-reach groups. I have been keen to support
young people looking for jobs in my constituency, but I am also aware
that the average age of my constituents is among the highest in any
constituency in the country, and certainly in Wales. A significant
problem that we need to re-examine is how proactively to help those
over 50 who are desperate to work. They may, despite having skills,
have been out of the job market for some time. There is an argument for
something similar to the Youth Contract, if funds permit at some point,
to support those people. Perhaps we need to persuade employers that
there is an advantage in recruiting such people from the Work
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Anne Marie Morris" PimsId="5726" UID="13101070000115" xid="1189" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000115">Anne
Marie Morris:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good
point. There is a challenge for older people who have been made
redundant. Does he agree that an area in which the Work programme could
do better is in helping to provide advice and support to those who
could think about self-employment? That seems appropriate for the older
person. The all-party group on micro-businesses did a survey showing
that only half the Work programme providers could provide such advice
and
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guto Bebb" PimsId="5521" UID="13101070000116" xid="1002" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000116">Guto
Bebb:</Member></B> I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. One of the
strengths of the Work programme in rural Wales is the fact that
providers have been able to vary their targets for attracting people to
self-employment. Originally, the significant targets for
self-employment were given to providers in south Wales. However,
statistics clearly showed that the self-employment option was not doing
well in south Wales, but that in rural and north Wales there was
considerable interest in taking that route. There is a significant
amount of support available from Work programme providers, but, more
importantly, there is flexibility in the system to allow the numbers to
be switched, and that has benefited many in my part of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000016"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Timms" PimsId="4291" UID="13101070000117" xid="593" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000117">Stephen
Timms:</Member></B> The hon. Member for Newton Abbot raised an
interesting point. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it could be

moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guto Bebb" PimsId="5521" UID="13101070000118" xid="1002" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000118">Guto
Bebb:</Member></B> That, indeed, is one of the recommendations that I
would make to the Department. I have been a key advocate of the new
enterprise allowance. A long time ago I was an adviser to people
starting out on the old enterprise allowance scheme. There are still
businesses in my constituency that were established under that scheme.
It is important to provide such joined-up support. 
<?notus-xml column=157?>I am not making a criticism; Work programme providers are giving
valuable support in my constituency to people interested in
self-employment. I appreciate the fact that they have developed strong
relationships with local enterprise support providers, which is very
important; the black box approach is a key issue for Wales. I agree
that it would be helpful if the new enterprise allowance were
available, especially when there is flexibility in the programme to
allow figures and targets to be swapped between different parts of the
country. We must not put barriers in the way of people who want
self-employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000018">Flexibility
is a key part of the Work programme. There is no such thing as a
standard client. That flexibility is crucial for reaching those who
most need support and are most difficult to place. Work programme
providers in various parts of the country have sometimes got access to
quite specialist support services for individuals, to ready them for
the jobs market, and often that support has been partially funded
through European funding. For example, the European social fund has
enabled some providers to refer Work programme clients to support
schemes to make them more work-ready. The Welsh European Funding
Office, an arm’s length body fully controlled by the Welsh
Government, has decided not to allow Work programme clients access to
any programme partially funded by the European social fund. That has
been a great barrier to the black box approach. Indeed, Work programme
providers in Wales that I have talked to—and certainly the two
operating in my constituency—have been unable to get support for
their clients that is available elsewhere. That might be support with
numeracy, confidence-building or skills, but the providers are not
allowed to refer clients to the programmes because of a decision that
in Wales if a project is funded by the European social fund the support
is not available to Work programme clients.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101070000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000019">That is a
matter of huge concern. As the report highlights, Welsh performance
levels are not as impressive as those in other parts of the country. It
could be argued that the economy and employment level in Wales are not
as high as elsewhere, but private sector employment growth there, while
not spectacular, has been positive since 2010. An extra 69,000 jobs
have been generated in the Welsh economy and there is less dependence
on the public sector than for a long time. It is bizarre that people
who everyone recognises need to be supported into work—and often
the ones who most need support—are denied access to programmes
provided by further education colleges and specialist providers, just
because they are Work programme clients. I am happy to say that
evidence from the Welsh Government and the Department for Work and
Pensions to the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, for its report on
the Work programme in Wales, will highlight that discrepancy. It is
worth pointing out that often the individuals who are worst affected by
the decision not to allow Work programme participants to use the
schemes may be exactly those who, according to the report we are
considering today, are least well served by the Work programme. There
is an issue for the DWP, but I also want the message to go out that the
Welsh Government should carefully examine the reason why their
definition of additionality in European funding differs so markedly
from the one used in
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000020">I
have written to small employers in my constituency; and I do not have
many large ones. During the general election campaign the present
Chancellor of the Exchequer, 
<?notus-xml column=158?>who was then the shadow Chancellor, wanted to visit my constituency. He
asked for a list of employers with more than 500 members of staff, and
I could offer him nothing but the local authority. My constituency is
very dependent on small businesses; so I have tried to highlight the
support available for small businesses from the Work programme. The
other thing we have done in my constituency is to undertake a jobs
fair, which was a success. We managed to get significant participation
and, again, have seen positive outcomes in terms of jobs created. I
said clearly to the local newspaper that if one person found a job as a
result of the jobs fair, it was my time well spent. Two weeks later, we
are up to seven, which is very positive, with another six interviews

key point from that meeting was the fact that a number of small
businesses came up to me and said they were confused by the number of
organisations telling them that they offered support. This is an
important point that we need to get across: we have to ensure that the
streamlined level of support and the understanding of what support is
available is also part of the way in which we deliver the Work
programme. The last thing we want is for employers to feel that it is
too difficult to engage with such an important scheme as the Work
programme.</hs_Para>

of the Work programme has been positive, but I am not somebody who says
there is no way in which we can improve the system. We have had two
years, and in my view, the programme is delivering well, but there are
problems with specific groups who are being supported by it but are not
particularly successful, at this point, in getting into employment. We
need to look at such things as why there is a delay before somebody can
be referred on to the Work programme. In many cases, the delay is
because the job centre will be able to support individuals, because, as
everybody knows, the opportunity for people to re-engage with the
workplace is much higher when they have recently lost a job than it is
after several months.</hs_Para>

there is an issue about identifying individuals who might have specific
barriers in terms of getting back into the workplace. Why would it not
be possible for such people to be referred immediately on to the Work
programme? I am not sure whether there would be a huge additional cost,
but we would avoid the period in which somebody loses their confidence
for a period because they are in the job centre system and perhaps
feeling increasingly dejected as they are unable to get back into the
workplace. When identifying someone as needing particular levels of
support, it might be worth considering that such individuals could be
referred to the Work programme earlier. If we have confidence, as I do,
that the Work programme is adapting and meeting the challenges of
helping people back into the workplace, the sooner we can refer some
people on to it, the better. I would like people to consider that
point.</hs_Para>

fair to say that the programme was established quickly. The Select
Committee recognises that it was an achievement to get the contracts
signed and the programme up and running so quickly, but there is always
an opportunity to regroup and readdress some issues. I talk to
providers in my constituency and yes, they are very enthusiastic about
the scheme, yes, they are confident that they will deliver in due
course, and yes, they are frustrated with some restrictions in a Welsh
context, but 
<?notus-xml column=159?>one comment that comes out strongly is that the assessment of
individuals based on the benefits that they currently claim is a blunt
tool, in terms of identifying the required support.</hs_Para>

that the reason why that was the way forward initially was that we
needed to get the scheme up and running, and obviously, we assess
people in terms of what sort of benefits they qualify for. However, as
we have more confidence in the providers of the Work
programme—and increasingly, we are confident that in most parts
of the country we have Work programme providers who know what they are
doing—we need to have an increased level of understanding about
individual clients’ needs. Ultimately, if there are barriers
because of somebody being categorised for a particular benefit, and
that barrier is stopping them getting the support they need, we should,
at least, try to recognise that and address it in due course. There is
an argument for looking carefully at the way in which we assess
individuals in terms of the level of support that they need, rather the
using the blunt instrument of the benefits that they are
receiving.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000026">We
also have to look carefully at the fact that we are now coming to the
end of the initial two-year period. Clearly, the aim and aspiration is
that the vast majority of people in due course will find employment.
Current figures show about 56% being returned to job centres and about
41% going into employment, while some have been lost, or have left the
system in some way. That is not a bad performance—obviously, I
would like to see a majority gaining jobs—but we need to start
thinking carefully about what we do now. Do we extend the programme? I
have talked to individual Work programme clients—and
advisers—and what has been striking is that a number have said
that it has taken them a significant period of time simply to rebuild
their confidence, and to feel that they can face an employer across a
table and try and sell themselves. The coalition Government and,
certainly, the DWP need to think carefully about whether there is
mileage in extending the Work programme for particular clients for
longer than two years. The two-year period is, again, a blunt
instrument, because it is one rule for all, despite the fact that we
recognise that some individuals need more support than
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000027">Nobody
would deny that we can look at ways to improve the system, but we

great success stories and significant developments in the Work

politicians, we need to be constructive friends of the Work programme.
Where concerns exist, we need to highlight them, but we need to do so
in the context of acknowledging that with a significantly better
value-for-money ratio, the programme is delivering support and
delivering people back into the workplace. Can it do more? Of course it
can. Do we want it to do more? Of course we do. Can the Government look
at ideas about changing elements of the programme to be more supportive
of those who find it most difficult to find employment? Yes, I think
the Government should, but we should also recognise that to date, the
programme is a success story. I only hope that that success continues
and is enhanced, and if changes result in that enhancement being even
greater, no one would be more pleased  than
me.</hs_Para>

will come as no surprise that I take a slightly different view from the
rosy one portrayed by the hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb). In
fact, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)
alluded to a different view in his remarks about the start of the
programme. As hon. Members probably know, in spite of the difficult
economic circumstances faced by the Work programme—which the
report acknowledged—the levels of employment achieved through
the programme in the first 14 months would have been achieved without
it. For the first 14 months, therefore, it was not a success.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101070000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000030">I want to
focus on a number of points today. We need a 21st century
welfare-to-work system that reflects not only our current economic
reality, but the dynamic economy and flexible labour market that we
need for the future. I am afraid that the Work programme fails in that
regard on a number of levels. It fails, first, in terms of the efficacy
of welfare-to-work providers, and I shall try and pick out a few points
on that in a moment. Secondly, in contrast to the remarks made by the
hon. Member for Aberconwy, it fails to address the growing number of
long-term unemployed, and that was really the thrust of the message in
our report. The Work programme is also not helping with the change in
our economy. It is perpetuating a low-skill, low-aspiration economy. We
need to ensure that a welfare-to-work programme complements the type of
economy that we want, but it is failing to do so.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101070000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000031">I shall focus
now on the Work programme providers. We have seen a pattern across
public services of private sector providers delivering public services,
whether in the Work programme, in adult care, or, increasingly, in the
NHS. I do not have a problem with that where private providers
innovate, add value or capacity. However, I do have a problem where
private providers put profit before people and the services that they
deliver. When that is the case, I find it totally unacceptable. It is
not acceptable that staffing levels in some Work programme providers
mean caseloads of 120 to 180 jobseekers per adviser. It is not
acceptable that advisers are not adequately accredited or qualified to
fulfil their role. It is not acceptable—my hon. Friend the
Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg) mentioned this—that
small specialist organisations, which are disqualified from applying
for contracts separately because they are too small and do not have the
financial capacity to bid for them, are lured in and used as bid candy
for contract bids, but are then not used. They have a track record of
achieving success, particularly for jobseekers with specialist needs,
but are not being used. It is not acceptable that there are no minimum
standards other than job outcomes, that there is no effective
regulation and that there is a lack of transparency of Work programme
data, which prohibits effective
scrutiny.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000032">One
of the Select Committee’s biggest concerns was that the Work
programme is failing to address the growing number of long-term
unemployed people, particularly young people. The Work programme was
supposedly designed to cater for that through a payment-by-results
system, with differential pricing based on the 
<?notus-xml column=161?>type of benefit that jobseekers received, but evidence received by the
Committee shows that that is clearly not working,
with those furthest from the jobs market being parked and providers
creaming off those who are job-ready and easiest to
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000033">The
Select Committee recommended a more holistic approach to identifying
the barriers to work—for example, health problems or housing. A
number of specialist providers cater for people who are homeless, and
homelessness is an increasing problem. That comprehensive, more
holistic assessment must be needs-based, and funding models must be
developed that reflect an appropriate level of up-front
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000034">Related
to that, two years after the Select Committee’s report on the
work capability assessment, which highlighted our growing concerns at
the time, the Committee took more evidence that the WCA is not fit for
purpose. One example involved a claimant with terminal cancer whose
life expectancy was shorter than the WCA work-ready prognosis, but who
had been referred to the Work programme. What is happening about that
issue? It has been mentioned before. We are now two years on, but
certainly in my constituency surgery, I frequently encounter such
cases. Why are the Government not doing more on
that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000035">I
urge the Government to act now and undertake an immediate evaluation of
the WCA, with a view to revising the assessment process into
work-related and health-related components. That, too, was a key
recommendation in the Select Committee’s report. It would
identify the help that claimants with health conditions or disabilities
need in order to get into
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000036">Let
me move on to consider how we develop a welfare-to-work programme that
will help to skill up our economy. The WCA is just one example of how
the system is not fit for purpose. The Work programme, as the flagship
welfare-to-work programme, is failing to help to develop a high-skilled
work force. There are indications that opportunities to train beyond,
for example, level 3 skills training are being denied to jobseekers.
Instead of that type of training being supported, jobseekers are being
told that they must attend the training provided through the Work
programme and only that. Our welfare-to-work programmes must be more
flexible than that. We must be developing our skills base, not
restricting it. Just as our economy demands increased flexibility from
our labour market, so must our welfare-to-work programmes be more
flexible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000037">Finally,
I want to express my concerns about the Work programme in the context
of other welfare reforms. Last month, the National Audit Office
published a damning report about universal credit. I see direct
parallels in how the Work programme and universal credit have been
developed and implemented. A key failing identified in the NAO report
was the culture and leadership of the Department, which created what
was described as a “fortress” culture. I hope that, in
addition to responding to my remarks about the work capability
assessment, the Minister can explain how she will deal with that
culture and ensure that there is more openness and transparency in her
Department.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/F9E7B37F7DAB76FE8A90E1F4D8BEAD620773EC39" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="10 October 2013">Thursday

Lloyd</B> (Eastbourne) (LD):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr Walker. I congratulate the Minister on her
elevation. The question is, can the 
<?notus-xml column=162?>Work programme work for all user groups? That is the nub of this debate.
I share the broad views of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy
(Guto Bebb) and his passion for the programme. The Chair of the Select
Committee, the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg), knows
very well that I am absolutely passionate about the Work programme. One
of the key things that got me back into politics was the whole issue of
dignity of work and the challenge for the long-term unemployed, so I
feel very strongly about the Work programme and I think that in many
ways, despite its bumpy start, it is beginning to deliver and is making
a significant difference for a lot of
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000039">The
challenge—this is the nub of our report; this is what it focuses
on—is whether the Work programme works for all user groups. My
view is that, as currently configured, it does not, and I urge the
Minister, in her concluding remarks, to deal with the specific issues
that have been mentioned. The Department has already had an opportunity
to respond to a number of the key recommendations, but I do not feel
that it has responded
properly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000040">In
the first report, we clearly supported the principle of the programme,
but we flagged up two key concerns. The first was whether the
differential pricing would be sufficient to incentivise, and the second
was whether the Work programme supply chains would be suitably managed
to ensure adequate specialist services. The Work and Pensions Committee
recognises, as we all do in this area, that for many people who either
are a long way away from the job sector or have very specific
impairments and disabilities, the best way to help them into work is
for them to receive support from those very specialist and often quite
small groups that really understand the issue. One of the concerns
about the configuration of the Work programme was that we were not
confident that the supply chain, when it came down to it, would include
all those specialist groups. The Committee made a commitment to return
to the Work programme a year later to see whether our concerns in those
two specific areas had held water or had been dealt
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000041">Let
us consider differential pricing. I am slightly frustrated about this,
because before I came into politics, a lot of the work that I did with
Governments of both colours—Labour and Tory in the old
days—was in this area. The whole issue of creaming and parking,
as the hon. Member for Aberdeen South knows, is old hat. It has been
around a long time, so I was very hopeful that differential pricing
would crack it, and that this time we would head towards the sunny
uplands. Unfortunately, that has not happened, or not to the extent
that I would have liked. I need the Government to address that. I need
the DWP to be quite fierce about it with the Work programme
providers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000042">I
shall give a local example. In Eastbourne, my constituency, the first
tranche of those who unfortunately are called two-year returners are
coming through the sausage machine. I have had a meeting with a number
of the local training providers. Like my hon. Friend the Member for
Aberconwy, I work incredibly closely with my local training providers,
the chamber of commerce, Jobcentre Plus—you name it—and I
am discovering that a fair number of those individuals have had very
little support indeed. I am talking about a couple of face-to-face
meetings in two years, and then follow-up phone calls. They have been
parked. The reason why I 
<?notus-xml column=163?>am so hopping mad about it is that under the Work programme, those
individuals each had a £600 attachment fee. I want to go to the
local Work programme providers—my subcontractors, as it
were—and, on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions,
claim back £550 per person so that I can feed it into other
training operators and get those people jobs. There are issues with
differential pricing.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Aberconwy talked about benefit versus impairment.
I agree strongly—it was one of the recommendations in the
report—that how benefit is assessed needs revisiting. I am not
urging the Government to revisit the attachment fee at present;
however, I do not believe that Eastbourne is any different from any
other part of the country, other than that it is the sunniest town in
the UK, and for some early people there, the attachment fee has not
been used properly. I am disappointed that in some instances, the
primes clearly used specialist providers on the list to help them get
contracts, but did not use them properly after that. The DWP must look
closely at that.</hs_Para>

to tar all providers with the same brush. Like everything else in life,
there are good ones, middling ones and bad ones. One thing that I liked
about the business model for the Work programme is that the DWP and the
Secretary of State always said to us that as time went on, the better
Work programme providers would be rewarded and the worse ones
penalised. I want to see that happen, and I want the Department to be
absolutely vigorous. I am quite prepared to have competition in this
challenging and difficult area, but I want it to be genuinely robust,
so that better Work programme providers are rewarded and worse ones are
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000045">The
other challenge that we face is helping people with disabilities back
into work. I am disappointed—every Government has failed on this
issue—but I share the view of my hon. Friend the Member for
Aberconwy that we will get better at it. I feel strongly about it. It
is difficult. If someone has been out of work for 10 years with a
mental health problem and is in the Work programme, it is hard for
them. Anyone who says that it is not is in denial. I appreciate the
challenge, but I am disappointed that 90% of people with a disability
do not succeed in getting a job through the Work programme, and only 6%
of those on ESA get a job. I know the issue well, and I know how
challenging it is, so I will not jump up and down on the Government,
but I demand that we do it differently. All of us—the Select
Committee on Work and Pensions, the Opposition and Government
Members—know that it has been a crime. It is a waste of human
capacity and ability. I urge the Minister, in her response, to take on
board the fact that more needs to be done on disability and helping
disabled people into
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000046">Our
report made numerous specific recommendations, as the Chair of the

the situation would get worse, and it has. The coalition Government
have done a lot of work around the Harrington report, so it is better
than it was a few years ago, but the number of people coming down the

that is good enough. I never had the automatic loathing of Atos that a
lot of my constituents and the media have, because I know that we are
talking about a difficult task—and, frankly, Atos was appointed
by the previous Government. I had hoped that after the Harrington
report, Atos would improve and fewer clearly unsuitable people would be
passed. The situation is not good enough. I have come to the point
where I do not think that Atos is meeting its contract to a level with
which the Government should be satisfied. I urge the Minister to take a
serious look at that provider. I am seeing too many personal

other recommendation to which the Department did not respond involved
provision for unsuccessful participants. I have already mentioned the
people coming down the pipe after two years—two-year returners.
As the Chair of the Committee will know, we identified them as a
concern. I remember personally addressing the Secretary of State about
it a year or so ago, and asking for confirmation that a proper system
would be in place to manage the people who had not got a job after two
years and to keep them going in the direction of travel to get a job,
rather than just emphasising their sense of failure. I was given an

I get on extremely well with the middle managers there, who work

that there can be a rubbish service in one constituency because there
is no systemised instruction from on high, and a good one nearby
because an MP or councillor is enthusiastic about it, or the JCP has a
good manager. We must get service provision up to speed right now. I

In this very partisan place—I am not very keen on partisanship,

when we disagreed, we understood and supported the basic premise of the
Work programme, but we want to make it better. We want to make it work,
not only for the group of people who, after losing their job, are
turned around quickly, but for the challenging group of people who have
been stuck for a long time, and for the tens of thousands of people
with disabilities, who have tremendous resources and skills to give to
the country, which we need. If we do not give the right level of

share the Chair’s disappointment that the Government’s
response was so cursory and did not address many recommendations fully,
but we cannot blame the new Minister for that. I warmly welcome her to
her new role. I congratulate her on her appointment. I look forward to
debating these matters with her in the coming months. I hope that we
will get a little hint from her this afternoon that she recognises the
extent to which the Work programme is underperforming at the moment and
the fact that it needs change, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne said.
I am not denying that good things are happening in the Work programme,
but it is underperforming and needs change. We need to look for a major

Member for Eastbourne talked about those who had left the programme.
There were 74,630 people referred to the Work programme in its first
month, June 2011, but 53,720 of them returned to Jobcentre Plus after
two years without a job. That is a disappointing outcome after two
years’ effort. The hon. Member for Aberconwy is right to say
that the Work programme got off to a slow start, which was predicted
and could have been avoided, but unfortunately was not. I hope that we
will see a significantly better performance over the coming months, but
of those referred in that first month, more than 50,000 were badly
served, with a few of them getting only a couple of face-to-face
meetings and a phone call or two, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne
described. I am sure that is part of the reason why we saw such a big
rise in unemployment at that point.</hs_Para>

Select Committee is right to address key issues underpinning the
underperformance of the Work programme identified by the Chancellor.
The Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion has been commissioned to
carry out the official evaluation of the Work programme, and I think
that it will produce an interesting piece of work. In its analysis of
the 26 September on the most recent performance data, it points out
that two years in, the Work programme is not performing as well as the
flexible new deal. The percentage of those over 25 entering the
programme who secured a job in two years is 35%; it was 38.9% under the
flexible new deal. The Minister’s predecessor but two used to
castigate the flexible new deal. It turns out, according to CESI
observations, that it was better than the current programme.</hs_Para>

that would help, and that the Minister could do quickly, would be to
lift the ban on providers publishing data about what is going on in
their areas. The ban was introduced—let us be frank—to
safeguard the career prospects of the then Minister who introduced it,
to whom I recall that the present Minister was Parliamentary Private
Secretary, and in that it was successful. The right hon. Gentleman was
promoted to his current post in September 2012 and a few weeks later we
saw the first Work programme performance data, by which time he was
safely off the scene. The ban means that information about what works
well has been disseminated much too slowly and the underperformance
that concerns the Chancellor, and I suspect all of us, would have been
less if providers had been free to publish their performance data, as
they were in the past.</hs_Para>

we have still had nothing at all from the subcontractors. From that
quote, I want to pick up the point about user satisfaction, which the
Select Committee report also mentions. The Select Committee called,
quite rightly, for regular surveys of user satisfaction on the Work
programme, which would be valuable information. The 
<?notus-xml column=168?>“Open Public Services” White Paper had an effusive
foreword written by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister,
in which they signed up to its goals. We should understand
the user experience on the Work programme. The
Government’s response to that recommendation is simply to tell
us that there will be a couple of surveys of people who have been on
the Work programme. That is not what the White Paper stated was going
to happen. There should be much more information about what people are
experiencing. The fact that there is not is one of the reasons for the
underperformance that the Chancellor has pointed out.

hon. Member for Eastbourne was absolutely right to highlight concerns
about the performance of the Work programme for people on employment
and support allowance. The Work programme invitation to tender stated
that if nothing was done, 15% of those people would find a sustained
job outcome within two years. The minimum performance standard was set
at 10% above that, which is 16.5%. Paragraph 3.18 of the invitation to
tender
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13101070000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000102">“DWP

achieved, as the hon. Gentleman stated, 5.8%. The Royal National
Institute of Blind People tells me that 690 people with sight
impairments were referred to the Work programme in its first
22 months, and 20 of them got sustained job outcomes. St
Mungo’s has sent us a briefing for the debate, which tells us
that 54% of homeless people surveyed for St Mungo’s, Crisis and
Homeless Link reported seeing their Work programme adviser once a month
or less frequently. It is not surprising, therefore, that very few of
those who face serious hurdles—people with health problems and
people who are homeless—have got into work.</hs_Para>

Australia last week, where I talked to people about those issues. There
are quite a few providers that operate both in Australia and in the UK,
and they said that the Work programme model was wrong and that
“creaming and parking” was endemic; the hon. Member for
Eastbourne has touched on that. I agree with the Select Committee that
specialist voluntary sector providers have not been used enough. They
have been squeezed out. In Australia, I was told that 50% of provision
is from the voluntary sector, and I think in the Work programme it is
about 20% and going down. As others have said in this debate, some good
resources are not being utilised. St Mungo’s is a very good
example. It had a contract with several prime providers in London,
which was signed when the Work programme started in June 2011. By April
2012 it had not had a single referral, and it had to pull out and give
up.</hs_Para>

the suggestion that we should have a proper jobseeker classification
model, which we do not have at the moment. There are many things that
should be said, but I will conclude with this. The Chancellor of the
Exchequer is right: the programme is underperforming. The Minister, who
I welcome once again to her new role, has the opportunity to address
that underperformance. Some of it can be addressed quite quickly, and
the Select Committee report can be a real help. I wish  the
Minister well in her new role and I look forward  to her

this morning. I told them to watch the debate and listen to all the
contributions, because the Work programme is work in progress, and
there are things that they can take away from the debate. The comments
of the prime providers are quite pertinent, particularly as the hon.
Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth (Debbie Abrahams) mentioned low
skills and low aspirations. A representative from the Shaw Trust said
that they had been working in the field for 35 years, and the
system was the biggest and most rigorous ever; they had never been
monitored or measured so much. They took great pride in what they were
doing, the journey they were going on and how they were helping the

Serco, the Work programme must be viewed not over a year—that
would not be correct, because it is a two-year programme—but
within the five to seven-year cycle. A representative from Ingeus said
that the work was about helping people, and that, fundamentally,
individuals are being helped by people who care. They made the point
that people who work in the profession chose it, they know what they
are doing, and although it is tough, it is what they want to

the Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee has to speak, but before I
answer the many questions that have been asked, I want to emphasise
what a massive step change the Work programme has been. It is bold and
ambitious, and I want to set out the motivations behind it. When people
ask, “Is it failing?” that is fundamentally the wrong
question. To fail would be to do nothing at all. To fail would be to
leave people on benefits without even reaching out to them. I believe
that the fact that we are on a journey and we have to get it right must
be the start of success, and the Work programme must not be viewed from
a perspective of failure. We are on a journey together.</hs_Para>

board all the points that the Select Committee has made; some of them
drive a hard message home, and we must listen to them. The Work
programme is evolving as we speak. What did we have before the Work
programme? Hon. and right hon. Members have talked about the
performance of various previous programmes, but I have different
statistics. Those programmes covered a different mix of claimants,
using a different measure, in a different time frame. Pathways to work
can be classed as a failure because they could not have been rolled out
nationally; they would have had zero positive impact if they had been.
The previous approach was piecemeal, and people tried and failed to get
it right. We have to continue with what we are doing now and make sure
it works.</hs_Para>

individuals who are on the Work programme are the hardest to help. When
I looked at their journey, I saw that out of every 100 people who go on
to jobseeker’s

That core group of people—approximately 10 out of every
100—will end up on the Work programme. Those are the people whom
we are trying to support, and it is a difficult task. I have talked
about the length of the contract and how we are continually refining
it. Our approach is about continual improvement; we have to work with

Select Committee, the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg),

Chair talked about the annual underspend being held back, but the
system does not work like that. We have negotiated a sum of money, and
the programme is about performance-related payment on results. We have

about the flexibility of the system, we have to understand the people
we are talking about well. I hate using such words, but there has to be
multi-segmentation or multi-differentiation. We have to look at health
and other conditions, including attitudinal factors, and anything that
holds people back. We are doing that, not only with people who have
been in prison, but with those who have had addictions. We are also
helping and working with them, which adds to what we are

improvements made since the report came out are key, and I must
acknowledge the work of my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for

the report came out in November 2012, the results of the adaptations he
made, including the new pilots, can be seen in the numbers that are

want to pick up a couple of points made by my hon. Friend the Member
for Eastbourne (Stephen Lloyd). He mentioned the attachment fee, but
there is a fundamental misunderstanding about what it is and what it is
for. It was designed to provide cash flow in the early years to get
businesses going and to support providers, but that money was only ever
given on the basis of payment by results. There was therefore nothing
that, as he would see it, could be moved round or taken elsewhere. I

hon. Friend is quite right that we in the coalition Government are
doing the right things. He mentioned relations between employers,
employees and the Government, and people must understand what we can do
as the Government, what employers can do to provide jobs, and what I
hope employees can do. We are actively engaged in a two-year Disability
Confident campaign with 430 employers across the country, including 35
of the FTSE 100 companies. It involves asking what we can do, and we
should all get involved with it. From the point of view of spending,
people talk about the figure of £80 billion, and the purple
pound or the disability pound. We should ask what companies can do,
including with would-be employees and their
families and the 
<?notus-xml column=171?>extended community. That is something we are looking at, and it is
positive that 1.4 million new private sector jobs have been provided,
as have 1 million new apprenticeships. It needs to be put on the record
that everything my hon. Friend is doing in Eastbourne totally reflects
what the coalition Government are
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000087">My
hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) mentioned a key point
about how we can help people in north Wales who would not otherwise
receive full support, and how we can ensure that we are not preventing
people from receiving additional support. We are actively involved with
and talking to the devolved Governments to see what can be done. The
key factors are flexibility and engagement with employers, as well as
getting segmentation to work, so that individuals’ particular
needs are given
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000088">Another
key factor is the new enterprise allowance and how it fits with the
Work programme—a point that has been mentioned. It does work,
although not exactly in the same way. There is flexibility in the Work
programme, so support can be given by providers to encourage people to
set up in business. I wanted to ensure that that was the case and,
fortunately, because this is fundamentally about people, I have some
examples. They both involve people called Emma, so if someone’s
name is Emma and they are on the Work programme and want to set up a
business, it looks as though they have a high chance of success. Emma
King said that she had never thought about setting up in business
before, but now has, having been supported by A4e. Her goal now is to
get other people like her into work. Emma Thompson, whose home is in
Anfield, has said that if she had not met Dawne, who helped her through
the Work programme, she would not now have her own business and would
not be on a totally different path, one on which she feels she has
self-esteem and self-confidence and can look after
herself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0001.htm#13101070000089">Another
key point made by the hon. Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth was
about people’s low esteem in starting-off or primary jobs, but
in most instances the process is about getting promotion from those
jobs, and the question is what we can do to get people through that
process. Getting a job is the start of a journey, but getting a better
or improved job is another. Some of the people we have worked
with—including young men who have just got a child, and who have
never worked before or never had a job—have some very positive
stories about how they have got on the ladder, got through the process
and got a good outcome through their own drive and the support of the
Work
programme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0002.htm#13101070000090">I
am painting some of the positive stories, and it is correct to do so.
We appreciate that some things have not worked as well as they might
have done, but we have been on a journey together. As I said, this is
the biggest ever programme of its kind, and it has taken time, effort
and energy. We have used the whole notion of transparency, and decided
to have a black-box approach, because that would give flexibility to
providers, particularly at the start of their journey, so that they
could better understand people’s needs and see what they could
do with the money. However, there are measurements, processes and
monitoring within the system, and because we need to reach out to those
who are hardest to help, there is 
<?notus-xml column=172?>also a payment structure so that the most difficult to support get the
appropriate amount of money. All that is being developed at the
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0002.htm#13101070000091">We
therefore take it fairly and squarely on the chin when we are asked
whether the Work programme is working, and whether we are working with
the hardest-to-reach people. We are now asking people and key providers
to get back to us on which issues they found the most difficult, and to
tell us what support we need to give them. Yes, a lot is being done,
but there is still a lot to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101070000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0002.htm#13101070000092">The
Work programme is not perfect, but it is a major step forward in
supporting some of those who are hardest to help. I want to make sure
that the programme reaches its full potential, and I am committed to
fixing the bits that do not work. Many questions to me today have been
about whether we are committed to doing that, and we certainly are.
Another question raised was about culture and leadership. Transparency
is key, as is bold ambition, hard work and determination to reach out
to those who most need our help, and I give a commitment to those
things
today.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13101070000108" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/halltext/131010h0002.htm#13101070000108">4.28

has been quite a lot of agreement across the party political divide.
Much of what the hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) said reflected
comments from members of the Select Committee. He waxed lyrical about
the youth contract, which is not of course part of the Work programme,
but helps to illustrate that there is a need for specialist help,
including for more specialist help to be directed to certain people.
Both he and my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham East and Saddleworth
(Debbie Abrahams) said that there is a real problem with the rigidity
of Work programme rules, meaning that access to training can be quite
difficult, even when it is available. The Committee was certainly clear
that such access is needed.</hs_Para>

Member for Aberconwy mentioned that some people should have early
referrals, but that would of course require a proper classification

recommendation was to extend referrals for some clients. Both the hon.

Oldham East and Saddleworth mentioned the failure of the work

across member states against illegal shipments of waste and would like
to strengthen the requirements for enforcement. The Commission has
issued a proposal to amend the regulation to require competent
authorities to prepare and publish inspection plans. The amendments
would introduce provisions for competent authorities to request proof
from an exporter where it was suspected that they were exporting waste
in the guise of a product in order to evade the controls, and also to
request evidence that material exported for recovery had been recovered
in an environmentally sound manner in the destination country. The
amendments would also allow the Commission to adopt delegated acts on
technical and organisational requirements for the practical
implementation of electronic data interchange for the submission of
documents and information. The UK supports the principle of
strengthening the enforcement of the regulations, but has concerns
about some of the detail in the
proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13101058000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/wmstext/131010m0001.htm#13101058000046">After

in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider
(called an ‘finished admission episode’) it is only
mandatory to input diagnosis codes up to the fourth character and while

around desinewed meat (DSM) arose in 2012 due to a difference in
interpretation of the definition of mechanically separated meat (MSM)
in European Union Food Law between the United Kingdom and European
Commission. This was identified by the Commission's Food and Veterinary
Office (FVO) during a routine programmed audit of UK official controls
on MSM. The UK DSM moratorium was introduced in spring 2012 to align UK
policy with the Commission's interpretation.</hs_Para>

the position in the rest of the EU, the FVO carried out audits of MSM
controls in Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands during the
remainder of 2012, and in Denmark, Spain and Poland in spring 2013. The
reports of these audits, with the exception of that undertaken in
Poland, have been published. The reports reveal that the FVO identified
instances of mislabelled poultry and pork MSM which, in one member
state, was the result of a centrally-agreed approach. The reports also
show that the FVO found no evidence of the production of MSM from the
bones of cattle, sheep or goats which is prohibited under EU
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy legislation.</hs_Para>

introducing the DSM moratorium, the Government has continually pressed
the European Commission to ensure a level EU playing field and to take
the same approach to dealing with any non-compliance identified by the

roadworthiness test requirements for caravans. Additionally the
Department does not support the European Parliament's Transport

benefits are considered negligible. We are yet to make a substantive
assessment of the costs as the proposal is subject to significant
change in scope. Moreover it is my intention that we will continue to
strongly oppose such a measure. The police conduct roadside checks on
caravans if they have concerns as to their roadworthiness.</hs_Para>

Robertson:</Member></B> Rihanna Al Mosawi was charged with activities
relating to terrorism following her arrest on 20 April 2013 at the
Grand Prix circuit. On 16 July the main opposition party in Bahrain
issued a statement regarding Rihanna Al Mosawi, in which it was
detailed that the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) had started an
investigation into allegations she had been mistreated while in
detention. Part of the investigation included being checked by a
forensic doctor. We believe the SIU investigation is now closed, and
there have been no further allegations of mistreatment. The UK takes
all allegations of mistreatment against detainees seriously. We expect
the Government of Bahrain to meet all of its human rights obligations
and adhere to international standards.</hs_Para>

working on the ground in DRC with other donors and the UN Mission to
integrate the PSVI into health and security sector programmes. Specific
examples are an expert in a hospital in eastern DRC and funding to
teach new Congolese army recruits about human rights, including the
fight against sexual violence and impunity. We are also pressing for a
strengthened Sexual Violence Unit within the UN Mission to lead the UN
wider effort in country to tackle sexual violence. However, it is vital
that the DRC leads the efforts to tackle sexual violence. To that end,
we welcome the DRC's endorsement of the Declaration of Commitment to
End Sexual Violence in Conflict, launched by the Secretary of State at
the UN General Assembly last month. The Declaration has been endorsed

their real concerns about the way payday lenders can access money from
their customers' bank accounts using continuous payment authorities
(CPA). As part of a concerted plan for tackling the key problems in
this market, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) have been taking strong
action on non-compliant payday lenders as a top enforcement priority.

actions, but as a result of them since March we have seen 25 lenders
exit the payday lending

report published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
on 3 October on the payday industry's codes of practice provides
additional evidence of poor compliance by lenders in meeting their code
commitments on increased transparency for consumers around the use of
CPA. Government therefore welcomes tough new proposals announced by the
Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)—the new consumer credit
regulator from April 2014—to impose a cap of no more than two
attempts using CPA to take loan repayment and a ban on part payments to
stop lenders ‘fishing’ and clearing out borrowers'
accounts.</hs_Para>

by the Student Loans Company (SLC) shows that around 36% of cases were
deemed ineligible for residency or age; a further 35% were where either
the provider or course were not approved for loan funding ; around 23%
were related to learning duration/course duplication and the remaining
6% were for arrears on a previous

(QDS) returns of all 17 Departments participating in the QDS process
were delayed owing to the development of the Cabinet Office's
Government Interrogating Spending Tool (GIST). The GIST , was developed
in response to recommendations made in Dr Martin Read's
independent report entitled 'Practical Steps to Improve Management
Information in Government'. The GIST is an online tool that allows the
public to access a breakdown of government expenditure
through the Gov.UK website. It makes the process of
accessing and analysing complex QDS and OSCAR data easier and quicker,
and for these reasons was seen to justify a short delay in publishing
QDS

invested £665,042 to enhance the space efficiency of Temple Quay

occupy space in the facility as part the wider Government Regional
Estates Strategy. The project realised property cost reductions of-
around £800,000 per annum. DCLG invested £218,022 in
consolidating the space it held at Lateral House, Leeds, freeing-up
space for other Government Departments to use. The investment has
resulted in annual property cost reductions of around £1.5
million for DCLG. DCLG has invested £68,000 in consolidating the
space it held at Hemel Hempstead. The Department is currently
re-negotiating a smaller office footprint with the landlord, which will
deliver farther efficiency savings. DCLG has invested £14,570 in
consolidating the space it and other Government Departments held in St
Philips Place in Birmingham, improving the space efficiency of the
building for DCLG and wider Government, securing additional sub-let

including factors such as topography, the local environment and 
<?notus-xml column=397?>nearby land uses. This is why it is important to
think about in what circumstances proposals are likely to be acceptable
and plan on this

running a national advertising campaign aimed at informing employees
since just before the automatic enrolment policy was launched in
October 2012. To date, this has included four bursts of television
advertising, radio, press and digital display advertising, social media
and 'out of home' advertising. The latest published tracking research

Webb:</Member></B> Short term benefit advances (STBA) are only payable
in very specific circumstances at the start of a claim or where there
has been a change of circumstances resulting in a significant increase
in benefit. STBAs are not payable in any other circumstances, including
where the claimant says they have had their money stolen or say they
have lost it. Where benefit cannot yet be paid and the claimant
satisfies the conditions for receiving an STBA, including that they are
in financial need, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will
consider an STBA. DWP does signpost claimants to other services
(including foodbanks) if it cannot help, but will always consider
whether it has provision (including through STBAs) first.</hs_Para>

quantitative terms, the principal means of monitoring changes in morale
within the services is the Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey
(AFCAS). The findings of the AFCAS are used extensively in shaping
policy for terms and conditions of service. The results of the 2013
survey were published on 25 July 2013 and the full survey can be found

the 2013 survey, 39% of military personnel described their morale as
“high”, 32% as “neutral” and 29% as
“low”. The recommendations of the Strategic Defence and
Security Review have necessitated a series of difficult decisions,
including reshaping our armed forces as we move towards “'Future
Force 2020”. While issues such as headcount reductions and pay
restraint have inevitably had an impact on morale, I continue to be
impressed by the absolute dedication of our military
personnel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101081000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/text/131010w0003.htm#13101081000050">A

Soubry:</Member></B> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) uses data from the
Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey (AFCAS) to assess the level of
employment among the spouses and partners of armed forces personnel.
The AFC AS 2013 survey indicated that 72% of service personnel partners
or spouses were in employment. This included 22% who classed their
spouses or partners 
<?notus-xml column=411?>as part-time workers, but there is no data to
indicate the extent of any underemployment. No data are collected on
other family
members.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101081000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/text/131010w0003.htm#13101081000131">The
MOD appreciates that the mobile nature of Service life can create a
particular difficulty for working partners who may have to give up
their own jobs to accompany service personnel on postings. The Armed
Forces Covenant recognises that families should not face disadvantage
compared to other citizens, and Government measures taken to ensure
this include working with Jobcentre Plus Armed Forces champions to
assist service families find employment, and changes to rules for
accessing Jobcentre Plus benefits and
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101081000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/text/131010w0003.htm#13101081000132">As
part of the New Employment Model, the MOD is looking to support
domestic stability and support partners' employment. The impact of
service careers on family personal life and their partner's employment
are consistently cited in the AFCAS as the top two reasons that
increase the service person's intention to leave. In April 2013, the
MOD started a two-year partner employment project to better understand
the issues surrounding partner employment and to develop proposals to
support
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101081000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/text/131010w0003.htm#13101081000133">We

Laws:</Member></B> We are committed to delivering our
vision as stated in the White Paper ‘The Importance of
Teaching’, published on 24 November 2010. This set out the
Government's commitment to end the disparity in funding for 16 to
18-year-olds so that from the academic year 2015-16, schools and
colleges will be funded at the same level as one another for
like-for-like provision. We moved schools on to the same national
funding rate as colleges in the academic year 2011-12 and put in place
transitional protection for four years, to give schools time to adapt
to the new funding regime. The transitional protection will cease at
the end of 2014-15, and funding for institutions offering similar
provision to similar students will then be the same.</hs_Para>

existed to prevent schools putting school buildings on playing fields.
Schools could build over playing fields with impunity without seeking
consent. This led to the disappearance of thousands of playing
fields—Fields in Trust (formerly The National Playing Field
Association) estimated 2,540 playing fields, or 26 sites a month, were
lost between 1997 and 2005. This Government has introduced protection
for playing fields where there were none before. Schools and local
authorities now have to seek permission if they want to change the use
of public playing fields by putting school buildings on them. We now
require schools to apply for consent even where the buildings are being

remain part of local private finance deals. The contract remains
between the local authority and the private finance contractor; the
academy pays the local authority its share of the cost of the deal
under an agreement made at the time of conversion. The Government has
no plans to change these
arrangements.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13101083000012" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/text/131010w0004.htm#13101083000012">Sixth Form

Laws:</Member></B> There are no extra funding
elements for insurance in the funding formula for education of 16 to
19-year-olds for any institution, including academies. Local
authorities often arrange insurance for the schools they maintain, with
the consent of those schools through the schools forum. Academies, as
individual institutions, have to arrange their own insurance cover.
That is why we have included an element for insurance in the pre-16
funding allocations for academies, to assist them with those costs.
Academies are not given any extra funding for insurance in the funding
they receive for their 16 to 19-year-old
students.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13101083000013" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131010/text/131010w0004.htm#13101083000013">Special
