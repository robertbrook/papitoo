Minister to the Dispatch Box for her first Oral Question and warmly
congratulate her on that Answer. With the number of people travelling
by train now higher than at any time in the history of Britain’s
railways, with growth over the past five years running at 5%, does she
agree with Network Rail’s assessment that a make-do-and-mend
approach to the main lines built by our Victorian ancestors would
require 2,770 weekend closures, endless bus substitutions and increased
journey times over 14 years, and do little for economic growth for our
great cities outside

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, I could not agree more with the noble
Lord. I would also say that the benefit-cost ratio for HS2 assumes a
growth in rail demand of 2.2% while, as he has said, the actual growth
in demand over recent years has been much closer to 5%, which would
significantly increase that cost-benefit case. Capacity is the issue;
the alternatives just do not offer the scale. For example, HS2 will
deliver over 13,000 peak hour seats to west coast destinations compared
to just 3,000 for the
alternatives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:22:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:22:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Berkeley" PimsId="3972" UID="13103169000596" xid="1072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000596">Lord
Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, how many years of closure at
weekends or at other times of the three main lines going north from
London would be required to meet the demand of passengers and
freight—and freight will double in the next 20 years—if
that was to be a substitute for HS2? I declare an interest as chairman

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, we would be looking at something like 14
years of weekend closures, which is extraordinary disruption. That
assumes a very aggressive construction schedule of two simultaneous
schemes on each route at any one time. If it was done in a more usual
pattern, there would be even more weekends of closures. The question of
freight is a serious one, because the alternatives would not add a
single additional freight path on the southern section of the west
coast main line, whereas, by transferring long distance passengers to
HS2, there is a possibility of up to 20 additional freight paths on
that same congested set of
lines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:23:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Palmer" PimsId="91" UID="13103169000598" xid="1378" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000598">Lord

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall reply only briefly, because this
wanders away from the topic of the Question. The important issue is
that we need significant investment in the east coast main line. The
Government and DOR have done an excellent job of stabilising the
service; we look to the future and to investment and growth. That is
why the Government are making the decision to move ahead with the
franchise, to provide a far better and improved service in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:24:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:23:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Bradshaw" PimsId="2261" UID="13103169000600" xid="1089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000600">Lord

spent £24 million in acquiring a property the value of which is
expected to rise when Crossrail is opened? The HS2 route will see
significant rises in value but these are neither credited to the scheme
in the economic assessment nor captured by the public purse. Is any

Kramer:</Member></B> My noble friend Lord Bradshaw is right that the
economic case is looked at within fairly tightly defined contours.
There are many additional benefits. My noble friend Lord Deighton is
working on making sure that the growth potential of HS2 is 
<?notus-xml column=1677?>absolutely maximised. My noble friend made the point that there is an
uplift in value. My goodness, we have seen that around places like
King’s Cross/St Pancras, at the stations on the Jubilee line and
in the benefits to Canary Wharf. That economic uplift has not
traditionally been captured to help fund infrastructure. We will look
closely at ways to do that in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:25:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Snape" PimsId="749" UID="13103169000602" xid="1696" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000602">Lord
Snape (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister accept that the
problems on the east coast main line are due to the shoddy way in which
electrification took place in the 1980s, a fact that Ministers at the
time boasted about? Electrification masts were more widely spaced, and
the catenary of lightweight construction means that it blows down in
anything above a summer breeze. These matters have nothing to do with
the train-operating companies. The Minister’s welcome response
about the future of HS2 today ought to be answered by those in my own
party, some of whom appear to be more interested in playing politics
than worrying about the future of our railway
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:26:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kramer" PimsId="5891" UID="13103169000603" xid="2104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000603">Baroness
Kramer:</Member></B> Again, I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord
Snape, wanders away from the subject of today, but it is crucial to
understand that when HS2 goes forward, it does not mean we are stopping
other transport investment on crucial lines. As he will know, in the
next Parliament £73 billion has been committed to transport
improvements and only £17 billion of that goes on HS2. Definite
improvements are scheduled for the east coast. Since that is away from
the topic, I will not pursue those today—and I cannot find them
under my tab. I will write to the noble Lord in
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:27:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Cormack" PimsId="5885" UID="13103169000604" xid="2099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000604">Lord

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government—and
I—regard HS2 as a vital project. As I said, the underlying
rationale is capacity. We are out of capacity on critical lines going
north out of London and those are essential for the economy. We must
also continue to build the economy of the north of England rather than
just constantly focus on the south. I believe that the project has
found a good balance between the environmental challenges—of
course, they are many—and value for money. This is an absolutely
essential project and most of those in this House who specialise and

First, I am bound to say in all humility that my figures do not agree

lower than under the previous years of the Labour Government. Further,
if, as under the Help to Buy home ownership scheme, money is to be made
more easily available for purchases but there is no significant
increase in supply, prices are bound to go up without anyone
benefiting. Is that not

the criteria used to judge whether somebody can afford their mortgage

to death. He was force-fed, and the purpose of his application to be
transferred back to an ordinary prison was so that he could starve
himself to death without being force-fed.

sympathy for Mr Brady, although it has to be said that he has been
judged to be medically ill. Our law says that in those cases the mental
health review tribunal is part of the process of our legal system and
that a patient is entitled to a tribunal hearing, as set out in Part V
of the Mental Health Act 1983. We cannot have one law for those we find
worthy and another law for those we do not like. In some ways, it is

only two such cases in recent times. I am speaking off brief at the
moment, but it seems unfair that a single health authority should take
such a disproportionate hit on something that is really a national
matter. However, the rules as they now apply are that the Ministry of
Justice takes the state costs through the Legal Aid Agency and the
health authority concerned takes the hit with regard to costs. The

Ramsbotham (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
reply, but letters from experienced chief executives of probation
trusts directly to a Secretary of State suggest a worrying lack of
trust in the system between them. Behind those letters is an
understandable concern about the current timetable in which chief
executives were required to start work on 28 October, three days ago,
on a realignment process for their staff that has to be completed by 31
January 2014, including the confirmation of outcomes for all their
staff. However, despite frequent requests, as of yesterday they had not
been provided with any details of the number of posts, the workload or
the resources on which they can base any assessment, let alone
allocation. Apparently, much depends on a risk assessment process that
has yet to be resolved. When will these details be available, and why
will the Secretary of State not agree to a reasonable and sensible
request for
delay?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000050"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:45:11"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13103169000639" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000639"><B>Lord

learnt, including from some past mistakes. We have put aside
money to allow would-be entrants, particularly in the voluntary sector,
to prepare for bids. My impression is that we are
tapping into a large unused resource. Let us never lose sight of what
we are bringing forward. The part of the bargain that really excites me
is that we are going to be able to give help, support and
rehabilitation measures to those who are sentenced to less
than 12 months, the very sector which includes some of the most
prolific reoffenders. This is a rehabilitation revolution. Although
transfer and change are always difficult, we have this on track.
However, in answer to the original Question asked by the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham—and I know the care with which he takes an

there is the firing of a gun. Some of these things have been in track
for months and indeed years, and will continue in progress after
October, after next April and after the October after that. We are
managing change in a very important sector, whereas the Question
implies that public safety must be paramount. The idea that we are
somehow firing a gun and everybody rushes off ignores the reality of
some careful preparation which is under

remarks will focus mainly on the bedroom tax which I have raised
through Oral and Written Questions previously but which, given its
pernicious effects, needs to be aired at every opportunity until,
hopefully, the Government see the error of their ways. However it is
important to set the bedroom tax within the wider housing and economic
context, and this debate gives us the opportunity to do so. For
example, it needs to be set against the overall and desperate shortage
of affordable homes, which was referred to in Oral Questions today. It
also needs to be set against the problems in the private rented sector
at a time when private rents are soaring and there is a crying need for
the sector to be better regulated, something which I know my noble

occasions.</hs_para>

bedroom tax has now been in operation for more than six months. This
is, therefore, a good opportunity to examine, as far as we can tell,
what its effects have been. Some problems with the policy were apparent
from the start, but others have emerged more clearly over time. For a
start, we know that the Government’s thinking behind introducing
the tax was the need, as they saw it, to free up housing to allow those
in overcrowded accommodation to find suitable homes. The Government
made much of the figure that overall a quarter of a million people
lived in overcrowded accommodation, and contrasted this with the
estimated million so-called spare bedrooms. However, the problem was
that there was a complete mismatch between the areas of the country
where there was overcrowding and those areas where there was
underoccupancy, so that this often quoted overall figure was largely

6,000 people were affected by the bedroom tax while only 70 properties
were available to move into. I could quote many other examples from

Wales has been repeatedly referred to in this House. Certainly the

an opportunity to better understand the proposals. There are many
issues surrounding the area of welfare. Not least is the responsibility
of government to ensure that all benefits are dispensed in a way that
is fair to both the taxpayer and the recipients. We can all understand
the frustrations of those who rise early, work all day and find that
some of their neighbours on benefits appear to live a comparatively
comfortable life without any of the hassle. Any welfare system should
therefore be equally fair to those who pay into it and those who
receive it.

I want to concentrate on just one small point. With life expectancy
increasing, many elderly, and indeed very elderly, people live alone
and are able to live independent lives. This is certainly the case for
many women who are more often than not the ones left behind. They have
raised their families in the same home and then, when their children
have flown and the hustle and bustle gone, they can find themselves
living alone in a property too large for their needs. This happened to
me and I was then able to buy a smaller property, cut down on bills and
“downsize”. For anyone living in social housing, this can
be much more difficult and the choice has simply not been
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000082">I want
to encourage choice and I was therefore pleased to see that pensioners
are not subject to the spare room charge. So, if it is their wish to
continue to live in their accommodation, they may do so. However,
should they prefer, councils will support social tenants who wish to
downsize. There continues to be funding for an action team within the
Chartered Institute of Housing, which works with all social landlords
to help them to promote moves. It seems to me that for an elderly
person struggling with the upkeep of surplus rooms, that could be
hugely welcome. Such a scheme would not only encourage choice and make
it possible for a person to move to a smaller home but it would release
a property for a large family with all its
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000083">I was

George Young<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>. In
the 1990s, as Housing Minister, he said that we should subsidise
people, not property. Housing benefit, he assured us, would take the

the bedroom tax is the
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000086">The
Government claim that the housing benefit bill is high because tenants
occupy over-large property that should instead go to families who are
overcrowded or on the waiting list, thus saving £490 million a
year. 
<?notus-xml column=1690?>That is not true—none of it. Let us unpick it. Families are
overcrowded because other tenants do not trade down? False. As my noble
friend said, outside London that is not a problem. The DCLG’s
own statistics show that there are far fewer overcrowded families than
underoccupying families by a ratio of about 1:6. The Government do not
need to do this. Helping pensioners who want to downsize, but now will
not be able to, would sort

claim is that the bedroom tax will help waiting lists—false.
Some 80% of those on waiting lists are single people or young couples
without children also requiring one-bedroomed flats. However, they will
now, as the Scottish report showed, wait twice as long because
underoccupiers will take priority for that accommodation. This applies
similarly to the homeless—mostly single vulnerable
people—and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Seccombe, rightly
mentioned, pensioners. They, too, need and want the smaller properties
that will be made artificially scarce because of the bedroom tax, and
it will be harder to help
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000088">We
simply do not have single-bedroomed properties, as two-bedroomed homes

one-bedroomed properties to let but 2,500 tenants underoccupying and
nearly 7,000 households on the waiting list for a one-bedroomed
property. A similar situation applies in Leicester. Reports from
Scotland and Wales show that it will take years for underoccupiers to
trade down within the social sector. Three-bedroomed homes are now
standing empty, taking 50% longer to let, and some in the north may be
boarded up, while families with children or disabled families who want
to live in them are forced into scarce smaller property that other
people—pensioners, those on the waiting list and the
homeless—want and now will not

says Esther McVey brightly, “Convert three-bedroomed houses into
two flats, double up kitchens and bathrooms, build external staircases,
increase sound insulation, and provide car parking and external
storage”. It costs £70,000 or more, excluding land,
outside London to build a new home. Further, you cannot adapt a mid-
terrace house. You cannot adapt post-1960s houses as their rooms end up
too small by DCLG standards, and many built before 1960 have been sold.

absurd.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000090">Two-thirds

There are people with epilepsy, Huntington’s,
Parkinson’s, severe asthma, who as couples need separate

break their health as well. They have committed no offence. They have
lived difficult lives, yet we are now punishing some of the poorest and

40,000 of the 660,000 affected by the bedroom tax may end up on DHPs.
The extra money found by the department might extend to just 60,000 or
10%. The Government insist that tenants downsize to make way for people
who do not want the 
<?notus-xml column=1691?>larger homes they have left. However, at the same time the Government
hypocritically expect to make their savings precisely because 90% of
underoccupying tenants do not do what the Government
state—move—but do what the Government actually want: stay

recent ALMO survey finds a 24% increase in empty property and that 65%

been sent eviction notices and just 8% qualify for DHPs—so now
what? I declare an interest as chair of a housing association. If we as
social landlords do not evict, arrears soar, and the social landlord
goes into the red and into special measures. If we do evict, where do
tenants go—into our smaller accommodation? We do not have it.
Perhaps into the private rented sector, where the rent of one-bedroomed
flats is higher than that of the two-bedroomed flats they have left.
That is if a landlord will take them, if they have the money for
deposits, and the money for moving costs. With children, they may go
into B&amp;B at huge cost and distress, or if single, sofa-surf until
they end up on the streets. Some tenants may return as vulnerable into
hard-to-let, unwanted—guess what—three-bedroomed

the less, the Government insist that the bedroom tax will produce

that 90% will stay and take the hit and that just 10% will
move. The ALMO survey shows instead that only 60%, not 90%
want to stay and pay. Let us assume that 70% stay—between the
two figures, I think that that is realistic—and that 30% go,
most going into higher-cost private renting. Add in the cost of voids,

has rightly been specific criticism of the previous Government for
reducing the stock of social housing by 420,000 units. This is because

to affordability, house prices are rising again and we may be at the
start of yet another housing bubble in some parts of the country.
Funding for lending and help to buy provides cheaper credit to boost
sales, but the underlying problem is lack of supply. House building is
half of what it needs to be to match the rate of household formation

happening to demand on the funds and take action as necessary. Many
tenants who are subject to the new underoccupancy rules want to move to
a smaller home, but they cannot do so because the smaller home does not
exist. In my view, the charge should not apply where there is nowhere

forward is to give local councils greater flexibility to meet demand
for smaller accommodation in their areas. To do this, the Government
should see councils as part of the solution and progressively remove
the housing borrowing cap imposed on local councils, relying instead on
the existing prudential borrowing code under the Local Government
Act 2003, which guarantees that only sustainable housing
investment would get the go-ahead. Councils could raise a further
£4.2 billion above their current £2.8 billion borrowing
headroom and they could build up to 60,000 more homes over the next
five years. It will not be enough if the only action the Government
take is to give permission to pool the existing £2.8 billion
headroom to make sure that it all gets
spent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000107">Since
last year, April 2012, council housing has been self-financing. The
average debt on a council home is only £17,000, so there is
plenty of scope for safe additional borrowing against the asset of the
existing stock. In addition, we should note that across Europe, trading
accounts such as these are not seen as part of a Government’s
borrowing. They are not related to the deficit or to debt. The UK, for
reasons that are never satisfactorily explained, uses a much wider
definition of public debt than any other country in Europe. The
consequence is that we are not building as much social housing as we
could. The aim of making better use of the existing social housing
stock, which is the aim of the Government, can be done only if
sufficient numbers of smaller properties are made available for those
affected to move into. ALMOs in particular are in a good position to
develop small plots for one- and two-bedroomed
accommodation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000108">Research
is to be undertaken into the impact of the underoccupancy charge. I

available in 2014, although I do not know which end of 2014 that might
be; earlier rather than later, I hope. There is then to be a final
report late in 2015, which means that we are 
<?notus-xml column=1694?>two years away from the final report actually being produced. I hope
sincerely that we are not expected to wait for two years before
anything is changed because there is enough evidence now, and into the

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Quin
for initiating this debate. I will dwell largely on the broader housing
side, as did the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, but wanted to say something
first about the bedroom tax, spare room charge or whatever we care to
call it. Some evidence that I do not think has yet been cited comes
from the National Federation of ALMOs, which has done a survey of
council and ALMO-run properties. It found that arrears among those
affected have already almost doubled—there has been an increase
of almost 27 percentage points in the numbers in arrears. Of those
affected, only 13% were prepared to consider moving and only 2% have
actually done so. In other words, for a policy that is supposed to free
up property for more appropriate use, a very low level of achievement
has been recorded. As other noble Lords have said, and as the noble
Baroness, Lady Maddock, said during Question Time—I am afraid
that the Minister did not give her an adequate reply—the reality
is that there is no alternative accommodation for these people to move
into in most parts of our country. Of those surveyed by the federation,
some said it would take up to 14 years to put people in appropriate
housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:31:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000112">However,
this is not only about the nonsense of the bedroom tax. Behind all
this, there are chronic problems with housing and with affordable
housing in particular. The term “affordable” is of course
difficult to define. I declare an interest in that, last year, I
chaired an inquiry for an organisation called Housing Voice, which
produced a report to try to push housing up the political agenda. I
think that we, along with others, have succeeded in doing that. The
definition that we used then
was,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13103169000525" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000525">“comfortable,

have been more specific, saying that it should not cost the household

income.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13103169000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000113">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:32:38"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Government and the powers that be have used the word
“affordable” in an entirely different way. In an affront
to the meaning of the English language, the term
“affordable housing” in the social housing
sector is used, in Newspeak, to mean charging what are, for many social
tenants, totally unaffordable rents. In more general usage,
there is a chronic lack of affordability not just in the social housing
sector but across all 
<?notus-xml column=1695?>tenures of housing. Rents and prices are rising in all housing sectors
and in all parts of the country—the issue affects our inner
cities and our rural areas, young families seeking a mortgage for the
first time, leaseholders, private tenants and those in social housing.
Above all, it affects the young and those who are in the wrong kind of
housing because of family
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:33:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000114">The
situation reflects a long-term failure to build housing, which as the
noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said, has continued under successive
Governments for many years, with new housebuilding running at less than
half the rate of household
formation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
particularly acute towards the affordable end of the market and was, I
am afraid to say, greatly aggravated in the early days of the coalition
Government when they deliberately slashed government support for
affordable social housing by nearly two-thirds. They have belatedly
introduced policies to offset that, but it was a severe blow, which has
meant that recovery and improvement in the total level of housebuilding
is even further
off<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:33:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000115">I
have to say to noble Lords opposite that, to some extent, among their
ranks and in some of the coverage in the newspapers that support them,
there is a deep prejudice against tenants of social housing. That has
led to measures that are hitting social housing and, in particular but
not exclusively, those who are on benefits. That has been compounded by
aggravating and detailed interventions such as the bedroom tax. This
combination of factors has already led, as noble Lords have said, to
severe distress and threatens serious social and communal dislocation.
Other things have affected the situation and will, in future, affect it
even more, such as the move to the default position of payment to
tenants rather than to landlords. Although there is some justification
for that, particularly in the private rented sector, it means that
housing associations’ income and creditworthiness is less
assured and they are therefore less able to raise money to build new
homes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:35:07"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
private rented sector, the refusal to regulate private landlords is
leading to soaring rents and inadequate conditions in large parts of
the burgeoning private rented sector, not least here in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:35:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000116">All
this is, naturally, leading more people to claim housing benefit and
more people to claim a larger amount of housing benefit, reflecting
their housing costs. The Government are right to point to
this escalating cost of housing benefit as being a major problem in the
welfare bill. However, that has led them to the wrong
conclusion. Instead of tackling the increase in housing benefit
expenditure as a reflection of dysfunction in the housing market, they
have treated it as a dysfunction of the welfare system. That has led
them down exactly the opposite road to the one which they should be
going down. Part of the real solution, which I have been advocating for
some time in this House and elsewhere, would be for housing in central
government to be placed in the hands of one Minister and the resources
available for housing benefit to be put together with those available
in CLG. That way, we could have a strategic approach to housing demand
and supply and match them more substantially. As the noble Lord, Lord
Shipley, said, the other part of this would be to give councils and
local authorities the responsibility for strategic delivery of housing
right across the board in their
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:36:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

have recognised the need to build more houses and have introduced some
policies that they say are going to lead to that, nothing has yet been

its actual text, there are harsher words than that. Although the Help
to Buy policy has helped a number of people into the housing market,
and has undoubtedly had the political effect of reassuring existing
homeowners that the market value of their property is going up and
giving them a warm feeling about that, there is no point pouring money
into the demand side if you do not match it with policies to deliver
the supply to meet that demand. All that will
happen—particularly in the high-stress areas, but right across
the country, as we have already seen—is that house prices will

measures are probably misplaced and they are certainly not working. We
need further measures. On the planning side, we need to ensure that new

councils are having their arms twisted by developers and going back on
the previous policy. We must ensure, in so far as there are new
right-to-buy deals, that there is a genuine one-for-one replacement of
anything that goes out of the social housing system. The arithmetic

all, we need to ensure, as the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said, that
housing associations and councils are able to go to the market and
obtain money to build and improve housing, whether through traditional
council housing, housing association stock or joint ventures with the
private sector. As the noble Lord said, we are the only country in the
world, or at least in Europe, which counts expenditure by
municipalities and provinces to buy housing—a clear
asset—as part of public expenditure generally and puts a cap on
it. If that cap were raised, and preferably removed entirely,
councils’ ability to borrow would go some considerable way, even
if it takes us 10 years to get there, to replacing and improving the
amount of housing stock available to our people. I hope that the
Government take a grip on this area and come up with a strategy which
will deliver just
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_31_PT_1/1C2569A0332A71A2828063E416E7EE80FD660238" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 31 October 2013">Thursday,

friend Lady Seccombe has already commented on the exemption for the
elderly and the disabled. If the beneficiary of the spare room wishes
to stay where they are presently living, they can pay for
that—that is a choice. If they feel they cannot pay for it, they
can take in a lodger to help. That might not be ideal but where others
are subsidising, it cannot be right that they should be subsidising a
surplus. I find it curious that some Members of this House have been
speaking in favour of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000123">Of
course, the real culprit where housing is concerned is interference by
government. There are planning difficulties. I know of one housebuilder

building houses. I know of another housebuilder where the planning

regulations and so on and so forth. If the same government interference

today is very different from what it was 15 years ago. Then, a young
couple, whether single or getting married, who were in a profession
such as nursing or teaching—that whole cadre—would have
thought only of buying. Today we have two countries in England. We have
London and the south-east, and we have the rest of the country with
regards to the housing problem. Many of those young people who would
have been able to buy can no longer afford to because of the cost of
housing. The average age today of a first-time buyer is 37 years of
age. The number of families living in bed and breakfasts is at a
10-year high. I was reminded of something as I thought about this
debate: are we ready for another “Cathy Come Home”
television programme? That seared this country into doing something
about homelessness. We have 4.5 million people on the housing waiting
list.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000153">For the
first time in 50 years, we have more people in privately rented
accommodation that in what we call social housing—a dreadful
term: it is the housing of local authorities or housing associations.
Yet the average rent in the social sector is £83 a week while
the average in the private sector is £164 a week and a typical
mortgage outside London is £141 a week. If we are to tackle the
cost of housing and support, we must do it in the private rented sector
in particular. Part of the problem the Government have is that they do
not 
<?notus-xml column=1703?>seem to have a flexible policy at all. We need a policy on housing. How
are we to address, in the medium and longer term, the basic housing
shortage we have in this
country?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000154">A
number of ways would contribute to that if the Government would but
listen. For instance, they could form a national housing innovation
fund which could be small, with small resources, but would encourage
innovation and research. There is no doubt that the answer cannot be in
one policy or through one channel alone. It can be supplied only by
partnerships and consortiums, and by accepting and acknowledging that
the private sector has a key role to play. Starts in the private
building sector fell off a cliff in 2007. I know: I was at that time
and until April this year a non-executive director in Taylor Wimpey
housebuilders. We could see there what was happening and we knew that
the impact would not just be then but would last for years and years.
It takes time to buy land and get planning permission—although
we never had anyone at any time who had to wait 10 years for planning
permission. We need a policy on how we deal with this issue. That
cannot be on just the purely rented sector; it must be different kinds
of ownerships. People for Places, for instance, has 14 different
schemes, including mortgage, shared ownership and a scheme I worked on
some years ago when I was chairman of the Housing Corporation and was
asked by my noble friend Lord Prescott to carry out some
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000155">A lot
has been said about the underoccupancy charge. It is a cruel policy. I
would accept totally that it makes sense for
housing funded through the taxpayer to be used efficiently but you are
dealing with people and their lives. Just to have one policy that is
almost slash and burn, irrespective of circumstance, is so
wrong. We were delighted at Abbeyfield that people in retirement were
not affected by the underoccupancy rule. Could the Minister confirm
that there is no intention to change that current situation? If it was
extended to retired people, the problems we have now would look almost
nothing to the real issues we would
face.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000156">I would
like to talk about the impact of underoccupancy on registered social
landlords. The policy only came in from April this year but arrears are
going up substantially. There is no doubt about that. Underoccupancy of
one bedroom cuts housing benefit by 14% and of two bedrooms by 25%.
Where do those people get the money from to fund that? They cut back,
obviously—they have to—but we also see an increase in
loan sharks knocking on the door on Friday nights for their money.
People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:09:09"></hs_TimeCode> are
getting into personal debt that they cannot or are highly unlikely to
meet. We have heard a contribution about the working poor. It is true
that people in underoccupied houses are not just the unemployed. They
are working people, trying to look after their families, whose pay does
not give them enough. Why do not the Government get behind a living
wage? That would help these people. They do not want benefit; they
would prefer to pay for their own accommodation.</hs_para>

long-term impact will be wider than the narrow band that we are seeing
at the moment. For instance, it could affect the very viability of
housing associations, 
<?notus-xml column=1704?>because the level of their arrears is part of the consideration of their
financial stability. They loan money in the private sector. They have

will impact on housing availability, because housing associations will
retreat into what they have now. They will not expand; they will not

expanding. That will substantially impact on our housing policy. Yes,

bank accounts. If only everyone could open a bank account. The banks

True (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as leader of a
London borough council and join others in thanking the noble Baroness,
Lady Quin, for bringing what is a very important debate to this House.
I add my congratulations to my noble friend Lady Bakewell of Hardington
Mandeville on a very distinguished maiden speech. I look forward to
working with her and my other noble friends on those Benches in
supporting our coalition Government—sometimes with modified
degrees of
rapture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:12:29"></hs_TimeCode>, but we

factors contribute to housing pressures, and we have heard of many of
them, including population growth, immigration, changing expectations
about household formation, some related to past benefit policies, and
factors limiting supply to the market. I should like to follow up a few
of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, about the
London area. Heaven knows, in London, we understand the cry for
affordable housing, whether for sale or rent. It may be that we have to
ask ourselves whether we can overcome those difficulties without major
policy changes. We all want to sustain mixed populations, but in many
areas, embedded land values and limited development land mean that the
prospect of providing large-scale affordable housing for sale or rent
for all who might want it is slight. My local authority has raised
affordable housing performance a little above that of our Liberal
Democrat predecessors, but the numbers are still small, because of the
factors that I described.</hs_para>

some areas, we have to ask whether it is axiomatically correct that
everyone should necessarily expect to find a home in the place in which
they grew up. That may have been so in the past in, say, the close
fishing communities, where my ancestors lived. They cast their nets on
the cold North Sea and, many, sadly, drowned but, fortunately, not
before producing children—at least, fortunate for me. However,
in a more varied modern economy, that will not always be the case. Some
areas will always be more accessible and affordable than others. In my
case, I did not form a household in the place where I was brought up.
Nor 
<?notus-xml column=1705?>did my father; nor did my grandfather; nor, it seems, will my son. The
same is true in the case of my wife’s family and, no doubt, that
of many other families. It is a reality in a healthy economy that as
localities evolve and change people will have to travel to find
convenient homes that they can rent or afford to buy. This we should
facilitate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:15:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000163">Too
many policies work the other way. I should like to touch on something
not yet referred to in this country, which is the cruel
impact—we have heard the word cruel—of stamp duty in
south-east England. That was something piled on by Gordon Brown from
his very first Budget and not yet relieved by the coalition Government,
although I welcome the action of the Chancellor to address the abuse of
very expensive homes being bought by corporate bodies, which is
distorting the London
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:15:41"></hs_TimeCode>. In
London, and not just in the wealthier parts of London, a young,
first-time buyer can be asked to pay close on £10,000 in stamp
duty to buy a basement flat. I hope that my right honourable friend the
Chancellor will find time when he can to address
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000164">Points
have been made about the need for varying approaches in different
areas. We may need in time to look at that. Like other noble Lords, I
believe that local councils have a role in that. Lower tax is a good
old-fashioned benefit, as the coalition Government showed by taking
low-paid households out of the income tax that they used to pay under
Labour. I would be looking to break down more of the barriers that
cramp both construction and investment in the housing
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:16:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000165">Fewer
people will downsize. We have heard about the importance of downsizing.
I have to say that it is not only the fault of the Government if social
landlords do not have smaller homes available. Investors must choose in
what size of property to invest. In the private market, few will
downsize electively, liberating more affordable homes to buy for
growing families, when in many areas of the south-east, stamp duty will
take £30,000 or £50,000 out of their accumulated capital.
Few families will trade up to a larger home, liberating smaller homes,
when the £60,000 or £70,000 they would have to pay in
stamp duty could go on an extension. In some areas, the young family
looking to move from a one-bedroomed home to a two or three-bedroomed
home to buy finds nowhere to
go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
behavioural impact of reducing stamp duty is clear from recent peaks
and troughs in the statistics. Excessive taxation on housing
transactions has an impact at every level, including a knock-on effect
on the demand for social
housing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000166">Turning
to the social housing sector, it follows from what I have said about
mobility that I welcome schemes supported by the Government, local
councils, including Labour ones, and social landlords to promote the
exchange of homes. I am glad that we have moved on from the initial
dismissal of that by Mr Dromey. Indeed, I find much that is confusing
about the Opposition’s position on the policy. They have
admitted that they presided over an unsustainable growth in benefit.
They claim to accept the need to address it, but, as we have heard
today, they oppose the means, or at least this
means<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:18:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord McKenzie of
Luton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:18:26"></hs_TimeCode>, who is

wind-up whether a Labour Government would commit hundreds of millions

their most popular programmes, tackling the benefit

others have said, through the local housing allowance and other

the rhetoric about the spare room subsidy is, of course, based on
genuine concerns—we have heard some good, strong arguments in
this House—but some of it is also political rhetoric. It is
called the bedroom tax, although it is neither a tax nor a levy
specifically on bedrooms. My noble friends on the Front Bench should
not neglect the battle of language that is always so well understood on
the left in politics but less readily by my own party, as the rather
terrible story of the community charge—aka poll
tax—demonstrates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000169">It
is agreed across the House that there are almost 1 million
underoccupied rooms being paid for under housing benefit. Yet there are
over a quarter of a million households living in overcrowded
accommodation who need more space, and 1.8 million in England and Wales
on the waiting list. Meanwhile, our country is still borrowing
£13 million an hour and is short of public finance. Can
underoccupancy be ignored in such circumstances?</hs_para>

authorities, my own has set up systems to monitor carefully the
cumulative impact of benefit changes. So far, in our case, that impact
is relatively small. Out of many hundreds of households which our
officers contacted in a programme to help tenants, only 15 have so far
left as a direct result of changes to the local housing allowance,
although we will have to wait as tenancies run out to see the full
effect. In terms of the underoccupancy rules, we were
offered more than £400,000 to support discretionary
payments. So far, we have had to pay down only £136,000,
although the second six-monthly round will provide further evidence.
The number of households in receipt of housing benefit remains almost
constant.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103169000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000171">To
conclude, I accept that my authority is not a bog-standard authority
and that we need to see more evidence but this does not bear out the
more apocalyptic statements we have heard. The coalition Government are
surely right to seek to bring fairness back to the system and make
better use of social housing stock. I hope that my noble friend Lady
Stowell, whom I, too, warmly welcome to debates on local government
matters, will stick to her
course.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_31_PT_1/486EDC234DF1EDAA7F8478AFCA4CB56F27C57873" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 31 October 2013">Thursday,

about housing in this House and about the bedroom tax, which the
Minister must know is deeply unpopular. Many vulnerable people have
been distressed, particularly those who are disabled. The opposition to
it is widespread, including in Scotland, where housing associations
report that many people are already in arrears and fearing eviction.
The same applies in Wales, where there are also problems. As we have
heard during the discussion this afternoon, there are many instances of
extreme distress, of which I hope that the Government will take note.

policy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103169000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000175">This
is of course part of a wider discussion of housing in general, where I
fear we have rather a crisis. This is particularly true of London and
the south-east. We shall no doubt be told by the Government that one
cannot talk about a housing crisis without reference to the economic
situation, which they will claim is set to improve. It is true that the
figures show that this is so for London and the south-east but I do not
think it applies in the rest of the country. Indeed, manufacturing
growth seems not to have improved in areas where it was hoped that the
economy would be rebalanced.</hs_para>

south-east, everything is no doubt very good for those who are well
off. For the remainder—the majority—that is not so.
Housing costs have risen dramatically and are still rising, by more
than 7% in the last year. People say that it is now even more than
that. Things are particularly difficult for younger people, for whom
unemployment figures are still high. The area in which I live was once
regarded as one of the cheaper areas of Hampstead—it is adjacent
to Kilburn—but no longer. It is now really expensive. The
problem for younger people can be simply stated: private rents are too
high and wages too low, while there is insufficient secular
housing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103169000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000177">The
Government will no doubt claim that they are attempting to deal with
the cost of living and the housing crisis by introducing the so-called
right to buy. Yet as many have pointed out, that could merely introduce
a housing bubble like that which put housing out of the reach of many
in the past. People are already struggling to make ends meet and are
going to find it difficult to produce the requisite deposit. The scheme
is likely to benefit those already in housing. It will enable people
who are already not too badly off to climb further up the housing
ladder by uprating. It will not help younger people, who are often in
low-paid jobs, onto the housing ladder at all.</hs_para>

problem. Councils are having difficulty in coping with the lists of
those who need social housing. Increasingly, they are having to look
outside London and the south-east to access social housing for those
who need it and who have not been able to be accommodated in that area.
This means that the people so housed will have the expense
of commuting, if they still have jobs in London, thus adding further to
the expense involved. Moreover, it risks turning London and the
south-east into an area where only the well off can afford to live. If
you happen to be poor but hard-working, too bad—even if you have
a job.</hs_para>

have often faced housing crises. Just after the war, there was a
shortage of housing. There had of course been the bombing and the
destruction of large parts of London and the south-east. The Government
of the day took very strong measures, with a lot of public support.
They built the pre-fabs: small houses put up rapidly, which housed
people very quickly and which still exist. The Government also took
control of the housing market. While controls were placed on what could
be charged by private landlords, there were rent tribunals which made
decisions in line with what people were earning. So despite the
shortages and suffering caused by the war, people realised that
everything possible was being done to help them. That is not the

secular housing, which we have been told is planned. On the other hand,
that is for the future and we have a crisis now. Measures are therefore
needed to cope with that crisis. I hope that the Government realise how

other part of the Motion refers to affordable rents. The problem with
affordable rents is that the words have an ordinary meaning that people
will assume them to have, but the way in which they are now used by the

technical phrase. As some noble Lords have already said, in many places
they are not really affordable, so what they are called is not an

for that from my own authority in Pendle. The HCA affordable homes
framework covers the period 2011-15. It introduced a new affordable
rent product that replaced the previous social rent 
<?notus-xml column=1710?>model. Registered providers therefore cannot obtain funding to develop
housing for social rent now; they have to go to affordable rents, and
rents for these properties can be charged at up to 80% of market rates.
What is called an “affordable” rent is related very
closely to market rates. This approach is designed to give providers
more income to build affordable housing, as the assumption is that
market rents will be significantly higher than social rents, hence
borrowing capacity will be increased.</hs_para>

problem in areas like the one where I live and am a councillor is that
housing is relatively cheap to buy, and levels of rent in the private
sector are also therefore relatively cheap. For example, for a
two-bedroomed flat where the social rent might be
£65.06, in the example that I have been given by my
officers, the affordable rent per week—that is, 80% of the
average market rent in the private sector—is £83.07. For
a three-bedroomed house, the affordable rent would be £87.69 per
week. These are cheap rents relative to many parts of the country. Low
differentials between market rent and social rent put registered
providers developing in low-value areas at a disadvantage, because the

debate is driven by two negative factors: the decreasing provision of
affordable housing, measured against demand, and the impact of the
spare room tax on both tenants and providers. It is common ground that
in England the shortage of affordable housing is 
<?notus-xml column=1711?>now over 100,000 per year, and at the current rate of growth will
shortly exceed 150,000. Demand for extra homes in England is now
estimated to be over 200,000 properties a year, which means that even
if housebuilding output was increased by 4.5%, it would be 2022 before
we got back to 2007
figures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000194">As we
have heard, the issue of affordability is not confined to London and
the south-east but is to be found across the length and breadth of the
country. In 55% of local authority areas, fewer than one in
10 available properties are affordable to a working couple
on average wages with, say, two children. The Help to Buy scheme is
seen as an instrument that will fuel increased demand and put up house
prices but not address the fundamental issue of lack of supply. It
certainly is not doing that. That is a pretty unanimous view across the
board. There is only one man in the United Kingdom who cannot see the
problem and that is the Chancellor. Until recently, providers of
affordable housing have been focusing on building family homes and
moving away from smaller units, but the impact of the bedroom tax has
now set that trend in reverse.</hs_para>

words about the underoccupancy charge. It is fair to say that few
policies have been more controversial in the current Parliament than
the Government’s decision to reduce the amount of housing
benefit available to social housing tenants who have one or more
unoccupied bedrooms. Even the name invites controversy. Campaigners
like me have labelled it the bedroom tax, which is what it is, while
the Government have called it a spare room subsidy, which it is
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000196">One of
the primary criticisms against this policy is that the measure will not
achieve the so-called objective of freeing underoccupied properties.
Tenants are downsizing in any event not because of the effectiveness of
the policy but because of pure and simple unaffordability. Frankly,
there is insufficient stock of the appropriate size in the
social-rented sector to meet this demand. A survey of 51 housing
associations around England, carried out by the National Housing
Federation, found that 51% of residents affected by the bedroom tax
have been unable to pay their rent between April and June. This
situation is likely to get worse as discretionary payments provided to
customers hit by large charges are withdrawn. There is concern among
some of these groups, including those paying in full, as the impact on
their ability to pay for other essentials, such as food and fuel,
leaves them with the stark choice of eating or
heating.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000197">My
organisation, Midland Heart, continues to see an increase in people
leaving their homes following the introduction of the welfare reform
programme. Demand for one-bedroomed homes has increased, and exceeded
demand for two-bedroomed homes for the first time. It is now common to
have more than 200 people applying for a one-bedroomed property in
cities such as Birmingham in the West Midlands. There will be a price
to be paid: families forced to live in overcrowded conditions with
nowhere for children to do their homework and the dignity of family
life
undermined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000198">Clearly
a tension arises as the current model for delivering new affordable
homes is predicated on providers increasing rents to 80% of the market
rate, and that in 
<?notus-xml column=1712?>turn puts pressure on the housing benefit bill at a time when such
charges are under huge pressures. Individuals face major difficulties
as they seek to make the necessary underoccupancy adjustments. The
challenge is therefore to fulfil the desire to provide much needed
housing while ensuring that it is affordable to the most vulnerable in

this stage of the debate a lot of the points have already been made,
and I do not think there is much point repeating them. I shall
concentrate on a few issues. I think there is common agreement that no
Government in the past 30 years has had a housing record that they
could be really proud of. The housing sector has been dominated by
catastrophic cycles of boom and bust. We all recognise that there is a
need to build more than 200,000 units annually and consistently to meet
the demands of household formation, and we have failed miserably. There
has been a huge problem of selling off our social housing stock: 2
million homes since 1979. As we heard from the noble Lord, Lord
Shipley, the previous Government saw a net loss of 400,000 units from
our social housing stock. Now we are reaping the
consequences.</hs_para>

supply issues but first I shall make two brief comments on the spare
room subsidy clawback. I do not have a problem with the
principle of the policy: there is an issue of equity with the private
rented sector, and a problem with the imbalance between underoccupancy
and huge demand for social accommodation. However, we have warned about
the transition problem that results from retrospective
implementation of the clawback without the availability of sufficient
smaller accommodation. We need to concentrate on the transition, but
the principle is
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000202">Secondly,
I pay tribute to the staff in the social housing sector, particularly
in housing associations and local councils, who have been grappling
with the issue of tenants who have had to incur significant extra
expenditure when their household budgets are already tight. The
information I am getting is that efforts in that direction, and the
extra resources provided for that sort of advice and assistance, are
helping to keep arrears at lower levels than might otherwise have been
expected. It is an area that we should learn from and concentrate extra
resources
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000203">I turn now
to the longer-term issue of housing supply. The issue is how we are
going to build more affordable housing in future. If we are going to
advocate that, we have to say how we are going to fund it and achieve
it. This Government have had to face appalling problems in the housing
sector. Let us remind ourselves—I do not think that we have done
it much in this debate—that, arguably, the heart attack which
our economy experienced was sourced from the overindulgence, credit
expansion and speculation in the housing sector. It 
<?notus-xml column=1713?>was inevitable, certainly for the first couple of years of this

forget that housing is a cyclical industry and you need two to three
years’ cash up your sleeve to survive the years of famine that

£300 million in cash to keep going for three years
with no house sales, if he needed to. In fact he did not need to use it

Back-Bench speaker; many people will be pleased about that. This has
been a good debate and people really understand this issue about tax. I
was going to speak about the tax. I now do not intend to do so because
it has been said so well so many times. Instead, I will offer a few
reflections on how the issue makes me feel and how it affects the life
I live in the community in which I live and which I care about. My
overriding feeling about the housing issue is depression. The noble
Baroness, Lady Bakewell, said that her contribution was slightly in
that vein. I think it is almost impossible to see it any other way. The
statistics, the evidence and the experience of people who care about
and need housing has been quite unsatisfactory for many
years.</hs_para>

Lady Turner, spoke about what happened after the war. My
parents’ generation really rolled their sleeves up and did
something about the housing shortage, about the bomb damage and the
slum clearance; they really tackled it. For many reasons which we have
heard this afternoon, we have not been able to do that. We have left
our children with some awful housing problems to

been said and I hear people with vast experience speak about policy, a
critique of a policy, a new policy and so on, and I do not think that

soaring prices, the private rented sector boom, extortionate rents, the
buy-to-let 
<?notus-xml column=1715?>boom, brownfield sites, green-belt sites, high-rise
versus low-rise and funding issues. Is that an agenda that needs
another policy? I do not think so—it needs something bigger than
that. It needs a much bigger vision, a strategy. It needs a strategy
which cannot be brought forward by this Government because it is too
short term. We really need to be looking at the contenders for the next
general election and for the London Mayor and to ask them, “What
is your vision? What is your strategy? What have you got to say about
solving this housing crisis?”. It is that big, and that is the

Vauxhall, and I think, “My goodness me. This city is on a real

do not know whether noble Lords read Michael Goldfarb on London in the
<I>Observer</I> a couple of weekends ago. I thought it was a really
powerful article. He said that the property market in London is no
longer about people making long-term investments and owning their own
home, but a place for the world’s richest people to get a return
of about 10% at an annualised rate by buying houses there. In 2012, an
extraordinary £83 billion of flats were purchased in London
without mortgages and no financing. He also said that with extra
foreign and domestic millionaires and billionaires, it is not just the
rate of return but the coalition’s tax regime. Britain has a
corporate tax rate of 23%, due to come down to 20% in 2015. In Germany
it is 29%. Again, while the majority of London citizens pay up to 40%
or more of their incomes to maintain services in London, the rich pay
taxes in small change. His answer was a mansion tax.</hs_para>

can certainly indentify with this. I can see a rich person’s
London which does not affect me, my family or my neighbours. That has
to be addressed. There must be a way of making sure that the same
attention is given to ordinary people and their housing needs as is
given to big business, capital and commerce. There has to be a way of
doing that. As the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said, the responsibility
to make that case rests at the door of the politicians. It will not be
made by business people or commercial people; we have to make the case
for as much attention for the people that we want to house as business

therefore, are my thoughts on the debate. I am glad that the noble
Lord, Lord True, is back in his place. He said that nobody has a right
to live where they were born, and I think that that is probably
accepted. However, people have a right to a home in the place where
they live and work. We are not talking 
<?notus-xml column=1716?>about everyone staying where they were born but about being able to find
a job and have a home where they can easily and without too much
difficulty travel to the place where they work. That is what the aim of

was not going to speak about the bedroom tax, because it has already
been covered. However, the noble Lord, Lord True, provoked me into
saying that everyone calls it a bedroom tax because it feels
like a tax. The amount is taken out of your benefit at source and you
are left with a rent bill that is beyond your means. The Government
cynically believe that the poor will find the money, but of course many
cannot or they find it only because they deny themselves other basic
things such as heating and food, and they may get some way forward by
asking their families for help.</hs_para>

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, like other noble Lords
I will start by thanking my noble friend Lady Quin for leading on this
first-class debate, the focus of which is the availability of
affordable housing and the impact of what—the noble Lord, Lord
True, notwithstanding—I shall continue to call the bedroom tax.
I offer my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell of
Hardington Mandeville, on a very impressive maiden speech and I have no
doubt that her expertise in local government will
be 
<?notus-xml column=1717?>put to good use in this House. I am sure that she is disappointed at
having just missed the Local Audit and Accountability Bill, but I can

as have most noble Lords today, that we face the biggest housing crisis
in a generation because of the long-term failure of successive
Governments to build enough housing to meet a growing need.
That issue will not go away. For many, the desire to own their own home
has shifted from being difficult to being frankly impossible, with home
ownership falling for the first time in a century. There are now nearly
9 million people in private rented accommodation—a largely
unregulated sector—who spend on average 41% of their income on
rent. There are 5 million people on the list for social housing and we
know that there is an increase in homelessness and rough
sleeping.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000225">We
can only begin to tackle this crisis if we build more homes of all
tenures. As the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, said, this means a long-term
effort. In the past three years the number of houses built has
reached its lowest level in peacetime since the
1920s, but it is welcome news that new building is picking up, albeit
from a low ebb. However, we are still starting to build less than half
the number of homes we need to build each year. Can the Minister say
whether the Government are still guided by the 2008 household
projections, which imply an overall need for new
homes—affordable or otherwise—of 230,000 each year until
2033? If not, what is the new projection and what level of annual new
homes provision are the Government working
to?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000226">Given the
demise of regional spatial strategies, the determination of housing
needs is to be driven by a bottom-up approach. Can the Minister also
say how current local plans underpin the Government’s affordable
housing programme, and how many local authorities have in place a
strategic housing market assessment and a strategic housing land
availability assessment? How do these correspond to the overall numbers
the Government propose for this and the next
spending
round?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000227">As we
have heard, the programme for affordable housing comprises some 170,000
new homes for the period to March 2015, although 70,000 of those were
commissioned by the previous Government and 165,000 back-end loaded for
the period to March 2018. We will have to see what gets delivered, but
that is not a step change on what has gone
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000228">We
have heard about the previous Government’s record. They were
faced with significant competing priorities for housing investment.
They had in particular to deal with the stock of social rented housing
which had generally been starved of funding. Rotting windows, outside
toilets and poor or non-existent insulation could not have been
ignored. Had we done so, the consequences today, especially with
soaring energy costs, would have been distressing indeed. In 1997 the
Labour Government inherited a £19 billion backlog in repairs,
but brought 1.5 million social homes up to a decent standard through
the Decent Homes programme. Notwithstanding that, we still built
500,000 more affordable homes during our time in office and delivered 
<?notus-xml column=1718?>256,000 additional affordable homes in our last five
years. Between 1997 and 2010, nearly 2 million more homes were built in

Government are concerned, we have seen the switch in the funding
model—my noble friend Lord Whitty in particular referred to
this—for the provision of affordable housing from capital to
revenue with the halving of grant funding, and we heard about the
initial negative impact of that on delivery. Can the Minister give us
any information about the numbers and spread of properties now let at
“affordable” or intermediate rents, and any figures for
the estimated increase in housing benefit payable as a result of social
rents being payable at this higher affordable rent
level?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000230">For us,
Ed Miliband has set out the ambition of building 200,000 homes a year
by the end of the next Parliament—which is just a start. He and
Hilary Benn have asked Sir Michael Lyons, supported by a panel of

solutions needed to deliver the step change required to close the gap

delivery.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000231">At
present, we know that some areas want to grow to meet local housing
need but do not have the land within their local authority boundary to
do so. Neighbouring authorities too often block the building of badly
needed homes, particularly affordable homes. That is why we propose
that local authorities should have a new “right to grow”,
with bids to the Planning Inspectorate leading to the requirement that
neighbouring authorities are required to draw up a joint plan. We would
also like to see local authorities given strengthened compulsory powers
so they can buy and assemble land which is being hoarded and is holding
back development. There should be powers to charge developers who sit

last time we faced such a big need for housing, new towns and garden
cities played a big part in meeting it. We need to build new
institutions and incentives to help deliver this, and we look to local
authorities to engage and take this forward. Given the need for more
social housing, it is surely time to look again to local councils to
play a larger role. Many would welcome this and some—mostly
Labour—councils are already beginning to build on a scale not
seen for a generation. Of course, that would involve looking at the
financing arrangements for local authorities. There is much
else to say on that but time does not permit me to go into

must be a fair basis for supporting those who need help with housing
obligations. At the very time when there is a switch to funding
affordable housing by revenue support rather than capital, we see
attempts to cut back housing benefit through the bedroom tax.
Working-age renters of affordable housing are the direct targets of
this draconian measure. Let me be clear: we consider this a cruel,
misguided attempt at behavioural economics which has already caused
great hardship and distress to the vulnerable and disabled. We have
heard some individual stories today and there are doubtless many more.
This measure is already putting people into debt and leaving them with
impossible choices regarding how they spend meagre budgets. We know
that it is distorting the allocation of properties, with larger

Lords will be aware that the Government expect to save some £450
million, gross of DHP, in the first year of this programme,
but this is on the assumption that tenants caught by the provisions
will generally sit tight and take the hit—a cynical
approach to policy-making, as my noble friend
Lady Hollis touched on. However, the Centre for Housing Policy,
referred to by my noble friend Lady Quin, has worked with four
significant housing providers, looking at the early data to test some
of the DWP assumptions on savings, and has concluded that the suggested
savings are likely to be substantially lower than the impact assessment
suggests. In particular, it suggests there has been an underestimate of
the proportion of those underoccupying by one bedroom who will move,
and of the proportion of those who move who will go to the private
sector. It suggests that for some who move to housing associations at
so-called affordable rents the housing benefit bill will rise, and some
vacated homes will be taken up by new households claiming housing
benefit for the first
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000236">This
early study suggests that savings might be between 26% and 39% less
than originally predicted—a very substantial difference. This is
before taking account of the additional challenges the policy presents
to providers. RSLs will doubtless invest to support their tenants and
will also carry an increased burden of tenant debt which they have to
manage; and this at the same time that universal credit is coming down

Lords, I start by congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, on
securing this debate. While we have differences of view, we all agree
on the importance of affordable housing. I am grateful to the noble
Baroness for giving us the opportunity to debate this important issue.
I also welcome my noble friend

have covered a huge amount of ground and I know that I will not be able
to reply to all the questions that have been put to me, but I will
ensure that, where I fail to do so, I follow them up in writing. I
start by addressing the issue raised by my noble friend Lord Shipley,
which was echoed by many noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord
Whitty and Lord Sawyer, as regards the most important issue being that
of increasing supply and the number of affordable homes available to
everyone in England. That is why, because it is so important that we
increase supply, we are building more of those homes. More than 150,000
new affordable homes have been delivered in England over the past three
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000242" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000242">Our
Affordable Homes Programme is generating nearly £20 billion of
public and private investment to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes
between 2011 and 2015. I say to my noble friend Lord Stoneham that we
have already delivered more than 80,000 of those, and around £23
billion of additional public and private funding will help deliver
another 165,000 new homes over three years from 2015. All this adds up
to being the fastest annual rate of building of affordable homes for at
least 20 years. As the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and others have heard
me say in other housing debates to which I have responded in the past
couple of weeks, this compares with the figure under the previous
Administration, where the number of affordable rented homes fell by
420,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:17:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000243">I
am grateful to the noble Baronesses, Lady Blackstone and Lady Dean, for
their realistic assessment of the previous Government’s
performance. However, the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, was wrong to
claim that things are getting worse because if we focus specifically on
council housing we see that more council housing has been built in the
three years of this Government than in all the 13 years of the previous
Labour Government combined. As regards the increase both in specific
council housing and the affordable housing to which I have just
referred, it is important to bear in mind two things. The lack of
supply under the previous Government occurred during a boom period
whereas we are trying to increase supply and tackle the deficit at the
same time. That leads me to respond to the point which I think was
first raised by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, but was certainly echoed
by the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, and the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, in criticising our policies on affordable housing.
It is because of them that less government capital grant is required in
terms of building. This means that we can build more affordable homes
for every pound of upfront government investment using affordable
rent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:19:02"></hs_TimeCode>. My noble
friend Lord Stoneham questioned 
<?notus-xml column=1721?>whether this was a sustainable approach in the long term. I think that I
am just over my three-week anniversary in the job so I do not feel
qualified at the moment to get into a detailed debate on that. However,
I say to all noble Lords that we are increasing the supply of
affordable housing—all noble Lords in today’s debate seem
to be united in that request—at a time when we are also dealing
with the deficit, so we are having to balance those competing
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0001.htm#13103169000244">Noble
Lords also asked whether we were using other measures to increase
supply. I should say to my noble friend Lord Stoneham, who asked about
guarantee bonds, that up to £3.5 billion in government-supported
guarantees will be available in the affordable homes guarantees
programmes, but we have yet to get the approval of the first of
those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Shipley and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, asked about the capacity of
councils to borrow more money to build more affordable housing and
whether the Government could raise the borrowing cap. Because of the
competing objectives of retaining or bringing down the deficit and
trying to stimulate new builds in local areas we do not feel that it is
right to lift that cap. However, it is important to note that not all
councils are borrowing up to their cap and it is possible from
self-financing for councils to have a new source of revenue that was
not open to them

Lady Dean, asked how innovative we are being. We are certainly looking
at a range of options whereby we can provide grant funding towards
building new homes, which would first be let at affordable rents but
give those tenants the first option to buy. In all of this area we are
trying hard to fulfil the absolutely important objective that we all
share, which is increasing supply, and we are making positive inroads

into a lot of detail about the wider issue of housing supply beyond
affordable housing, except to say that I disagree with the noble
Baroness, Lady Blackstone, and others who said that our efforts are not
bearing any results. Housing supply is at its highest since the end of
the boom in 2008, with 334,000 new homes built over the past three
years. Only last month the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply
said that houses are being built at the quickest rate for a decade. The
latest GDP figures showed that 2.5% was from construction output and
jobs in the construction industry are up 9,000 on last year. I
therefore agree that this is an important area but progress is being
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on us to deliver more new homes, we also have to make the most out of
existing stock. We are giving landlords the freedom to do that. The
noble Baroness, Lady Dean, was right to highlight how things have
changed in terms of those who now need access to social housing than
perhaps had been the case 15 or 20 years ago. Some people may need
social housing for life but for many others it should act as a stepping
stone or springboard that provides stability and support for only as
long as it is needed. Councils and housing associations can now offer
short, fixed-term tenancies as well as lifetime tenancies to new
tenants where it makes more sense. We have made sure that 
<?notus-xml column=1722?>councils can decide who qualifies for social housing in their area while
finding alternative solutions for those who do not qualify. I was moved
by what the noble Lord, Lord Sawyer, said about people having a right
to a home where they work and live. I agree with him about that but our
changes to the law via the Localism Act mean that councils have much
greater flexibility than they had in the past in terms of their power
to respond to the crucial issue that the noble Lord
raised.</hs_para>

I move on I should mention something that no one has raised in this
debate. An important point for us not to lose sight of is that the
Audit Commission estimates that around 98,000 social homes in England
are being unlawfully occupied and that social housing fraud is costing
us an estimated £1.8 billion a year. To try to drive that down
because we need to make strong inroads in this area we are
giving £19 million over four years to local authorities to help
them tackle fraud in social housing. We are also funding a team of
experts at the Chartered Institute of Housing who offer free help to
landlords on how to tackle fraud and
underoccupation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:24:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other issue raised in our debate—the removal of the spare room
subsidy. The first thing I would say is that we in this Government
strongly believe that removing that subsidy returns fairness to housing
benefit through levelling the playing field. People who receive housing
benefit when renting privately, as we have just heard in the exchange
between my noble friend Lord True and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie,
have long been entitled to benefit for the number of bedrooms that they
need. The Opposition have said that they will reintroduce the spare
room subsidy for social housing, but if I understood correctly the
point that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, was making in his exchange
with my noble friend it is the Opposition’s position that they
will not extend the reintroduction of that subsidy to those who are in
receipt of benefit but in the private rented
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:25:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> Usually the questions go the other way
but let me be clear. We see these two types of tenure as being quite
different. My noble friend Lady Hollis stressed this point. A
person’s council house tenancy is allocated at the time on the
basis of their needs. If their need changes over time a change is made.
It is different from short-term tenancies in the private sector where
there is a much higher turnover. We do not see the two as being the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

outline regarding the use of existing stock and more innovative ways to

relation to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Dean—is

nearly doubled under the previous Government. I promise that I will
come back to the remarks of the noble Baronesses, Lady Hollis and Lady
Quin, on savings estimates. While it gives me no pleasure to say this,
given the spiralling housing benefit bill it cannot be right, as my
noble friend Lord Howard of Rising said, that the taxpayer should
continue to pay for homes that are too large for the household’s
needs. Before we made the change, up to 1 million spare bedrooms in
working-age households in England were being paid for by housing
benefit.</hs_para>

I have acknowledged, we are in a transitional period, with both
landlords and tenants facing change. The Government are investing
heavily in new affordable homes and we have to get that supply coming
through. Over time we think that there will be more efficient use of
social homes, with the spread of accommodation being more appropriate
for the area as a result of the measures we are introducing. However,
getting there will take time, which is why we have made available
£405 million of discretionary housing payments over this
spending review period. The noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said that
that is not enough, but we have trebled the DHP budget to £190
million this year. I think that it was my noble friend Lord True who
talked about how his council is drawing on that fund and how other
areas are adjusting to the new

is early days but I can report in general terms that councils are using
the fund to give awards where it is clear that the claimant is unable
to make up the shortfall. This includes longer-term awards, including,
as the noble Baroness mentioned, to disabled claimants living in
significantly adapted homes, and short-term support—for example,
to help people who have been off work due to illness but are due to

already in work are able to increase their hours and others are 
<?notus-xml column=1724?>able to move to smaller accommodation. In the two and a half years
between the policy being announced and it being implemented, local
authorities, landlords and tenants in some areas started to prepare for
this change. Because time is limited I shall not go into the detail but
Westminster, for example, has used a scheme to ensure that support is
available for those who want to downsize. Likewise, the council in
Salford is running schemes to help to bring together tenants who may be
interested in swapping their homes. My noble friend Lady Seccombe
referred to HomeSwap Direct. Through this scheme, for the first time,
social tenants who want to swap their homes can now see every available

Touhig (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, recently General Sir Nick
Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff, spoke of the huge
challenges faced by our Armed Forces. Those challenges are being
compounded by the Government’s policy of Armed Forces
redundancies. The recent unjust treatment of soldiers made compulsorily
redundant shortly before their full pension date is a reprehensible
scandal. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:38:26"></hs_TimeCode>

Government’s lack of consideration has seen servicemen made
redundant just short of qualifying for their full pension and
consequently losing out on around £100,000 to £200,000 in
income. Representations made by Pension Justice for Troops have
revealed the shocking impact of this mean-spirited action on soldiers
who are often called the “warrior generation”. One
example is Major Braithwaite, who served in the Balkans, Iraq and
Afghanistan and was made redundant just 87 days short of reaching his
full pension. Another is Sergeant Anderson, who enlisted at the age of
16 and was made compulsorily redundant just three days short of
reaching his full pension entitlement. They had completed 98% of their
service contract, yet are now to receive just 40% of the value of their
pensions. This is a gross injustice, which has fundamentally altered
the futures of these men. Indeed, Sergeant Anderson’s wife,
Jolene, has spoken about how they feel, and said that,
“financial security has now been cruelly snatched
away<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:40:46"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000277">The
couple had planned to use the pension to secure a mortgage on leaving
Army accommodation. The pension exists to help our brave soldiers move
with dignity to civilian life and it is unfair when just a few extra
days’ service would have resulted in a pension 50% higher. The
shameful treatment is a dereliction of the military covenant. I have in
my possession a Ministry of Defence memo, in which a number of
questions about the compulsory selection process are asked and
answered. Two questions jump off this piece of paper. The first is:
“At what point in the redundancy selection process were the
outcomes for service personnel and their families considered against
the values and standards of the Army?”. The answer: “At
no point”. Another question is: “At what point in the
redundancy selection process were the outcomes for service personnel
and their families considered against the letter and the spirit of the
Armed Forces covenant?”. Again the answer is: “At no
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:41:16"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000278">I
understand that the standards and values of the Army and of the Armed
Forces covenant must be taken into account in these circumstances.
Indeed, Queen’s Regulations say that they should, yet the
Government have ignored that. This piece of paper reveals a lack of
consideration that effectively renders the covenant a toothless
document, with no real value to servicemen when it comes to their terms
and conditions of
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:41:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000279">Last
December the external covenant reference group, consisting of highly
respected veterans’ agencies commenting on the
Government’s own first annual covenant report on soldiers made
redundant days before they qualified for their full pension declared 
<?notus-xml column=1727?>that it was a betrayal of the spirit of the covenant. It is even more
appalling that out of 11,000 Armed Forces redundancies, only around 130
soldiers have been victims of this sleight of hand. Robbing these men
of their full pension saves the Ministry of Defence an inconsequential
sum of money, but the impact on the lives of those affected and those
who serve or are considering serving in the Armed Forces, is dramatic.
Not since the notorious crook, Robert Maxwell, plundered his
employees’ pensions have we seen an employer—in this case
Her Majesty’s Government—so contrive a redundancy package
to deny a small group of people, who have put their lives on the line
for Britain, their rightful
pension<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:42:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000280">Under
the previous Government full pensions were protected. That was done by
reducing the length of service required to gain a full pension by four
years. I am sure that the whole House will join me in asking the
Government to think again and to look again at what they have done to
this small group of loyal men and pay them their full pension. I ask
them not to shame our country any more by neglecting their duty to our
soldiers. This treatment of long-serving soldiers is having an
indisputably negative impact on the morale of the Armed Forces.
According to the Armed Forces Continuous Attitude survey published in
July, one in three—30%—said that morale was low. This
figure is twice what it was when the Government came to power. The
current policy of redundancies is having a highly damaging impact on
the morale of those who so dutifully and selflessly devote their lives
to the service of our country. Last December, General Sir
Peter Wall, Chief of the General Staff, told the Defence Select
Committee that the issue of redundancies close to qualification for
full pension was having a “disproportionate impact” on
morale. These recent redundancies have not simply had an adverse affect
on today’s soldiers but have damaged
recruitment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:44:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Defence report, dated 6 August this year, highlighted the serious
difficulties being experienced in recruitment. It shows that the Army
is on course to recruit only half the reservists in 2013-14 necessary
to fulfil the Government’s target. The report declares that
there currently exists a “hostile recruiting
environment”. One of the chief reasons for this environment is,
in the words of the report, “redundancy downsizing”. It
is no wonder that people are unwilling to enter
the Armed Forces if at the end of a long and dutiful service the
Government abandon their commitment to care for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:45:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000282" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000282">The
entire policy of restructuring the Army was predicated on the reserves
being able to complement the Regular Forces. It is becoming clear that
the Government’s policy of redundancies is undermining this very
ability to expand the Reserve Forces, and is jeopardising the
Government’s entire approach towards the Armed Forces. This
policy increasingly seems based on pleasing the Treasury. The extent of
this capitulation has been revealed in recent reports in the <I>Daily
Telegraph</I> in which senior officers and Ministry of Defence
officials have revealed that the Ministry failed to spend
£2 billion of its budget. The detail shows that
£200 million, earmarked for wages, has gone unspent due to more
servicemen than expected choosing to quit. This cash pile, amassed by
the MoD could maintain six infantry battalions—3,900
soldiers—for an entire decade. In 
<?notus-xml column=1728?>Opposition the Prime Minister told BBC Scotland that he wanted to see
the British Army increase in size. It now appears that his policy is

voluntary redundancies. In fact the proportion of voluntary

2013, we will have seen more than 10,000 serving forces personnel
ending their service careers. We debated back in June of this year the
impact on those selected for redundancy who were close to pensionable
age. Now the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, broadens and repeats questions
that we raised at the time. He asks about the overall impact of the

to a question that I have asked on earlier occasions in your

proceed. What proportion will come from voluntary redundancy? What
spread of skills and experience will be lost? Are those taking
voluntary redundancy the people we want to lose? These are important
questions, not least to enable the Government to demonstrate that our

defence review. I have no doubt that our reduced forces will cope in
times of peace, but could they cope with another Afghanistan? Could
they cope if there were two such conflicts at the same

among the casualties of this reduction were the children of people
being declared redundant who were at school on boarding school

through until the next stage of a child’s schooling so that they
could complete the examination on which they were currently embarked.

is here that I come to the word “trust”. The mutual trust
between the top and the bottom of an organisation is absolutely
crucial. The regiment that I joined, the Rifle Brigade, had the motto
given to it by my ancestor, Sir John Moore, which was based on a mutual
bond of trust and affection which the officers had to earn. I thought
that they were wise words because there is no doubt that the trust of
the Armed Forces in their political and military masters has to be
earned; it is not automatic. What worries me about the impact was
clearly put by the Chief of the General Staff last December and

the damage that has been done to the internal workings of the Armed

are reducing in size you have to recruit to be certain that you will
have that sustainability tomorrow. In 1990, I remember having great
difficulty persuading civil servants that it was not like shutting a
garage door. You could not just chop something off because you had to
think about the future. Looking back on those years, I was hugely
impressed by the care that was taken over every single redundancy. Each
one was planned with care and pension issues were taken into account.
That is why some people were put into tranches 2 and 3 as opposed to
tranche 1. If it was possible then with the much larger
numbers involved, I fail to see why it is not possible today.</hs_para>

It is not a closed book as far as he, and indeed a number of us, are
concerned. I listened with shock to the two quotations he repeated from
the memo from the Ministry of Defence, which I have not seen. However,
equally shocking was a response given by the Minister on 22
July, a response that I would not normally associate

complete disregard for the impact on the individual. That has not been
taken into account and pragmatically applied. What makes it worse is
that we are not talking about an individual employee in a company who
can stay in their own home and who have not been prepared to give their
life for their country. Armed Forces personnel generally do not own
their homes and commit their lives to military service. What has been
done by the MoD to a small number of people in this case has not been
done in my name as a citizen of this country. It is not something that
I can condone in any way.</hs_para>

Government. The Government have a responsibility in this. I want to ask
the Minister: are the Government prepared to review their position? We
have heard that more redundancies may be declared in January of next
year. Will the Government’s position be the same as it was on
this redundancy round? We are told that the new reserves need to be up
to number by 2018 because it is a five-year policy, yet the
redundancies will be completed by 2015. I accept that people have to be
recruited into the Armed Forces even at a time when redundancies are
being made because you want to be sure that you have people in place
for the officer cadre at the appropriate time. In my view, you would
not go about making a big change such as this in any business in
Britain. First, you would not get away with it and, more importantly,
you would want to make sure that you could deliver on your operational
requirements, whether for a company making products or for the Armed
Forces. This has not been staged in a way that you would expect:
“We will make so many redundancies, then let’s get up to
the requirement we need, and then take it to the next

Garden of Frognal (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I join in thanking the
noble Lord, Lord Touhig, for introducing this debate. He has long been
a doughty champion of the Armed Forces. All three services have
experienced redundancies in recent months. The numbers within the Royal
Navy and the Royal Air Force are considerably smaller than for the
Army, but we should bear in mind that for each of the individuals
involved, there will have been the stress and disturbance, and
hopefully the excitement, of a fundamental change of
lifestyle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000310">The
Army redundancies are still ongoing, so this debate has focused on the
Army, with its planned reduction of some 20,000 troops. The more
limited the redundancy programme, the more feasible it is to tailor
transition facilities for each individual to find new opportunities.
But the impact of any redundancies has an unsettling effect far wider
than for those directly affected. Uncertainty spreads among colleagues,
families and friends. In any walk of life, the prospect of losing jobs
is challenging. For the Armed Forces there are additional elements
seldom present in civilian employment. Military service is not just a
job, it is a way of life, as the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, has just
indicated. Many of those facing redundancy will be living in service
accommodation, which they will have to leave. At a difficult time in
the market, they will face having to buy or rent scarce and expensive
housing. In addition, it is a lifestyle where friends and social life
often centre on military people and activities. Some of those who have
signed up to put their life on the line in the service of their country
may now be facing the loss of job, home and community.</hs_para>

remarks on the impact as it affects the welfare aspects of troop
reductions and consider the measures being taken to help with those
three elements: jobs, housing and community. Despite the reservations
expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, the military covenant is a
welcome development in raising the profile of the Government’s
duty of care towards the Armed Forces. I start with employment. We have
come a long way in recent years in enabling service people to be
accredited with civilian qualifications that reflect their experience
and competence. This was certainly not always the case. Indeed,
sometimes it was positively the reverse as commanders did not wish
their troops to be particularly well qualified lest they seek
employment elsewhere. Luckily, our thoughts on that have now changed.
Military personnel are now positively encouraged to work towards
academic and vocational qualifications that will be recognised by
civilian employers in their job applications.</hs_para>

that is working and what the CTP’s success rate is?
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:16:23"></hs_TimeCode> latest round

about housing? The nomadic military life does not lend itself to

would be considered to have a local entitlement to social housing. For
those who already have a foot in the housing market, the problem will
be less urgent than for those whose service lives have been
spent entirely in service accommodation. Will the Minister indicate
what sort of assistance is being offered to help with rehousing those
who have to leave service accommodation on
redundancy?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000314">Finally,
there is the impact of moving away from the camaraderie and social side
of military life, with its own inbuilt systems of mutual support. A
recent study by the Forces in Mind Trust has shown how difficulties in
the transition to civilian life take their toll in alcohol abuse,
mental illness and family breakdown. The study gives much food for
thought. It estimates a cost to taxpayers and charities of £114
million in 2012 and an estimated rise to £122 million this year
with the increase in those leaving under the Armed Forces redundancy
programme. That makes sorry reading. I note that the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Craig of Radley, has a debate next week which will explore
this report in more
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000315">Inspiring

are many positive stories to be told of those who channel the skills

friends. Membership of a church or other faith group, or the pursuit of
a sporting interest or hobby, are also ways to become an integrated

great respect—knows this and am sure that, when he was a

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend
Lord Touhig on securing this debate on an issue that appears to be
causing as much concern within our Armed Forces as it is in your
Lordships’ House and elsewhere. Speaking for the Government, the
Minister said in this Chamber on 22 July that there
was,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13103169000527" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000527">“no
evidence that morale in the Armed Forces has been adversely affected by

Government’s view appears to be that despite the fact that the
last round of redundancies was 84% voluntary and, unlike previous
rounds, heavily oversubscribed, that was not an indicator of the state
of morale because the Army had deliberately set out to maximise
applications. I have to say that that assertion sounds just about as
convincing as the claim once made by one of our major train operating
companies that an increase in the number of complaints received did not
indicate a rise in levels of dissatisfaction, because they had been
encouraging their customers to make
complaints<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:15:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13103169000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000322">I
do not wish to suggest that the views of one or two individuals,
however senior, are conclusive, but they rather call into question the
Government’s assertion on 22 July that there was no evidence of
morale being adversely affected by the redundancy programme. General
Sir Nick Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff, was described by the

the article is wrong; in which case, I am sure that is what the
Minister will say when he responds. However, if it is at least broadly
accurate, it certainly does not square with the Government’s
assertion on 22 July about there being “no evidence”; nor
does the Government’s assertion on 22 July square with a
statement by a Ministry of Defence spokesman quoted in the <I>Daily

noble friend Lord Touhig referred to the Armed Forces Continuous
Attitude Survey and quoted different figures on morale from those in
the newspaper articles to which I have referred. But these survey
figures again show a doubling since 2010 in the number of service
personnel describing their morale as low, with the number of personnel
stating their morale was high falling for a third successive year. What
is of concern is that the Government do not appear willing to recognise
that the way in which they have handled the redundancy situation and
the changes in the structure of our Armed Forces has had an adverse
impact on morale. After all, you cannot address a problem if you are in
a state of denial that it even exists. The 2010 strategic defence and
security review was rushed and a cost-cutting exercise, but morale was
not helped when the reductions in personnel were subsequently
substantially increased beyond those set out in the SDSR.</hs_para>

Touhig has been assiduous in raising the treatment of soldiers made
compulsorily redundant shortly before reaching their immediate pension
point. He has mentioned it again today, citing specific examples of
where it has led to significant pension entitlement loss. He last
raised it before today in this Chamber on 22 July. On that occasion the
Government’s response was not well received and the Minister
implied in his final response that he would ask his department to
reflect on the unhappy reaction there had been. What further
consideration have the Government given to this issue since 22 July,
and has their position changed? Surely the Government recognise that
this issue and the manner in which a relatively small number of people
have been treated in a compulsory redundancy situation is hardly in
line with the military covenant, does nothing to enhance morale and has
an impact that extends way beyond the “only”—to
use the Minister’s word—1.2% of those made redundant who
are
affected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000326" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000326">It

hardly think that what is happening now over the recruitment or
non-recruitment of reservists is exactly assisting morale. The morale
of our Armed Forces can hardly be enhanced when the Government are in
effect saying that while the policy—which we support—is
for an expanded, more heavily integrated role for the reserves
alongside regulars, the number of regulars will be reduced irrespective
of whether we have recruited the many thousands of additional
reservists who are needed to play a vital part in delivering our
intended future defence
capabilities.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13103169000327" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000327">Earlier

no longer appears to be the policy. When was the policy changed, by
whom and for what reason? I hope the Minister will be able to give us
answers because we still have not had a satisfactory answer from the
Government as to why the rate of cuts in the Regular Army manpower is
not dependent on the required projected rate of increase in the number
of reservists being achieved. I again invite the Minister to give such
a commitment. Apart from putting at risk our ability to deliver our
future intended defence capabilities, failure to give such a commitment
devalues the importance of the role that the reservists will play in
future, which will have an impact on recruitment and in the way in
which the role of reservists is regarded both by members of the Regular
Armed Forces and the community at
large.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13103169000328" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000328">This
debate has drawn attention to how the Government’s approach to
implementing policy, not least over the rundown in the size of our
Regular Armed Forces and the associated redundancies, is contributing
significantly to the downturn in morale registered in the Ministry of
Defence’s own reports and surveys. What makes the situation even
more difficult is the apparent government view that there is not even a
problem. Our Armed Forces continue to put their lives on the line in
defence of our country’s interests and on behalf of us all. The
fact that they do so, and will continue to do so, with professionalism,
courage and commitment should not obscure the issues over morale and
trust that should now be properly addressed by the Government as a
priority.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13103169000570" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000570">3.22

the scale and complexity of what we are asking of our Armed Forces.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:23:50"></hs_TimeCode> do not need to
remind this House that the MoD is engaged in the challenging task of
reducing our Armed Forces by some 33,000, or 19%, by 2020 across the

long-overdue 2010 strategic defence and security review and to set
about reconfiguring our Armed Forces to make them better able to meet
the threats of the future. I am confident that our efforts to transform
defence through the Future Force 2020 programme will deliver, within
budget, the battle-winning forces that we need to reach across the

is no plan B. The redundancies are regrettable, but they are necessary.
We have been clear all along that, to maintain balanced force
structures for the future, an element of these reductions would need to
be made through a redundancy programme. For some, they represent an
opportunity. Selection principles through all three tranches of the
redundancy programme have, therefore, sought to maximise the number of
voluntary applications from all personnel who meet the published
criteria. For others, I am fully aware that redundancy has been
unwelcome news. In both cases, we have done, and will continue to do,
all we can to manage the human element of these changes in the best
possible
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000333" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000333">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:25:39"></hs_TimeCode>
the first instance, those selected for redundancy are encouraged to
apply for a transfer to other areas of the Armed Forces, if they meet
the selection criteria and a manning shortfall is forecast in the
future. Of course, this is not always possible. All those who are
ultimately selected for redundancy receive financial compensation and a
comprehensive resettlement package to help them to find a job and
transition to life outside the Armed Forces. This is the same
resettlement package that they would have received had they completed
the whole of their service commitment. In most cases, this will
comprise a training grant; travel and subsistence; 35 days of paid
resettlement training; career transition workshops; a job-finding
service; curriculum vitae writing; interview skills; and access to
training

noble friend Lady Garden asked me to provide an update on the work of
the Career Transition Partnership, or CTP. The CTP is a partnering
arrangement between the Ministry of Defence and Right Management Ltd, a
leading outplacement company. It delivers the suite of training and
employment support that I mentioned a moment ago, which is no small
undertaking. In total, the number of Armed Forces personnel who 
<?notus-xml column=1739?>have left service and taken part in the CTP programme over the last 24
months to the end of the first quarter of 2012-13 is some 20,800. Over
this 24-month period, some 85% of former participants in the Career
Transition Programme found employment within six months of leaving
service. This is particularly notable when compared to an employment
rate of 70% in the general UK
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:27:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
clear that these measures to ensure a smooth transition to civilian
life are working. Evidence provided by service leavers indicates that
our resettlement provision is consistently to a high standard and that
the services that they provide do assist with a successful transition
to civilian
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000335" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000335">My noble
friend also raised the matter of housing for those who leave service on
redundancy terms. The Government are committed to ensuring that service
personnel and their families have access to appropriate accommodation
when they leave the Armed Forces. Protections have already been put in
place through secondary legislation, which means that members of the
Regular Armed Forces, their bereaved spouses and civil partners, and
seriously injured reservists, must not be subject to disqualification
through a requirement for a local connection. Additionally, following
parliamentary approval, local authorities are required to frame their
allocation schemes to give additional preference to service leavers who
have urgent housing needs. When looking for civilian housing, personnel
can take advice from the Joint Service Housing Advice Office, a
dedicated team that provides advice on civilian housing options. This
service also operates a referral scheme to place personnel in available
housing association
properties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:28:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
Service leavers are entitled to remain in MoD accommodation initially
for 93 days after the termination of their service, extended by a
further 93 days when compassionate grounds require it. Where
surplus accommodation is available, recently retired or redundant
service personnel can also be offered accommodation for six months on
payment of the market

It would be wrong of me to suggest that headcount reductions and pay
restraint have not impacted adversely on morale. In quantitative terms,
the principal means of monitoring changes in morale within the services
is the Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey, AFCAS, which noble
Lords mentioned. The findings of AFCAS are used extensively in shaping
policy for terms and conditions of service. Although the 2013 survey
shows that over 70% of military personnel described their morale as
either “high” at 39% or “neutral” at 32%,
the fact remains that 29% describe it as low. We are aware that we have
work to do on that. The key point here is one made recently by the
Chief of the Defence Staff: the Armed Forces have demonstrated
extraordinary resilience and continued professionalism despite the
understandable fall in morale in some quarters. That ability to set
aside individual happiness and demonstrate true courage and endurance
in times of real austerity is something that each and every person in
this nation should be rightly thankful
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000337" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000337">The
Government understand that there is concern about the reduction in
numbers of regulars before we have recruited and trained the increased
number of 
<?notus-xml column=1740?>reserves we require—a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser.
However, I urge patience. The Future Reserve 2020 programme has created
what we believe is a good offer, and, to paraphrase General Houghton,
we have to get the message out that people who join the reserves now
are joining something exciting and with a strong future. At the same
time as growing and transforming the reserve, we are changing the way
that we recruit for both regulars and reserve, which includes partners
in commerce. These are two large-scale change programmes which are yet
to reach full maturity. I assure the House that, at the highest level,
the MoD is now working with the relevant contractors—Capita and
ATLAS—and all MoD stakeholders to identify the growing pains,
iron them out, mature the programmes and deliver as
committed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000338" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000338">I
must stress that we are now only four months into a five-year plan to
grow the reserves and the recruitment campaigns only began in the
autumn. The key target is an Army Reserve at a trained strength of
30,000 by the end of 2018. We must not lose sight of the fact that we
already have around 19,000 trained, which means we are already
two-thirds of the way there. We do not dispute that it is a challenging
target, but the Government agree with the assessment of our senior
military leaders: it is a plan that can
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000339" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000339">I

capabilities that our Armed Forces require to meet the challenges of
the future. Our commitments were re-evaluated during the strategic

view of the Ministry of Defence is that this is most unfortunate, but
that any cut-off dates before IPP or EDPP would invariably leave some
Service men and women just outside the bracket. This is unavoidable and
adjusting the rules, after their agreement and promulgation would only
cause further hardship. Any adjustment of the rules once the
redundancies had started would have been very unfair to others who had
gone before. After much discussion with the most senior Service

exempt individuals from redundancy solely to enable them to reach their

The Ministry of Defence also worked hard to ensure that many more

not have qualified. For other ranks on Armed Forces Pension Scheme 75,

Forces’ redundancy schemes recognise those who miss out
immediate incomes by paying them specifically enhanced tax relief.
Under redundancy compensation schemes, where people leave before the

Prosser (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am privileged and pleased to be
able to introduce this debate on the cost of living and its impact on
family budgets. It would be disingenuous to pretend that the issues
encompassed in the title are easy to deal with or to put right, but I
will try to set out the ideas and proposals from these Benches which,
we believe, would in the short term ease the pain currently suffered by
so many ordinary, “get up and out in the morning”
individuals and families and, in the longer term, strengthen our
economy to the benefit of all
players<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:36:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000345" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000345">Let
me start by setting out the major changes and events that have taken
place in the UK in recent history which have contributed to
today’s imbalance in our society. First, the world of work for
many in this country has been turned on its head. An industrial
revolution has taken place whereby thousands and thousands of decently
paid but largely unskilled, mostly manual, full-time jobs mostly done
by men have gone for good. They have been replaced with jobs in the
service sector which are lower paid, requiring very different skills
and often part time. In part, that has come about because of the
extraordinary and rapid growth in technology, often replacing many
hands with one worker and a computer screen; but let us not forget that
that change also came about because thousands of jobs went overseas in
the 1980s chasing the cheapest dollar and encouraged by the Government
of the day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:37:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Some
may say that that is no longer relevant because it was a long time ago,
but that decimation of our manufacturing base and the skilled workforce
that went with it has had long-term deleterious effects on our economy
and on the livelihoods of many working people, still felt to this
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

picture, we must take account of the 2008 banking crisis, a global
collapse of confidence in financial institutions and a requirement for
the Labour Government of the day to use millions of pounds of
government money to save us from complete and utter catastrophe. We are
of course aware that those events have led to a very difficult
financial situation, with the need to curtail capital expenditure.
Whether or not that justifies the current austerity regime is a matter
of political opinion and fierce debate, which will no doubt run and
run. However, it has been well documented that those on the bottom
rungs and those in the middle of society have been the hardest hit by
the Government’s actions, leading to a widening of the gap
between the haves and the
have-nots<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:38:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000347" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000347">The
final big picture point which needs to be mentioned is the opening up
of European borders to some of the new members of the EU, enabling
their citizens to come here to live and work. Many employees rely on EU
labour, and most speak highly of the work ethic which those workers
bring with them. Some, however, have, frankly, abused European Union
labour, taking advantage of workers’ lack of knowledge of the
legal protection available to them and often paying them below the rate
offered to the indigenous workforce. That is not only wrong in itself
but has introduced a “them and us” culture into
workplaces and local areas which is divisive and
unhelpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000348" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000348">What
comes out of all this? What is needed to being greater equality back to
our society, so that people can feel that they have a stake in the
future and that not all the rewards are reserved for those at the top?
The coalition Government appear to have only one string to their
collective bow when determining priorities for both expenditure and the
cuts: more and more austerity and more and more in the name of
“We can’t afford it”, to roll back the role of the
state. I am not alone in thinking that the first point is there in
large part to disguise the desire for the second. Is the Tea Party
alive and well in No. 11?</hs_para>

believe most of the general public would agree, that in a civilised
society the role of the state in ensuring well-being and fairness, in
providing essential services and physical infrastructure and in
controlling the excesses of private companies and individuals is not
only important but key to social cohesion and the long-term well-being
of the nation as a whole. What we have at the moment is, of course, a
disinclination on the part of the Government to do any of these
things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000350" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000350">I
start with incomes. According to the Government’s own Social
Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, the UK has one of the highest
rates of low pay in the developed world. The national minimum wage is
now worth £1,000 less in real terms than in 2008.
Average wages have fallen in 38 of the 39 months since David Cameron
came to power and, only last week, official figures showed that working
people are now £1,500 a year worse off since the 2010 general
election. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation maintains that minimum income
standards have been hit by 4% inflation; the Government declare that it
is 2.4%, as measured by the CPI. Wages have risen by 1% overall; as
Mr Micawber would say, “Misery”.</hs_para>

Government will tackle low pay by strengthening the minimum wage. Moves
are already afoot to investigate the role and powers of the Low Pay
Commission to see that they are strengthened and extended, including
consideration of where certain employers could pay more than the
minimum. The Low Pay Commission will continue to make balanced
decisions on these matters, taking into account the need for wage
growth versus the possible impact on employment. Increasing pay would
reduce the numbers of people reliant on benefit subsidies and therefore
help the taxpayer and the nation’s coffers. It surely cannot be
right that taxpayers generally are supporting low-paid workers while,
in many cases, their employers make very large profits and often record
their own accounts in such a way that reduces their corporate tax
liability. The great British public are a bit fed up with that
wheeze.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000352" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000352">A
future Labour Government will also be ready to help families back into
work by assisting with the high cost of childcare. In particular, many
women are deterred from participating in paid employment because the
cost of childcare is far from affordable on the kinds of salaries that
they can command. An extra 10 hours of free childcare will be
available, on top of the 15 hours early years entitlement, and given to
households with three and four year-olds where single parents or couple
households are all in work. The cost of this extra provision will be
met by increasing the bank levy rate to raise an extra £800
million a
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000353">I turn
to housing, the costs of which are a reflection of supply and demand.
Lack of supply has sent the cost rocketing. It is estimated that,
today, it would take 22 years for the average family to save for a
deposit. Effectively, that means no house. Rental prices have risen to
an average of 41% of gross income for the 9 million people
who rent privately. Our Prime Minister has presided over the lowest
level of homebuilding of any PM in peacetime since the 1920s. The
gimmick of providing guaranteed home loans will do nothing to increase
the numbers of homes available and is therefore not capable of denting
the current crisis. A Labour Government would provide a number of
policy initiatives which will be key in helping to resolve this
problem, including powers to tackle landholding; the development of new
towns and garden cities; local authority access to fast-track planning
processes to ease differences between neighbouring authorities; and
ensuring that communities receive a greater share of the benefits of
developments.</hs_para>

cost-of-living topic of our times: the rising cost of energy. What was
supposed to be a move to install competition and efficiency—that
is, the privatisation of the utilities back in the 1980s—has
turned into what some of us always knew it would, a monopoly in all but
name, with seriously hefty profits for those at the top and for
dividend-holders. Just this week, Ofgem issued figures regarding the
ups and downs of average wholesale electricity costs, showing
categorically that the recently announced increases in consumer bills
far outstrip anything that has had to be paid on the wholesale
market.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103169000355" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000355">A
<I>Guardian</I> article on 29 October, a few days ago, cited Npower as
having increased consumer prices by 7.2% and 9.1% in the years 2011 and
2012, despite the 
<?notus-xml column=1744?>wholesale price reducing by 4% in 2011 and rising by less than 2% in
2012. As the article pointed out, running an electricity supply
business is about more than wholesale and retail prices. However,
complaints by the various companies that the network and environmental
costs are a key factor appear to be rather dented by Ofgem’s
assertions that network costs have risen by £10 in each of the
past four years, with green costs rising by a similar
amount.</hs_para>

is a similar one, with recently announced gas prices ranging between
8.4% to about 10%. Meanwhile, the CEO of Centrica, owner of

affairs has even spurred Sir John Major to speak out, calling
for the Government to recognise the unacceptably high profit margins by
introducing a windfall tax on the industry. Neither the Prime Minister
nor the Chancellor has responded positively to that proposal,

to change suppliers. Given that there is nothing to choose between
suppliers, it is hard to know what benefit such an exercise would

that we have such a situation in this country. We may have something of

Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my
noble friend Lady Prosser for arranging this debate today and for the
detail that she went into in her presentation. A recent YouGov poll
reported that one-half of the working population believe that the
coalition’s economic policies are making them feel less secure.
That is not a revelation; I think that most of us would understand that
from going around and reading the press. A <I>Which?</I> report this
month says that consumers have less money to spend than they did a year
ago; that more than one in four have cut back on essential spending;
that women between 30 and 49, and those earning least, have
been hardest hit by the austerity measures; and that basics such as the
cost of fuel, energy and food were the biggest worry that households
had—the three key factors that help keep a household together.
One in five households had no 
<?notus-xml column=1745?>savings at all to give them a barrier against these challenges. The
Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that families with children were
feeling particularly
squeezed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000361" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000361">One
of the areas they are squeezed on is related to the debate we had
earlier on welfare cutbacks. If we look at the way the Government have
applied housing policy—I do not expect the Minister to answer on
this as it is not his portfolio—and consider underoccupancy, the
Government have introduced the discretionary housing payment. That
sounds good. The problem is that 200 local authorities are applying it
in different ways. In one authority, you may get support for
12 months; in another, you may get it for three months. It
is a postcode lottery. That is helping make people feel
insecure.</hs_para>

which is, I gather, the largest loan company in the country and is
based in Leeds, said that rising food, fuel and utility bills are now
the biggest reasons for people taking loans. It has 1.7
million customers, and debt levels are rising, which should concern us
all. People are resorting to food banks. In April this year, we heard
reports that the number doing so had trebled since last year. Last
year, 113,000 people were relying on them; this year, there are 356,000
people, of whom 120,000 are children. I read in a newspaper—I
cannot remember which—that one response was, “There are
more food banks, so of course more people are using them”. What
an arrogant, unthoughtful statement to make.</hs_para>

we have growth, which is good news. I hope it will pick up momentum.
Even so, the economy is still 2.5% smaller than it was before the
recession, manufacturing is 8.9% lower and construction is even lower.
Last Friday, the <I>Daily Mail</I>—yes, the <I>Daily
Mail</I>—reported that workers expect a fifth successive year of
below-inflation pay rises, and many have had no pay rise for four
years. Working families are reading that and are reading about, for
instance, the chief executive of Serco who is going because he has
failed, but going with £9 million in his back pocket. He will
not have any problems. They are reading about the enormous increase in
dividends. Of course, I accept that savers need dividends, but it
almost telling people that we live in two different worlds running in
parallel: the world of the working poor, where two in a family working
cannot bring in enough income to look after the family, and the other
world of people who are exceptionally and enormously well paid. The
subterranean world of working families did not create the problems this
country has, yet they are taking the brunt of the austerity
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000364" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000364">The
recent report from the Government’s Social Mobility and Child
Poverty Commission, chaired by Alan Milburn, a former Labour Minister,
reported that the working poor are bearing the brunt of the
coalition’s deficit reduction. That is quite a statement and
quite an indictment, too. What is the Government’s answer? It is
not good enough to say, “We have this debt problem”.
There is no need to repeat that mantra that it is the Labour
Government’s fault. That does not wash any more. It cannot wash;
it never did. What is the Government’s intention? One thing that
would help would be for the Government to adopt the living 
<?notus-xml column=1746?>wage. That would give some hope because it is quite clear that the
minimum wage is now not meeting what families need to live
independently. We do not want working people to be dependent on welfare
benefits, and they do not want that, either. A living wage would
certainly
help.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000365" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000365">This

country, despite the recent and of course welcome signs of economic
recovery and the preliminary estimate of gross domestic product, just
published, indicating that output will grow by 0.8% during the three
months to September. Nevertheless, real anxiety over the cost of living
is the day-to-day reality of many British families, particularly those
on low incomes. The stark fact is that living standards have been
stagnating. The economic review, published yesterday by the Office for
National Statistics shows that households in Britain have seen their
living standards stagnate for the past four years and are spending an
increased share of their income on essentials such as food, fuel and

a £700 tax cut to more than 20 million working people and lifted
some 2.7 million of the poorest paid out of income tax

energy, way above the rise in wholesale prices, makes my blood boil. It
simply feels as if we are being held to ransom for a basic essential of
life. I am no expert in this field, so my thoughts are those of a lay
person. I certainly do not speak for my party on energy policy; others
far more expert than I do that. However, the antics of the big six
companies—which seem to operate as a price-fixing
cartel—tell me that privatisation in this case has created an
energy market that is simply not working in the public interest.
Otherwise, why would prices be going up sharply when wholesale prices,
which are by far the biggest element of energy costs, are relatively
stable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:58:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

profits, the simplification of tariffs, a competition review, more
focus on consumer power through things like collective switching, and
switching green levies away from energy bills to general taxation.
Personally, I think that anything which could feasibly and
realistically bring down prices, and quickly, deserves further
investigation to test its workability and impact. I hope that this does

provision of 15 hours a week of free childcare for all three to four

is usually very nice to be part of an organisation that is top of the
league. However, on this occasion it does not feel very comfortable to
know that the UK is 
<?notus-xml column=1749?>currently the EU’s inflation champion. Our rate last month of
2.7% was more than double the EU rate as a whole. In the wider OECD
only three top us—Turkey, Mexico and Iceland. It is worth asking
why we are in this uncomfortable position of being the EU inflation
champion. Several factors have clearly played their part. One might be
quantitative easing which boosts asset prices and thus favours the
people who own the assets who are already wealthy, and in turn
contributes to further rising inequality. It does nothing for most wage
and salary earners who are the main source of effective demand and
spending power. As the noble Lord, Lord Skidelsky, put it recently in

about the other factors behind inflation? Devaluation of sterling has
certainly been a factor. The big fall in the pound in 2008 has probably
mostly worked its way through now but there was a very strong
inflationary effect, as one would expect given that we are a major

contrast with Ireland is stark. Ireland has had a very bad recession
but it has also had some good things going for it. Whereas we have had
a 20.7% increase in consumer prices over six years,
Ireland’s rise was 3.2%. Food and drink prices have gone up by a
hefty 35.9% in the UK in the past six years, but the Irish rise is 1%.
The energy comparison is nearly as stark. The Irish rise is half ours

make it absolutely clear that I would not have liked the UK’s
property bust to have been as severe as the Irish one has been.
However, periodic devaluations have imposed big costs on us whereas
that has not been the case with the euro. That is not a debate for
today and I do not believe that the British economy was strong enough
to hold its place in the euro in recent years. However, that situation
shows that there is a cost to not belonging to a currency from which
the Irish have benefited, at least as far as inflation is

other concern is about pay, which other noble Lords have mentioned.
Average real pay is down by 7.5% since 2008. Higher paid public sector
jobs have been replaced with lower paid private sector jobs, which in
turn have depressed demand. This problem was faced by many people
before the recession, not just during it. Even when growth was healthy
average wages barely grew and were negative for the lowest earners.
Only the top 5% experienced faster earnings growth. The poorest half of
the population has borne the brunt of the shrinking wage pie—a
25% drop since the late 1970s—with the winner being the
increased share of profits in that pie. If profits had been ploughed
back into investment, and therefore into growth, that might have been
justifiable. However, that is not the case because the low rate of
investment is another area where Britain is vying for top place in
league tables in the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:08:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000387" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000387">What
can we do about all this? I know that the Minister thinks about these
matters and I listen to his comments with great interest. However, can
we not think about doing something about the following? What about the
business culture in this country? The bonus system gives executives the
incentive to use cash 
<?notus-xml column=1750?>to buy back shares or to sell assets rather than invest in new capital
and equipment. Bumping up the share price prompts executives to push up
prices to keep profit margins high even when demand is weak and even
though in the longer term the business is made rather
anorexic.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:09:59"></hs_TimeCode> The
bonus culture as it is creates an inbuilt bias against investment in
new machinery, training and things that look like immediate costs but
are benefits in the long term, and contributes towards inflation. This
is not an insoluble problem. In Germany, after all, bonuses are tied
not just to shareholder value but to growing market share, to organic
growth. There is another factor in the bonus system and that is not the
case in most outfits in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

overdue change in that direction? The fact is that Britain needs a pay
rise, as has just been said from across the House. Stagnating pay
packets only depress demand and fuel borrowing on credit, and we have
had too much of that in Britain in recent years. It also means reduced
tax receipts and so intensifies our economic malaise. How about raising
the minimum wage at least to its original real value? I know that the

new interest in the revival of collective bargaining in the private
sector to help ensure that workers get a fair share—a fairer

having brought about this debate. She made a thoughtful speech because
she acknowledged in her introduction that these are global trends.
Whether you look at America, Canada or this side of the Atlantic in
Germany, France or Britain, inequality has increased over the past 10
years. People on low incomes and middle incomes have been squeezed and
in many instances their standard of living has reduced over long
periods. The noble Lord, Lord Monks, also made an issue of the balance
between profit and labour. That has in many cases gone the wrong way. I
agree that there would have been a reason for that if investment 
<?notus-xml column=1751?>had been as high as we would have liked it to be but obviously that has
not happened, and that changing balance is an important part of what

as the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, said, tackling these big issues is
difficult for any Government, whether they are Labour, Conservative or
coalition. None the less, we have to be positive. There is no point in
sitting back and letting all this flow over our heads. We have to do
what we can. In that respect, the initiative by the leader of the
Opposition, Mr Miliband, at his party conference was notable and
certainly made a big political impact, if nothing else. Sadly, I am
afraid that such an initiative is unlikely to bring the relief to
ordinary people that they would hope for. In particular, the truth is
that if there were to be a 20-month freeze it would be easy for
companies to get around that, either by increasing their prices in
anticipation of the freeze or, if it happened, looking at their
situation and increasing their prices afterwards by more than they
would otherwise have done. So the net effect over quite a short period
may not be much different from what it would have been anyway. I am
afraid that that is the difficulty of introducing freezes of that
kind.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103169000393" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000393">I heard
what my noble friend Lady Tyler said. I prefer to look at the green
subsidies, but not because we want to change them in any way. All three
parties have, quite rightly, had a part to play in bringing in green
subsidies to produce decarbonisation and to contribute to dealing with
climate change. However, as my noble friend rightly pointed out, the
way they are now weighted on gas and electricity prices means that they
hit the poorest hardest, because those prices are regressive, whereas
taxation is progressive. If a way could be found of shifting some of
that burden from prices to taxes, we would make progress. I have no
knowledge of what the Government may do but I know that not only Simon
Hughes but the Prime Minister made a point about this. Much though I
like my right honourable friend Mr Hughes, I think it is more important
that the Prime Minister takes this on board and I am glad that he has.

looking at the sustained effect on gas and electricity prices, one

Fitzpatrick, who said precisely that to the Select Committee in the
other place—that sometimes the “six”, as they are
called, look like a rather cosy cartel which is immune to competitive
good practice. People coming into the industry need to have that
competitive good practice so as to make the energy companies bring down

the Opposition that the Government, as my noble friend Lady Tyler said,
have done quite a lot to keep down prices and costs for ordinary

The average bill for energy prices is £1,500 a year—a
very high level for the average household—but mortgages are

accept that prices have gone up even more. The noble Lord, Lord Davies
of Oldham—a good friend of mine—made the point the other
day in Question Time that inequality was in the DNA of the Conservative
Party. I am afraid that inequality was in the DNA of the Labour Party
when it was in power: the Gini coefficient, which is the acknowledged
measure of inequality, reached its highest point ever in our history
under a Labour Government. Now, we are becoming more equal because of
the measures that a Conservative Government are taking. I do not think
that we will take any lectures from him or anybody else on inequality.
In practice, the Labour Party talks a lot about equality but
the Conservative Party has delivered more equality than the Labour
Government ever

there is a big political battle going on but I will close by saying

area. The minimum wage is £6.31 and the London living wage is
£8.55; there is a big gap between the two. I am talking about

working hours in low to middle-income households. Today’s
workplace is polarised, with employment growing in highly skilled jobs
and in low-skilled, low-status service sector roles, but declining in
middle-skilled jobs. While it is only part of the solution, we need

me turn, as other noble Lords have, to the issue of low pay. I am proud
to be a founder member of the Low Pay Commission. It is 14 years since
we set the first statutory national minimum wage of £3.60 but
more importantly, its framework, which has stood the test of time. The
figure was very modest because we wanted to establish a national
minimum wage safely and
securely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000405">The
adult rate has increased by 72% since its introduction in April 1999. I
am aware that the Low Pay Commission works within tight constraints and
the fact that the hourly rate has increased by more than the increases
in average earnings or prices is commendable. However, despite the
increase this month to £6.31 an hour, it still means that the
national minimum wage has not even doubled in 14 years. This is no
criticism of the Low Pay Commission. It should have a wider remit, as
has been said, and I welcome 
<?notus-xml column=1754?>the statement by the Secretary of State, Vince Cable, that he is
inviting the LPC to extend its expertise in this area. Let us hope it
will come to
something<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:24:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000406">We
need not only to extend its remit but to be much tougher on compliance.
Research commissioned by the Low Pay Commission showed that around 6%
of the bottom decile of adult earners in the UK were not receiving
their entitlement to the national minimum wage. Areas of non-compliance
are found in apprenticeships and internships; among those on work
experience; in social care, especially domiciliary social care; and
among hotel cleaners and home workers. The LPC recommended that more
needs to be done to ensure that all available tools are fully utilised.
It expresses disappointment that after two years only one non-compliant
business has been publicly

me give a couple of examples of non-compliance. A company can show in
its books that it pays the national minimum wage to its employees, but
they then work substantial amounts of overtime at a lower rate off the
books, bringing the total earnings to below the statutory minimum. We
met complainants but they were not willing to raise the matter with
their employer; they knew they would never get another job in the
industry because of the close communications within it. We met home
workers who were being paid 50p per pleated skirt whose circumstances
prevented them going out to work. They were reluctant to complain
because they knew that there was a huge queue of women waiting to take
on the
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000408" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000408">One
way to assist compliance is to have effective, clear and accessible
guidance on all aspects of the minimum wage. However, the
Government replaced the guidance which previously existed with a

previous Government’s sites—the LPC’s words, not
mine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:26:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Although
the Government accepted the LPC’s recommendation about an
improved information site, unfortunately it has not been implemented.
There is no point in beefing up the national minimum wage if no one
knows about it. Stakeholders have confirmed that the existing site does
not meet their

should not forget that the floor provided by the national minimum wage
is not intended to be a substitute for a low pay strategy—the
two are entirely different. Too many employers rely on low pay rather
than a skilled workforce and the taxpayer foots the bill for low pay.
In-work benefits have been slashed by the Government, making the
prospects for low-paid families far worse and saving money only in the
short term. However, low pay will still be a cost to taxpayers because
of the absence of savings and pensions to cushion any rises in the cost
of living—not least because of increased debt, arrears and
homelessness—which will eventually cost the
Exchequer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:27:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000410" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000410">According

to total disposable income, 45% is enjoyed by the highest earning fifth

most expensive way, and being told they have a spare bedroom, which
gives them either less money or less flexibility in managing their
family life. Crocodile tears from the Liberal Democrats do not wash

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the
noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, on securing this debate and on setting
such a good framework in her introduction. I want to look particularly
at the human cost of this issue and at the family budgets of those who
are at the sharp end of the struggle in trying to deal with rising
living costs. I shall begin with the big picture. Earlier this year I
organised a hunger summit in Derby. We looked at food poverty in what
we call the developing countries, but we also looked at food poverty in
our own city. We took the opportunity to launch a remodelled food bank
system to provide a more comprehensive service to meet the growing food
poverty that we are finding in our own back yard. That is the context
in which we should begin to look at the pressure on family budgets. We
were supported by the Fair Share Trust. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord
Newby, was in the House earlier this week when there was a Question
about food waste, and I hope that one of the things we can do with
excess food is redirect some of it towards organisations such as the
Fair Share Trust so that it can be used to supplement those families
whose budgets are so stretched that they cannot afford to eat
properly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:30:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the city of Derby, we have seen a 100% increase in the use of food
banks. The point I want to make in this debate is that the shift has
moved away from the normal suspects, who are, tragically, homeless
people, towards families who are housed, but whose incomes are so low
that they cannot feed themselves seven days a week. The increased
demand has been seen among occasional users who pitch up several times
a week in order to secure a proper meal for the family that
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

situation with treats. Today, many people are living on such stringent
budgets that they cannot afford any treats. St Peter’s Church in
the middle of Derby runs something called “Christmas Lunch on
Jesus”. The project has some 400 volunteers who send a meal out
on Christmas Day. Last year the meals were sent to 1,500 families, and
this year the project is budgeting for 2,000 families. People do not
have the wherewithal even to celebrate Christmas in the way most of us
would take for granted. There is a real issue
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103169000415" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000415">I want to comment
briefly on three areas of complexity. The first is work and income, the
second concerns lifestyle, and the third concerns the role of the state

<?notus-xml column=1756?>and other support. I turn first to work and income. Recently, a family
with one child turned up at one of our churches. They had got out of
work and into debt. It took 15 weeks of debt counselling, providing
food and childcare support—all the normal things—to turn
the family around and get them back into work. The person concerned is
now contributing food to the local food bank. My point is that work for
many people is very insecure. It does not plough on and on and it is
not just about getting a living wage. The experience of trying to be in
work is insecure for many people. It is not untypical to tip out of
work, get into debt because of having been living at a certain pace,
and to run out of food. Churches and other groups try to pick these
people up again. The problem, however, is that churches and the
volunteer sector are struggling with the increased number of people in
this situation and finding it harder to make that kind of generous
response. When we talk about work and a living wage, we have to
remember how insecure that is for so many people. Whatever the system
is that underlies it, an enormous amount of energy and good will is
required of volunteers to help people to cope. As other noble Lords
have said, we need a more systematic approach to the provision and
security of
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:33:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the sheer complexity of lifestyles and the difficulty around
interpreting the phrase “family budgets”. Perhaps I may
share another story. Two weeks ago, a family turned up at one of our
city centre churches comprising a mother who was eight and a half
months pregnant and five other children. They were running away from
domestic violence. By the way, the woman has successfully had her sixth
child. They pitched up at the church, a strange place to them, with no
support systems. The children had been out of school for six months.
The church has worked hard to place the children in local schools, get
them bus passes and school uniforms in order to help this woman through
the trauma of the birth of her sixth child. Her benefits have been
stopped because she has not replied to a letter from the DWP, but that
is because she is no longer at home, having run away from domestic
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:38:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000417" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000417">There
is no easy answer for that story but it is not untypical of the very
complex lifestyles that many people have. These are not normal families
that you can just put in a box or bureaucracy, or find a welfare system
for. There is a certain chaos and unpredictability about many
people’s lifestyles. We therefore need to invest more in
agencies with the sensitivity to pick up people who do not fit into the
boxes, help them negotiate with the system, and discover what benefits
and housing might be available. As family budgets are under such
pressure, we really need to invest in those who can help people
negotiate with the
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:35:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000418" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000418">My
third point is about the role of the state. The big word is cuts: cuts
in family budgets, in local authority budgets and in government
expenditure. I encourage noble Lords to think that there is a
potentially more positive side to this negative mantra of cuts in terms
of the reshaping of welfare provision in our times, which is a
challenge to all of us. Clearly, Government and local government are
taking various decisions about the role of the state and public
authorities, and we are having a political debate at the moment as to
whether 
<?notus-xml column=1757?>they are the right decisions. However, there is a very interesting role
for not just the voluntary sector, which I have been talking about, but
business. In the city of Derby, we are working quite closely with local
businesses to see how they can support the management and leadership of
schools, and support the development of work opportunities for young
people and raise aspirations for children in certain educational
environments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000419" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000419">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>
experience is that many local businesses have a genuine desire to be
part of a new ecology of trying to reach out and help people understand
what work is about, to access it and be part of growing up to make a
positive contribution. As the Minister looks at the big macroeconomic
and social issues that have, rightly, been raised, I hope that there
might be some response on how we can properly encourage a role for the
voluntary and faith sectors in this interface between those who are
crushed in terms of family budgets and those systems designed to
support them, and on how can we try to grow a different ecology of
welfare and mutuality where society uses local resources and local
businesses, and the state, in a different kind of partnership. There is
lots of talk about it but, for those of us on the ground, not a lot of
action and few encouraging

most chaotic and most under pressure. I hope that there could be a
positive line across all parties of the House about creating a new

a challenging aspiration to achieve. Recent figures not only confirm
the squeeze on living standards for low to middle-income households but
also that it will be longer and deeper than previously projected.
Despite job growth in the private sector, wages have fallen in real
terms, many work fewer hours than they would like and the impact of
changes to benefits and tax credits are all putting further downward
pressure on those households. Although tax credits now make a smaller
contribution to income for workers in the bottom half, it is still a

some extent, all families have been affected since the recession but
households in work, on low and middle incomes, especially those with
children, start with far less than the better-off, making the squeeze
even harder to bear. They spend a greater proportion of their income on
essentials such as food, fuel and transport, the costs of which have
risen much faster than overall inflation, leaving them facing falling
wages and an “inflation premium”. It is not surprising
that 
<?notus-xml column=1758?>calls to constrain energy bills have such resonance with the public. In
addition, modest-income households are more prone to debt. According to
the Resolution Foundation, among all households with some form of debt
in the bottom half of the income distribution, 30% can be considered
“debt-loaded”: their repayments account for more than a
quarter of their gross household
income.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000423">The
causes of the pressure on household budgets are both structural and
cyclical, exacerbated no doubt by the events and policies of recent
years. As my noble friend Lord Monks identified, it is also evident
that many households benefited less from previous economic growth, when
the wages of ordinary full-time workers barely grew and were negative
for the lowest earners. Looking back even further, inequality increased
at all points in the income distribution from 1979 to 1997.</hs_para>

Government is to ensure that the benefits of future growth are shared
more equitably. To quote from the Commission on Living
Standards’<I> Gaining from Growth</I> report, only 12% of every
£1 of UK GDP now goes to wages in the bottom half, down 25% in
the past three decades. Polarisation of incomes is not unique to the UK
but it is greater here than in most other developed countries, and so
is the extent of low pay. To make up the ground left by the recession,
wages for the low to middle-income groups have to grow by 1.1% a year
in real terms over the next decade. That is without taking into account
the reduced expenditure on tax credits and benefits. As my noble friend
Lady Prosser said, that challenge has to make us consider how we can
build on the current role of the Low Pay Commission and strengthen and
broaden the contribution of the national minimum

factors contributing to low UK productivity are several and complex but
they are neither new nor recent. Comparatively low labour productivity,
low investment, lesser management skills and low company expenditure on

strategy to reduce the UK’s reliance on low pay must include a
national minimum wage but setting that wage so as to avoid any
perceived undue impact on employment and at a very modest level has not
constrained growing income polarisation. There is a real danger that
unless the national minimum wage is raised significantly, some firms
will not need to be or become more innovative and more productive in
absorbing higher wage costs. Those that are productive and could absorb
the higher costs will simply continue to pay lower wages because they
can.</hs_para>

family budgets will become even more polarised. People who do the right

underperformance of women with children in their 30s and women over 50

Foundation study, which has updated the minimum income standards first
published in 2008 to this year, shows that the continuation of several
trends has made it harder for households to make ends meet. Increasing
prices, especially in childcare, social rents and public transport, as
well as in food and energy, have pushed the minimum cost of living up
faster than the average cost of living. These increases show no sign of
abating, while cuts in benefit entitlements both to those in and out of
work are going to continue. We must remember that so many benefit
recipients—some surveys say the majority—are actually in
work. These discrepancies will continue; the report concludes that the
minimum amount that households without children need to earn rose about

continued to rise more

especially for the older people in the village who without it would be
socially isolated. It is struggling to pay its heating bills, maintain
the building and keep the rates for the breakfasts and lunches it
provides at an affordable level for those who need it so much. This
story will be repeated throughout our country, in towns and cities as
well as villages. We often do not value such community hubs until they
disappear but we should try to remember how vital they are in
maintaining links and contacts. Such organisations and charities always
work as hard as they can to ensure their services continue, often via
the personal sacrifice of the volunteers in charge. Helping them invest
in fuel-efficient heating, insulation, solar panels and so on can be

what must we do about it? First, as we have heard, we must enable
people to maximise their incomes. Better access to benefits and no

benefit claimants which seems to be de rigueur now, that huge amounts
of benefits actually go unclaimed. We must also strengthen the powers
of the Low Pay Commission, and I endorse what others said about the

expansive and perceptive way that it gave all other contributors some
substance on which to cohere. She reflected on the changes in our
economy and society over the past three decades, and the change in the
nature of work. We have moved from a much more substantial
manufacturing base 30 years ago and lost our capacity to make cars,
unless the Japanese are employing British workers; all our companies
apart from Jaguar Land Rover went down. The movement from the
manufacturing industry to the services industry has produced a change
for workers, with much greater part-time work; the emergence of the

people presenting themselves for work; and the reduction in the

resources of working people. That is to say nothing about the level of
unemployment, which also means that very many do not have work at all.

increase in energy bills at present is profound. Added to the

increases in fares that the rail companies are able to perpetrate. Poor
people travel on buses and are continually seeing those fares increase
by more than double the rate of inflation. Travel costs are a very

opportunities to

which my noble friends have covered very fully, as they have all
aspects of this debate. There is a real issue of the pressure on
housing. A very large percentage of our population are now in the
private rented sector, and we all know the rate at which rents are
increasing. Nothing is more disturbing to a family or to individuals
than to feel that their housing costs are running out of control. As
for whether one can get into the housing market with a purchase in
London, unless a family is earning £100,000 a year its entry
into the housing market is very difficult indeed. We all know the
particular approach of the Government in their limited position with
regard to 5% mortgages. The anxiety about that is obvious enough: that
it will stimulate a housing bubble which will put us back to 2007-08,

Newby (LD):</Member></B>
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:06:44"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
thank the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, for initiating this debate. I
agree with many noble Lords, specifically the noble Baroness, Lady
Drake, that what we have been discussing today is arguably the biggest
challenge that we face with regard to economic policy—how we
deal fairly with the bottom 50% of the workforce in terms of their
earnings. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, that putting
the current situation right is extremely challenging.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103169000449" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000449">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:05:06"></hs_TimeCode>
agree very much with the noble Baroness’s analysis of the issues
that are central to that challenge. Some of them, like the labour
market changes that she and other noble Lords described, are very
long-term challenges, while some have been exacerbated by the banking
crisis. With regard to labour market changes, I agree with the noble
Baroness, Lady Donaghy, who said that there is a real challenge because
of, as it were, the hollowing out of the middle and the problem that
people with intermediate skills have found their real wages squeezed.
One of the reasons why we are keen to have a much higher level not just
of apprenticeships but of advanced apprenticeships is to upskill many
more people in that middle band so that they are more able to earn a
higher income than they are at the
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:06:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000450" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000450">I
will talk later about low pay, but there has been quite sensible
interest in and concern about what has been happening as part of a
long-term trend on high pay. I was a member of the High Pay Commission,
which looked at this whole issue. It has been very 
<?notus-xml column=1764?>striking how over a couple of decades pay at the top has virtually lost
touch with the reality of everything else and gone into the
stratosphere. The Government are in the process of implementing the
majority of the recommendations of the High Pay Commission, not least
in giving shareholders a greater say in the pay of senior executives.
It is a fact that bonuses have fallen by 85% since the peak year
2007-08, so something has happened in a way that we would all think was
beneficial. However, I do not think anyone believes that we have gone
as far as we
should<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:07:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000451" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000451">With
regard to financial services, the remuneration code, which is in the
process of being strengthened, will tie earnings much more closely to
performance and lead to a much greater degree of deferred payment,
which will not stop people being paid a lot of money but to a far
greater extent will tie those earnings to what they have actually
achieved. That, combined with greater shareholder control of earnings,
will make some difference at the top

the economy is the Government’s first priority because this will
raise everyone’s living standards. We are also keen to oversee a
fairer tax system to ensure that jobs are created across the country
and that those who make the most pay the most. However, we understand
the immediate financial pressures that have been the main subject of
today’s debate. I shall do my best to respond to as many of the
issues that have been raised as possible—first, by looking at
the way in which the Government’s economic policy is helping to
keep employment as high as possible and interest rates low; secondly,
by discussing the action that we have taken to protect standards of
living; and, thirdly, by discussing our commitment to ensure that the
impacts of our policies are as fair as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:08:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

policy, we know, and have been discussing, the extent to which times
are difficult. However, our view is that the only way to deliver a
sustained improvement in living standards is to tackle the
economy’s problems head-on and deliver a recovery that works for
everyone. The Government’s economic plan is designed to equip
the UK to secure a stronger economy and a fairer society and to help
people who aspire to work hard and get on. The economy is turning a
corner. Third-quarter GDP grew by 0.8%. This growth was broad-based
across all sectors of the economy, and surveys of future intentions
suggest that the growth will be sustained. This does not mean that we
have eliminated all risks, but by cutting the deficit significantly, we
have helped to secure near-record low interest rates which, as a result
of the Bank of England’s forward guidance, are not likely to
rise significantly in the short term. These low interest rates have
supported hard-working families’ living standards, especially
those families which have mortgages to pay. If mortgage interest rates
rose by 1%, we would see average mortgage bills increasing by around
£1,000 a year. It has been a central tenet of this
Government’s policy to have a credible deficit reduction plan so
that we can sustain low interest rates, and in this central aim, the
Government have been successful.</hs_para>

are also helping people across the country get into work. There is
obviously no better way to increase standards of living than by making
sure that people are in work and securing a reasonable 
<?notus-xml column=1765?>wage. There are now more people in employment than ever before: 1.4
million private sector jobs have been created over the past three years
and 155,000 have been created over the past three months. It is
pleasing that of the groups about which we have most concern the number
of NEETs has fallen for the past five quarters. It has not fallen far
enough, but there has been progress.</hs_para>

household disposable incomes grew by 1.6% on average above inflation
despite the squeeze, which was the fastest for three years, and
according to the OBR, next year total earnings will increase above
inflation and by 2015, they will be more than double the rise in
inflation.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103169000456" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000456">I
realise that in the mean time pay, earnings and disposable income have
been squeezed significantly, but one element of the issues that we
face, which the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, did not highlight, was
that when this Government took office, there was no money left. This
has been the leitmotif throughout all the policies we have had to adopt
in order to get the deficit down and to keep interest rates down. We
are also taking steps wherever we can directly to protect standards of
living by pursuing measures that will keep cash in the pockets of
hard-working people up and down the country. Noble Lords will be
pleased to know that I am not going to list everything, but I shall
mention the key points.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103169000457" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000457">First, we are
increasing the tax-free personal allowance to £10,000 by April
next year. Taken together, this Government’s increases to the
personal allowance will put £700 back into the pocket of each
and every average taxpayer and will have taken around 2.7 million
people on low incomes out of income tax altogether. We believe this is
the most effective way to support those on low and middle incomes
because it enables people to keep more of the money they earn.
Achieving this in times of plenty would have been hard enough, but
doing it under the economic circumstances we inherited makes it even
more important. As a result of the changes that we have made, nine out
of 10 working households will on average be almost £300 a year
better off as a result of tax and benefits changes that took effect
this year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000458" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000458">We
are also taking a series of actions to keep consumers’ energy
bills down. Although I agree that there is quite a row—to put it
mildly—about what is happening to energy prices, and there is
some suggestion that they are not actually rising very much, the
wholesale price of gas this winter will be 8% higher than the price
last year, according to Ofgem. That is the back ground to the price
increases that we are seeing at the moment. The steps we are taking on
energy bills include 2 million households getting help under the warm
home discount, including well over a million of the poorest pensioners
who will receive £135 off their electricity bill. Under the
winter fuel payment, between £100 and £300 is available
tax-free to those over 61 to help them pay their heating bills. A
£900,000 Big Energy Saving Network will help the most vulnerable
get the best deal for them. We are legislating through the Energy Bill
to ensure that suppliers place all customers on the cheapest tariff
that meets their preferences. We are making energy bills simpler,
clearer and fairer, 
<?notus-xml column=1766?>helping the 84% who do not switch and could be missing out on savings of
up to £158. It simply is not the case that all electricity
companies charge the same. There are savings to be
made.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_31_PT_1/97470EBCDA63B7A27A3DB37F18DB081565DBD0EA" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 31 October 2013">Thursday,

The Prime Minister has announced there will be an annual review into
the state of the competition in the market. This review will be led by
the OFT, Ofgem and the new Competition and Markets Authority, when it
comes into existence, to report by next year. Further measures on
energy will be announced shortly by my noble friend Lady Verma when she

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000460" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000460">In

completely endorse the comments of my noble friend Lord Horam on Labour
Party policy in this area. It is simply incredible to believe that a
temporary price freeze would have the effect for which the Labour Party
hopes. I suspect that that is why the majority of people, when polled
about this last weekend, said that they did not believe that it would
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:16:39"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
also helped local authorities to freeze council tax, and we have frozen
fuel duties. All these measures help to reduce the day-to-day cost of
living for millions of people up and down the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000462" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0002.htm#13103169000462">I
turn to redistribution and the distribution of income more generally.
Before the fiscal consolidation we are now implementing, the richest
20% contributed three and a half times as much in tax as they received
from public spending. This has now increased to around four times as
much. As noble Lords have already discussed, there has been a fall in
income inequality to the lowest level since 1986. There may be a number
of caveats around that, but it is the case that income inequality is at
the lowest level since 1986. For those of us to wish to see less income
inequality, that is something to be pleased about. We have also taken
steps to ensure that the most vulnerable low-income groups have been
protected against the effects of economic
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:18:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

measures that we have taken for pensioners. It is interesting that not
a single noble Lord has mentioned pensioners in the debate. I suspect
that the reason is that the Government have treated pensioners, if not
overgenerously, then certainly very fairly over the past three years.
Pensioners have seen above-inflation increases to the state pension.
The triple lock means that the basic state pension is higher by
£6.85 a week than if it had been increased by earnings only. The
average person reaching state pension age in 2013 with a full basic
state pension can expect to receive an additional £12,000 in
basic state pension over their retirement. In April this year,
following a 2.5% increase, the basic state pension was estimated to be
almost 18% of average earnings, the highest it has been in any year
since 1992. In times of austerity, this is a significant
achievement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:19:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Tyler, and others talked about improved childcare for people on

<?notus-xml column=1767?>of free childcare a week to 260,000 by September next year. We have also
implemented 15 hours a week for all three and four year-olds and have

every noble Lord who has spoken in the debate has talked about low pay,
which is clearly a very significant issue. The problems we now face are
in part the result of long-term trends in unemployment. For example,
the noble Lord, Lord Monks, pointed out that many people moving from
the public to the private sector have taken a cut in pay because, on
average, public sector wages have become somewhat higher than private
sector wages. We have had a big shift from public to private, which has
obviously had an impact on many people’s
wages<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:20:36"></hs_TimeCode>. The

the minimum wage, as noble Lords have pointed out, my colleague Vince
Cable has asked the Low Pay Commission to look at the scope for
increasing the minimum wage without having detrimental effects on the
level of employment. We hope very much that that will lead to a greater

and the living wage is a level that the Government support and
encourage employers to
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:21:48"></hs_TimeCode>. As a
number of noble Lords pointed out, when the minimum wage was introduced
there was a lot of scaremongering about the employment costs, which
proved to be completely false. It has been estimated that the living
wage might cost 160,000 jobs if implemented overall. I do not know
whether that is a realistic assessment, but certainly the work that we
have asked the Low Pay Commission to do to increase the minimum wage

noble Baroness talked about compliance. When the minimum wage was going
through, I remember expressing some concerns that the legislation
seemed to have very little in it about compliance. Although I

detailed response. I should like to single out the noble Lord, Lord
Horam, for putting forward a different point of view and keeping us all
on our toes. However, I find it difficult to understand the point that
he and the Minister made about the narrowing of inequality. It rather
reminds me of the “lies, damned lies and statistics”
statement with which we are all familiar. How is inequality being
narrowed when we have seen such a huge increase in the number of people
using food banks and those in rent arrears? That phrase does not mean
the same thing out there on the street. I urge the Minister, as the
representative of the Government, to take the arguments back to other
members of the Government and to remind them that the word
“govern” is a verb—it is a doing word. I, on
behalf of these Benches, expect there to be rather more doing than
talking because the consequences of not dealing with the major widening
of inequality in our society will be hugely dangerous for our country
in the future. I once again thank noble Lords for their

underinvestment, dithering and delay, so this Government are having to
take the tough decisions others have ducked to make sure
Britain’s lights stay on. Everything we are doing has to ensure
that we drive investment into the system, not scare it off or freeze it
out. But as I will make clear in this Statement, energy security must
go hand in hand with
affordability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000474" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103169000474">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:27:35"></hs_TimeCode>
let me set out the robust plans we have to deliver affordable energy
security. To deal with the problem of tightening electricity margins up
to 2018, the Government have been working with the national grid and
Ofgem 
<?notus-xml column=1769?>to develop existing safeguards to have more electricity available for
the grid at peak times, including, if needed, the use of power plants
currently mothballed. We are introducing to Britain a capacity market
to ensure we attract the investment we need in new power stations. The
first capacity market auction will take place next year for delivery
from the winter of
2018<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:29:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103169000475" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103169000475">In
addition to these measures to keep the lights on, Britain now has a
long-term strategy encapsulated in the Energy Bill. Over the summer we
published draft strike prices for renewable electricity under contracts
for difference. Detailed proposals for the implementation of
electricity market reform were published this month. The fruits of
bringing this greater predictability and certainty to investment are
already showing. Latest estimates suggest that at least £35
billion has been invested in new electricity infrastructure since 2010,
and much more is in the pipeline. In the past 12 months
alone, we have provided consent for seven major energy infrastructure
applications worth around £20 billion with the capacity to
generate electricity to more than 6 million homes, including,
of course, last week’s announcement that we have reached key
commercial terms with EDF for the first new nuclear power station in a
generation at Hinkley Point

is more. Through the Energy Bill’s final investment

offshore wind, onshore wind and biomass

though British households pay some of the lowest prices for gas and
electricity in Europe, such facts are scant comfort to those who have
seen prices rise considerably over the past 10 years. The main driver
of these energy price rises has been rising wholesale energy costs, not
social and environmental policy. But apportioning blame is also scant
comfort to people who are struggling to make ends meet. That is why we
have been taking action to help people and businesses struggling with
their energy

already introduced some help that is immediate. Two million vulnerable
households will get £135 off their energy bills this winter,
thanks to the Government’s warm home discount. Around 12.5
million pensioners will get the winter fuel payment—£200
for the under-80s and £300 for those over 80. And of course
there are cold weather payments if needed, which last year delivered

year we have added to these policies with more direct action. Our new
Big Energy Saving Network is training 500 volunteers to go out into
communities to help people get better deals from energy suppliers and
reduce their energy bills. These volunteers will be fully supported. We

not something that the party opposite understands, for the previous

help only the big six. In contrast, from day one, this coalition

we can dramatically speed up switching. I want five-week switching to 
<?notus-xml column=1771?>come down to one-week switching, and then I want to go faster still. Let
us be clear that it will not happen overnight. We could announce

want to talk to suppliers who can agree and deliver a plan to speed up
switching down to 24 hours, without increasing bills. Any company
interested in making things easier for customers to switch, in addition
to those that have already agreed, is invited to come and see me. Our
preference is to do this jointly with suppliers, building on the good

also written to energy companies about direct debits. I share concerns
that they may be holding on to significant credit balances where
customers have overpaid through direct debits. I expect all suppliers
to make every effort to return money to customers with closed accounts.
I accept that sometimes that will not be possible but, when it is not,
my strong view is that credits should be directly applied to help the
fuel poor and other vulnerable customers. My right honourable friend
the Member for Bexhill and Battle will be meeting energy suppliers next

debates on energy bills, many have understandably been asking whether
competition is working in our energy markets. While this coalition has
already done a great deal to promote competition, we are ready to do
more. As the Prime Minister announced last week, we now propose to
introduce annual reviews of the state of competition in the energy
markets. The first of these new competition assessments will be
delivered by spring next year. The assessment will be undertaken by
Ofgem, working closely with the Office of Fair Trading and the

exact metrics for the review will be a matter for the regulators but I
will be asking them to look in depth and across the energy sector at

also need to make sure that the energy suppliers are open and honest
about the profits they are making, so I have also asked Ofgem to

are many important questions about the future direction of our energy
sector that this Government are simply failing to clarify. One of the
biggest, which was referred to in the debate that we had on Monday, is
the degree to which this Government are still committed to
decarbonising our electricity sector, yet there was no mention of this
in the Statement. The Prime Minister has indicated that he
wants to roll back green support mechanisms, without stating which
ones. This is bound to decrease investor
confidence across the board and increase the cost of borrowing. Just
this morning the Leader of the House in the other place wrongly said
that it was only Labour that wanted a decarbonisation target and that
had we won the vote on Monday, this would have added £125 to
consumer bills. Has there been a change of policy? Are the Government
no longer committed to setting a decarbonisation target?
Are the first few clauses of the Energy Bill now redundant?
If so, we need to be told. Will the Minister please confirm that the
official estimate of the cost of adding the decarbonisation target is
£20, not the £125 which is being repeatedly trotted out
by government claims that that is what the target would add to
bills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000004">The
other reason why I was disappointed was that the Secretary of State
appeared, quite wrongly, to be trying to blame the situation in the
energy market today on the previous Labour Government. Let us be clear,
under Labour, 26 gigawatts of new capacity was added to the
grid—19 gigawatts of non-renewable capacity and seven of
renewables. Since then we have seen a hiatus in investment, with
reports that renewable energy investment has now halved under this
Government. The Statement says that £20 billion-worth of new
infrastructure projects have been consented, but does not list what
they are. To consent a project is nowhere near the same as having one
delivered, built and providing electricity to the grid. We know this
because there are many gigawatts of consented gas stations sitting by
with absolutely no movement towards bringing them on to the grid. Will
the Minister state clearly how much capacity has been added under this
Government—not what is proposed or under construction, but what
has been
added<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:42:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

in the Statement. The most important is the Secretary of State’s
statement that the main driver of energy price rises has been wholesale
energy costs, not social and environmental policy. We know that they
contribute less than 10% of the increase in bills that we have seen in
recent years, and that many of them are precisely the measures we need
to insulate ourselves against higher prices in the future, and to help
the poorest and most vulnerable in making their homes more energy
efficient. I am delighted that he made that very clear statement, and I
hope that that could be reiterated by government across the
board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:43:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000006">Sadly,
to return to things that disappointed me, clearly the weakest part of
the Statement is the Secretary of State’s claim that he is
standing up to the big six. That is very hard to believe. The
Government have given everything to the big six that they have asked
for. They wanted a rollback in green and social measures, so the Prime
Minister says that that will happen. They wanted a review of
competition, and the Secretary of State has said today that that is
what he will do. We do not need any more reviews; there have
been 17 investigations into energy market competition since
2001. What has the regulator been doing all these years? Why do we
still not have a competitive market either in generation or retail? We
do not need another review. What we need is another approach and
another Government; we need to split the big six generation companies
from the supply companies to open up that market forcing them to sell
their product through an open and transparent market in which everyone
can compete fairly; and we need a new regulator. This is what Labour is
committed to and what it will
deliver<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:44:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000007">On
security of supply to the UK energy system—of course, there has
been another statement today on this issue—the Government are
failing to face up to the fact that the greatest uncertainty in
security of supply of electricity at the moment is what will happen to
our coal-fired power stations. Twelve such stations remain on the
system. Built in the 1960s, they are ageing relics and have twice the
emissions of gas-fired stations; they are old and they are prone to
break down. There is no indication in the Statement that the Government
are interested in finding out what these stations intend to do. As long
as we do not know what they will do, we cannot move forward with
investment in new infrastructure. The longer the coal-fired stations
stay on the system, the less there is a clear incentive for investors
to bring old gas-fired stations back into the market and to invest in
new gas capacity. This is the big question on security of supply but
the Government do not have an answer. We need to seek clarity, and

is welcome that the Secretary of State will be introducing new measures

the Government simply do not have an answer. They do not even have a

Jenkin of Roding (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
for what she has said, but might I press her a little further on the
point with which she ended her reply to the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington? I refer to the question of the competition reviews. The
Statement says that although much has already been done, the Government
are ready to do more, and then goes into detail about annual reviews of
the state of competition in the sector. If, as seems entirely possible,
one of the results of a review is that the regulator, Ofgem, for
example—I agree with my noble friend that we need to build on
what is already in place and not try to create something entirely
new—needs strengthened powers to make competition more
effective, how might Ministers expect to deal with that? As the
Secretary of State said in his
Statement:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13103185000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000123">“If

to take powers now in order to avoid having to introduce fresh primary
legislation? Interestingly, EDF has come out in only the past few
minutes to say that it would welcome a review, because that will help
to restore trust in the system. If that is indeed likely to be the
result, would it not be a good idea to act fairly
quickly?</hs_parafo>

Verma:</Member></B> My noble friend is absolutely right. The purpose of
the review is to enable the regulators, led by Ofgem, to see what needs
to happen in order to strengthen competition. They should be able to
look carefully at whether there is transparency or not and
accountability or not. What we need to do is wait for the competition
review to take place, conduct a consultation on the review, feed into
the review and then comment on it. It would be wrong for the Government
to comment at this moment in time. It is right to get the competition
review under way by having all three regulators look at the position
carefully. They have the expertise and they know what they are looking
for. If they need extra powers, it is for the Government to ensure that
we support them by ensuring that those extra powers are put in
place.</hs_para>

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, with this kind of Statement, we
get rather infected with the way of doing things and the mood of the
House of Commons. I welcome the fact that the Statement concentrates on
competition. We have to keep it absolutely focused there. Is there an
easy answer to this and is anybody offering one? No, there is not, but
we need to keep working at it. I have a particular question for the 
<?notus-xml column=1776?>Minister on that point, which I will ask in a minute, but first let me
say that I welcome the security of supply report that came with this
Statement. It is one of the clearest and most interesting documents
that has come out of DECC for some time and includes things such as the
electricity diversity diagram and report. I particularly welcome the
move to make switching much easier and quicker; that is clearly
important both for consumer power and for competition. I also
particularly welcome the market manipulation pledges that have come
from my right honourable friend the Secretary of State. We certainly
expect that when it comes to other types of asset and other financial
instruments, which is effectively what energy is nowadays, and we
should have it now in this
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000020">My
question was about the proportion of the wholesale supply that the
Government intend should go through a market and be auctioned. Where is
the government thinking on that? My own wish is that we start to expand
the proportion of the market that has to go out there and is traded
between the supply side and distribution to customers. One issue that
came out in our consideration of the Energy Bill was the transparency
of those actions. I know that that is a priority for the Government and
would like to understand how that is moving
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000021">My
last point is about energy prices. We are told time and again that
electricity prices very much rely on and follow wholesale gas prices,
but we are questioning how much wholesale prices have gone up in
reality over the past year. We are now engaged in greater questioning
of the big six. Given that electricity generation is now dominated by
much cheaper coal, can the Minister tell me where that extra margin
from the cheaper fuel input has gone? It has certainly not gone to
consumers. That is an area that the Minister would do well to
pursue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000022"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13103185000151" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000151">Baroness

the questions that he asks are poignant, as are the remarks that he
made around switching and making sure that we have the security of
supply that we require. As my noble friend is aware, in the short term
we have measures in place. However, in the longer term we have to look
at a range of measures and mechanisms. I know that my noble friend is
very keen on demand-side reduction, which of course is part of that and
another measure that we are seriously looking at piloting through the

friend also raised the issue of manipulation. The Secretary of State
has said that we need to look at stronger measures. If we do not see
action on greater transparency and accountability, we may have to look
beyond just financial penalties at criminal sanctions. We are

that we are of course debating many of the questions that he has asked

repeating the Statement. It was comprehensive, intellectually rigorous
and resistant of soundbites, which is to be welcomed. My question
relates to the regulator. The question of consumers switching between
utilities is not a new concept. In the telecoms sector, Ofcom was quick
to address the question of switching from one mobile phone provider to
another. Was it a failure of the regulator or of the statutory powers
and remit of the regulator that meant that this question was not
addressed earlier?</hs_para>

ensuring that consumers have easy-to-understand information. That has
been a big part of the problem, as well as the fact that we have not
pushed enough to get energy companies to be more transparent and
accountable. First Utility has been one of the first companies to come
forward, with E.ON, Scottish Power and SSE, to say that it will be
leading the charge to try to make switching quicker and easier. We are
inviting more energy companies to come forward to join us. The
Secretary of State has made it very clear: we want to talk with all
energy companies and we are keen to see their consumers’ bills
go down. It will become apparent that those energy companies that do
not want to do this will end up losing customers to those suppliers
that are at the front of the

turn to the Falkland Islands, where there is sadly no abatement in
difficulties being raised by Argentina, exacerbated last year on the
30th anniversary of the Falklands War. Again, this does not appear to
have affected the economic development of the islands, which

who, like the Gibraltar Government, devise their economic
diversification strategy and implements it. Her Majesty’s

believe that we can approach the general issue of economic development
under three broad headings: diversification, tourism and financial
services. On diversification, which is a common goal throughout the
territories, a robust, long-term economic strategy needs to be worked
out on a territory by territory basis. Some will need more help than
others; each is a unique and different place. To give an example,
Tristan da Cunha—which is heavily reliant on its one leading
export, gourmet-quality lobster—needs to take advantage of new
technology and upgrade its techniques, for example for buying and
selling products online. Tristan is also looking to develop its tourism

example that I can quote is that of Anguilla, where the economy is
heavily reliant on tourism, which is currently suffering in the present
economic climate. They have a small financial services sector, which is
under challenge, and are seeking support for diversification in
developing a fishing strategy, for example, to clear the waters to the
north of the island of third-country, mainly Asian, trawlers, to enable
local fishermen to fish and put a conservation policy in place. It must
be said that Anguilla has particular constitutional issues that affect
the relationship between the governor and the elected Government, which
they claim is too complex and commercially based and not sufficiently

those examples, and the many others that I do not have time to quote,
underline the need for a proactive rather than a reactive partnership
plan between the United Kingdom and the relevant overseas territories.
They also emphasise the importance of links in the field of education,
training and skills, particularly at tertiary level, between UK
institutions and the overseas territories. It is clearly important, not
to say vital, for overseas territories to have well diversified
economies, not only to enable them to become sustainable but to allow
them to flourish with continually growing resilient economies and
increasingly affluent societies. I look forward to my noble

varying degrees, tourism affects all overseas territories. I have
already made reference to some of them. The unique and isolated
locations of many territories, treasure trove of biodiversity and
improving communications all go to make tourism a high value source of
income for those territories. Even Bermuda, now the largest of the
overseas territories, acknowledges that tourism is its second-largest
industry, providing 6% of its GDP. Perhaps the most exciting
development, after years of campaigning, is the building of the airport
on St Helena. This will have a huge impact, with journey times to the
island reduced from five days at sea to five hours by plane. The UK
Government’s involvement in the airport, as well as some ongoing
DfID funding to infrastructure and capacity-building 
<?notus-xml column=1780?>initiatives to support the airport investment, is to be welcomed. I hope
the Minister will be able to tell us that the UK Government intend to
follow on from and build upon the large upfront investment they have
made in the
airport.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000038">My
third theme is financial services. I shall try to speak briefly on this
as I know that others will major on the overseas territories active in
this area. First, it is important to recognise that, for example in a
territory such as Bermuda—which provides a global service centre
in the insurance remittance, private equity and asset management
fields, with the knock-on effect of 100,000 jobs in the UK—we
are talking about activities with an important added value of
expertise. However, the eyes of the world, especially through the prism
of the OECD, are focusing very much on money-laundering and
tax-washing—I think that is the expression now. It seems that
blacklists can be issued on a unilateral basis, which can have an
unfair impact. Nevertheless, the OECD estimated that developing
countries lose three times as much money to tax havens as they receive
annually in aid. It is therefore essential that our Government do all
they can to ensure openness, transparency and high standards of
probity. Can my noble friend comment on the signing up by overseas
territories to the multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative
Assistance in Tax Matters? Could he also tell us whether the Prime
Minister’s announcement this morning of the Government’s
decision to create a new public register of the ownership of some
2.5 million companies applies equally to companies
registered in the overseas
territories?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000039">In
conclusion, in the nearly 30 years that I have been a Member of your
Lordships’ House, I have had the privilege and pleasure of
introducing a number of debates on issues affecting the 14 overseas
territories and their dependencies. Today’s debate is the least
well attended. I feel sure that it is a case of quality rather than
quantity and I am most grateful to those who are participating in the
debate. I have received apologies from some who know and take a great
interest in various overseas territories but are not able to be here.
It is a sad reflection on the present composition of your

too many Members and nowhere to sit, so few take an interest in the

with that long overdue project. That addresses the central issue which
we are asked to look at tonight about the diversification of the
economies of our overseas territories. The need to diversify those
economies to achieve the Government’s stated objective of
successful and resilient economies in the overseas territories is
clear. Without 
<?notus-xml column=1781?>diversification, there is no way that those small economies will

on urging the overseas territories to sign up fully at the Joint
Ministerial Council to the multilateral convention on mutual assistance

too, has suffered as a result of the recent global downturn. It is to
one particular economy in one of our overseas territories, that of
Anguilla, that I ask the Minister to address his mind and the activity
of the Government. Anguilla is a small island whose dependence on
tourism has come at a very high cost. According to the ECCB figures of
September this year, there was negative growth in Anguilla for
2012—minus 2.61%—and, for 2013, growth is projected at
0.93%. Frankly, the margin of error there is such that the economy has

stalled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000047">The
consequences of that in terms of unemployment and poverty on the island
are real. It is now seeing growing levels of poverty, an increasing
reliance on food banks, and one in 10 homes are without electricity.
There is real human suffering in Anguilla and we have a responsibility
to address it. The Government have said that where there is need, the
overseas territories will have first call on DfID’s budget. We
have not yet seen that materialise in fact, and we need to hear from
the Minister what plans DfID has to step in to support Anguilla at this
difficult time.</hs_para>

occasions when it will be open to DfID to say, “They do not meet
our eligibility criteria”, because the fact of the matter is
that they do. If we look at the criteria for overseas development
assistance or at the OECD’s development assistance co-operation
list, which defines the poorest countries in the world, Anguilla is
among them. We need to hear what the Government propose to do to give

is a concern that Montserrat and Anguilla have somehow fallen into the
twilight zone of policy that affects the Caribbean, so far as the
operations of Her Majesty’s Government are concerned. Despite
its middle-income status in some instances, the Caribbean generally has
within it real instances of poverty. They are driving a situation in
which there are fragile states exposed to the dangers and vagaries of
international and domestic gangsterism, and in which women are forced
to become mules for drug runners because of their own dire poverty. Yet
because these pockets exist within “middle-income
countries”, DfID is unable or unwilling to do anything. We need
to revisit policy in relation to the Caribbean generally, but our focus
this evening is on our overseas territories—those territories
for which we are responsible. Surely, Montserrat and Anguilla are
entitled to the benefit of DfID’s active engagement.</hs_para>

supposed to be working in Montserrat in ways that promote
private-public partnership responses to the needs of that island, which
is all very interesting. There is a real opportunity to develop the
volcano that was responsible for so much of the damage and harm done to
Montserrat as a highly effective energy source. Yet despite
DfID’s best endeavours, and despite what I am told is the
express willingness of a number of private sector operators to become
involved, there does not seem to have been any particular progress in
attracting private sector engagement for Montserrat. We really need to
see some action in this area.</hs_para>

see is a greater degree of engagement on the part of Her
Majesty’s Government with the ACP in Brussels, which has a brief
in this area and which also has resources paid for by the British
taxpayer. We should see what it can do to promote diversification
across the piece, throughout our overseas territories. These
territories are a responsibility that we have inherited. We should not
see them as some sort of embarrassment or vestige of a colonial past
that we no longer want to talk about. They are part and parcel of our
history. We owe them a debt of gratitude for the role that they played
strategically over many years in our island story. We owe them, too, a
moral responsibility to deliver to them at this time of real need in so
many of these

Of course, Gibraltar diversified into online gaming, but the Treasury

on competitiveness that I wish to close my remarks. Some of the
territories and Crown dependencies are top financial centres and are
rated alongside the 
<?notus-xml column=1785?>Londons, Hong Kongs and New Yorks of this world. They contribute
billions to the UK economy. The Michael Foot review, set up under the
previous Government, showed conclusively that they did not cause the
economic crisis of 2008. In July, Jersey published a report,
<I>Jersey’s Value to Britain</I>, which showed that £1 in
every £20 of money invested by foreign individuals and companies
in assets located in Britain reaches the UK via Jersey, and each year
Jersey banks send around £120 billion of their deposits to
parent operations in the UK. The same goes for most of the other
overseas territory and Crown dependency financial centres. A recent
World Bank report—I think it was in April—showed that
massive investment routed through the financial centres of the world is
pouring into the eight African countries that have economies growing at
more than 10%. British financial centres are putting money into
developing infrastructure projects in the UK and emerging nations, not
taking it out. Two days ago the Premier of Bermuda spoke at the Islamic
finance conference and said that Bermuda would seek to diversify into
Islamic banking. That is diversification of a kind, but still within
the umbrella of international
finance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000066">These
financial centres cannot diversify into something totally different,
and nor should they. I deplore the neo-colonial attitude of some
activists who say that they should be closed down and get overseas aid
instead. These territories are a source for good in the world, and I
thank the Prime Minister for his robust declaration that they are no
longer tax havens and that we should look at much larger nations which
are not as well regulated as the territories. He is absolutely right.
Professor Sharman’s report showed how easy it is to set up a
shell company in some states of the USA, with no checks whatever. If
the NSA is looking for sources of terrorist financing, it should spend
less time looking into Angela Merkel’s and the Pope’s
phone messages 5,000 miles away and look 50 miles down the road at 1209
Orange Street, Delaware, where a little two-story block has more than
200,000 companies registered. No questions are asked and nobody knows

overseas territories are well regulated, as the Prime Minister has now
acknowledged. We all support the principle of a global level playing

global and regulation must also be global and apply to all. If all

experienced strong growth during the period 2004-07. Its GDP stood at
12%. Now recession and the dreaded APD tax have hit the country. It

it is accepted that there is the need to diversify—agriculture,
fisheries, finance services and ICT are cited as

poorest countries in the world. However, DfID has not provided any
development assistance to Anguilla for many years. In the 2012 White

overseas territories in order to make them flourish and free from
financial dependence. Overseas territories also have “the first

these facts, DfID does not provide any direct funding to Anguilla and
does not have the machinery to re-evaluate the economic status of a
territory once it decides that the territory should not get any
support. This means that, despite six successive years of
economic decline, DfID has been unwilling to entertain any
conversations about re-evaluating Anguilla’s status for DfID
support, despite the fact that Anguilla remains very much in need of
help by official development assistance. The UK Government are
committed to contributing 0.7% of their national income in aid, but it
appears to be without regard for the overseas

vulnerable to downturns and recessions in larger, more

tourism has taken the place of indigenous industries such as fishing or

territories are constitutionally separate from the United Kingdom and
have their own Governments and laws. The elected Governments of the
territories are responsible for developing their economies but, as we
said in the White Paper last year, the UK Government will continue to
work with the territories to help them in this area. We have made
significant strides but recognise that there is more to do. As several
noble Lords outlined, the territories have particular challenges, such
as their geographical isolation, small communities—only 52 in
one case, as we heard—and the fact that at times they face
hostility from their nearest neighbours. They have a narrow economic
base and limited natural resources, and few have a manufacturing
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000096">Many
territory economies are based on the twin pillars of financial services
and tourism, both of which are vulnerable to shifts in the global
economy. Territory leaders recognise the need for diversification, but
their scope to do so is limited. The Falkland Islands, for example, are
actively developing their natural resources for their economic benefit.
Anguilla, which was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Howells, and
others, is looking to develop a sustainable fishing industry, which is
to be
welcomed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000097">Renewable
energy—another source of diversification —is another area
that some Caribbean territories, such as Montserrat, are taking

set out for noble Lords the work that we have been doing across
government to support the territories in order to help them to
diversify their economies. At last year’s Overseas Territories
Joint Ministerial Council, the Government and territory leaders agreed
to work together to promote trade and investment between the
territories and the United Kingdom; to support territories in
overcoming obstacles to trading with third countries; to support the
development of entrepreneurship and the growth of small business in the
territories; and to organise a business forum in 2013 involving the
territories.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103185000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-0003.htm#13103185000099">In
July this year, we gave instructions to our overseas missions to assist
bona fide territory companies and territory government/business
delegations in accessing overseas markets. FCO and UKTI staff will also
give a range of assistance across three fronts: first, assisting
territory delegations visiting their markets; secondly, assisting
territory companies experiencing market access difficulties; and,
thirdly, assisting territory Governments and trade promotion agencies
wanting to establish a presence in a market. We have also introduced a
light-touch buddy system so that territories can call on expert UKTI
advice in their respective

work in different ways across the territories, but I will highlight
some specific examples where they have received assistance from the
Government. Last year, the FCO launched the jubilee fund to help
develop the capacity of the public services across all the territories.
The fund, which this financial year is worth approximately
£500,000, has been used to support secondments of 
<?notus-xml column=1791?>territory officials to UK counterpart departments and agencies, as well
as visits to territories by UK experts. This work assists the
territories to reach high standards in governance, financial management

themselves as trustworthy and transparent partners in business, and
excellent places in which to invest.</hs_para>

some of the questions asked, and if I am unable to answer all of them
because of pressure of time, I will write to noble Lords. Gibraltar is
close to my heart. The name Gibraltar in Arabic is Gibral Tariq, and
means the mountain of Tariq, so I suppose I have a personal territorial
claim. Gibraltar is the only overseas territory in the EU and European
law applies to Gibraltar, with some exceptions. Our team in Brussels
works closely with and on behalf of the Government of Gibraltar,
alerting them to forthcoming EU measures, negotiating on their behalf,
and ensuring that they are able to benefit from access to EU markets. I
thank all noble Lords who raised the issue of sovereignty in both the
Falklands and Gibraltar. Let me make Her Majesty’s position

has no doubt about its sovereignty over the islands. The principle of
self-determination underlines this. There can be no negotiation on
sovereignty unless and until the islanders so wish. Our position on
sovereignty in Gibraltar is also clear. The UK will never enter into
arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar would pass under the
sovereignty of another state. I assure my noble friend Lady Hooper that
this will never happen against their freely and democratically
expressed wishes. The relationship with the EU is also important for
the other territories, and I am pleased to inform the House

their international standards. They have responded speedily to our G8

progress made by all overseas territories, as my noble friend Lord

Office’s Immigration Enforcement command ensures that the
immigration rules are complied with and that those with no right to be
in the UK are removed. It is better for both the UK taxpayer and
offenders themselves if offenders leave the country voluntarily rather
than in an enforced manner. Immigration Compliance and Enforcement
teams are therefore working to identify how they can promote the
visibility of enforcement operations to drive compliance and encourage
more immigration offenders to leave the UK voluntarily.</hs_para>

Operation Vaken, took place between 22 July and 22 August 2013 in six
London boroughs to test whether different communications could
encourage any increases in voluntary departures. It included a number
of communications techniques, such as mobile billboards highlighting
the risk of arrest, postcards in shop windows, adverts in newspapers
and magazines, leaflets and posters advertising immigration surgeries
in faith/charity group buildings.</hs_para>

on 22 October 2013 and a full evaluation report has now been produced,
a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House. As of 22
October, there have been 60 voluntary departures which can be directly
attributed to this pilot. The report also identifies a further 65 cases
that are currently being progressed towards departure.</hs_para>

pilot was £9,740. Data held by the Home Office indicate that the
average cost of a voluntary removal is £1,000, and the average
cost of an enforced removal is up to £15,000. The 60 voluntary
removals connected to this pilot therefore represent a notional saving
of approximately £830,000 compared to the costs of enforcing
those removals.</hs_para>

communications were the adverts, leaflets and posters that advertised
immigration surgeries in faith and charity groups, rather than the
advertising vans or other forms of advertising used in the operation.
In addition, as my Rt Hon Friend the Home Secretary told the House of
Commons on 22 October, the advertising vans in particular
were too much of a blunt instrument and will not be used
again.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103153000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131031-wms0001.htm#13103153000042">During
this period, a separate pilot was conducted in two immigration
reporting centres, in Hounslow and Glasgow. These centres are
principally used to ensure that those suspected of immigration offences
are kept in regular contact whilst their case is progressed to removal.
This pilot used a variety of communication materials to encourage those
reporting to enquire about leaving the UK voluntarily and ceased on
4 October. The activity is being evaluated separately but
there are no plans to repeat it.</hs_para>

Companies meeting the criteria for the Future Fifty
programme applied through an on-line application form accessed through
the website: www.futurefifty.com. Selection was then undertaken by an
advisory panel of 13 industry experts, investors, advisors and
successful entrepreneurs, resulting in a cohort of 25 companies in the
first wave. Selection was based on a combination of quantitative and
qualitative criteria. Quantitative measurements focused on financial
metrics such as revenue, revenue growth, and profitability. Qualitative
metrics included an assessment of the company, its products, market
environment, competitive position, and strength of the leadership team
as well as an assessment of further opportunity and
scalability.</hs_para>
