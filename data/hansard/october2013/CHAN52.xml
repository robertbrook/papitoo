will also hit 25,000 disabled families. The Minister should confer with

This year’s funding for the north-east clinical commissioning

situation is that an individual will be liable for prosecution for
possession of photographs, pseudo-photographs, computer generated
images or cartoons of graphic child sex abuse, but cannot be prosecuted
for written words describing child sex abuse in pornographic and often
lurid detail. All such things, including the written word in this form,
are designed for sexual stimulation resulting from the sexual abuse of
children. An individual could write from his or her imagination a
graphic description of child sexual abuse, which could be more emotive
and more graphic than any picture of any form, but they could not be

written word is more powerful; I shall give a simple example, which the
police have given me. A gentleman from Kent wrote describing his wish
to kidnap an early-teenage girl, strip her naked, sexually abuse her
and then in an appalling way, which I will not detail, murder her.
Horrifically, having written and stimulated his imagination, he did
exactly that. Fortunately, he has been caught and is in
prison—hopefully, for a very long time. However, the teenager is
dead. In theory, the police could have found those writings, but if
they had they could have done nothing about them because they would not
have been illegal. I understand that the distribution of such stuff is
illegal, but its possession is
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000226">Some
years ago, I went through one of the early parliamentary police
programmes with the London Metropolitan police; I highly recommend the
course. I spent one of the days with the Metropolitan police paedophile
unit. I was shocked; I could not believe that people could do such
appalling things to children, including babies. I found the police
estimate of the number of active paedophiles in the UK way beyond any
level I could have imagined and I was stunned at the estimate that
approximately 20% of them were
female.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000227">Following
the course, I had a meeting with the full Metropolitan police team and
it was apparent that some major and some minor legal changes were
required. I became a member of the then Home Office taskforce 
<?notus-xml column=166?>which led to the introduction of parts of the Sexual Offences Act 2003
relating to child sex abuse. The Act introduced the offence of child
grooming. At that time we led the world in such legislation.
Additionally, either on my own or with others, and with the
co-operation of the Government of the day, I have helped to introduce
about a dozen changes in this area. As a Home Office Minister, the
right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins) was
particularly sympathetic and helpful. That explains why he is my only
backer, although I would expect considerable support throughout the
House.</hs_Para>

Bill would close a loophole—an anomaly. Last year the Child
Exploitation and Online Protection Centre published a research document
on paedophile cases. The report mentions, but almost as a sideline,
that some offenders possess graphic notes or writings on child abuse
for their own benefit. I have been shown some examples of these by then
Detective Chief Inspector David Marshall, who was head of the
Metropolitan police paedophile unit. He is an expert in this area and
has drawn this loophole to my attention. Following that, I have had the
support of the current head of the Metropolitan police paedophile unit
and of CEOP. They have seen volumes of this material, but they have
seen it coincidentally, while looking through material for illegal
child abuse photographs or images. As possession of such written
material is not illegal, the officers generally disregarded it because
they were looking only for images.</hs_Para>

will recall, Mr Speaker, my Adjournment debate on 13 March when you
kindly sat in the Chair to hear the extraordinary story of the
six-month investigation into me by Sussex police on account of a single
e-mail I had sent to a constituent in which I had endorsed the right of
my local council, Adur council, to refer to a particularly
troublesome resident as “unkempt”. Subsequently the
constituent complained that as he claimed to be of Romany Gypsy origin,
unbeknown to me or anybody else, this was in some way racist. When the
case was rightly thrown out six months later, I questioned the bizarre
behaviour of Sussex police in wasting so much time and
taxpayers’ resources on an obviously vexatious complaint from a
serial complainer. I also raised the implications this had for the
right of other hon. Members to correspond with their constituents
without fear of the police knocking on their constituency
doors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000241">The
account I gave during the debate raised, unsurprisingly, disbelief and
indignation in equal proportions. However, what has transpired since
will, I am sure, top that and, again, has implications for the way in
which all hon. Members go about their business. I believe it represents
a clear breach of parliamentary privilege by Sussex police, and in the
full knowledge of the Chief Constable Martin
Richards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000242">In
the debate, I stated that such was the vile abuse that had been aimed
at me and my staff by the constituent and his attempts to have me
prosecuted that it was no longer tenable for me to act as his MP. I
said, therefore, that I would no longer be responding to his
correspondence or abusive phone calls, which had left my staff in
tears. I proposed to write to him to that effect but, given the
spurious grounds on which he had previously referred my correspondence
to the police, I first sought the assurance of the chief constable that
such a straightforward and innocuous letter would not again lead to
their involvement. In a singularly obstructive meeting, in which he
repeatedly stated that he had complete confidence that the police had
handled the case perfectly correctly, Chief Constable Martin Richards
refused to comment on my proposed
letter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000243">Subsequently
I sought guidance from the Clerk, who in contrast has been singularly
helpful. He advised me that I should send a complete copy of the
<I>Hansard </I>record of 13 March, including the report of the debate,
to the constituent, with a compliment slip and without any need for a
covering letter, and that that would be protected by parliamentary
privilege. That is exactly what I did. Subsequently I have had no
communications 
<?notus-xml column=168?>with my ex-constituent, have made no public statement and have not
responded to or initiated any social media to do with
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000244">In
contrast, the constituent has stepped up an onslaught of vile abuse
since 13 March, primarily against me as well as the leader and the
chairman of Adur district council, his ward councillor and assorted
others who cross his path. Yesterday he abused the organisers of
Worthing mental health awareness week, which I launched, and to date he
has posted on his blog and sent tweets to or about me and my councillor
colleagues on well over 200
occasions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000245">Many
come under the heading of political abuse, which, however offensive it
may be, we all know is part of our job. However, what is not part of
our job is that they have included doctored photographs of my children,
taken from their social media sites. What a man in his 40s is doing
trawling the social media sites of teenage girls, I do not know. They
were eventually taken down, but he then attempted to blackmail me,
saying he would put them up again unless I complied with his demands.
He has posted doctored pictures of the council leader’s young
children regaled with Nazi insignia. He has posted vile, contorted
accounts of my parents’ divorce, forged tweets, posted
references to my neighbours and photographs of my home, and most
recently a direct tweet urging me to commit suicide, along with
assorted lies, made up stories and pure fantasy. He has also recently
sought to disrupt our regular street surgeries and pour his abuse on
anyone who happens to be in the vicinity, and to menace guests at the
chairman’s charity dance. I guess we all sometimes have to deal
with very nasty people, but this one wins all the
awards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000246">Despite
my complaints—which have led to the man’s arrest on just
one occasion—the police have failed to secure any charges and he
carries on harassing, bullying, stalking, trolling and abusing me, my
family and colleagues. However, on 4 September, out of the blue I had a
formal police information notice served on me by Sussex police for
harassment. Other hon. Members will probably have come across these
notices when used on constituents in anti-social-behaviour cases. The
notice stated that the police had received an allegation of harassment
against me by the aforementioned constituent, making me aware that if
the kind of behaviour described were to continue I would be liable to
arrest and prosecution. The specific single incident of behaviour that
gave rise to this PIN was the act of sending a copy of <I>Hansard
</I>to my ex-constituent. Apparently this had caused him alarm and
distress. That came as a surprise to me and various others,
particularly given that on his blog on 14 March that
ex-constituent had described how he had watched my Adjournment debate
on television with “great amusement.” Therefore,
apparently, <I>Hansard</I> is a cause of alarm and distress, and Sussex
police believe that our deliberations are a potent weapon of
abuse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000247"><Member ContinuationText="Keith Vaz" PimsId="4426" UID="13100960002190" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960002190"><B>Keith

gold group led by Assistant Chief Constable Robin Merrett met on 3 July
to approve those PINs at the highest level. Two months later, they were
served on me and my councillor colleagues without me knowing that a

under any investigation, in clear breach of the police guidance, which
states that I should be given the opportunity to be interviewed to
account for my actions and show that they were reasonable and lawful.

intolerable affront to the rights of the House and hon. Members to go

exposing any dodgy organisation in Parliament could find themselves
being questioned by the police, or, with reference to DCI

David:</Member></B> It gives me no great pleasure to move new clause 2,

prior thought to, or prior serious consultation on, the Bill’s
impact on the devolved institutions. When I mentioned the devolved
institutions in Committee, there was a blank look on the
Minister’s face. Some people believe that the legislation
applies only to preparations for UK general elections, but it has an
impact on devolved elections, too. New clause 2 seeks to focus on
devolved institutions and the referendum, so that proper consideration
is given to the Bill’s impact and so that there is proper
planning for the legislation’s implementation
phase.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000272">I

Office of the First Minister of the Welsh Government is that there was
no prior consultation at all—the Assembly Government were asked
for their comments on the day that the Bill was published in the House.
I expect that there was the same lack of consultation with the Northern
Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. That is very worrying.

hon. Friend refers to Wales, but the Government generally lack
realisation of how important civil society engagement is in Northern
Ireland. In fact, civil society engagement is a cornerstone of the
peace process. That is one reason why great progress has been made in
Northern Ireland. It is extremely worrying that the Bill undermines
that process. It does not do so deliberately, but unintentionally.
However, that is indicative of a lack of any real understanding or
desire to ensure that there is a holistic, consensual approach to such
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000278">I
stress the word “consensual” because Labour Members hold
very firmly the view—we adhered to this in
government—that we need not only cross-party consultation and
discussion, but agreement, so that we can proceed consensually, in the
interests not of any political party, but of democracy as a whole. That
concept of democracy 
<?notus-xml column=172?>is not confined to the House; it also involves consultation with the
devolved institutions and civil society throughout the UK. That is my
first point—the lack of
engagement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000279">My
second point relates to the technical impact of the legislation. The
following changes will apply to all the devolved institutions: clause
26 and schedule 3 on the wider scope of regulated spending; clause 27
on the reduced registration thresholds; and clause 31 on the new
notification requirements for relevant participators when registering
with the Electoral Commission. Those three crucial aspects of the Bill
will apply to the devolved
institutions.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13100960002004" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960002004">1

some provisions in the Bill will not apply to the devolved
institutions. The reduced spending limits in clause 27 will apply only
to UK parliamentary general elections. The spending limits for the
devolved institutions will remain the same, as listed in schedule 10 to
the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. Several
provisions will apply only when a devolved election overlaps with a
general election—a so-called combined period. Those provisions
include the application of the new constituency spending limits in
clause 28, the new controls on spending that supports a single party in
clause 29, the new pre-poll donation reporting requirements in clause
32 and the new requirement for “true and fair” statements
of accounts in clause
33.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000281">In
essence, what I am saying is that the relationship between the Bill and
the devolved institutions is not straightforward. Some provisions will
apply to them, but others will not. There will inevitably be some
confusion, but it is vital to ensure that there is not excessive
confusion about what does and does not apply to the devolved
institutions, and about how the legislation will work in practice. We
therefore call for a report to be laid before both Houses with a proper
assessment of the impact that part 2 will have on third-party
engagement with the devolved
institutions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000282">There

next general election will be. The two periods concerned are bound to

Friday agreement 15 years ago, civil society in Northern Ireland has
been able to participate willingly and openly in responding to
Government proposals. A lot of that activity has been done by groups
from different denominations and all communities in Northern Ireland
working together. Those groups are extremely worried about the impact
of part 2 on that activity because of the reductions and limitations on
expenditure and because of the span of activities that will be caught

engagement of civil society is one of the anchors of the peace
agreement. It is a key reason why so much progress has been made in
Northern Ireland over the past few years. I reiterate that that has
been accepted by the Electoral Commission and by many politicians of

noted, the Electoral Commission is extremely critical of the proposed

lack of consideration given to the technical implementation of the
Bill, and how much it will cost to be implemented properly in practice.
The Electoral Commission is not a party-political body; it is truly and
genuinely impartial, and considers the technical implementation of a
piece of legislation with regard to regulation and elections. Its
responsibility is to ensure that elections are conducted properly and
fairly, according to the law.</hs_Para>

been various estimates of how much the proposed legislation will cost
the Electoral Commission to implement. A conservative figure is
£390,000, although others have said it will cost a heck of a lot
more. It has even been suggested that the legislation would be so
complex, and the burden on third sector organisations so great, that it
is unlikely it could be implemented properly in practice, and certainly
not to the extremely short time scale envisaged. This is not about all
elections being delayed, as in Northern Ireland, but about the first
impact and the general election in May 2015. To get this complex Bill
up and running, not just here in the centre of the process but to have
a proper understanding of all the things that voluntary and campaigning
organisations must do to comply, will be extremely difficult. In
essence, the new clause asks the Government to pause and realise that
it is all well and good to enact the Bill and say that this or that

stress the run-up because we must not talk only about the general
election but the period before it. If the new clause is accepted by the
Government—I genuinely hope it will be—it would be part
of the legislative base. As a consequence, if the objective information
is provided, the Government will do what is necessary to prevent a

people—I will stand corrected if I am wrong. Although they have
not been consulted, they will be required to police the provisions in
the clauses that relate to freedom of speech. They may be required to
act between contending parties. Let us imagine that there is a bit of a
bust-up between the League Against Cruel Sports and the Countryside
Alliance in the constituency of the Leader of the House—if he
were to get wind of such a thing he would of course report it to the
Electoral Commission. Presumably, the EC would have to get some big
lads—I do not know if they have any—to take down the
bunting, intervene in the debate and stop the bad things, as defined in
the Bill, being done. If that happens, 12 people will not be
enough to police even one constituency, so a recruitment campaign might

there has been very little agreement—that the
Government’s amendments are anywhere near enough. I said in
Committee that I welcomed the fact that the Leader of the House had had
discussions with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and
given certain verbal commitments. Since then, however, the NCVO has
said, “Hang on, we’ll see what is actually
proposed,” and now it has considered the proposals in detail
and, more importantly, taken legal advice, there is a consensus among
most voluntary organisations that the proposals are not sufficient and
arguably create further complications, which underlines the point that
we have made consistently: this is the wrong way to approach this kind
of Bill. We should not be in this position, but unfortunately we cannot
turn the clock back, which is why it is important to focus on new
clause 3 and at least recognise the need for the Government to take

David:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point and refers to
the Senghenydd disaster, in my constituency, of October 1913. I will
not speak at length about it, but the point is that historically all
civil society organisations have been able to campaign on issues of
concern to them and their members, and today’s health and safety
legislation came about through the active campaigning by men and women
in places of work. As a direct consequence of what happened in
Senghenydd in 1901, when 81 men lost their lives, legislation was
introduced, but unfortunately it was not implemented by the coalers and
so there was another horrific explosion in the same colliery a few
years later, when 439 men and boys lost their lives. Of course, things
have improved enormously since those days, but the point is that many
great social advances come about not because politicians 
<?notus-xml column=179?>decide in an ivory tower that something is good for people, but because
in a democracy people have the ability and wherewithal to campaign for
measures that will improve their and their communities’ lives.
Our fundamental concern about part 2 is that the encumbrances created
are so great that a raft of civil society organisations might think
that things are far too complicated and onerous for them to bother to
engage in the democratic
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000323" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000323"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Allen" PimsId="3636" UID="13100960002219" xid="9" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960002219">Mr

would not have been created had these measures been in place. It is the
only party created outside Parliament, rather than as the product of
splits among those already in Parliament. It was created by people who
we might say today were part of the big society. The Labour
Representation Committee—a joint committee of the kind covered
by the Bill—created a new political party in order to do certain
things in Parliament, and I would speculate that while legislation in
the 1900s made the birth, funding and advancement of the Labour party
incredibly difficult, even with the help of our good friends in the
Liberal party—perhaps we could reinvent that pact in the near
future—this Bill would have made its creation impossible. We

about the Labour party, however; other parties have been formed
recently as well, and who knows what the future holds? The point is

conducting a review and has produced more than 50 recommendations for
improving the legislation. We strongly believe that it needs to be
improved; we are on record as saying that we need to find a way of
taking the big money out of politics. We are not defending the status
quo. We want change, but we want it to be introduced properly,
systematically and on the basis of dialogue and consensus, not on the
basis of this Bill, whose rushed, back-of-an-envelope proposals have
been pursued—some would say—on a partisan basis. We have
to be careful and say yes to change, but for goodness’ sake let
us work together. What is wrong with working together to ensure that we
achieve a proper consensus? That would work not to our own political
advantage but to the political advantage of society and democracy as a
whole.</hs_Para>

Durkan</B> (Foyle) (SDLP):</Member> We know that those who are
fundamentally concerned about part 2 of the Bill do not have any
running anxieties about the existing legislation. They are concerned
about the imposition of reduced caps, the wider scope of the controlled
expenditure and the absolute minefield of difficulties—the
veritable twilight zone—that is being created in and around the
devolved regions, in relation not only to the conduct of elections
there but potentially to the conduct of Assembly business in Northern
Ireland. For example, people could well say that the Assembly should
not be in the business of legislating on same-sex marriage in the same
year as a run-up to a Westminster election, as that could be deemed to
be a re-run of the debate here, which could influence the election.
None of this has been properly considered by the
Government.</hs_Para>

4, 5, 6, 10, 11 and 12, which have been included in this group with the

they were tabled in Committee but were not reached because we ran out

opportunity to speak to them today.</hs_Para>

has always been that the House should introduce legislation that is
clear and precise. That is particularly true of legislation relating to
electoral law, which is becoming increasingly complex in this country.
It could almost be argued that it now presents a barrier to entry to
new people who want to start a political party, to engage in the
political process or to contribute to an established party.</hs_Para>

address the amendments, I should like to put on record my appreciation
of the work of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, whose
Chairman, the hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen), is here
today. I have had the privilege of serving on the Committee since it
was first set up at the beginning of this Parliament. It is frustrating
at the best of times to serve on a Select Committee, but it is doubly
frustrating when a Committee produces reports to which the Government
say they will respond but never do so, and merely bring forward their
own legislation, ex cathedra, as they have done with this
Bill.</hs_Para>

met in early September to try to deal with these issues, as well as at
the end of July, soon after the Bill had been published. We raised a
lot of questions 
<?notus-xml column=182?>with the then Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich North
(Miss Smith), some of which have resulted in the welcome tabling of
Government amendments in Committee and now, on Report. It would have
been far better, however, if this had been done the other way round. We
should have had proper pre-legislative scrutiny, consultations and
exchanges of views with bodies such as the Electoral Commission, which
were established specifically to advise Parliament and the Government
on issues of electoral law.</hs_Para>

about new clauses 2 and 3 is that, although they recognise the reality
of the situation, they would not provide an effective remedy. It is no
good saying that there should be a report on the implications of the
legislation within a month of its receiving Royal Assent. Nothing would
happen as a result of that, because it would be too late to change the
law. Regulatory impact assessments should be produced while legislation
is being considered by this House, so that we can respond to them by
tabling appropriate amendments.</hs_Para>

amendments—modest as they are, as always—were designed to
bring clarity to the question of commencement. At the moment, clause 41
provides for the Bill’s provisions to come into effect on the
day in which the Act is passed, but with a whole lot of exceptions,
some of which are set out. I am seeking to remove those exceptions
through my amendments 4, 5 and 6, which would leave out sub-paragraphs
(i), (iii) and (iv). Thus clauses 30, 34 and 35 would come into effect
on the day the Act is passed rather than on some subsequent day when a
Minister might decide to bring forward a commencement order.</hs_Para>

Why does the order-making power itself need to be made subject to
another order-making power? If clause 30 came into effect and into law
on the day the Bill received Royal Assent, its provisions would still
be subject to the Secretary of State’s having the power to make
a variation. If we want to give the Secretary of State that power, why
do we need to cover it by saying, “Well, we won’t give
him the power to make an order until he has brought forward an order
giving himself the power to make the order”? By including
sub-paragraph (i) in clause 41, we are making the provisions less
direct and more confusing. I look forward to hearing the
Minister’s explanation of why he thinks clause 41 is so
vital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000343" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0001.htm#13100960000343">Similar
arguments relate to my amendments 5 and 6, which would ensure that

stage through an order-making power? Again, I look forward to hearing
the Minister’s

way in which the Government do legislation nowadays seems to me to be
about leaving as many opportunities as possible for further

second group of amendments—10, 11 and 12
—relate to clause 42. Amendment 10 would leave out
subsections (3) to (6); amendment 11 would leave out subsections (7)

quite important, because it deals with “Transitional
provision”. It is quite complex. The explanatory notes state
that because of the interaction of the European Parliament elections in
the latter part of May next year and the fixed-term Parliament
provisions that assure us of a general election in May 2015, we need
special provisions to cover that scenario. As explained

dangerous territory whereby the Government are taking transitional
powers, interfering with existing law, and doing so on the grounds that
the situation is complicated by the European parliamentary elections
next May, while at the same time not dealing with the situation of the
Scottish referendum in September next year. I do not understand why
there are no transitional provisions for that Scottish referendum;
perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us. If we are to have strict
limits on spending by registered political parties during a period that
includes what amounts to a national referendum in Scotland on whether
or not Scotland should remain part of the United Kingdom, surely we
need some special provision to deal with related expenditure.</hs_Para>

Durkan:</Member></B> I share some of the concerns of the hon. Member
for Christchurch (Mr Chope) around the muddle and clutter in the Bill
in relation to variable commencement dates and the transitional
provisions. The Government may well say that the clauses are framed in
a way that allows for slippage if that is needed, but slippage at the
hands of a Minister in relation to commencement will give rise to
suspicions of slipperiness and the possibility of partisan motivations.
The variable commencement provisions that apply to different parts of
part 2 are evidence of just how scrappy the thinking has been, and
provide an argument for there being a longer pause for
thought.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000379" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000379">I
wish to speak particularly in support of new clauses 2 and 3. Some
Members have said that neither of the clauses on their own goes far
enough. That may be so, but they do recognise gross deficiencies in the
Bill. They may not meet them in full, but at least if this Chamber
agrees to these amendments it will be creating a basis on which there
will be further amendments and further consideration to meet those
gross deficiencies. It is a derelict argument to say that, because they
do not completely meet the deficiencies, we should not adopt them.
There are even more inadequacies in the Bill that we would leave
unamended, so saying that they do not go far enough and would need to
be supplemented by other changes should not be used as a justification
for voting against
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000380" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000380">New
clause 2 refers to the very confusing impact this legislation would
have in the context of the devolved areas. I have a particular interest

the point that has been made on a number of occasions by the Chairman

one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000381" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000381">I
want again to inform the House that many Members have referred to the
vast numbers of third sector groups—charities, Churches, policy
advocacy groups—that have 
<?notus-xml column=188?>expressed concern throughout England, Scotland and Wales, and they have
also done so in Northern Ireland. In many ways their concerns are even
more vexed because, as the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David) has
said, civil society in Northern Ireland has been playing a significant,
telling and growing role in helping to move politics on and improving
the content and climate of political debate in Northern
Ireland.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13100960002009" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960002009">2.15

key British-Irish axis, the power-sharing institutions and the new
beginning to policing are three important wheels of the peace process,
but the fourth wheel on which the peace process runs is that played by
civil society in reinforcing the sense of progressive political debate
and helping to inform an otherwise sectarian binary political debate,
which passes for political exchange but does not really address some of
the underlying public policy issues that affect people’s
economic, social, environmental or cultural interests. Anything that
puts at risk the growing role of civil society in improving politics in
Northern Ireland has to be a cause for
worry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000383" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000383">The
problems do not relate just to the chill factor, which we have heard
discussed by other Members today and in previous debates, that will
potentially be created through controlling and measuring
people’s contributions to public policy debate in a Westminster
election year. They could extend to the very conduct of the Assembly
itself and of politics at other levels. I will explain that because
Ministers will say, “No, this is clearly in the main about
Westminster elections.” The fact is, it is not always about
Westminster elections. Some aspects of clauses 26, 27 and 28, for
example, apply to Northern Ireland Assembly elections while others do
not, but that creates uncertainty and confusion, and it means that at
any time any campaign group—a charity, a service delivery group,
a body promoting policies, or a conglomerate of different interests and
groups hopefully on a truly cross-community basis—might be stuck
with having to check their legal position, what resources they might
bring to any campaign, and what may or may not be counted against them.
We do not want that sort of chill factor to change the nature of
political exchange in Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

recognise that, even in a separately designated Westminster election
year, politics still continues at other levels—local government
or the Assembly. During the relevant period leading up to a Westminster
election there could be very live issues that need to be debated in the
context of the Northern Ireland Assembly. They could be live issues on
which many groups would want to campaign—put forward their
views, support a private Member’s Bill, object to Bills being
put forward by Departments or rallying behind amendments proposed or
championed by one of the Assembly Committees. However, some of those
issues on which the Assembly might be deliberating might also be issues
on which the parties and candidates lining up for the Westminster
elections have different and distinct views. Will we then have a
situation whereby the Electoral Commission is asked to judge whether a
campaign around a proposed piece of legislation is really a non-party
campaign with the aim of procuring support for parties or candidates in
the Westminster election pretending to be a campaign around legislation
in the Assembly? Do we really put it past parties or individuals in the
Assembly to come up 
<?notus-xml column=189?>with proposals for Assembly legislation, which may be specious or
speculative on one level, or worthy and worthwhile on another? Such
proposals should be able to be the subject of a campaign, for or
against, and people should be able to make legitimate points. However,
we will be told that it is okay to do that in Northern Ireland, even
though it has a direct impact on people standing in a Westminster
election, because it is happening under the Assembly, but that would
not be the case in another context.</hs_Para>

not have cross-community support and that therefore the vote would not
stand. It was a statement of opinion or wish; it was not a legislative
proposal. Should a legislative proposal come before the Assembly in the
same year as a Westminster election, will people argue that that is
really a way of groups advertising where they stand on how Northern
Ireland Members—possible candidates in that Westminster

that was the issuing of leaflets by a political party pointing out the
role of the Alliance party, my party and Sinn Fein in a vote in Belfast
city council. The Democratic Unionist party’s agenda—I am
sorry that nobody from the DUP is in the Chamber—clearly had
nothing to do with the whether the flag was flying over Belfast city

that politics in a local council chamber in Northern Ireland can be

rule out the possibility that people might use politics or proposals

stereotyping politics and rallying to the old binary polarities in

negotiating the Good Friday agreement and we had difficulties with even
getting talks started, the role of civil society at so many levels, in
canvassing support for the possibility of progress, change and
agreement, was important, just as it has been in building on the

examine some areas where we have not made progress in Northern Ireland
but where we could build fully on the spirit of the agreement. One
thing we notice is that a number of the commissions that have been in
place to deal with the vexed problems that the political process could
not discharge, such as the Parades Commission, the Equality Commission
for Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission,
also find themselves, from time to time, accused of having a particular
slant or bias. Despite the difficulties they face and the nuances of
the issues they are managing, they are able to cope with those
accusations and tensions, and to manage them on the basis of their
mandate and of their proven balance in their other work. However, there
is a serious danger that we could inadvertently add the Electoral
Commission to the list of commissions that get embroiled in the
particular contentions of Northern Ireland politics.</hs_Para>

Electoral Commission has a role whereby it has to arbitrate and
adjudicate on whether campaigns were injurious to a particular
candidate in a given constituency or to a party across the region, or
on whether they had the effect of enhancing one, it will find itself
resented, and not just for those issues where it does intervene
and make a judgment; it will find itself accused on issues
where it does not intervene and make a judgment. It will be put in an
absolutely impossible position in Northern Ireland. It will be sucked
into a quicksand of “whatabouttery” and will have to
observe a completely contrived symmetry, whereby if it deals with an
issue relating to one campaign, it will have to be seen to be dealing
with another contrived issue relating to some other campaign. If it
does not do so, it will find itself accused of being on one side or
other of the old arguments that we are trying to move beyond in
Northern Ireland. I ask the House to support new clause 2, not because
it solves that problem completely, but because it begins to recognise
that that problem and those implications will arise. It will then force

earlier exchange that one hon. Member referred to the Royal British
Legion and the work on the military covenant, which he said, all
parties support. All parties in Great Britain do indeed support it and
all parties in Northern Ireland have supported the RBL’s work.
As I understand it, all parties in Northern Ireland, whether or not
their individual members wear the poppy, subscribe to the campaign and
the collection. Indeed, mayors of all parties, including Sinn Fein,
have always launched the poppy campaign, so there has been that broad
support. Is there universal support on the military covenant? No, there
is not. Even the recent inquiry by the Select Committee on Northern
Ireland Affairs showed that there was not agreement on what the
military covenant would or would not, and should or should not, mean in
Northern Ireland. That is the case for obvious reasons. When that
earlier exchange was taking place, I sensed that the Deputy Leader of
the House was planning to say that the fact that there was consensus
and that all parties agree on the military covenant proved that the
RBL’s campaign would not be caught by this legislation. However,
it could be caught in Northern Ireland, because not all parties would
subscribe to it in the same way, for their particular
reasons.</hs_Para>

campaigns in Northern Ireland where people are asking parties to say
what they are going to do in Parliament, some parties campaign not to
take their seats and some campaign to take their seats. That, in
itself, creates a differential in Northern Ireland that does not exist
anywhere else and could give rise to people saying, “We are
supporting you because you are going to vote a particular way. We would
not want to commend candidates who are not going to vote that way or
take a stand on that sort of issue.” So we face added,
particular difficulties in the context of Northern Ireland and the
Government have simply not thought about them. I do not believe that
even the parties in Northern Ireland have fully thought about them
enough or that the Assembly has done so, perhaps because people are
distracted by other issues.</hs_Para>

now—and it is common knowledge that we are considering the Bill.
It is no secret that we hope to complete our work this month—we
are doing it as quickly as we can—and to publish our report. The

do not think that anyone can complain that there has not been enough

we have not had the pre-legislative scrutiny that all Bills ideally

the regulated period for the 2015 UK parliamentary election will
overlap with the regulated period for the 2014 Scottish independence
referendum, spending in the Scottish referendum is a matter for the
Scottish Parliament. Such expenditure could not, in our view,
reasonably be regarded as intended to promote electoral success and
would therefore not be controlled under the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000 or regulated by the Bill. We believe
that expenditure incurred during the regulated period for the
referendum would be treated as referendum expenditure and not
controlled expenditure for the election, unless there was a clear or

shall move on to new clause 3, which would require the Electoral
Commission to identify the Bill’s impact on both its own
resources and on third parties. It would require the commission to lay
a full cost projection before Parliament within one month of the Bill
receiving Royal Assent. As I have just explained, the Government have
already published an impact assessment to accompany the Bill. That
assessment considers the impact on both the Electoral Commission and
third parties. The assessment estimates that the lowered registration
thresholds will bring 30 more third parties into the regime
administered by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000—that is, third parties that campaign for the electoral
success of a party or
candidate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000426" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000426">The
assessment also estimates that only 10% of third-party organisations
will see their expenditure affected by the reduced spending limits
proposed in the Bill. At the 2010 UK general election, only two
organisations even passed the lower limits proposed in the Bill. There
will be a relatively small administrative cost to each registered third
party as a result of the new reporting provisions that the Bill
introduces. The impact assessment considers that the enforcement cost
to the Electoral Commission will rise by a maximum of £390,000
annually. Let me say again that this analysis is comprehensive, and I
see no need to repeat it after the Bill has received Royal
Assent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000427" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000427">The

merely assumes that one might. The amendment’s effectiveness is
therefore limited, as in the absence of any inquiry, part 2 will come

Amendment 67 takes the opposite approach and appears to intend that,
subject to amendment 66, which we have just discussed, all of part 2
but clauses 30, 31, 34 and 35 would not come into force on Royal
Assent. However, its effect would in fact be the contrary. In the
absence of any considered commencement and transitional provision, all
of part 2 would come into force on Royal Assent. I suspect that that is
not the intention, but it would be the
effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000439">In
relation to amendments 10, 11 and 12, tabled and spoken to by my hon.
Friend the Member for Christchurch, it appears that he is seeking to
delay the Act’s measures, rather than to have them swiftly
implemented. He has already tabled amendments 4, 5 and 6 to clause 41
so that all of part 2 would come into force at the same time and then
become subject to the transitional provisions of clause 42. I know that
he was seeking to bring clarity, but the effect of amendments 10, 11
and 12, together with amendments 4, 5 and 6, is that the measures in
part 2 would not come into effect before the 2015 general
election. Amendments 10, 11 and 12 would remove the transitional
provision of clause 42 altogether, with the result that the part 2
provisions would come into effect only at the commencement of the next
regulated period after Royal Assent, which is unlikely to be the
regulated period for the 2015 general election. The Government are
committed to enhancing the transparency of spending by third parties,
and that includes enacting the measures within part 2 in time for the
regulated period of the 2015 general election. I therefore do not
consider it appropriate to delay their implementation until after the
2015 general
election.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000440" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000440"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Chope" PimsId="2598" UID="13100960002262" xid="110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960002262">Mr

address those concerns by reintroducing a test with which the

has existing guidance and experience. Introducing a new and untested
primary purpose test would completely undermine those benefits. Rather
than having the clear test of whether the expenditure can be reasonably
regarded as intended to promote electoral success there would be two
tests: can it be so regarded and is it also the primary purpose? The
opportunity for uncertainty and legal challenge would only be increased
by the following questions. What is the primary purpose of your
campaign? Is it to promote the issue or to promote those who support
your issue? That is an additional test which does nothing to provide

more damaging is the opportunity for avoidance. The primary purpose of
an environmental organisation’s advertising campaign might be
claimed to be to recruit new members and encourage donations, but it
might also urge support for its preferred party. It may be said that
the primary purpose is to protect animal welfare, but that may be done
only by encouraging support for particular candidates. Those are
activities that are and ought to be regulated. The primary purpose test
would drive a coach and horses through the legislation. Groups carrying
out these activities have previously undertaken campaigning as
recognised third parties, which is perfectly appropriate: they can
campaign without restrictions. Under the hon. Gentleman’s
amendment, however, all could be potentially excluded from
registration. The Government have responded to concerns from the
Electoral Commission and other groups that the test for controlled

uncertainty for

on reasonable assumptions. If a judge is to make a test of
someone’s behaviour, it will be based on reasonableness; the

question of definition in the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000, which has been in place for 13 years, and there
have been three general elections since. The questions put to me as I

“what if?” scenarios and what might

to which we have been party since we have been elected—in my
case, since 2010—have been e-mail-based, as is 95% of the
correspondence that I receive from my constituents. In fact, I prefer
to deal with constituents face-to-face, because it is much quicker and
more interactive. I think that much of the concern about the impact of
issues such as cost on larger charities will not come to the fore if
the amendment is passed. It really would improve the Bill, and I think
that if it were voted down, the Bill would be left in a much worse

in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests: I am the chair

politics and people on the issue that we care about, that of children
and babies. This is our moment: MPs are at their most open, and we can
gain access to them and talk to them. It is absolutely
wonderful.” I shall say, unreservedly and without equivocation,
“Do not go anywhere near this just because that nice Mr
Brake—that nice Deputy Leader of the House—has
said that it is all going to be
okay.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000591" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000591">If
it were to be left to the Deputy Leader of the House to decide on these
matters, I would be entirely reassured. I would not even be on my feet,
because I trust the right hon. Gentleman implicitly on a personal
level. The problem is that it will not be the Deputy Leader of the
House who makes the decisions. Someone in a wig and gown down the road
will decide what should happen in Stevenage if a certain body has said,

know that we have already had that debate. I apologise for intervening
earlier on the hon. Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland), but I
realise that he is one of those Members who appreciate a dialogue in
the Chamber rather than a monologue, and I think we both reached the
conclusion that neither of us actually knew what the outcome would be.
So we are going to employ our own solicitors to decide. It might be a
very tight election in Stevenage; the hon. Gentleman might win by a
handful over a Labour candidate who was desperate to kill, personally,
as many badgers as he could lay his hands on.</hs_Para>

very significant, therefore. Situations such as an intervention by
someone on—to be less humorous—an anti-racist platform or
a pro-racist platform who says something totally outwith what the hon.
Gentleman would want said on his behalf will start to influence our
politics. It will not be well-meaning, good-hearted people in this
House who decide on that. It will be people outside it; it will be
people in the judiciary. They will not be taking the cases, however.
The people who will be taking the cases will be people who are
vexatious—people who normally do not like each other, people who
are on opposite sides of a political, social or environmental argument.
They will be pro-frackers and anti-frackers. They will be the League
Against Cruel Sports and the Countryside Alliance. These guys do not
lie down easily together. They will take opportunities to get hold of
somebody and change our politics in a particular way; they have proven
already in the right way that they are prepared to do that and long may
that 
<?notus-xml column=219?>continue. It is something we should encourage. Those people should not
be chilled from undertaking activities and campaigning in election
year, and that should certainly not be the case for the broader range
of people—the Royal British Legion, Civil Society, those in the
big society and the third sector. These people are our lifeblood. They
are the people who have supported us, and they include people who are
affiliated to political parties as well. They are people who care about
out politics and our democracy. It is those people, as well as my

the House on a nuance of drafting. I am very happy that my words do not
appear in any Bill. Even though we will divide along party lines, what
is uniting the House is that we all know this is a dog’s
breakfast and clauses 26 and 27 are the heart of what is
wrong with the Bill. The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and

wrong—think again.” If he feels that if the amendment
were to be won tonight—whatever form of words we use—it
would survive the process in the second Chamber and come back, he is
having a little joke and we can all have a laugh at that.

talking about 38 Degrees getting a bad press—rightly, some might
argue—or people sometimes being annoyed, depending on their
political view, with those on the fringes of some voluntary
organisations, because a lot of other people have written to us just
this day. A number of them have said things such as they fear this
Bill, they are worried about unintended consequences and this does not
have legal certainty. Are those the wild and wacky people we need to
legislate against? I shall tell hon. Members who these people are; I
shall tell the House who said those three things. They were said by
Rabbi Sybil Sheridan of the Assembly of Reform Rabbis UK, Neil Thomas
of the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development, Farooq Murad of the
Muslim Council of Britain and Paul Parker of the Quakers. I could go on
to cite a list of about 20 people from faith groups. According to the
Leader of the House, they are 
<?notus-xml column=221?>making something up in order to embarrass the Government or because they
have been wound up. I do not believe these people are so frail-minded.
These people are anxious, just as the chairman of a charity who is
standing before you is anxious, that we are putting in the Bill and
into law something that will chill our ability to campaign. I guarantee
the House that it will chill my organisation’s ability to
campaign, because if some bright spark wants to take a case, for some
reason or other, against what has been said inadvertently, my
budget—I go around cap in hand trying to raise money for my
charity—will be spent in a court of law, not on providing the
service that I think is appropriate through my charity for babies,
children and young people. How many staff would I have to fire if I got
landed with a £200,000 legal bill? That is why amendment 101 and
the symbolism of tonight’s vote are important. They are
important for all those charities outside that have been inundating us

views.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000603">As

it had to be reconsidered, and its passing was 16 votes. I am asking 16
Members of this House to vote with those who voted last time on

two short remarks. His argument is that we should vote for amendment
101 because it sends a signal by introducing the primary purpose test.
He invites us to vote for that, knowing that if it is successful it

more significant problem with amendment 101, however, in that it
introduces something that worries me greatly in legislation—that
is, a subjective as opposed to an objective test. I have been involved
in various bits of legislation, many of them rather dry and
sometimes technical, such as the creation of the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority, where we have sought to introduce tests that
get certain things done. Whenever one is tempted to introduce a test
that is not purely objective and does not have objective criteria, one
comes up against all sorts of difficulties. Although I have a lot of
sympathy with the concept, I could not support this amendment because,
for me, it crosses a major legislative Rubicon between the objective
test and the subjective test.</hs_Para>

relatively understandable. Objective tests can, of course, be argued in
a court of law—we all know that—but they have a far
greater degree of certainty than a subjective test. That is why I will

some of the background behind those amendments. Basically, the
Government were seeking to redefine the legislation based on the
request they had received from the Electoral Commission and others.
This was seen at the time—when that legislation arrived before
us—as making significant and potentially unintended changes that
we had not been able to look into. Incidentally, I reiterate the point
that I made on Second Reading and in Committee, which is that if ever a
Bill deserved pre-legislative scrutiny, it was this one. But as has
been said before, when we want to go to a certain place, we might not
have wished to start from here, but we are here, so
let’s get on with it and go to where we want to
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000610" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000610">It
seemed to me that the sensible course of action to deal with the
concerns being expressed by all the people who were in contact with me
was to say, okay, let’s not make those changes. Let’s
stick with the existing wording, and if we stick with the wording that
exists already, we will have addressed that problem. That was what I
proposed and what the Government said they would do. The test for me
today is, therefore, whether the amendments do what we wanted the
Government to do, and that is where I shall concentrate my
remarks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000611">Following
on from two of the interventions that I have made today, I shall try to
answer one of the critical questions behind the Bill: what is the
purpose of part 2? If one does not believe in the purpose of part 2,
there is not a great deal of point in seeking to amend it to achieve
the objective. To me, part 2 is a critical and essential part of the
Bill. Part 2 sets out to regulate the political campaigning activities
in favour of or against candidates by third parties. As such, it hardly
touches on charities, which are already regulated, as has been
mentioned, by charity law. That is not the target and that is why we
are not seeking to regulate on that. The target is the non-charity
third parties. That is why, among other things, the 2000 Act was
brought into being and passed, and it is thoroughly appropriate to look
again at
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000612" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0002.htm#13100960000612">I
look across the Atlantic, as I mentioned earlier, and I see what
happens when organisations such as the National Rifle Association or
others start to pour large amounts of money into one district, Senate
seat or state, or into one issue. Such organisations have had
considerable success in that country in changing the political
representation in the House of Representatives and the Senate. I
observe in passing that the extremism that has entered American
politics over recent years seems to have followed naturally from
that.</hs_Para>

Kingdom we have a plurality and a diversity in our politics which I
think is exceptionally precious and needs to be preserved. I hope we
would agree on that. I do see a danger of third-party organisations
being created and funded in a way that could have a serious impact on
the body politic, which I do not want to see. For me, part 2, far from
gagging charities, is an enabler of the freedom of speech of the
smaller people in politics throughout the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

wholly behind the principle, as indeed did the hon. Member for
Caerphilly (Wayne David) an hour and a half ago, when I asked him this
precise question and he responded that those on the Opposition Front
Bench were in favour of the principle being put forward and were behind
the 2000 Act. They agreed that the Act needed updating. The point of
his reply to a straightforward question was that the principle behind
part 2 was in essence one with which the Opposition still agreed. If
the Opposition feel that there should be no regulation of third
parties, if they genuinely feel that third parties in
politics—great rich blocs of people—can come and shove
money into distant constituencies and get away with it unregulated, I
invite them to say so. If not, I hope for their support for the
principle of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960000615" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960000615"><Member ContinuationText="Ms Angela Eagle" PimsId="3064" UID="13100960002346" xid="185" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960002346"><B>Ms

dealing with here are changes that this Government are introducing, in
a partial and partisan way, without any consultation or any attempt to
discuss them with wider civil society, campaigners or third parties.
What we need to do is take the Bill off the agenda and do it properly
so that we can develop the electoral law for third parties and

reflect on the grave concerns expressed by large and small charities

of the people who make democracy work at the local level—the
volunteers, the organisers and the people who demonstrate.
Demonstrating is part of our democratic right. I joined the TUC 40-odd
years ago in the week after the demonstration against the Industrial
Relations Bill on 21 February. That was a very important occasion. I
wonder whether its cost, if there had been a general election that

against anything that frustrated this part of the Bill, so I want to
speak in support of amendment 101. All the problems with
this provision stem from one mistake, which is that it is rushed and
has not been consulted on. In the past I have been responsible for
negotiating compacts with the voluntary sector. Compacts are not widely
known about, and even in the voluntary community and social enterprise
sector they are viewed with a huge degree of scepticism. It can be the
devil’s own work getting charities to engage with the process
because they do not trust the local authorities, the Government or
other organisations taking part in it. Driving a coach and horses
through the first principle of a compact will do nothing whatsoever to
encourage a relationship of trust with organisations in this sector.
There has been no consultation and no time to consider the amendments.

relationship with our voluntary and community sector that was starting

signing a pledge not to vote in any circumstances for increased tuition
fees. This is what he said, and this is how he voted.” Will he
confirm—yes or no—whether that campaign or that union

voters. The pledge was to campaign to allow asylum seekers to get work
legally. I said, “No, I don’t believe in that
policy,” and had to walk off the stage and allow the other
candidates to have their photograph taken, which would have had an
effect on the voting intentions of certain groups of people in my
constituency. A charitable organisation was distributing information
that had an effect on my election. Will the Minister say whether that,

Allen:</Member></B> Following on from that interesting vote, I should
like to point out that had 19 more colleagues voted for the amendment
rather than against it, it would have been carried. I am sure that that
will be noted by the thousands of people who have sent in requests to
colleagues to consider their plight seriously. The fact is that those
requests have been ignored by large numbers of Members of Parliament
who might well feel that the voluntary and community sectors will be
their supporters in the next election. I do not know whether the law
will now mean that those people will be able to be prosecuted in some
way, but I am sure that the voluntary sector and the charities will
study the record with great interest. I also hope that they will study
the record of our deliberations on clause
27.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001275">Clause
27 is not about symbols or about gagging, as our previous discussions
have been. It is about cash. It is about the ability of charities to
put across their point of view, to have the money to do that, and to be
able to enjoy the interaction with the democratic process that they
have come to know in recent years. This is not about a Government
handout or about some back-door way of influencing the Government. It
is not about charities having to pay, as a professional lobbyist might.

<?notus-xml column=238?>It is about their freedom to enter the democratic process in an election
year. That is a right that they have enjoyed, but it is going to be
changed if we allow clause 27 to go through tonight. That is
why I wish to notify the Chair that I should like to call a vote on
amendment 102. That will allow every Member of Parliament to make a
simple statement by answering a very straightforward, black-and-white,
yes-or-no question. They could state that the activity that charities
have hitherto enjoyed in interacting with our democracy in an election
year is fine and that they should continue to be able to do so, and
that whatever else we have said about the Bill, the expenditure limits
set out before clause 27 are okay. Alternatively, they could endorse
the provisions in clause
27.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001276">Those
Members who have laboured through the Committee and Report stages of
the Bill have probably heard this before. When the Select Committee was
denied the right to give the Bill proper pre-legislative scrutiny, we
attempted hurriedly to pull together witnesses. They and members of my
Select Committee—some of whom are in the Chamber this
evening—gave up their time to do some really quick
pre-legislative scrutiny. That is absolutely not the way to do
it.</hs_Para>

that I can say about this Bill—and one thing that we will
remember about it—is that there are lots of firsts and lots of
examples of how not to conduct a proper legislative process. It may be
that the Electoral Commission, set up to deal with these issues, has
not been listened to. The Government attitude seems to be,
“Don’t let’s talk to them; don’t even tell
them that we are changing their terms of reference until very late in
the day”; and “Let’s not involve the people who
are affected until we have drafted a Bill and it is virtually ready to
go into print. At that point, perhaps we will talk to them”; and
“Let’s not involve Parliament—a body so
contemptible and useless that we do not want to involve this bunch of
clowns in a pre-legislative process so that evidence from outside
bodies could be gathered and people could come in and provide some
advice.” Parliament, it seems, deserves total
contempt—“They do not get to do any pre-legislative
scrutiny until after a Bill is published; and if they want to do that,
we will give them three working days between the Bill’s
publication and its Second Reading.”</hs_Para>

on all that, we can see that the absence of proper pre-legislative
scrutiny is not the worst crime that we have seen with this Bill. When
it comes to abuse of the legislative process, this is about as bad it
gets. Our hope has to be that our unelected friends down the other end
of the corridor in the other place will see that, due to the lack of
time Parliament has had to discuss the Bill and the lack of input from
those affected by it, clause 27 shows the legislative process at its
most pernicious. Why? Because as yet—perhaps this is the
night—no justification, no evidence and no reason has been given
for why clause 27 should exist. I know that the Deputy Leader of the
House has been working hard on this during the Bill’s
parliamentary stages, and I am sure that tonight is going to be the
night on which he is going to tell us why there is a clause 27. Our
Select Committee looked pretty hard at clause 27. We asked the
Government, as well as other people, to give evidence to us, but we
could not find the reason for it. I remain optimistic that we are
actually going to hear it tonight, which would be a good occasion for
all of us and a parliamentary first on this Bill.</hs_Para>

this measure necessary? Lord Hodgson produced a very thorough report on
the Charities Act 2006, in which he said that the current arguments

hard for people who believe that there is a serious problem that we

none of us knew about until the end of July, one day before the House
went into recess. Lo and behold, we did not get a lobbying Bill; we got

ether at the end of July, and if press releases are issued as part of a
spin on the Bill and people feel that they are inaccurate, that does
not provide clarity; it just adds to the confusion. That is why I think
it appropriate to use a word that became commonplace in another
context, and to suggest that there should be a pause in the Bill. That
would enable scrutiny to take place, would enable me to answer the
question posed by the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter
Ross (John Thurso), and would enable the House to set up a proper
process of scrutiny so that all the questions could be answered. How

I have received the most correspondence. In Northern Ireland—and
the other regions of Scotland and Wales—the threshold has for
some reason been reduced by more than half to £2,000 for no good
reason. No justification has been given for that at all. A number of
cross-community organisations

Allen:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a clear and succinct point. The
sad fact is that this provision is a mystery; clause 27 has no
antecedents and no pedigree, and we are not sure why it is in the Bill.
Nobody has asked for a reduction in the interaction. Many colleagues
throughout the House want a greater interaction—dare I cite the
Prime Minister talking about the big society? I welcomed those words,
because I would like to see that. This provision does not welcome the
big society; it shrinks the big society to a slightly smaller big
society that feels unloved, chilled, unable to get its point of view

existence.</hs_Para>

moving amendment 102 and asking colleagues in all parts of the House to
support it is, again, to send a signal to the Government that they
should think again on the issue—this is not the end of the

this House and perhaps even set up an arrangement whereby further
evidence can be taken. My Committee, which is all-party, and its
unanimous report might be able to help in that, and we are keen to find
a way forward that arrives at a consensus. The only way in which we
will get that pause, and get the Government to have another think and a
little more of a listen to all the people who are writing to us today

Brake:</Member></B> Third parties may campaign in a relevant election
up to a particular threshold without being subject to any electoral
controls or restrictions on their activities. The Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000 sets the threshold for third parties
campaigning in England at £10,000, and at £5,000 for
third parties campaigning in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Third parties may exceed these thresholds only if they register with
the Electoral Commission as “recognised third parties”.

registration, third parties also become subject to spending and
donations controls for the duration of the regulated period of the

third party” if it wishes to spend more than the revised
threshold in the Bill—£5,000 in England or £2,000
in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. That will have the effect that
more third parties will account for their expenditure and provide

recent elections shows that the third-party spending limit for UK

England, £35,400 in Scotland, £24,000 in Wales and

aggregate £390,000 campaigning in a UK parliamentary election, a
figure that we think allows third parties to campaign vigorously
nationally but that also provides a greater degree of control over
spending to ensure that big money does not seek to play a part in
influencing the outcome of elections, particularly in a limited number
of constituencies, distorting the electoral process. A third party
could, however, choose to direct the entire national spending limit at
only a small part of the UK. Again it is not clear whether the
Opposition are comfortable with the current situation, where that is

Wishart</B> (Perth and North Perthshire) (SNP):</Member> It is
unfortunate that the Deputy Leader of the House has not had the
opportunity to address my very important amendments 2 and 3, which were
part of this group of amendments. I very much support the hon. Member
for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) and we will support him in the Lobby
tonight.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001327">I
do not have an opportunity to talk about Scotland, which is what I
wanted to talk a little bit about before I got on to my own amendments,
other than to say what a dog’s breakfast the Bill has concocted
on issues connected with the referendum. The failure to see this is a
travesty on the Government’s part. The fact that we have the
same expenditure threshold as Northern Ireland is a total disgrace.
Northern Ireland has a population of 
<?notus-xml column=246?>1.8 million. We have a population of 5.2 million, which is
more than double, yet once again we are lumped in with the same
threshold.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001328">I
shall speak briefly to my amendments 2 and 3. It has surprised me that
there has been very little talk about big money and the House of Lords.
One of the defining features of the previous Parliament was the cash
for honours crisis. It was a disgrace that a sitting Prime Minister was
interviewed by the police because there was a belief that millions of
pounds had changed hands for a place in that place down the road. The
police eventually did not pursue the matter, not because they could not
find particular evidence, but because they believed that it was not in
the public interest.</hs_Para>

were appalled by cash for honours, but the Bill does absolutely nothing
to address big money in the House of Lords. Only China’s
National People’s Congress is larger than that big bloated
Chamber, which has 786 Members, but in their wisdom they
decided that it required another 30 Members. When we look at a list of
those 30 new Members, we see that—surprise,
surprise—£1.26 million had been donated in the last round
of honours. The public will be aghast that that has been ignored and
that the Bill does not even touch on cash for
honours.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001330">I
will explain what I propose very quickly, because I know that the hon.
Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) is still to speak.
We have seen £1.26 million donated by the 30 new
Members of the upper House. Sir William Haughey is among them, as is
Sir Anthony Bamford and Howard Leigh, all Labour or Tory donors. Do not
think the Liberals get off lightly, because they have already suggested
a few Members who have given them significant amounts of money over the
years. This is a cash cow for the UK parties and it has to
stop.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001331">We
cannot have this as a feature of our democracy. The fact that someone
can donate to a political party and then be rewarded with ermine in the
unelected House of Lords, which the hon. Member for Nottingham North
hopes might fix this mess of a Bill, is absurd. Is that any way to run
a democracy in what is the fifth or sixth largest economy in the world?
There will soon be 1,000 of these people if we do not do something
about it. I do not know how much money that would bring in for the UK
parties, but I suggest that it would be a lot.</hs_Para>

little amendments are all about trying to address at least some of
those concerns. I do not have time to go through them in detail,
because I see that Labour Front Benchers are getting twitchy. I will
not push this to a vote, but let us look at what goes on with big money
and cash for honours. It is a disgrace and the public are appalled, so
let us stop
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001333"><B><Member ContinuationText="Angela Smith" PimsId="4808" UID="13100960002956" xid="886" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960002956">Angela

clear in Committee, many of the clauses in part 2 of the Bill depend
for their validity on clause 26, which we have just
discussed. We were assured then that the Government would think again
about that clause, but the consequence of their rethink appears to be a
loosening of the gag, and a gag is still a gag. Therefore, the Bill
could still have a chilling effect on the third sector and is still, in
effect, a gagging Bill designed to insulate the governing parties from
the challenges that 
<?notus-xml column=247?>are always part of a healthy democracy. As we have just heard in the
debate on clause 26, the Government’s amendments still leave the
third sector and the Electoral Commission facing a great deal of
uncertainty and ambiguity, which, combined with the measures in
clause 27, will effectively dampen the third sector’s
campaigning
activity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001335">The
Opposition have said repeatedly that we support taking the big money
out of politics and having sensible controls on the money spent by
third parties. We said that on Second Reading and in Committee. Earlier
this afternoon my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby
(Stephen Twigg) reiterated the big figures. In the 2010 general
election, political parties nationally spent £31 million,
compared with just £3 million spent by third-party campaigners.
The biggest third-party spender spent a sum that equates to just 4% of
the £17 million spent by the Conservative
party.</hs_Para>

it clear in Committee that we understand and support the need to review
the provisions contained in the 2000 Act. As the Electoral Commission
has made clear, a review of the legislation relating to third-party
spending in an election period would be useful. We support that, but we
would support such a review in the context of a much more ambitious
agenda relating to radical reform of spending by political parties in
the election period. That is the proper way to deal with issues that
are so important and fundamental to the health of our democratic
process, as I said earlier.</hs_Para>

only does the Bill fail to deal with the first-order issue, reform of
spending by political parties, but it has been brought forward in a
rush. To make things worse, it has been amended inadequately. Even
worse, the Bill did not get the pre-legislative scrutiny that it needed
and deserved and it has enjoyed only minimal scrutiny in this House.
Not only have the Government failed to tackle the big money in
politics; they have also effectively manipulated the legislative
process to minimise the proper, robust testing of the Bill needed to
pinpoint its weaknesses and expose its badly thought through changes to
the 2000
Act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001338">I
say “expose” because our view is that the Bill remains a
bad one. Part 2 is built on the shifting sands of the utterly
inadequate clause 26. I challenge the Government to admit that the Bill
is the wrong way to tackle reform of election spending and join us in
going back to the drawing board, starting with meaningful negotiations
on the reform of party political
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001339">Clause
27 has caused huge consternation in the third sector. If it is passed

cannot be right for any modern, 21st century democracy. The
sceptical among us could be forgiven for thinking that in part
2—in clause 27 in particular—the Government appear to be
trying to insulate their record and policies from legitimate,
democratic criticism. Raising the thresholds for registration by third
parties and dramatically reducing expenditure limits in any given
election period undoubtedly poses a real threat to the legitimate role
of third parties in ensuring that the voice of civic society is heard
during the most critical point in the cycle that governs our democracy.
One could argue that it is only in a general election that the people
of our country truly hold power in their own hands. Consequently, it is
crucial that we have the widest possible input into the debates in a
general election period that are so essential to ensuring that informed
choices are made by
voters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001343" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001343">If
the Bill had been law before the 2010 election, a number of
high-profile third sector campaigns could have been curtailed by the
combined provisions of clauses 26 and 27, as we pointed out in
Committee. At the next election, if the legislation goes through, the
National Union of Students could find it difficult to hold Members to
account for their record on the tripling of student tuition
fees.</hs_Para>

tabled two amendments to clause 27. First, we propose the removal of
the reduction in thresholds for registration of third parties. Our
amendment 60 proposes a report from the Electoral Commission on the
potential impact of the reduction in controlled expenditure by third

spending. Clause 27 would therefore not come into force before such a
report had been laid before
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100960001345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100960001345">It

find amusing my mention of the prospect of meaningful negotiations on

such meaningful negotiations or not? The choice is on the table. We are

emerge in relation to party political funding and funding for the third

purpose of the Bill is to achieve transparency by fulfilling our
coalition commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists so
that the public know who lobbyists represent when they meet decision
makers, and by making it clearer where and how money is being spent by
third parties at elections to influence the outcomes of those
elections. We are also seeking transparency by giving the public, and
members of trade unions, the confidence that they know who their
members are. Together, those measures will increase transparency in the
political system.</hs_Para>

Edwards:</Member></B> On Second Reading I listed a number of lobbying

far too long: donations for dinners, cash for honours, cash for

Bill stop in
future?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Lansley" PimsId="1419" UID="13100979000731" xid="347" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000731">Mr
Lansley:</Member></B> The character of each of those scandals is of a
particular kind. We are setting out to ensure that relationships
between lobbyists and key decision makers in Government are more
transparent in future, so that those who impact on our political system
do so in the glare of public life. For most of the things the hon.
Gentleman describes, people were trying to seek influence covertly, and
in some cases were completely contrary to the law and the codes of
conduct of this House and elsewhere, or of government. We must expose
those relationships everywhere, where we can, and when people breach
the code, we will deal with it.</hs_Para>

been widely debated in the House and beyond, and I thank Members for
sharing their views, because healthy debate is a cornerstone of our
democracy. The measures in the Bill have also been misrepresented, and
during the passage of the Bill we have fully exposed where those
misrepresentations lie. The hon. Member for Nottingham North explained
on many occasions in the course of his 190 minutes of offerings that
there had not been sufficient scrutiny of the Bill. I gently say to
him, however, that one does not take the moral high ground over lack of
scrutiny by taking up more time than is needed to explain the issues.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Actually, I think there are
relatively few issues, and we have exposed them clearly and answered
them fully. I encourage Members in the other place to read the

this House, those issues have been answered, and by virtue of the
amendments tabled the Bill has been improved. As is always the case,
all is capable of improvement.</hs_Para>

Hughes:</Member></B> There can be no serious objection to parts 1 and 3

The Leader of the House has committed to considering the report by the
Political and Constitutional Reform Committee when it is published, but
will he confirm the undertaking that he and his colleagues will work to
ensure that the misrepresentations are dealt with, and that the
concerns—and some uncertainties—can be discussed with

Lansley:</Member></B> I hope I will be clear, just as I thought my
right hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House was clear during
discussions on part 2 of the Bill. We had a number of meetings with a
range of organisations, and we listened carefully to points raised in
this House and by those organisations. I met the National Council for
Voluntary Organisations before Committee stage, and I was clear that we
would make changes to the definition of expenditure for electoral
purposes, to remove what it regarded as the risks and uncertainty
associated with those definitions. It was not our intention to change
in substance the test for what constitutes expenditure for electoral
purposes, albeit that we intend—rightly, I think—to
introduce greater transparency by including the range of controlled
activities in a way consistent with recommendations by the Electoral
Commission in its regulatory review.</hs_Para>

important for us to have a registration threshold, so that those who
want to spend a significant amount of money to influence electoral
outcomes do so openly. They will not be prevented from doing that, but
they will have to do it in a transparent way. It is important to get
big money out of trying to influence electoral outcomes. It is
therefore important to bring down the threshold, and for it to be
disaggregated so that it cannot be spent disproportionately in
individual constituencies or small geographic areas.</hs_Para>

want to change the test, in the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendums Act 2000, that only expenditure that could reasonably be
regarded as intended to procure or promote the electoral success of a
party or candidate should be controlled expenditure. That will still be
true. In fact, it will be even more narrowly true, because we have
taken out the strand relating to enhancing the standing of political
parties at relevant elections, as it was capable of being used to
create uncertainty.</hs_Para>

quoted from the letter by Sir Stuart Etherington, the chief executive
of NVCO. I urge them to read it carefully. It says that there is
uncertainty associated with the definition in the 2000 Act, and that
that continues to be the case. It is the job of the Electoral
Commission—taking the test we have here, which is as clear as we
could make it—to inform organisations through the guidance it
produces. We stand ready to work with the Electoral Commission.

Hermon:</Member></B> The Leader of the House is being most generous in
taking interventions. May I ask him to address one particular issue
that pertains to Northern Ireland? He emphasised the need for
transparency and the need to know who influences elections, and I think
we all agree that that is important. However, the Government have
agreed that the anonymity of donations to political parties in Northern
Ireland will continue. That can no longer be justified on security
grounds, because Northern Ireland has successfully hosted, without
incident, the G8 summit in Fermanagh and the world police and fire
games. How does he square those two
things?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Lansley" PimsId="1419" UID="13100979000735" xid="347" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000735">Mr
Lansley:</Member></B> Each has its own particular characteristics and
the Speaker will forgive me if I do not respond to that point, as I
think it is outwith the terms of the Bill. We do not intend to change
that. We are introducing transparency relating to expenditure by third
parties seeking to influence the outcome of elections. The Bill has no
impact on the donations that individuals or organisations make to
political parties, or on how political parties spend money at
elections.</hs_Para>

able, on Report, to discuss the final group of amendments on part 3 of
the Bill. We continue to value the important role trade unions play in
public life. We recognise that their influence extends beyond their own
members, which is why it is important for members, employers and the
public to have confidence that unions know who their members are. The
Bill is in no sense an attack on trade unions. That is not correct. The
measures are not designed to make it harder for unions to operate. I
will be clear: the Bill will not prevent unions from taking industrial
action; it will not require unions to collect more data; and nor will
it place membership data in the hands of employers. Instead, it
provides the public with reassurance that trade unions are fulfilling
the duties to which they are already bound. Part 3 of the Bill
strengthens requirements in existing legislation to ensure that unions
can demonstrate that they keep an up-to-date and accurate membership
register.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000028">Part
1 will create transparency with regard to who is lobbying whom in
relation to key decision makers. The Labour party, and last
year’s report by the Select Committee on the earlier
consultation, seeks a different Bill—one that creates a
large-scale bureaucracy listing everybody who engages in any kind of
lobbying activity. We have looked at that approach, and, frankly, it is
not remotely justified. Transparency is the way forward: transparency
in lobbying and in third-party campaigning. When people set out to
influence the electoral outcomes, they must do so in a transparent
way.</hs_Para>

voluntary organisations and third parties who want to campaign on
policies and issues will continue to be free to do so, as long as they
do not step over the line and set out to influence electoral outcomes
directly. There will be transparency in how trade unions represent
their members, because they will know who their members are. These are
the ways we will provide reassurance in the political system and
enhance confidence through transparency and accountability. I commend
the Bill to the House.</hs_Para>

heart of this Government. It does absolutely nothing to ensure greater
transparency in the Government’s cosy relationship with the big
six energy companies, which make record profits while forcing energy
prices ever higher for households and businesses, and which reacted so
hysterically to Labour’s announcement of an energy price
freeze.</hs_Para>

seeks to silence critics of the Government in the run-up to the general

demonstrates all too clearly that they are a Government who stand up
for the wrong people and are willing to abuse the legislative process
in their own partisan interests. The one success that the Bill can
claim is that it is an object lesson in how not to legislate. In his
more candid moments, even the Leader of the House must know that the

consider the history of the Bill. The House has been subjected to an
abusive and disgraceful process that brings shame on the Government.
The Bill was published after three years of inaction on the day before
the House rose for the summer recess. Second Reading was scheduled for
the day after the House returned for its September sitting, and the
Committee stage was then scheduled for the week after, on the Floor of
the House, thus ensuring that there could be no pre-legislative
scrutiny of the proposals in parts 2 and 3, which the Government drew
up in secret. Those proposals had not been consulted on because nobody
even knew they existed. Report and Third Reading were then scheduled
for the first two days back after the conference recess.</hs_Para>

Committees were caught unawares and had strong objections to the Bill,
but the Government’s timetabling, by deliberate design, gave
those Committees little time to develop or publicise their views. The
Political 
<?notus-xml column=258?>and Constitutional Reform Committee had to meet in the recess in order
to be in a position to publish its highly critical report on the Bill.
The Standards Committee had significant worries about the Bill, some of
which the Government have been forced to address. The Chair of the
Joint Committee on Human Rights has written to the Leader of the House
complaining that the Bill could have a chilling effect and risks
damaging the quality of debate in the run-up to the general election.
That is a serious charge in any democracy, but the Government have
simply chosen to ignore it. Their decision to ram the Bill through the
House has ensured that the Select Committee will not even be able to
publish its report until after the Bill has completed all its Commons
stages.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000036">The
Government did not consult the many thousands of campaigners, trade
unionists and charities directly affected by the sinister gagging
proposals in part 2 prior to the publication of the Bill. Even more
astonishingly, the Electoral Commission, the Government’s own
regulator, was not consulted either and continues to regard many of the
proposals in the Bill as undesirable and other proposals such as the
constituency cap as unworkable, yet it is expected to police these
partisan changes in electoral law. No one in the Government has
plausibly been able to identify the problems that parts 2 and 3 of the
Bill are meant to address or, much less, to solve.</hs_Para>

a transparency Bill. The well-established tradition that changes to the
law governing elections should be agreed on a cross-party basis has
been abandoned by this Government in a partisan abuse of the
legislative process that is aimed at hobbling their growing body of
critics in civil society. This is an abuse that will not be

Government promised to sort out lobbying, but the Bill defines it in
such excruciatingly narrow terms that it renders all claims by the
Government to achieve transparency completely laughable. Indeed, it
could even worsen the current situation by undermining the existing
registers. It excludes in-house lobbyists completely and instead
applies only to consultant lobbyists. It has been estimated by the
industry itself that it will catch only 20% of lobbyists and a
minuscule 1% of lobbying episodes. The Bill is so inadequate that it
has achieved the previously unheard-of feat of uniting the transparency
campaigners and the lobbying industry in opposition to it. It is so
narrow that it would not apply to a lobbyist lobbying a Member of this
House about the lobbying Bill. During the unacceptably rapid passage of
the Bill through the Commons, we have argued that there should be
comprehensive coverage of the entire industry, a code of conduct and
sanctions for misbehaviour. We continue to believe that such a system
must be legislated for in the future, and if this Government refuse to
do that, we will do it.</hs_Para>

Bill has caused the most outrage and worry in civil society, and quite
right too. Part 2 will place a sinister gag on the Government’s
critics as the election approaches. It will create regulatory

society and on local campaigning in the year before a general election.
Indeed, it has been deliberately designed to do so.</hs_Para>

dealing with the funding arms-race between political parties during
election periods, the Bill slashes the amounts that can be spent by
third-party campaigners, leaving the political parties untouched,
despite the fact that third parties spent only one tenth of what
political parties spent at the last general election. The Bill
significantly lowers the spending thresholds for third parties during
the general election period, which will ensure that many thousands of
small charities, bloggers and campaigners will be caught by the strict
regulation required by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums
Act 2000. Indeed, the Bill will make that regulation far more onerous
for all third parties and create a massive new administrative burden
for them, further increasing the incentive for them simply to keep
quiet.</hs_Para>

a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle), the

she is. I am proud that we are the most transparent Government ever,
having done a huge amount of work to open up the Government and become
more transparent. I think that this Bill has been a victory for
Parliament because it was improved in Committee—perhaps not to
the extent that some Members wanted, but it has been improved, and I am

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000053">On
part 1 and the lobbying register, I know that many Members do not
believe that the Bill goes far enough, but the reality is that, for the
first time in many years, we have had the opportunity to discuss
lobbying on the Floor of the House and to debate whether it has any
impact. I said personally in my previous speeches that I do not think
lobbying is particularly effective one way or another, but the
important point is that this is a step at least in the right direction,
as there will be a register of lobbyists—it may or may not be
expanded, but I am pleased that we are moving in the right
direction.</hs_Para>

most important part and it has excited the public imagination most. I
have a real concern about this theme of gagging. I am proud of free
speech and very concerned about the argument that has drifted
in—that charities will not be able to behave as they did in
previous elections. As we have identified at every stage of the Bill,
Government amendment 32 has pretty much changed the definition so that
it is much closer to that in the Political Parties, Elections and
Referendum Act 2000, which emphasises the test of reasonability. For
me, we are taken back to a position in which charities can campaign in
a way that it was proven they could campaign in the 2001, 2005 and 2010
general elections. I am aware of some concern about the limits, but as
I suggested in an earlier speech, the House of Commons Library has
shown that the number of organisations that would be captured by those
limits are very few. The reality is that only two were captured by 
<?notus-xml column=261?>the previous limits and that all the organisations discussed in
successive stages would not have been captured by the proposed
limits.</hs_Para>

have moved the Bill in the right direction, and I am pleased that the
Government Front-Bench team have listened to Back Benchers and Members
of all parties. That is important, as we have tried to improve the
Bill. As we have discussed many times, there is more that unites us on
this Bill than divides us—<I>[Interruption.] </I>I think we are
close to reaching a position in which the charities can have more
confidence about what the Bill will do. I would dearly love to be in a
position where all the charities and community groups feel that they
can continue to campaign, without feeling that they are gagged.
Anything that affects freedom of speech—this Bill does not,
although some of the hyperbole around the Bill might well
have—is dangerous. We should all send out a clear message that
we want every charity and community group to campaign as much as they
can.</hs_Para>

occasions with the aim of correcting the position, and failed. Only
last year the courts did correct it, ruling that minor errors or
discrepancies in balloting procedures relating to membership lists
should no longer be taken into account if they had no effect on the
result of the ballot itself. That legal decision was a major
breakthrough for trade union rights, but part 3 will enable employers
to subvert it through the back door. Employers will now challenge
membership lists, because they will still be the basis on which ballots

Members—particularly the Liberal Democrats, who may have voted

action, because people will not tolerate the interference of employers
in the democratic processes of trade unions. It is extraordinary that
trade union membership lists are the only lists with which we are
dealing. We are not dealing with party membership lists, CBI membership
lists, or any other membership lists, and in my view that is evidence

intervene in the debate on that subject, but I can say now that I have
no problem with the reduction to £5,000. The limit has been
£5,000 in Scotland since 2000, and there has never been any
difficulty with it. However, I have a very big question to ask about
why there should be any difference between the limits applying to
Edinburgh and Birmingham. Why not have the same limit for both? I am
happy for the amount to fall, but I should prefer it to be the same
throughout the United Kingdom. I am also slightly concerned about the
time limits prior to elections. All those matters will have to be dealt
with in the other place, and examined by us again when the Bill returns
to the Commons.</hs_Para>

disappointment in the Bill concerns the way in which the Opposition
have chosen to deal with it. As always, I listened with awe and
admiration to what was said by the hon. Member for Wallasey
(Ms Eagle), but I must tell her that if there was ever an
example of maximum hyperbole with the best skill chasing minimum fact,
it was her speech. It is a great shame, because I think a dampening
effect may come from a complete misunderstanding of both the intentions
of the Bill and what it will actually do. That will dissipate with
time, but it is a shame that that has been raised at this
point.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13100979000720" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0003.htm#13100979000720">6.50

through most of the proceedings on this Bill but unfortunately
yesterday I had to stay at home because I had to have an MRI scan. I do
not know whether any other Member has had an MRI scan. Part of the
patient’s body goes into a magnetic field and it is very noisy;
there are moans and groans, bangs and clangs, whistles and whines to
the extent that they give the patient a pair of headphones. Fortunately
I had enough sense to take along with me the “Essential Bob
Dylan” CD, and I lay there for 40 minutes and I was just getting
into “Maggie’s Farm”, which is a tune I really

they were making such a noise in order to try and hide what is going on
here. They are the people who should be scanned, and they will be
scanned very clearly about what has gone on here today and over the
past few weeks, because this is not a mistake. Instead, this is part of
a pattern of abuse that the two coalition parties have undertaken since
this Parliament started.</hs_Para>

we have come to this: they have realised they are not going to be able

campaigners. They want to shut people up, put them in the dark, and
stop them campaigning when the people of Britain are tuned in for
probably the only time in the whole Parliament—when the people
want to hear what is being said, and what has been done in their name
for the previous five years. They are trying to shut up the people who
really know: the campaigners, the students, the Royal British Legion,
the voluntary organisations, the pro and anti-hunt lobbies, and, in
particular, the trade unions. They do not want

the people have not been fooled by this. The Government must not think
they have got away with this if the Bill passes tonight, goes along the
corridor and comes back here in a few weeks. We know that this is being
rushed through because they want it signed, sealed, delivered and
stamped by the Queen before 8 May next year so there will be a full
year before the election on 7 May 2015 when they can get away with
hiding the facts from the nation and stopping people complaining. It
will not work because the people will not forget this. They will not be
forgiven for what they have done. This is not just abuse of this House,

to the hon. Members for Wallasey (Ms Eagle) and for Blaydon

Reading speech is that they miss changes made to the Bill in the
interim. I would, however, like to thank all hon. Members for their
contributions to this debate. I appreciate that organisations from all

views—about the Bill, and I am grateful that so many have taken
the time to share
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000075">The
Bill is about transparency and giving the public confidence in our
political system. I am sure that no Member would disagree that we must
ensure that all those who impact on our democracy do so transparently,
accountably and fairly—these measures will do that. This debate
has covered a wide range of viewpoints. There is not time to address
every point that has been raised, but I will quickly recap what this
Bill will do, as that should address points raised. It will introduce a
statutory register of consultant lobbyists to complement our existing
transparency regime; it will fill a specific gap where it is not
certain on whose behalf consultant lobbyists are lobbying; it will
ensure that third parties campaigning at elections do so in a fully
transparent manner; and it will give the public reassurance that trade
unions which influence public life beyond their own members know who
those members are. The Bill will bring greater transparency to our
political system, as we promised to do, and I therefore commend it to
the House.</hs_Para>

Phillip Lee</B> (Bracknell) (Con):</Member> I never thought I would see
the day when the words “Mobile Army Surgical Hospital”
would be the title of a debate of mine. I grew up watching the
television series “MASH”, which partly inspired me to
become a doctor. I want to make a serious proposal about a capability
that this country should be able to deploy abroad. I started thinking
about the issue following the Syria vote in August. I voted against
both motions before the House that day. After that, I thought that I
should come forward with a constructive suggestion for our engagement
with the crisis in Syria. This is my
suggestion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000658" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000658">I

response capability that we need. I shall then mention the challenges

the facility.</hs_Para>

doctor for a number of reasons, but a couple of things spring to mind.
One is a book called “The Red and Green Life Machine”
written by a commander in the Royal Navy, a chap called Rick Jolly. The
title refers to a field hospital in the Falklands war, set up in a
disused abattoir in San Carlos bay. I read the book when I was about
13. I watched every single episode of “MASH” and
developed desire and ambition—initially, to become a trauma
orthopaedic surgeon. I subsequently went to medical school and decided
that I would be a GP. What inspired me was the desire to do something
to help people in distress.</hs_Para>

stress that I am no pacifist. I did not vote in August against the
intervention lightly; in fact, I am in favour of quite significant
intervention if it is well thought through, coherent and backed up with
a strategy for the region. However, I am against the wilful, somewhat
reckless destruction of assets in a small way because that can breed
more problems going
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000661" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000661">We
are experiencing the ongoing crisis in Syria through our TV screens. I
first visited the country in 1998 and I went back as vice-chairman of
the Conservative middle east council in February 2011, about three
weeks before the civil war started. I have a sense of association with
the country. I enjoyed both my visits—particularly the first
one, when I was backpacking around as a medical student. I visited
Homs, Hama and the beautiful parts of Aleppo that I fear are no longer
intact. When I came back from my second visit, I was gripped with a
sense of foreboding that trouble was about to start, although not as
quickly as it did. I also felt the sense that Britain’s
engagement with the country in its crisis should be constructive and
trying desperately to bring about a peaceful end to the
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000662" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000662">The
problem is that since then there have been more than 100,000 deaths and
more than 2 million people have migrated away from the chaos. There has
been one public use of chemical weapons, and it has been suggested that
there have been others. We have all had to endure some pretty appalling
footage of death and destruction, primarily affecting innocent
civilians—women and children. It is pretty shocking to have to
endure it.</hs_Para>

should be multi-pronged. We could foresee a situation in which hard
power is wielded, but soft power should also be considered. This is
where I come to the MASH or mobile surgical hospital facility that I
envisage for Britain. The history of field hospitals goes back to the
Napoleonic wars and the gentleman called the father of combat medicine,
Baron Dominique Jean Larrey. From that concept of forward surgical
hospitals bringing medical support to combatants at the front line,
things developed slowly. I guess that the fastest development took
place during the Korean war in the early 1950s; the
“MASH” TV series is based on that war, although it was
always associated with the Vietnam war because of when it was made.
During the Korean war, major developments were made in pushing field
hospitals closer to the front line. There was the famous image of a
Bell helicopter with two casualties strapped into stretchers on either
side, with the purpose of bringing people back to be treated very
quickly. The dictum was, “Life takes precedence over limb,
function over anatomical defects.”</hs_Para>

then, there have been massive advances. I have not yet visited the
hospital at Camp Bastian in Afghanistan, but I am told that it is a
remarkable facility delivering the very best trauma care. Of particular
note to Britain is our experience in Kosovo in 1999, where the British
Army managed to create, in effect, a tented village for a load of
refugees as well as medical facilities. It was a fantastic success, and

not just hard power but softer power. Ultimately, in any

military in appearance—we can also intervene in other ways. The
capability should be resourceful. We are good at this stuff. We can
draw on our experiences in the Balkans and the Falklands—I

We are very good at this; we have the clinical expertise, in
particular. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T19:24:31"></hs_TimeCode>

to details and capacity, as a result of the conversations I have had I
envisage a facility with at least 50 beds, perhaps more. If it is as
successful as I think it will be I suspect we will extend it, but 50
beds is a good starting point. I think it should include a CT scanner,
which is often not available in more rural areas and far-flung
destinations. It is possible to put CT scanners in containers and
companies such as Marshall Land Systems in Cambridge make container
hospitals. There is no reason why we cannot do this. We need to
consider whether the facility should also have paediatric and obstetric
services, because it is not just soldiers such as those in the
“MASH” television series who will be coming in, but
children who have been affected by a neurological agent—such as
those we saw in that dreadful footage—and pregnant women who
have sustained
injuries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000675">Cost
is always relevant when it comes to Government spending and there are
some figures available. Apparently the Finns purchased a hospital for
deployment for

between £5 million and £10 million. I think it should be
a military asset, because the military is best placed to run it, but it
should be staffed primarily with reservists, not regulars. Military
logistics are important: the army are the best people to get this
facility quickly into the field, and Kosovo is an example of that. The

minds and on delivering care on the ground, and if I were an Islamist
jihadist I would think, “We need to knock that out, because
it’s going to start changing minds and attitudes.” The
facility’s security would need some thought. For example, RAF

the case, we have a responsibility to try to overcome such bureaucratic
hurdles. I recognise that the MOD has concerns about the long-term
liability of cost and staffing. I am sure the NHS will have questions,
such as, “You’re taking my orthopaedic consultant.
Who’s going to do his list?” There are problems, and I
have not come to the Chamber with a perfect project outlined and ready
to go, but I see no reason whatever why the project cannot be brought
about. If we could establish a British MASH unit with a Union Jack on
the side of it, it would be fantastic for this country. Our reputation
would be enhanced, and such a facility is clearly desperately needed in
Syria and the surrounding countries. We are dealing with a significant
humanitarian crisis. I know the Minister and his Department are
responding in a good way, but that added capability would be much
valued. We can do it and do it
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000686" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000686">I

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T19:32:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bracknell (Dr Lee) for introducing this debate on such
an interesting topic. Put simply, I entirely agree that military field
hospitals could play a vital role in any international humanitarian
response. Indeed, the Department for International
Development has collaborated with UK forces in humanitarian responses
over many years, for instance in Bosnia, which is well known to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T19:33:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart), East Timor, Kosovo, Iraq,
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Haiti, to name some of the more notable
examples.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000689" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000689">DFID,
the MOD and the armed forces continue to co-operate closely. Since
2007, that co-operation has been codified in a memorandum of
understanding that sets out how DFID and UK forces will work together.
Its main principles are that DFID will lead the UK response to overseas
disasters, that it can ask the MOD for military support if necessary,
and that the MOD will charge DFID only the additional operating costs
for, for example, ships or aeroplanes, and not the full capital costs.
In requesting military support for overseas disasters, it is clearly
understood that UK defence requirements will always take
precedence.</hs_Para>

established framework of co-operation, the two Departments have made
explicit provision to use military field hospitals if required. DFID
has agreed with senior military medical colleagues that, subject to
defence priorities, military field hospitals may be deployed as part of
a humanitarian response by DFID. To that end, DFID has visited the
Army’s 34 Field Hospital at Catterick garrison, which is the
MOD’s designated rapid response field hospital. DFID has held
detailed practical discussions with it and has contributed to its
humanitarian training and
preparedness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000691" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000691">Importantly,
it must be understood that the deployment of a military field hospital
requires substantial logistical support. It might also require a
considerable force protection package, which would have a bearing on
the location and appropriateness of the facility. Our experience is
that the use of any military asset is expensive. Issues around
permission to operate and the command and control of such a facility
would need to be agreed with the receiving nation, which would
inevitably prove more complicated with a military facility than a
civilian

Duncan:</Member></B> Spending on humanitarian matters is official
development assistance, so in that respect my hon. Friend is right.
However, we must also show that there is value for money and we must
know that the assets can be appropriately deployed. I will discuss that
issue
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000694" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000694">DFID
has worked on the ground alongside UK forces in Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra
Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan. DFID has also used Royal Air Force
aircraft and helicopters in earthquake and flood relief in Pakistan,
and in sending search and rescue teams to Indonesia. The Royal Navy was
able to make its Royal Fleet Auxiliary Largs Bay ships available to
help with relief after the Haiti
earthquake.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000695" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000695">So
far, UK military field hospitals have not been deployed under the
auspices of DFID. However, the way it would work is that DFID would
request the support of the MOD in response to a natural disaster, in
accordance with United Nations guidelines known as the Oslo guidelines.
Those guidelines stipulate that support should be provided in line with
the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, humanity and
independence. They also state that military assets should be requested
only where there is no comparable civilian alternative. That implies
that the military asset must be the only way of meeting the particular
need and that its use should be a last
resort.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000696" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000696">DFID
has to design its humanitarian responses carefully according to the
specific humanitarian needs that they face and based on what responses
are best provided by the UK and by other donors. Very often, what works
best is help to restore and rebuild an afflicted country’s own
health system. If a field hospital is needed, there  
<?notus-xml column=276?>are already well established civilian organisations that are used to
providing such hospitals in humanitarian crises, notably the
International Red Cross, which has been
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000697" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000697">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T19:39:04"></hs_TimeCode>
civilian response will usually be what is needed in a delicate and
complex situation, rather than a foreign military presence which,
however well intentioned, is still military and may not be welcomed.
For example, in Pakistan, which has also been mentioned, it was a
difficult, finely balanced, decision to include RAF aircraft in the
NATO relief airlift, when extremists had explicitly threatened the
foreign relief effort and relief workers if NATO were to operate in
that country. Like other international donors, therefore, while we are
glad to have military field hospitals available, we will use them as a
last resort, when it is too difficult or dangerous to use civilian
measures and if the circumstances permit a military medical unit to be
deployed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000698" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000698">DFID
has also been building a UK civilian medical response capability. UK
surgeons and other medical staff performed heroically in Haiti after
the earthquake in 2010, saving lives and limbs which might otherwise
have been lost. Building on that experience, DFID is supporting a
programme of training and regional workshops for NHS doctors and other
medical staff to equip them to deal with the additional challenges of
surgery in a conflict zone. That is underpinned by an arrangement with
the Department of Health and the national health service to deploy
surgical trauma teams drawn from the British health service. Many of
those personnel will also be military reservists, thus further
exemplifying good civilian/military co-operation across
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000699">My
hon. Friend specifically mentioned the Syria crisis. As the House is
aware, the UK Government’s relief response is considerable. The
UK has so far pledged £500 million, making us the second largest
donor. Much of that relief is to provide health and medical care.
Through our funding we are supporting vital medical help on civilian
channels and with civilian medical personnel, not all details of which
can be openly revealed. I can say, however, that the range of services
provided by DFID is wide and big. It includes ensuring the running,
supply and necessary specialist training for a large number of
emergency surgical facilities, including in remote areas. For example,
we are supporting primary health care centres to help look after
vulnerable groups such as women and children, as well as the elderly,
who often have chronic unmet health needs. In Syria’s
neighbouring countries, which now host more than 2 million refugees
between them, DFID-supported health programmes provide medical
evacuations and ambulance services, widespread primary health care
facilities, mental health and psycho-social services, and highly
specialised facilities for victims of sexual and gender-based
violence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000700" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000700">We
provide specialist training courses for health professionals, many of
whom are specialist staff seconded into emergency departments to
reinforce their capacity and specialist care. We provide health
services for refugees, as well as for vulnerable resident populations
that are hosting huge numbers of refugees in their communities. DFID
and MOD officials are in frequent touch in London and the region, and
the need for and suitability of mobile field hospitals is often
discussed. While options remain open, it is agreed that deploying a
mobile field 
<?notus-xml column=277?>hospital at the moment would not be the most effective way to reach the
diverse needs faced by so many people in so many different
locations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000701" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000701">DFID’s
new civilian surgical trauma facility also remains an option, but so
far it has not been necessary to deploy a surgical team in any of the
refugee-hosting countries. Inside Syria, the level of conflict makes
access to health care difficult in many areas, and unfortunately the
security challenges also prevent the deployment of a field hospital or
a civilian UK surgical team. DFID will therefore continue to support
existing health facilities on the ground, and constantly review the
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-09T19:42:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100979000702" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979000702"><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="13100979001331" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/debtext/131009-0004.htm#13100979001331"><B>Bob

Duncan:</Member></B> I like to think that DFID is well prepared always
to procure and lay its hands on any such equipment, to which end many
framework contracts permit us to draw at short notice on many
companies’ equipment so as to do whatever is appropriate in
whatever humanitarian situation we face, be that an earthquake, a

conclusion, the Government value their ability to deploy military
surgical teams as an important option, additional to other means of
response. DFID’s response is based on the needs of the affected

not arisen. If it does, we remain ready to respond as required in the

Members on both sides of the Chamber know quite a lot about this
subject and have shown great interest in Africa, particularly Kenya,
over the years. Some of what I say will not be news to them, and will
be well known to the Minister, but it is important to set the scene and
to say a few things that may seem obvious to some, but not to others
observing what is going on at the moment. Today, I am particularly
concerned about the nature of the ongoing action by the International
Criminal Court against President Kenyatta and Deputy President Ruto,
and that is, primarily, the context in which I will speak. I will make
a few comments about the ICC, but they will be entirely contextual and
legitimate, and I will be careful not to stray too far, Mr

Monday 13 October, the African Union will meet to discuss the
possibility of African ICC member states withdrawing from the ICC en

by the ICC’s treatment of President Kenyatta and Deputy

nothing inherently unreasonable in holding people to account in front
of the ICC, but the nature of the present action against President
Kenyatta and Deputy President Ruto is of particular
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000009">Some
nations, particularly African nations, that are signatories to the
treaty of Rome are placing the future of the ICC in question. There is
a risk that Africans in the UK—I speak to many of them in
diasporas of all sorts—and particularly Kenyans will see it as
the African criminal court, rather than the International Criminal
Court. I want to set out how and why that has happened. I am not
critical in any sense of the Government’s position on Kenya over
the past year or so; they have handled the situation not
elegantly—that may be putting too fine a point on it—but
rather well earlier in the year, when President Kenyatta won the
election. The Prime Minister encouraged him to come to the UK and met
him soon after his election, which sent a significant message.
Nevertheless, there is a strange and strained diplomatic relationship,
in that we still support the ICC and its ongoing action to bring the
President to
court.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000010">Kenya
is one of our most important allies on the African continent. One of
our largest foreign training bases is there, and the UK and Kenya host
each other’s large diasporas. Trade with Kenya through Nairobi
has been increasing almost exponentially for some years. We have the
strongest of historical links, too. I will not go into whether the
empire was good or bad. There were many good things about it, although
we tend to remember the bad things, but the long view shows benefits
that accrued on both sides.</hs_Para>

relationship with Kenya has been fraught, to put it mildly, notably
during the Mau Mau uprising. It is to the Government’s credit
that at the beginning of the summer they recognised that crimes that
were broadly described as being against humanity took place when we
were running the show, and reparation has been made to Kenyans who were
affected. Some people are ambivalent about that, because some Kenyans
were fighting against British soldiers at the time, but the
Government’s general view—I am not sure what the
Opposition’s position is—was that it was right to make
reparation. Soldiers who behaved abominably, as some did, cannot be
held to account now because they are dead, and we should remember that,
but we should also remember the context in which the Mau Mau uprising
took place, and the nature of the deployment that our troops faced.
However, we bear in mind that we are making reparation for what can
today be described as war
crimes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000012">I
will not rehearse the democratic period in Kenya, but will fast forward

It is true that when we think about Africa, politics and governance, we
tend automatically to think about corruption. Corruption in many parts
of Africa and of course in Kenya must be dealt with in every possible
way. We must encourage the authorities to do that, and I think the
authorities in Kenya, as in most African states, are willing to do so.
Sometimes we are  a little too ready and quick to flag up
corruption as a synonym for a nation state’s name, instead of
remembering that such states are sometimes making enormous progress. I
will not rehearse the arguments about Rwanda, which is perhaps the best
example, but Kenya is also a good example of a state that is making
bounding progress. That is part of what causes me concern about the ICC
action.</hs_Para>

there was violence before the 2007 general election, and we know that
following the election, presidential candidates came together to form a
Government of national unity. President Kibaki and Prime Minister
Odinga were the two primary office-holders, and that coalition held
together for a full term of office. Significantly, violence was almost
entirely absent at the following election, after the
coalition—the election that has just taken place. That suggests
that a lasting resolution was achieved with the coalition back in 2007,
and Kenyan people understand that.However, part of that coalition
agreement was that there would be an inquiry, quite rightly, into the
violence that took place during the election.</hs_Para>

was duly conducted by a Kenyan judge, Justice Philip Waki, who felt
that six individuals had committed serious offences, but when the
Kenyan Parliament took a vote—it votes on judicial or legal
matters in a way that we probably would not—it decided not to
refer the matter onwards, so the judge decided to refer it to the
United Nations Secretary-General, with a recommendation that it should
then be passed on to the ICC. That is why the series of six cases has
ended up where it has. It was essentially a quasi-judicial process in
Kenya, which has ended up as an administrative and legal process in The

action by the ICC, six years after events on which there is one
dissenting opinion, has enormous implications for the Kenyan people. It
is true that Mr Kenyatta is not the first Head of State to
be indicted by the ICC, and I will come to that shortly, but Kenya is
of enormous importance to the UK—that is not to say that Sudan
is not, but Kenya is particularly important to the UK and all our
allies. Kenya has also successfully come through a period of strife,
when other countries have collapsed under the terrible weight of
internecine warfare. Kenya is the great economic success story of east
and central Africa. It is leading the fight against terrorism in
Somalia. We know now, given events over the past few weeks at the
Westgate mall, how terrible a price the Kenyan people are paying for
being at the front in that ongoing battle, but they have not wilted or
split. Kenyans have remained united in the face of all that has been
thrown at them by terrorists. It seems to me that we reward them by
insisting that the President and Vice-President, who are leading them
into what promises to be a very decent future, stand trial at the ICC,
accused of hotly disputed offences that took place years ago.</hs_Para>

well say that the ICC has an important role to play, and I would agree.
They may say that it is not for us mere mortals to make judgments about

politics should not play a part. I would say, 
<?notus-xml column=64?>however, that although it is not ordinary for politicians to intervene
in judicial processes, the ICC is inherently political, as are its
outcomes. It seems entirely appropriate that, at some points, when
there are very significant political implications for a particular
nation, it is for politicians and not civil servants to decide. In the
same way, the Chancellor does not ask his civil servants to read out
his Budget in the Chamber or ask them to lead the whole Budget process.
In this case, it is for politicians around the world, including in the
UK, fundamentally to make a decision. It is beyond the powers of civil
servants, Government servants, or the international Government
servants—whatever we call them—who run the ICC’s
administration and procedures.</hs_Para>

significant to note that all 32 indictees of the ICC have come from
Africa. Eight African states have been involved, so I guess that is
about four each. Initially, they were primarily from the Congo, and now
a number are from Kenya. Four of those countries—it says this in
Wikipedia, and I have also seen ICC officials saying it—referred
cases involving their own people to the ICC. The ICC says, “Come
on guv, you can’t blame us for taking action, because they were
referred to us,” but that is where it becomes inherently
political, because we put great pressure on those states to refer cases
to the ICC. We cannot just hold our hands up and say, “Nothing
to do with us, guv.” Clearly, we put enormous pressure on those
states. Cases involving the Lord’s Resistance Army, for example,
in Uganda, remain a cause célèbre—although less
than they were, I suppose—and there are other cases.</hs_Para>

pressure was put on those states, and they did what we asked, but now,
because they did, they find themselves in a terrible bind. The only
place that the ICC is able to act is Africa, and that is a terrible
state of affairs. It cannot act in nations that are in the orbit of
China—we all understand why—or of Russia, so the
“stans” and the far east are out. Sri Lanka is out,
obviously. India is out. Anything in the orbit of America is out.
Obviously, Europe is out—we are not going to indict ourselves,
are we? The United States did not sign up to the ICC originally,
because it was concerned that former politicians might be arraigned in
front of the ICC. It did not sign up for political reasons, and it
still has not signed up for the same reasons. Of the five permanent
members of the Security Council, the three most powerful have not
signed up for political reasons. That takes out the great majority of
the countries of the world, leaving those that are not considered to be
strategically important, and—guess what?—are in
Africa.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_09_PT_1/D577A1128D1A3E77335BF9BD503F896D360028E5" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="9 October 2013">Wednesday

say, “This is the African criminal court, really, isn’t

says, “We are having a look at other cases,” but we know
that it will not take action against FARC or anybody else in Colombia,
for obvious reasons—because there is a peace process. It clearly
will not take action, nor would I particularly want it to. Therefore,
we end up with action being taken only against Africans, and even then
only when political implications have been considered. In many cases,
action has not been taken because of politics. Therefore, people who
say that it is up to ICC officials are missing the point; it is
fundamentally a political issue.</hs_Para>

bang on forever, Mr Caton—other Members may wish to jump
in—but I will say a little more. I suspect that at least one
Government Member will 
<?notus-xml column=65?>correct me if I am wrong, but I recall that, when I arrived in this
place, just before the final stage of the International Criminal Court
Act 2001, the then Opposition opposed joining the ICC. It may be that
they changed and voted to do so at the end, but I remember that, at the
time, the argument in the Chamber was that the then
Opposition—now the Government—strongly opposed it. They
did so because they were concerned—I voted for and still support
the ICC’s existence, but the concern was legitimate at the
time—that soldiers, deployed as they are around the world, in
all sorts of different places, might find themselves captured, not
returned to the UK, and in front of the ICC. There was a deep concern
about that.</hs_Para>

were largely allayed, and clearly, the Government are a supporter. The
fears have not come to fruition, because we are willing and able to try
our own people. We show that and have actually done it, so there does
not seem to be a great risk. I notice, however, that the Americans
still have not signed up, so they clearly think there is a risk. There
is at least one politician, famously—it would not be fair to say
his name, but I think most of us know who it is—whom many
lawyers have said might well be arraigned in front of the ICC. Even
that one case, and the fear that others might happen in future, would
stop the Americans signing up.</hs_Para>

significant. UK citizens are not more likely than anybody else to
commit serious offences, but the concern was that it might become
political, and indeed, I think that has proven to be the case, almost
by default. It has not become political on purpose; it has become
political because the ICC has been unable to be even-handed across the
world, for strong political reasons.</hs_Para>

However, it is worth reflecting on the principle of the ICC. I may have

dangerous phase for the ICC. If the ICC gets it wrong and if the
international community gets it wrong in respect of Kenya, the ICC will
fall apart; I do not think that it will continue, in a meaningful
sense, in existence. I know that there is concern among NGOs and
experts, including lawyers, that if there were to be a discontinuation
of the case against the President and vice-president of Kenya, that
would effectively be the end of the ICC. I do not agree with that view.
I will not put all the arguments as to why 
<?notus-xml column=66?>I disagree with it. I simply think that that would not be the case. It
would be more practically effective to find a way of dealing with the

Joyce:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Member for his intervention. I
think that the technical situation is that the case will continue even
if Kenya withdraws, although my instinct is that it will be difficult
to do anything in that situation. I suppose the ICC may criticise the
President’s absence and then carry on with the trial.
Theoretically, and it is pretty theoretical, the African nations that
are considering withdrawing—I hope that they do not
withdraw—would still be subject to any current cases involving
them, although not to any future cases. So, for the moment the case
against the President would continue. In a sense, therefore, it is
academic whether Kenya has chosen to withdraw from the ICC or not,
although I hope that it will come back in. I think that Kenya is making
a very powerful statement, just as some other African states that are
supporting Kenya’s cause at the moment are making a similarly
powerful statement.</hs_Para>

to draw to a conclusion. I visited the ICC’s former chief
prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, in The Hague a couple of years ago,
regarding a particular case; it is pertinent to this debate, so I hope
that you will bear with me, Mr Caton. My concern at the time was that
all these people being indicted were Africans, and I was concerned
about one particular case. I was concerned about President al-Bashir,
as a head of state, being indicted, but in particular I was concerned
about a chap called Bemba, who was a Congolese leader indicted for an
alleged crime in the Central African Republic. I spoke to Luis
Moreno-Ocampo and I was with him for much of the day—strangely.
He gave me a tutorial in how the ICC operated, and convinced me that he
was doing his best and that the ICC was doing its best. It was taking a
long time to get a prosecution. It has now had one successful
prosecution, that of Thomas Lubanga of the Democratic Republic of
Congo. Mr Moreno-Ocampo was very convincing and he convinced me that
the ICC is indeed a good thing. There are clear difficulties, which the
ICC recognises, in pursuing cases in the orbits of nations that do not
fancy having the ICC in their own backyard, as I have described
before.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000034">Then,
however, Mr Moreno-Ocampo was gone, and he has been replaced by the
former Gambian Justice Minister. My instinct, although it is harsh to
say it, is that, although I have no doubt she will be a very fine
lawyer, that appointment in itself was a political
nod—“We are only indicting Africans, so we will have an
African in charge”. However, just to show the difficulty, she
herself—I will not be critical of her personally but
contextually—was the Justice Minister in Gambia. Gambia is not
the most pure place on the planet. The last time that I was in Gambia,
as we were driving to the airport 
<?notus-xml column=67?>there was lots of security around and we discovered that the President
had just shot a whole bunch of prisoners, some of whom were political
prisoners essentially. Gambia has its issues, so it seems to me that a
political nod in a particular direction may have had the opposite
effect to that intended. I think that the ICC recognised the need to
make a political gesture, and to some degree therefore it accepts that
the whole thing is a political process.</hs_Para>

me that at the moment we tend, right across the board, to apply values
straight from our desks and pop them straight down on to the desks of
politicians and other leading folk in African states, without really
considering the period of development that those countries are going
through right now, as we speak. Just as I walked across here to
Westminster Hall, I was reflecting—I am not quite sure
why—on the fact that most of us would put our hands up and say,
“Chemical weapons—bad thing.” However, as far as I
can remember, we were developing chemical weapons into the ’80s.
Chemical weapons became a bad thing in the ’90s, but I think it
was still British military doctrine to use chemical weapons until just
a few years before then. I remember that when I was a private soldier,
troops alongside me volunteered to go to Porton Down to have chemicals
put on their hands—I do not think that Porton Down was looking
for a solution to the common cold—and that was in the
’80s.</hs_Para>

moved forward and we say that chemical weapons are a horror; Winston
Churchill was a fan of chemical weapons, but now we say that they are a
horror and it has taken us 15 or 20 years for us to get to that point.
Now we say, “Here is a democracy in Africa and we expect you to
uphold the same standards that we do here in all the same ways”,
without trying to contextualise things. That is a tough gig, as the
Africans become increasingly nationalistic, and pan-African
nationalistic, if that is not too grand a phrase to use; I am not
harking back to a slightly different phenomenon from 60 years ago.
However, if Africans are in that zone and in many cases looking towards
China rather than looking towards us, it is because there is a very
strong taint of a kind of imperialist attitude.</hs_Para>

understanding—what I am about to say may be wrong, but I do not
think that it is—is that the Kenyans have refused to accredit
three diplomats; the would-be ambassadors from France, Germany and
Belgium. I understand that that happened just a few days ago, and I
also understand that the Tanzanians refused to accredit the new German
ambassador, on account of the fact that she had invited—probably
unwisely, because it was clearly a gesture on her part—the
former Prime Minister, Raila Odinga, as a guest of honour for a wee
party before she left. That was a clear statement, so the Tanzanians
went, “That was a nice statement. Here’s another
one—off you go.” So that was a neat political statement
by a daft German ambassador—a former German ambassador to
Kenya—but there is a lot of that going on.</hs_Para>

consequence was

maintaining a strong relationship with a really important ally, for all
the reasons that we all know; I will not rehearse them again. However,
the fact is that there is a crux and if the crux is not properly
climbed then the ICC will fall off and it will no longer be an
effective and meaningful international force.</hs_Para>

a slight digression, I will say that it is possible for someone to
spend five years in the ICC and then get found not guilty, as one
Congolese chap did at the end of last year. So we suspend certain rules
and assumptions—reasonably, because it is very hard to gather
evidence—but we should remember that Jean-Pierre Bemba remains
there. His trial is now in its third year and he has been there for
almost six years, with no end in sight. If he is found not guilty, he
will have spent seven or eight years in custody. If anyone tried do
that anywhere else, we would say that that country was a dictator
state. We have made allowances and allowed that to happen at the ICC. I
am concerned about how long the process takes but I am not critical per
se, because I know that it is very hard to gather evidence and to argue
the case when we are talking about certain countries, such as the
Central African Republic. In this case, it is for the politicians to
make a political decision to take the matter out of the hands of
administrators and to put the case against President Kenyatta and
Deputy President William Ruto. That would give the Kenyans a fair crack
of the whip at a time when they really need our
support.</hs_ParaIndent></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_09_PT_1/D6ED77869CB48995FFE089045BBF7C93CA2DAD0C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="9 October 2013">Wednesday

William Cash</B> (Stone) (Con):</Member> This is an interesting and
important debate. I am chairman of the all-party parliamentary groups
on Kenya and on Uganda and, as chairman or secretary of various other
all-party groups, I have been much involved in all matters relating to
east Africa since the 1980s. I have a strong sense that that part of
the world is extremely important both in its own right and in relation
not only to the United Kingdom but to the world as a whole.
Economically, it is one of the fastest-growing areas in the world and,
as with all countries—and I exclude none—there is a

fairness prevail.</hs_Para>

of all this lies the question whether domestic matters should be
adjudicated by a methodology applicable through international law when
the better route could well be to have them dealt with in the country
in question. That important issue is illustrated by the fact that in
many, many countries in the world—I do not need to set them all
out, but Vietnam is a case in point—terrible things happen.
There are civil wars. We had a civil war, as did the United States, and
there are times when innocent people get caught up. We have a vast
range of civil wars going on all over the middle east; it is a very
disturbing picture. Not unnaturally, 
<?notus-xml column=69?>people will attribute blame to individuals who have been involved in the
process, but it is an unwise person who makes assumptions about who was

Cash:</Member></B> I certainly do. There must be a significant review
of the methodology that is applied in relation to the ICC process,
which can be encapsulated in an expression from Maine’s
“Ancient Law” that says that justice is to be found in
the interstices of procedure. It sounds grandiloquent, but it is
extremely important given the incredible number of events that are
taking place. We have to look at not just what is happening in
countries such as Syria, where people from both sides commit atrocities
all the time, but the motivation for such atrocities and the extent to
which they are politically driven. Some would argue that the use of
atomic weapons or chemical weapons is a matter where distinctions need
to be drawn. It could also be said that all weapons of mass destruction
should automatically be regarded as of one kind, which they are
not.</hs_Para>

to the terrible events that took place in Kenya some years ago, the
methodology that was applied in the prosecution and indictment is a
matter that requires very careful consideration. There are good
grounds, I believe, for taking a step back and looking at the matter
again, taking into consideration the evidence and who is responsible
for the conduct of the prosecution and the manner in which it is being
deployed. It is also extremely important to bear in mind that the most
incredible sensitivities will arise, and have arisen, which may lead to
the African Union and other individual countries, many of which I am
familiar with, withdrawing from the ICC.</hs_Para>

several issues to be considered. One relates to justice, fairness and
the question of procedures and methodology. Another relates to the
impact of what is being done in relation to the African Union and
individual countries there, and the extent to which they are taking a
position, which, to say the least, is radical. Then there is the
question whether the matter should really be dealt with in domestic
courts. Is there the political impetus to prosecute a Head of State or
one or two people when the evidence could as well be addressed in a
domestic arena?</hs_Para>

Attorney-General for several years, and have always had certain
reservations, to say the least, about the assumptions that lie behind
some human rights trials. I will not enlarge on that, but what I will
say is that with the massive number of conflicts and potential
conflicts in the middle east—in countries such as Egypt, Libya,
Syria and Tunisia—Somalia and elsewhere in Africa, a complete
analysis of the whole matter is required. In addition, some of the most
significant countries, not only numerically but in terms of power and
influence, are not members of the ICC. How can we have a system of
justice that is based on differentiation between those countries that
are not involved in the process because they have not signed up, and
others 
<?notus-xml column=70?>that are? There are so many interwoven complexities that it makes me
seriously wonder about the whole question of justiciability and the
methodology that lies at the heart not only of the procedures but of
the underlying consequences of the ICC

do not want to say any more, because I want everyone to stand back and
ask themselves some central questions. The Minister, for whom I have
the highest regard, has a very difficult task here. I have raised the
matter with the Foreign Office, both after and in the run-up to
elections, because I was concerned about the politicisation of what
could be regarded as a matter of domestic legal process. Justice and
fairness are key, and how we arrive at that, and whether the ICC can do
so in this case and in many others, is a very big question. I will rest
my argument there, but I shall continue to pursue such questions,

consideration and understanding of an intensely difficult issue.
Although I will be seeking to find out the Minister’s position

its people, and because of its significance in what, at the moment, is
an important part of north Africa. Some of the biggest political issues

north Africa, with cultures, faiths and economies colliding and causing
enormous issues. We must grapple with those issues if we are to make
progress. Kenya, whose relationship with the UK is massively
significant, is hugely important in that regard, for instance in
addressing the difficulties in Somalia and the horn of Africa. That

other Members have, to the dreadful recent attack in the Westgate

civilians and six security officers, and Britons were among those
killed. Our thoughts are with all those affected by these tragic
events. We must of course support the Kenyan Government in showing

Lucas:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent intervention,
and puts the difficult question very well. It is, however, important to
remember that Kenya has chosen to be a member of the International
Criminal Court. If it withdraws, it will leave an international
institution that it chose to join. As we have already heard, several
countries have refused to join the International Criminal Court. If we
are a member of an institution, we have to accept that it has rules
that it must apply to its members without fear or favour. The reason
why we need to support the Kenyan Government is that they face the very
difficult situation caused by the Westgate shopping centre attack, but
equally, the fact is that Kenya chose to be a member of the
International Criminal Court and, as a consequence of decisions made in
Kenya, the court has been seized of the case and is proceeding with
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000054">To
return to the Westgate shopping mall, rigorous inquiries are taking
place, and must continue to do so, into the circumstances leading to
the attacks. We need to support the Kenyan Government in their taking
steps to bring those involved to justice and to ensure that such an
incident does not recur. We must also, however, conduct rigorous
inquiries into the perpetrators of the violence that followed the 2007
election, because we cannot take action in one area, but not in
another, and I therefore turn to the Kenyan Government’s
possible attempts to withdraw from the
ICC.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000055">We
must reflect on the violence in 2007, when, as we have heard, more than
1,000 people were killed and 600,000 people were displaced. The
investigations into the violence culminated in the ICC bringing
charges, including against the Kenyan President, of crimes against
humanity and of orchestrating ethnic violence. For that reason, charges

problems, and the world has to deal with more and more internationally
connected issues every day: events in Africa profoundly affect our
constituencies in the UK. Far from this being a time for 
<?notus-xml column=72?>us to withdraw from international action, we should be more involved. If
we submit ourselves as a nation to the authority of the International
Criminal Court, we must accept that that court has jurisdiction. Such
an issue would be difficult and many in the United Kingdom would not
want to accept the court’s jurisdiction, but if we have
submitted to the court through legislation, as has been mentioned, we
must accept the consequences. We cannot duck out when it gets

is a difficult problem of that sort—nobody pretends that it is
not difficult—that we now have to address. The Parliament of
Kenya is dealing with the difficulty that, in the hypothetical case
mentioned by my hon. Friend, might apply in the United Kingdom. The two
politicians are not the only individuals facing charges. I understand
that the ICC has also issued an arrest warrant for a journalist called
Walter Barasa for offering bribes to prosecution witnesses in the trial

approach, through organisations such as the United Nations, and a
progression of that. I am saying that, in particular cases, the use of

the Rwandans—most of the African states—will, very sadly

long-standing commitment to the ICC. For that reason, this is a
difficult time; people are working through a difficult issue. That is
why we should be supporting the ICC at this time, rather than saying
that when the going gets tough, we opt out. In those circumstances, the
institution will never make any progress. What is needed is for the
process to continue and for dialogue to continue. We must support the
development of international institutions. Having agreed to set up the
ICC and having become a member, if we do not support it when the
pressure is on, the institution will never make any progress. It is
clear that if that is the case, we will have one less weapon in our
armoury to deal with the hugely difficult international problems that

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs (Mark Simmonds):</Member></B> It is a pleasure to be under your
chairmanship and guidance this morning, Mr Caton. I congratulate the
hon. Member for Falkirk (Eric Joyce) on securing this important debate,
and on his continued interest in and knowledge of Africa, and Kenya in
particular. I thank him for referring to the importance of having a
detailed knowledge and understanding of the significant bilateral
relationship, historically and today, between the United Kingdom and
Kenya. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr Cash), who
has significant knowledge and experience of east Africa and Kenya, and
who shows a continuing energetic commitment to improving the lives of
those who live in Africa. My hon. Friend and the hon. Members for
Falkirk, and for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), powerfully articulated the
complexities and sensitivities of the issue.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000073">I will
endeavour to address all the points that have been raised. First, I
will take stock, as the hon. Member for Wrexham did, of our wider
bilateral relationship, particularly in the aftermath of the horrific
terrorist attack on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi on 21
September. I am sure that the whole House will join me in
re-emphasising our deep sympathy and profound condolences to the Kenyan
Government and people, and to the other countries affected by that
abhorrent act. As the Prime Minister has said, it was a sickening and
despicable act of appalling brutality.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000074">Hon. Members
may have spotted that yesterday my right hon. Friend the Foreign
Secretary laid before Parliament a written statement setting out the UK
Government’s response to the crisis. On the day of the attack,
the Prime Minister spoke to President Kenyatta, and I spoke to the
Kenyan Foreign Minister, Amina Mohamed, to express the UK’s
solidarity and to offer assistance. The UK has provided assistance at
the scene 
<?notus-xml column=75?>in identifying victims and collecting forensic evidence. We have also
provided medical supplies and rations to the Aga Khan university
hospital, where many of the wounded were taken.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000075">We are
determined to work with Kenya on the shared challenge of addressing
regional terrorism and building stability in Somalia. The close
co-operation and understanding that underpin the UK response to the
Westgate attack is a reminder that the UK and Kenya share many
priorities and interests. The relationship between the countries today
is one of partnership, shared mutual interests and shared concerns,
through being members of the Commonwealth, through strong commercial
security and through personal ties. The UK is the largest commercial
investor in Kenya and the second-largest trading partner, with
bilateral trade worth more than £1 billion a year. Thirty
thousand British nationals reside in Kenya, and 180,000 British
nationals visit Kenya every year. Kenya is also one of the largest
bilateral recipients of DFID aid, with the UK contributing £135
million annually in support of Kenya Vision 2030. Our projects tackle
conflict, increase stability and improve education and health
care.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000076">I have read
what the hon. Member for Falkirk said in a similar debate that he
secured in March. In that debate, he highlighted the fact that we have
a strong defence and security relationship. The British Army trains
10,000 British soldiers in Kenya every year, which benefits not only
the UK but the Kenyan defence forces and the wider economy. We want
that co-operation to continue and develop for the mutual benefit of the
UK and Kenya.</hs_Para>

on to specifics about the International Criminal Court, I will address
a couple of points that arose in interventions on the hon. Member for
Falkirk. The hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) rightly raised
the importance of trying to reduce, if not eradicate, corruption in
Kenya. Department for International Development programmes are involved
in supporting greater transparency and accountability at national and
county level. The hon. Member for Falkirk mentioned the Mau Mau
settlement. It is important to understand that that did not constitute
reparation; it was a settlement of claims that recognised the pain and
suffering experienced by people on all sides during those events many
years ago.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000078">At the heart
of our relationship with Kenya is counter-terrorism engagement, through
which we assist Kenya in defending itself and countering cross-border
security threats, many of which stem from Kenya’s leading role
in the African Union Mission in Somalia. Kenya made significant
sacrifices during that mission in its attempts to secure peace and
stability in Somalia, and we recognise and welcome the significant
contributions that Kenya and others have made.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000079">I turn to the
issue at the heart of the debate, namely the International Criminal
Court. I think it would be helpful if I briefly set out what the ICC is
about and why it is so important before I address some of the
complexities and sensitivities involved in the issue that we are
talking about. The UK and Kenya are among the 122 countries that are
signatories to the ICC’s founding Rome statute. Of those
countries, 34 are African states; that is the biggest bloc anywhere in
the world. As 
<?notus-xml column=76?>the hon. Member for Wrexham pointed out, we strongly support the
ICC’s work around the world as an impartial, independent
guardian of the rule of law. It is a court of last resort for the most
serious crimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity. It takes up cases only when national authorities are unable
or unwilling to do so. It provides no immunity for those in positions
of power, even Heads of State—a point that has been made
powerfully. That universality is one of its strengths. It plays a vital
role in ending impunity, holding perpetrators to account and delivering
justice for
victims.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000080">In
July, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary launched the
Government’s ICC strategy, which sets out our thinking on how we
can ensure that the ICC retains its independence—that is
vital—delivers justice, increases its membership, builds more
support for its decisions from states and the UN Security Council,
gains wider regional support and completes its work more
efficiently.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000081">As I have
said, the ICC will take on cases only where national authorities lack
the capabilities or the will to undertake prosecutions, as was the case
in Kenya. The UK is committed to helping to provide training and
mentoring to national authorities to help them develop their own laws
and systems.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000082">The hon.
Member for Falkirk powerfully highlighted the common perception that
the ICC is anti-Africa, and I want to address that point. In Africa,
the Court is working tirelessly to deliver justice for millions of
Africans who endured appalling treatment at the hands of fellow
Africans. African states have been some of the most important
supporters of the creation and effective functioning of the ICC.
African states played an active role in the negotiations that led to
the establishment of the Court, and 22 African countries were among the
founding ratifiers of the Rome statute. Interestingly, the first and
most recent states to ratify the Rome statute, Senegal and Côte
d’Ivoire, were African. The majority of African Union member
states—34 African states—are now ICC state parties. It is
important to recognise that Africans are among the highest level of ICC
officials, and they serve as judges and prosecutors at the
Court.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000083">The ICC
investigates situations, not people, and only after situations have
been investigated do prosecutions occur. Suggestions that the ICC
focuses solely on Africa do not tell the full story. Preliminary
investigations are already under way in cases outside Africa, including
in Afghanistan, Colombia, Georgia and Honduras. The majority of cases
brought against Africans have been lodged with the ICC by
Africans.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100951000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000084">I turn to
specifics that all hon. Members raised about the ICC and Kenya. Of
course I accept that the topic is controversial and sensitive, and
creates difficulties for the Kenyan Government, but after the appalling
post-election violence in 2007-08, many believe that justice is
essential for national reconciliation and healing, and that the trials
must continue to give the victims and the accused access to justice. We
should remind ourselves of the numbers involved. I underline the
figures that hon. Members have mentioned: more than 1,000 people were
killed; 3,000 people suffered serious sexual violence; and more than
600,000 people were displaced. We strongly welcome the Kenyan
Government’s co-operation with the Court and urge them to
continue to co-operate, as they have pledged to do.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=77?><hs_Para UID="13100951000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000085">The UK
Government recognise that President Kenyatta and Deputy President Ruto
have constitutional obligations and important responsibilities at home,
as the Westgate attack illustrated so graphically. We therefore believe
that the Court’s decision to alternate the trials of the
President and Deputy President, to ensure conformity with the Kenyan
constitution, and to agree a short delay to allow Deputy President Ruto
to take part in the Kenyan Government’s response to Westgate,
showed welcome
pragmatism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000086">The
hon. Member for Wrexham raised the issue of witness intimidation. We
remain deeply concerned by reports of witness intimidation, and call on
all state parties to assist the Court in preventing it. That would mean
Kenya responding to the arrest warrant the Court issued last
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000087">The
hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of the Kenyan Parliament’s
vote in support of a motion to withdraw from the Rome statute. We must
be clear: it is for Kenya, as a sovereign country, to decide whether to
withdraw. We, of course, very much hope that it does not. Withdrawing
from the Rome statute would not remove Kenya’s obligation to
co-operate with the Court on the current investigation, as the hon.
Members for Falkirk, and for Wrexham, pointed out. The UK Government
support the process, but we are clear that it must be recognised that
defendants remain innocent until proven guilty. It is for a competent
court—in this case the ICC—not the UK or any Government
or individual, to pass judgment. The strength of the Court lies in its
independence, and its processes are, rightly, independent of the UK. I
do not share the analysis of the hon. Member for Falkirk that the Court
process is political, not judicial; it is very clearly a judicial
process. We are determined to ensure that the UK’s support for
international justice and the ICC does not jeopardise our wider
bilateral relations with Kenya.</hs_Para>

Simmonds:</Member></B> As I said earlier, the ICC only takes up matters
when the country in question does not put in place the requisite
judicial process to allow relevant prosecutions or investigations to
take place. Specifically, the Waki commission, to which the hon. Member
for Falkirk referred, gave the Kenyan authorities time to put in place
the necessary and appropriate structures to deal with the judicial
process, as it relates to the terrible atrocities that occurred in
2007-08. It is only because the Kenyan authorities did not do that at
the time that the matter was referred to the
ICC.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000090">There
are seven cases before the ICC, including the Kenyan issue. Of the
other six, four were referred to the Court by Africans themselves, and
two were referred by the UN Security Council. The hon. Member for
Falkirk raised the issue of the speculation that the African Union
summit could result in some states withdrawing from the Rome statute.
He will not be surprised to hear 
<?notus-xml column=78?>that I will not engage in speculation, but I shall make two points.
Although there is a perception that the ICC is focused only on Africa,
there is a broad range of views, as there would be in the UK, across
the African Union. Only a couple of days ago, 130 groups from across
Africa called for not only sustained but greater co-operation with the
ICC. He will not be surprised to hear that we urge African states to
continue their support for the Court, and encourage those African
states not party to the Rome statue to consider ratification or
accession and other ways that they can support the Court’s work.
African support and expertise continues to be vital to enable the Court
to fulfil its mandate of delivering justice for victims and tackling
impunity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000091">I
am the first to acknowledge that the Court is a young institution. The
UK is among those, not only in Africa, but elsewhere, who would like to
see improvements. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone made a powerful
point about other countries around the world that are not signatories
to the Rome statute, and the terrible atrocities in Syria, which we
have seen on our television screens. I am sure that he is aware of the
UK Government’s position: those who perpetrated those horrific
crimes should face justice.</hs_Para>

conclude, I shall reflect for a moment on the Kenyan elections in
March. The Kenyan people and politicians need to be congratulated on
the peaceful nature of the elections, which was in stark contrast to
the violence which marred the election in 2007-08. That demonstrated
the determination of the Kenyan people to express their democratic
right to elect a Government of their choosing in an environment free
from violence and intimidation. Kenyans should be proud of that
significant achievement. The UK played a role in supporting the
democratic process, including by providing £16 million to
support free and peaceful elections. The UK position has been
consistent and clear: it is for the Kenyan people to elect their
leaders and for the courts to resolve any disputes that stem from the

it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair during this important, but
short,
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000097">Every
year the Government need to think about how they will prepare for
winter and the challenges that lie ahead, including how we can prevent
thousands of people from dying from cold each winter. However, we have
a greater challenge this year and in the years to come. Energy bills
have risen by more than £300 under this Government; Ofgem is
warning of blackouts; and the energy market appears to be becoming less
and less predictable. We need short-term and long-term action and I
want to be confident that the Government are taking that action. I want
to be confident about that, so I can pass it on to thousands of my
constituents who are elderly, disabled, have young children or who are
alone and are worrying about how they will heat their homes this
winter. I may get silly answers, as one official told my office staff
yesterday, but I am sure the Minister has more sense than that and will
give these issues proper
consideration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000098">First,
I want to speak about the worrying headlines about blackout Britain.
Before anybody tries to intervene—unfortunately, there are no
hon. Members here to do that—I am talking about actual blackouts
due to lack of energy, not energy companies scaremongering about what
they might do if a Labour Government froze energy prices. Ofgem
announced in the summer that we are facing a crisis, with our safety
margin of spare capacity for electricity about to shrink from a healthy
margin of around 15%, to less than 4% within three years. This winter,
the estimated de-rated capacity margin is 6.3% and, only this week,
National Grid announced that it was keeping a “close watching
brief” on supplies. I do not want to be alarmist, because we
will probably be all right, but if the chief executive of Ofgem felt it
necessary to warn of a “near crisis”, I think we need to
take that seriously. Do the Government take it seriously? I know that
provisions have been included in the Energy Bill for this, and we
support the principle of a capacity mechanism, even if we have not been
given many details. As an aside, I would like to know when we can
expect details on this. Hopefully, we will have them before
2018.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13100951000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000145">Crucially,
the first capacity market auction for 2014 is for delivery of capacity
from 2018-19. What provisions are in place for this winter and those
leading up to 2018? Will we be reliant upon the small diesel generators
available under the short-term operating reserve in these years? What
assessment has the Minister done of the necessity to use those during
this period? In such cases, we could become further reliant on gas,
particularly liquefied natural gas. Demand for that is increasing from
countries such as China, so I have concerns about the price we will
have to pay for this commodity. External shocks might dramatically
increase the price of gas, just as Fukushima increased Japan’s
demand for gas and therefore increased prices across the world. Gas
storage in the UK is equivalent to 14 days’ worth of supply,
compared with between 59 and 87 days’ worth in Italy, Germany
and France.</hs_ParaIndent>

acknowledges that the UK has returned to levels of import dependency
not seen since the 1970s. We must consider the countries from which we
are importing gas—Qatar and Russia are key suppliers. According
to Peter Hughes, a former vice-president of BP, importing from such
countries means we are more vulnerable to short-term price increases,
and we are therefore vulnerable to political volatility. I recognise
that the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change recently
published a statement saying that he will press ahead with
interventions already in hand, but I do not think we will see the
immediate effects
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000100">I
also hope that DECC officials are planning how to use any excess gas.
Were we to buy too much gas and have a warmer winter, will energy
prices be lowered? I would have thought so, as energy companies blame
higher profits on the cold winter, but knowing what I know, I think we
will have to work hard to ensure that we see the financial effects of a
warm winter. Is Ofgem capable of forcing companies to do
that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000101">In
a recent BBC survey, 25% of people said that they are living in an
unacceptably cold home. That is unbelievable in the 21st century. The
Government have committed to ensuring that half of all households have
at least one insulation measure by 2022, but the Minister will be only
too aware that we are nowhere near meeting that target. In the middle
of last month only 12 households—not 12,000, nor 1,200 but
12—had some sort of measure installed under the green deal, with
372 households waiting. What assessment have the Government made of
that? Why is uptake so
low?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000102">The
green deal is not a good deal for the public; it offers high interest
rates of some 8%, which I have been told can be undercut by other
sources of finance. The only incentive is the cashback payments, which
will soon dry up. Predatory door-to-door and nuisance call selling
tactics are also not encouraging concerned people to take up the deal.
Perhaps the Minister needs to give some sleeping pills to his colleague
the right hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker), who said
that he would not be sleeping unless 10,000 had signed up to the green
deal by the end of the year—he must have had a lot of sleepless
nights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000103">That
is based on those households that can even apply for insulation. I have
a good number of tenement blocks in my constituency that are home to
some of the people who we really need to be helping in the winter
months: the elderly and the poor. The green deal is not a bad deal for
them; it is an impossible deal. Glasgow city council has been trying to
upgrade some of its stock through retrofit schemes, but there are so
many types of building that are unfit for insulation measures and are
leaking heat at an alarming rate. What are the Government’s
plans for them? For those people who are waiting on the green deal to
bear fruit, January 2014 is not good enough. People need warm houses at
the start of the winter, not at the end.</hs_Para>

do not turn on their heating because of the cost. In fact, almost seven
in 10 households did not do so at some point last winter. The revised
figures in the Hills report show that 7,800 people die in winter
because they cannot afford to heat their home properly. Of course,
rising energy bills are not helping. Energy barons are simply
profiteering from their customers, with profits going up each year from
what are already eye-watering figures. The big six doubled their profit

<?notus-xml column=81?>margins in the last year alone. The Government have totally failed to
act on this, claiming that the market is competitive, which it simply
is
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000105"><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="13100951000182" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000182"><B>Guy

heating oil prices for thousands of people across the

circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Robertson" PimsId="401" UID="13100951000185" xid="504" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000185">John

I have said, many people do not turn on the heating because of the
cost. The Government’s report shows that 7,800 people die
because of the winter cold. The energy barons are profiteering as far
as I am concerned. The big six doubled their profit margins last year
alone, and the Government have totally failed to act, claiming that the
market is competitive, which it simply is not. I am pleased to say that
in 2015, if Labour is elected, as I am sure we will be, energy bills
will be
frozen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000110">The
energy companies are scaremongering, saying that they will turn the
lights off and that investment will stop. They could manipulate a
black-out, so a real hard-nosed regulator is needed now, just in case.
A family in my constituency will save £112 a year under
Labour’s idea, but that is not enough on its own. Energy prices
have been rising far too much for far too long, but it would be a
start. The fact that Co-operative Energy backs the move shows that
bills do not need to rise. All the companies could give contracts
lasting for two years. Saying there would be a black-out due to the
price freeze is absolutely spurious. There is no way they can justify
saying
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000111">Despite
having 98% of the market, the big six provide only 47% of investment.
So where exactly is the money from successive price rises going? The
Government, as the previous Conservative Government did with BT, need
to support new companies in the sector and ensure that at least 25% of
provision is in the hands of companies 
<?notus-xml column=82?>other than the big six. That was a Conservative policy in the 1980s. I
spoke against it back then, but I can see the need for it now,
particularly for the energy
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000112">The
big question today is: what are the Government going to do this winter
and next? Will my constituents be left helpless for another year,
watching their bills go up by an expected 10% this year and probably
twice again before the general election? We want people to have a
better life, and this Tory-led Government want big business to make the
difference. That is not happening in the energy sector. The Government
are unwilling to sort out energy prices. We will have to wait until
2015 for a Labour Government to do that, but perhaps the Minister could
consider cold weather payments. I was shocked to find that nobody in my
constituency received a cold weather payment last year or the year
before. The Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the
hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb) has acknowledged that
that might be due to unclaimed pension credit, although saying that is
different from acting on it. More can be done to get pensioners on to
that benefit. What is actually being done?</hs_Para>

reason is that the conditions on these payments are much too strict.
The £25 is automatically allocated if the weather has been, or
is forecast to be, an average of 0° C over a seven-day period.
That is extremely cold and for an extremely long time. Last winter was
bitter. In the weeks leading up to other parts of the country being
given the payment in March this year, there was a seven-day period in
my constituency when the average temperature was 1.57° C. During
that time, the thermometer recorded much lower
temperatures—minus 3° C, minus 4° C and even minus
8° C one day. I am talking about record low temperatures, but no
payment was made.</hs_Para>

estimated that there are about 8,000 extra deaths for every 1° C
drop in the average temperature. We need to have a good look at how the
system works. How many people have to die before anything is done?
Perhaps we could look at raising the temperature threshold or, as the
Institution of Gas Engineers and Managers suggests, basing it on
heating degree days. In my constituency, winters are long. The weather
was particularly cold in April last year, but cold weather payments go
up only to 31 March. Why? Will the Minister do an impact assessment on
the effects of those cut-off points?</hs_Para>

Minister actually doing to save lives? The Government’s Hills
report told us of the thousands of people dying due to fuel poverty.
How long will it be until Ministers take notice? How many lives
will  be lost? These payments are important because, as a
recent study showed, poorer households reduce their food expenditure by
7.2% in cold weather shocks. I  commend the Prime Minister for
making the £25 payment permanent, but I believe it should be
higher. The website energyhelpline.com estimates that, on cold days,
families could be spending as much as £20 a day on energy. With
energy bills rising, that is certain to increase. We have been told the
payment will be set at £25 for the whole Parliament. Clearly,
that is not enough.</hs_Para>

assumes that people will turn on their heating in cold weather. Elderly
people, in particular, worry about turning on their heating, because of
the cost. However, the winter fuel payment not only provides the
financial support pensioners need to turn the heating on, but gives
them confidence that they can afford to keep it on for as long as they
need to.</hs_Para>

consistently looked to increase them. I am pleased the coalition
Government honoured our 2010 Budget for that winter, making one-off
£100 or £50 payments to various people, but
that was not continued. Those payments were crucial to helping
pensioners afford to keep warm. Expenditure on them is likely to
decrease from £2.2 billion to £2 billion by 2017-18. I am

are the Government publicising these and other support measures? I fear
the emphasis in terms of spending may be misplaced. Considering that
the firm used to advertise the green deal was fined £45,000 for
nuisance calls, the advertising budget could surely be spent better.
Perhaps it could be spent on advertising offline to reach all
vulnerable people and to highlight the different support measures
available: winter fuel payments, cold weather payments, the warm home
discount, Warm Front, Nest, the energy assistance package and the
priority services register—the list goes on. I worry that those

realise that some of those support measures fall outside the

Departments actually talk to each other? Do the Government talk to the

Gentleman said that prices had risen by £300 under this
Government, but I remind him that they have risen more slowly in the
first three years of this Government than they did in the last five
years of the previous Labour Government.</hs_Para>

to the hon. Gentleman’s first point, on margin and capacity. He
will have studied the assessments made by the National Grid and Ofgem.
Those assessments say that the margin would tighten if nothing were
done, but things are, of course, being done. Things are being done in
the short term better to balance the system. Ofgem is consulting on a
number of measures to ensure that there is better balance on the demand
and the supply side. As the hon. Gentleman himself said, the
Government plan to run the first capacity market—the reserve
supply. We are ready to run the auction next year, so that supply can
be available in 2018. He asked when further details of the capacity
market would be made available; that will be in the next few weeks,
before the legislation leaves the House of Lords.</hs_Para>

outlook, the National Grid assessment is that the demand for energy
this winter will be broadly similar to last year’s. We are not
immune to the impacts of prolonged severe weather. A combination of a
diverse range of import capacity and a mixture of storage types has
performed well over the past few years, and we expect it to do so again
this year. We expect electricity demand this winter to remain flat at
current levels, and we have significant spare gas capacity, as the
Holford and Aldbrough storage sites increase their delivery networks.
Last winter, gas demand was around 290 million cubic metres a day. Our
gas supply infrastructure can deliver more than twice that amount with
high levels of secure flow from Norway and the
continent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100951000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000128"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Robertson" PimsId="401" UID="13100951000189" xid="504" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100951000189">John

households through our warm home discount scheme, which is worth

The first is a core group, whose members automatically receive a
£135 discount on their bills. Consumers who are either under 75
and not receiving the savings credit part of pension credit, or over 75
on the qualifying date and in receipt of a pension credit, are
eligible. The discount rises to £140 in 2014-15. For older
consumers who have less access to technology, that automatic payment is
a big advantage. We expect this year’s automatic payments to be
made by Christmas. Indeed, hundreds of thousands of payments will be
made this month, giving people confidence that they can afford to turn
their heating up when the cold weather sets in. The broader group also
targets low-income and vulnerable consumers, but provides energy
suppliers with the opportunity to set the eligibility criteria, which
must be approved by Ofgem. The third element is a legacy spend group

that fine tradition of probing and debating. The conclusion I have come
to, supported by the DPP’s statement, is that the policy on
prosecutions or offences contravening the Abortion Act is unclear, and,
sadly, largely unenforceable. The DPP has helpfully shone a
prosecutorial light on the practice of abortion where doctors have no
direct contact with patients, where authorisation forms can be
pre-signed, and where assessments concerning physical or mental health

60,000 abortions a year. She says that sex selection may not be grounds
for abortion, but there is no legal requirement to deny a woman an
abortion if she has a sex preference, provided that the legal grounds
are still met. Indeed, Ann Furedi went so far as to say it would be
“wrong” to refuse to consider an abortion request when
gender is cited as a reason. Those are the words not of the Chinese or
Indian pregnancy advisory service but of the British Pregnancy Advisory
Service, advocating gender selection abortions and the removal of
barriers to abortion. The issue is worldwide: <I>The</I>

I heard about the investigation and the Care Quality Commission
investigations that followed, I could not believe that such things
could be happening in this country. The words I have quoted and the
lack of any prosecutorial decision—there have been a handful of
prosecutions for abortion contraventions in the past  10
years—give a green light to abortion on demand, which flies in
the face of the Abortion Act and the intention of parliamentarians in
1967. Some 98% of abortions tick the box of mental health risk, but if

in this country abortion on demand. I recognise that the
Attorney-General is focused on the prosecution policy and will not
trespass into the wider health policies, but my question is relevant.

the

Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), the outgoing public
health Minister—I welcome the new Minister, the Under-Secretary
of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Jane
Ellison), who is here—wrote to me on 3 October; it was one of
her last letters as public health Minister. She wrote to say
unequivocally, and it has been repeated by the Secretary of State for
Health, that abortion on the grounds of gender alone is unacceptable
and illegal. This has not changed. I therefore look forward to the
Attorney-General making the obvious point and confirming the policy
position. However, there is some doubt, because Ann Furedi, the BPAS
chief executive, says that the law is “silent” on the
question. Indeed, the DPP in his letter on 7 October said quite
properly that the law does not expressly prohibit gender-specific
abortions. Rather, it prohibits any abortion carried out without two
medical practitioners having formed a view in good faith that the
health risks of continuing with the pregnancy outweigh those of
termination.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000016">The

a criminal defence lawyer, I looked more deeply into that decision. The
reasoning seems to be for an evidential rather than a public interest
factor against prosecution—the public interest factor was the
focus of the review. The CPS statement seemed to be going into what the
DPP himself admits were the overlapping considerations of the
evidential and public interest tests. The main basis of the
DPP’s reasoning for not supporting a prosecution—which
went a stage further and, with great respect, I suggest perhaps moved
the goalposts towards the evidential side of things—was the
evidential difficulties arising in the case, which I think can be
applied generally and are of general concern in all such cases.
Although the evidential test in that particular case had been passed,
my concern is that the wider public interest appears to have been
sidelined. That is not only my view, although I have 20 or so years of
experience in the criminal law and in dealing with cases where it is
difficult to detect a
crime.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000024">What
is the public interest factor in such cases? The former DPP, Lord
Macdonald, drew attention to that point, saying that there is
“strong public interest” in prosecuting crimes that are
hard to detect, such as sex-selection abortion. The onus is therefore
much more on looking into what is in the public interest when so few
cases are exposed and where we recognise that there are evidential
difficulties—perhaps inherent—in the current system,
given the lack of guidance. Does that not make the case even more
strongly for a prosecution being in the public
interest?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_09_PT_1/CEDC88628BD14BB73F38E60A1578B767FD1C4658" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="9 October 2013">Wednesday

Any effect can spread to all sorts of other areas, such as assisted

enforced, as it has been in one or two cases, confidence in the
law’s ability to deal with highly complex issues
disappears.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Burrowes" PimsId="4754" UID="13100952000191" xid="839" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000191">Mr
Burrowes:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. In cases of
assisted suicide, the DPP has come forward with guidance to provide
some clarity, and that was carefully worked through. One of my requests
to the Attorney-General is to reflect on what has happened and, with
the DPP, to come forward with clear guidance to ensure that confidence
in the integrity of the law that many say has been lost. I also ask the
Attorney-General to comment on the former DPP’s view. In
addition, it must be in the public interest, in policy terms, for such
cases, in which there has been an obvious abuse of abortion
legislation—the cases are unusual and rarely see the light of
day, because they are not readily detected—and in which the
evidential threshold has been passed, to be seen in court.</hs_Para>

danger now is that the decision by the DPP,
following on from the CPS, sets a precedent—no prosecutions
under the Abortion Act without clearer evidence. Where will we get that
clearer evidence? Do we now have a new evidential test for
abortion-related offences, which can rarely be satisfied due to the
lack of the different factors affecting this, not least the lack of
professional guidance from
doctors?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000028">Another
concern about the CPS decision not to find public interest to prosecute
was the deferral to the GMC to enforce the breach of law. That was
particularly apparent in the original decision of the CPS, which saw
that as a key factor. The last time that I checked on enforcement of
the Abortion Act, it was for the courts to do, and not for a
disciplinary committee of GPs, which was never mentioned or even
suggested in 1967. That option is certainly not in statute. This is
specifically prescribed in statute as a contravention, and the law
should be enforced. I trust that the Attorney-General will make it
clear today that criminal sanctions cannot be avoided because of
professional status—making a point about integrity—and
that applies across the board with other instances of criminality
involving the professions. Plainly, everyone is equal under the law,
although some of us would say that that is not the case for an unborn
child.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000029">The
CPS decision to drop the case and to leave it to the GMC highlights the
gap between abortion law and practice. That must be filled somehow, at
least by guidance through GPs, but also by reform of the legislation. I
therefore welcome the assurance that I received from my hon. Friend the
Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), then an Under-Secretary of State for
Health, that the Department of Health has requested that the chief
medical officer issue guidance. I look forward to it, and hope that
there will be proper consultation on
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000030">Such
guidance is needed not only because of the cases involving GPs
highlighted by <I>The Daily Telegraph</I>, but also because of the CQC

England failed inspections, all involving the photocopying of

hospital’s regular routine was to pre-sign all abortion
forms—not only in one case—and the Princess Alexandra
hospital in Harlow used the photocopied signature of a doctor for so
long that it was well beyond the time that he had been employed as a
doctor or could have had any knowledge of the cases. Such is the extent
of the abuse and breaches of the Abortion Act. Such malpractice would
not be tolerated by patients or others in the prescription of
antibiotics or common painkillers, for example, and yet a blind eye is
being turned in abortion
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0001.htm#13100952000031">The
scandal is not only about malpractice, however; those hospitals were
not referred to the police for investigation, and no CQC investigation

on the issue of abortion, in particular because such problems might
have led to sex-selection abortion. Without such investigative
reporting on behalf of the public interest, there would probably be no
one to complain, and the issue would go by the bye. The reality is that
the unborn child has no complaint process. There is a lack of
transparent information, and no real safeguards. It is up to Parliament

the right message is sent from this place to those who prosecute. We
deplore the fact that any medical professional would ever stretch the
current legislation to allow selective abortion. The GMC has
intervened, but that is not enough. The law was not designed for that

impossible to be prosecuted in this country for carrying out an illegal

issue for Parliament and for this debate is whether Parliament makes
the laws, or whether the Crown Prosecution Service does. This
Parliament makes the laws, and clearly when it framed the Abortion

gender selection in this country. In my view, it is outrageous that in
Britain today the most dangerous position to be in is that of a female
fetus. That is completely unacceptable. It should not be tolerated in a
free society; we should not tolerate it.</hs_Para>

Friend—it is quite wrong. India’s 2011 census shows
7.1 million fewer girls than boys under the age of
six—a gap that has almost doubled over two decades. Rather than
a function of villages being backward or poor, this is a phenomenon
that grows more pronounced, apparently, as Indians grow richer. Studies
show that wealthier, better-educated Indians are more likely to have
boys, because they can afford the newish tools of ultrasound and
gender-specific abortion. In Mumbai, some clinics market their services

discrimination, but no action is to  be taken when one of the

account of being a girl—is highlighted. I congratulate my hon.

is not the only form of discrimination against the unborn child in this
country. Over the course of more than a year, the cross-party
parliamentary inquiry into abortion on the grounds of disability, which
I had the privilege of chairing and which published its report in July,
took evidence from 300 witnesses. The full report can be seen at the
website abortionanddisability.org. Just as people are shocked that
abortion can be allowed on the grounds of sex, people we spoke to were
shocked to discover, in an age when we go to extensive lengths to
accept, support and respect disabled people, seeing them as wholly
equal, that a child can be aborted right up to the moment of birth on
the grounds that they may be disabled. In contrast to the situation for
non-disabled babies, there is no 24-week time limit. Indeed, we heard
that many expectant mothers felt funnelled into having an abortion when
they were told that they were expecting a potentially disabled
child.</hs_Para>

highlights the lack of clarity in the abortion regulations about what
constitutes a serious disability. Some mothers who were told they were
expecting a disabled child told us the diagnosis was wrong. Others were
told that abortions would be allowed on the grounds of a cleft palate
or a club foot, and indeed they can be. Those are minor disabilities,
as I know, because I have a son with a club foot. In an era of enormous
support for the disabled and their families, we cannot allow this form
of discrimination to persist. We must take action to review
it.</hs_Para>

the DPP gave for not proceeding with the prosecution was that it would
not be in the public interest. Prosecutors have also pointed out that
the issue has become sensitive and political. How can it not be in the
public interest to state firmly and clearly that abortion on the
grounds of a child’s sex is wrong? It is wrong morally and
legally, and if the law is not sufficiently clear on this point, it is
our duty as parliamentarians and politicians—I see nothing wrong

recognises the right to choose the “number and spacing”

is, with only one exception, no clear evidence of such a divergence
from the norm. Interestingly, the country in question is Sri Lanka and,
curiously, the birth ratio for mothers born there is 99.2 male children

stance against the discriminatory practice in question, and support

ground of gender are illegal in this country. My Bill called on the
Department of Health to establish procedures to record the gender of
babies aborted under the Abortion Act 1967, when the sex can be
determined, and to consider a review of the penalties for anyone found
to have facilitated the abortion of a child because of their gender.

Friend the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), with her medical

straightforward in my remarks. If the law is not adequate to stop the
practice in question, it must be changed. If it has not been properly
interpreted and enforced, it must be. It is up to the Attorney-General
to make sure that that happens. If my accountant signed a form and
allowed me to fill it in for my farming business and send it to the tax
authorities, although it was all completely wrong, we would both be
prosecuted. Yet here we are, talking about the actions of doctors in
various places. Most doctors act very honourably, but there are a few
who have not. They cannot just photocopy forms and allow someone else

people have faith in it, if shoddy practice allows perfectly healthy
babies, of whatever sex, to be aborted? I shall be completely honest
and open: I do not like abortion. I think it is carried out far too
late, and I do not much like its being carried out at all. I accept
that in exceptional circumstances, when there are very serious problems
with a fetus, there could be an argument for it to be aborted; but not
just because it does not suit someone’s lifestyle, religion or

second objection, which was echoed at the time by the former Director

deference that the CPS seemed to be showing the medical profession. The
CPS seems to believe that doctors can have the discretion to disapply
the law in their surgeries. It seems to me that when a roofer breaks
the law, he is hauled into court and faces the prospect of prison. When
a doctor does, he should also be hauled into court and should not
simply be heard by a panel of his peers with no criminal powers. That
is taking the idea of “Doctor knows best” far too far.

meaningless.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100952000113">Following
the outcry, the DPP, Keir Starmer, has issued a statement seeking to
explain further the reasoning behind the decision. That statement,

argument, while quietly dropping some of the old ones. Mr Starmer now
tells us that the evidential threshold for the allegation that this was
a gender-based abortion has not been met. He says that that was because
other factors were alluded to during the discussion between patient and
doctor. Instead, the matter hinged on whether the doctors fulfilled
their duty under the Abortion Act to carry out a sufficiently robust
assessment of the risk to the pregnant 
<?notus-xml column=104?>woman’s mental and physical health to reach a good-faith opinion
that the continuation of the pregnancy would involve a risk, greater
than if the pregnancy was terminated, to the woman’s mental and
physical health. The director explains that there is no guidance on how
a doctor should assess that and therefore no yardstick by which to
measure whether the doctors’ assessments fell below a standard
that any reasonable doctor would consider adequate. The director
concludes that it would be of questionable public interest to prosecute
amid such
uncertainty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100952000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100952000114">That

the child. On that basis, it may well have seemed incomprehensible that
the full force of the criminal law was not being brought to bear on a
practice that most people would regard as abhorrent. I certainly do and
I think that everyone in this room does. But as I hope to make clear

entitles the public to have confidence in those decisions. However, it
is also important that the public should be able to understand the
decisions and, where that is not straightforward, that prosecutors make
a special effort to explain them. This was obviously such a case, and I

the decision before it was taken, is that I was not. The case was not
raised with me by the director prior to the decision not to prosecute
being taken. In my view, it should have been, and on reflection, the
director accepts that he should have done so. Before that leads to an
inference that therefore the decision might have been different, I
simply make the point that as I asked the director to review the
decision completely and I had ample opportunity to consult with him
before he did so, I am satisfied that the decision that has now been

emphasise that the law is not framed in terms of prohibiting
gender-specific abortion or indeed listing any other forms of unlawful
abortion. It works, or was intended to work by Parliament, by providing
for abortions to be performed safely, by qualified medical
practitioners, when those practitioners judge it to be in the medical
interests of the patient and where that is the course that the patient
herself agrees is right. Two medical practitioners must on each
occasion have formed a view, in good faith, that the health risks of
continuing with a pregnancy outweigh those of termination. That is our
guarantee, as provided by Parliament, that we have a system of safe and
lawful abortion provided by the 1967
Act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100953000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Neil Parish" PimsId="4943" UID="13100953000091" xid="1159" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000091">Neil

available in the cases to bring the good faith of the doctors into
issue. I think that the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury
was wrong when she said in her final statement that the position had
changed. The DPP’s statement of reasons says, nevertheless, that
the evidence was not strong in either case and the prospects of
conviction would not in his judgment have been high on the facts as
they appeared. The matter does not rest there. Even in a case that just
about passes the evidential threshold, the CPS is obliged to consider
whether a prosecution would be in the public interest. That is one of
the tasks that we require it to do. The fact that an evidential
threshold is passed—a point raised in the debate—does not
mean that a prosecution has to, or indeed should,
follow.</hs_Para>

was that prosecution did not pass the public interest threshold. It is
that aspect of the decision that raises wider issues of public policy,
some of which we have debated today, which I accept are an entirely
legitimate topic of debate. The issue, as I see it, is this. Because
the law makes the difference between lawful and unlawful abortion
subject to a medical test, doctors have to be able to carry out that
test on a case-by-case basis according to proper medical standards of
care, skill and judgment. That is, effectively, what the test of
“good faith” in the 1967 Act means. Doctors are required
by law to make such decisions to a proper professional standard. If a
question arises about whether a doctor has done so in any given case, a
law enforcement agency must look to approved medical practice for
assistance in identifying the proper standard. The same thing applies
in virtually every case involving professional standards. Dare I say
it, it would apply even in the case of a plumber who carried out some
work that led to a catastrophic
outcome.</hs_Para>

agencies acting as a back-stop for the most egregious cases that flout
any conceivable proper standards. The other view, which I understand
that the Department of Health has accepted, is that such a situation
allows law enforcement far too residual a role and that the balance
needs to be redressed. The law enforcement agencies will need clearer
and more specific guidance on how to distinguish between desirable and

The Attorney-General has rightly said that we should not second-guess a
prosecutor, the professional judgment of a doctor or the position of a
jury when taking evidence. We can, however, second-guess ourselves as
legislators. During the passage of the Human Fertilisation and
Embryology Act 2008, we were assured that gender selection would not be
permitted as a ground for abortion, and that a proposed amendment to
that effect was redundant. I am sure that that was said in good faith,

is quite clear from a reading of the 1967 Act that gender selection
alone is not grounds for the termination of a pregnancy. The debate has
highlighted policy issues, which Parliament can debate further if it

weight in respect of, in particular, the impact on a woman’s
mental health of continuing with a pregnancy. That is inherent in the
drafting of the legislation, which places a great burden of

strike action by certain teaching unions. Last week, on 1 October,
members of the National Union of Teachers and NASUWT went on strike in
49 local authorities in eastern England, the midlands,
Yorkshire and the Humber, consequently denying education to pupils in

this opportunity to urge teachers in schools in my constituency to
think twice about strike action and, like their many fellow
professionals who turned their back on last week’s strike, not
to strike at the expense of their pupils’ education and welfare.

us turn to the origin of the decision to take industrial action. Last
year, the two largest teaching unions, the NUT and NASUWT, voted to
take industrial action throughout 2013. At first glance, the results of
the ballots seem decisive: 82.5% of NUT members and 82% of NASUWT
members voted in favour of strike action. We must, however, look at the
turnout for the ballots: just 27% of all NUT members responded by
returning their ballots, as did 40% of NASUWT members. In reality,
strike action was therefore voted through by just 22% of NUT members
and 33% of NASUWT
members.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100953000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000041">Even
then, it is important to note that those unions do not represent the
teaching profession of more than 750,000 teachers in its entirety.
Taking that into account, strike action was agreed by the unions with a
mandate of only 17.3% of teachers voting to strike. That is
significant, because we must recognise the increasing divide between
teachers or teaching professionals and the unions who claim to
represent their
voice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100953000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000042">In
recent years, it seems that the only voice that unions represent is the
growing tendency towards militant socialism that has gripped the heart

Alliance for Workers’ Liberty, while 11 were endorsed by the
Socialist Workers party in their election to the executive, four are

Skidmore:</Member></B> It is
extremely important that school leadership remains strong at this time.
I am referring here to the chair of governors, who has a duty to
reflect the community’s voice, and the head teacher. As we know,
it is the leadership that decides whether a school should remain open
or should close. In my own constituency, I have seen the head teacher
make the decision. As well as telling teachers who wish not to strike
to have the courage of their convictions and to cross the picket line
and go into school, we must also tell head teachers to stand firm on
their principles. They are the captain of the ship in the school and
they must ensure that it stays open for as long as
possible.</hs_Para>

my point about teachers striking in school holidays, I do not believe
that teachers are taking off the entire school holiday. They are
working hard in that period when the pupils are away from school, so it
should not make any difference if the strike action was taken in school
holidays rather than term time unless the deliberate aim of the
teachers’ unions is to cause the maximum possible disruption to
pupils’ learning, which would be
regrettable.</hs_Para>

there will always be disagreements and battles over how schools are run
and pupils are taught. That is fair enough. Teachers themselves may
disagree over the direction of a policy or a Government, and that is
their right, but such battles should be fought not by strikes but in
the court of public opinion, with ballots that reflect the views of all
teachers and parents, and, ultimately, at the ballot box. They should
not be fought, as those striking well know, at the expense of the
children whom they claim to
serve.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_09_PT_1/18D09EF269794D6B41F13EB90A3E8A907F9836B0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="9 October 2013">Wednesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Elizabeth
Truss):</Member></B> It is a
pleasure, Mr Pritchard, to serve under your chairmanship this
afternoon. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood
(Chris Skidmore) on his excellent speech, which outlined many important
issues, and on his ongoing work to support the reform of education,
which is vital for our country. I note that we do not have Opposition
Front Benchers at this debate. The Opposition have remained silent on
the issue of trade unions, even though many of their Members of
Parliament are funded by those
organisations.</hs_Para>

benefit no one. They damage the education of pupils and inconvenience
parents and carers, who often rely on school when they are out at work.
The children who are let down the most are those from low-income
backgrounds who desperately need an excellent education to help them
get on in life. Moreover, strikes do not support the teaching
profession. What we want is a highly valued and respected profession
that takes professional responsibility for what it does. The strikes
are in danger of undermining the well deserved public respect for
teachers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100953000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000061">The
recent strikes have been particularly disappointing. They do not
command public support. A recent Populus poll found that 70% of the
public do not support the planned strikes, and, as my hon. Friend
pointed out, teachers themselves do not support them. Less than a
quarter of teachers voted in favour of strike action when they were
balloted by the National Union of Teachers and the
NASUWT.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100953000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000062">I am pleased
to say, though, that fewer schools closed than on previous occasions.
In last week’s strike in Yorkshire, the midlands and the east of
England, only a third of schools were fully closed to pupils. That was
down to the hard work and dedication of many teachers and head
teachers. By comparison, 60% of schools in the same regions were fully
closed in the national strike of November 2011. That shows that those
who seek wholesale disruption of our schools are losing the argument,
and less and less support for such action is being shown in the
classroom. Like my hon. Friend, I encourage teachers and head teachers
in constituencies that could be affected by the forthcoming strike to
keep their schools open. The majority of Britain’s hardworking
teachers understand that strike action is not the right way to express
their concerns about education reform, and they need to put pressure on
their unions to stop it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100953000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000063">The NUT and
the NASUWT have identified the issues of pay, particularly
performance-related pay, and pensions as an underlying cause of the
strikes. Most people get performance-related pay, so the concept is
widely understood. It helps to improve performance and retain
high-quality personnel. Teaching should be 
<?notus-xml column=115?>no different. The public understand that. In recent surveys, 61% of the
public supported performance-related pay for teachers. Pay reform,
which means moving to a performance-related pay system and away from
automatic increments based on how long someone has been a teacher, will
reward excellence and raise the professional status of teaching. It
will help schools to attract high-flying graduates and career-changers,
particularly to subjects for which it is difficult to recruit teachers
because there are highly competitive jobs available
elsewhere.</hs_Para>

challenging circumstances, which often struggle to retain good

recent YouGov poll for Policy Exchange found that nine out of 10
teachers think that the quality of teaching should be a major driver in
pay and progression, while only six out of 10 think that years of
experience should be a major factor in pay. Many teachers themselves
support the changes. The unions should be helping us to work with head
teachers to ensure that performance-related pay is implemented in a way
that is fair to teachers, rather than calling for strike action, which
will not only cause problems for the profession but potentially affect
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100953000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100953000067">The
other issue is pension reform. Changes to teachers’ pension
arrangements are in line with changes to public sector pensions in
general. We all know that people are living longer, and the cost of
public service pensions has increased by a third in the past 10 years
to £32 billion. The new teachers’ pension scheme remains
one of the very best available. All the evidence suggests that it does
help to attract people into the teaching
profession.</hs_Para>

the teaching unions might be motivated to take strike action for

</I>All educational research suggests that the
quality of teaching is the No. 1 factor in a child’s education
that will make the difference between learning and not learning.
However, we have seen this week, in the Programme for the International
Assessment of Adult Competencies study from the OECD, exactly where we
are in the skills league table, and during the past decades, our skills
have not significantly improved. It is a huge worry that, in key skills
such as literacy and numeracy, we have not seen the kind of improvement
that those who said that exam grades had improved have
claimed.</hs_Para>

issue with our education system. We know that the quality of our
education and skills is related to economic growth. We also know that
children who do not reach the levels of literacy and numeracy that they
need to reach will not get good jobs and will face more danger of being
unemployed. Those are critical issues, which is why we have embarked on
a wide-ranging series of reforms in education. First of all, there was
the academy and free schools programme, to ensure that head teachers
have the powers they need to improve results in their school. Secondly,
there was our programme to reform exams and the curriculum, to ensure
that we are teaching subjects such as mathematics, science and English
in a rigorous way. That is why we have reintroduced marks for grammar,
spelling and punctuation at GCSE level, and why we have addressed the
rampant grade inflation that has been evident in our GCSE results.
However, possibly most important of all our reforms is the way that we
are working to recruit the best and brightest to the teaching
profession.</hs_Para>

lot of tales of doom about teaching, but our figures compare very well
with those of other countries around the world when it comes to the age
profile of teachers. In many countries, those in the teaching
profession are close to retirement; that is a particular issue in
Germany. Here in England, those in the teaching profession are pretty
young. Teach First, a programme that ensures that top graduates are
attracted to teaching as soon as they leave university, has been very
effective. It is now the biggest graduate recruiter from our
universities, and teaching is now seen as an aspirational career by
many graduates when they leave university, which is fantastic. I am
delighted that this autumn we have been able to extend Teach First to
the early years, so we now have teachers who are top graduates straight
from university teaching three and
four-year-olds.</hs_Para>

is so much that we have to work on as a country to ensure that our
education system is world class. It is about all the things that I have
mentioned: teaching; the way that schools operate; and head teachers
having the flexibility to run their school in a way that will deliver
results for children. There are so many things that need to be done
that it is vital that everybody in the education system works to those
objectives. Progress is being made, and we have seen very positive
results. For example, the number of girls studying physics and
chemistry at GCSE is at a record high, and we have also 
<?notus-xml column=117?>seen the number of children studying maths and science at A-level go up.
When we have these very positive results in our education system, it is

Twigg), refused to condemn the strike action; actually, I do not think
that he supported or condemned it, but just said nothing about it, even
though children’s education was being disrupted. What we need to
hear from the new shadow Education Secretary is an answer to this
question: does he agree that these strikes should be condemned, and
does he agree with us that it is wrong for teachers to go on strike at
this important time in children’s educational careers, or is he
in the pockets of the unions, like his predecessor and like the leader
of his party? That is a question that I hope the Opposition will answer

this Conservative Government’s fear of the electoral challenge

fantastic relations throughout every single community, and we value

than ever that, with independence, Scotland will always get the
Government that we vote for. We will not have a Conservative Government

he is encouraged by what he has seen over the past few months. When the
Government were first challenged, they seemed to be able to

has a concern on immigration, and we will be questioning the Minister
when the immigration Bill is introduced, because it will contain some
horrible stuff that we must confront. We are still part of the UK, and
we will be subject to the Bill. We do not want it, but unfortunately we
will be subject to it. The Bill is contrary to everything that we are
trying to achieve for positive, good relations in Scotland, but we will

available, so the Conservatives decided to proceed any way. After what
we have heard from the Deputy Prime Minister, with whom I know he

that it was not right and that it was inconsistent with the good

Minister for Immigration (Mr Mark
Harper):</Member></B> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Pritchard. The hon.
Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) asked me lots of
questions and has not left me a great deal of time to answer them, but
I will do my best. If colleagues will forgive me, I shall address my
answers to him, as it is his debate. If I have chance, I will take
interventions from others, but it is right that I try to address his
questions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000049">I
suspect that the hon. Gentleman and I, from the sound of his remarks,
will not agree on the merits of the campaign, but it is worth setting
out our thinking, because the campaign is not what he suggests. It is
not focused at migrants; it is focused at people who are in the United
Kingdom illegally—people who are here and breaking our laws. The
campaign is not about
migrants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000050">The
hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil)—I
apologise again, because I always mangle the name of his
constituency—said that the Government do not welcome people to
Britain, which is not true. Every single time we make a speech or
publish something, we make it very clear that Britain is open to
migrants from across the world: people who want to come here to work,
to study and to make a contribution. That message, which is welcoming
to people who want to follow our laws and rules, is perfectly
compatible with a message that says, “For those people who come
here and do not follow the rules, and who want to break our laws, we
should be equally firm about telling them that we want to enforce those
laws.” Frankly, if people are here illegally, they should go
back to their country of origin. There is nothing wrong with suggesting
that they do so. If it is as bad here at the moment as the hon. Member
for Perth and North Perthshire suggests, the obvious question is why
people are in this country illegally and not returning to their country
of origin. We have worked closely with community groups and those
involved in supporting migrants to help them to deliver that message
sensitively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000051">The
campaign to which the hon. Gentleman refers was a pilot, and we were
trying to give a tough message about what will happen if people do not
leave the country voluntarily: they will leave themselves open to
arrest, detention and enforced removal. But the message also said that
there is something that those people can do: they can contact the Home
Office, and we will assist them in returning to their country of origin
voluntarily, perhaps supporting them to do so. A significant number of
people, more than 29,000, do that each year. That way of addressing the
problem is greatly preferable, and it is much better for the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000052">The
hon. Gentleman referred to the cost. The cost of the pilot was just
£10,000. If an individual who was in the country illegally
chooses to go home as a result of the pilot, it will have paid for
itself. We are doing a full evaluation. At the end of the three-month
period, which is a reasonable period because of the time it takes to
get travel documents, we will do the evaluation and then make a
decision about the
pilot.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000053">However,
I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the first voluntary departure as a
result of the pilot took place on 2 August. It was that of a Pakistani
national who had been living in the UK illegally since December. 
<?notus-xml column=125?>Interestingly—colleagues might find this slightly
ironic—he did not see the ad van itself; he saw a picture of it
in <I>The Guardian</I> newspaper.
He texted the number and we arranged to support him for his flight
home, so at least one individual has left the country as a result of
the pilot. From a cost perspective—something that I think the
Chair of the Select Committee on Home Affairs has mentioned—the
pilot has already paid for itself. If we had had to arrest, detain and
enforce the removal of one individual, it would have cost the taxpayer
probably the best part of £15,000, so from a cost perspective,
if we can persuade people to go home voluntarily, that is clearly the
right thing to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000054">The

van referred to someone’s area, and the hon. Gentleman is right
about the ASA’s view that people would interpret that as being
quite a narrow area. For example, in a London borough, people would
assume that it meant the London borough. Since our statistics were from
a slightly larger area, the ASA said that it was misleading. We have
therefore agreed not to use those advertisements in the form that was
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000058">The
ASA did not support the outlandish claims that I think the hon.
Gentleman suggested. He should also be aware that his views are not
supported by the public. The poll conducted by YouGov on 13 August
found that 66% of those polled in the United Kingdom did not consider
the poster to be racist, so two thirds of those polled do not agree
with him. Also, the comprehensive poll conducted by Lord Ashcroft and
published on 1 September found that 79% of those polled supported the
messaging in our posters, because they can see that giving a firm
message to people who are in the country illegally is perfectly
compatible with being welcoming and supportive of those who come to our
country legally, follow our rules and comply with the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000059">The
hon. Gentleman got very heated on that point, but I do not think that
he has the measure of public opinion on this issue. People want to
welcome those who come here for the right reasons, but the public want
to deal firmly with people who should not be here. The advertising
campaign was squarely aimed at those who are in the country illegally
and have no right to be here. Asking people in that context to return
to their country of origin is perfectly
reasonable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000060">The
hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Scotland reporting centre. He should
know that that pilot ran from 29 July, which is prior to his letter, to
4 October. It did not use any of the materials that we used for the ad
van campaign. A significant proportion of those using 
<?notus-xml column=126?>the reporting centre are people who have no right to be in the United
Kingdom. They should not be here and should be returning to their
country of origin. Partly, the message is a tough one, but the other
side of the message tells people that we can support their return and
help them to go
home.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000061">Our
immigration enforcement officers work closely with many communities in
the United Kingdom. They work with faith and voluntary groups that know
of people who want to return home, but need support to do that. They do
not want to be arrested or detained; they want to come forward in such
a way that they avoid that experience, and I think that that is
perfectly
reasonable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000062">The

evaluating the campaign to see how successful it has been in driving up
significantly the number of voluntary returns. We will make that
information available and then decide whether to

operations that we conducted, the hon. Gentleman referred to racial
profiling. I absolutely refute that. Our officers do not have the legal
power, and we do not have the ability, to do that. We use intelligence
to identify where to run the operations, and when we encounter people,
we decide whether to talk to them based on their behaviour, not their
race, ethnicity or appearance. I absolutely refute his allegation that
we are involved in racial profiling in street operations, and it is not
supported by the evidence. Again, it is worth saying that the general
public support the work that we do in enforcing illegal working laws
and in making sure that people obey the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000064">Our
officers have a difficult job to do. I have been out with them on
operations. They take their responsibilities and the intelligence
seriously, and they are well aware of the legal environment. They have
proper briefings before the operations and they deal with the people
they encounter sensitively. I have seen operations where, for example,
we have encountered people who have done nothing wrong, and our
officers have dealt with them very sensitively and handled a difficult
situation well. I do not think that the way in which the hon. Gentleman
characterises the issue reflects the reality on the ground. It is hard
and difficult work. Just as the police have a difficult job in
enforcing criminal laws, our immigration enforcement officers have to
enforce immigration laws. They deal with people who should not be in
the United Kingdom, and who might not wish to return to their country
of origin, but it is important that we enforce the law. It is difficult
work and will remain so. It has to be done sensitively, which is what
we have been

Nobody is questioning that we are talking about illegal immigrants. We
support the idea that there should be no illegal immigrants, but we
question the tactics used—for example, when there is forced
entry into shops and other places where they cannot find anybody and
the intelligence is poor. The small sample of 500 people supporting the
idea is not good

Harper:</Member></B> On the point
that the hon. Gentleman makes about entry, our officers have to obey
the law in the same way as other law enforcement officers. I have
attended operations on which we have encountered the “beds in
sheds” phenomenon in his part of London, where there are some
appalling pieces of accommodation. 
<?notus-xml column=127?>When we have to gain entry to those properties, we have to work with the
local authority. The local authority has to seek a warrant for entry.
We have to go through a proper legal process. We have to have evidence
and intelligence when we deal with those things, and it is the same
when we do illegal working operations. We have to have intelligence; we
do not simply do it on a speculative basis. If we have intelligence, we
approach people and gather evidence on whether people are working
illegally. I make no apology for doing that, because it is not simply
about the fact that they are breaking our laws. Employers who employ
people illegally undercut legitimate business people. They compete with
them unfairly, and we should deal with
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100956000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/halltext/131009h0002.htm#13100956000067">The
hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire both
said that they are against illegal immigration. I am glad that they
said that. All that the campaign was about was trying
something—a pilot—to see whether it was successful. We
have been frank about it and we will be guided by the evidence. If the
evidence suggests that the pilot has been successful, I might flip the
question round and ask why we would 
<?notus-xml column=128?>not go ahead with a pilot that is successful and that leads to more
people leaving the country voluntarily. If the pilot proves
unsuccessful, we will not roll it out. It will be based on the
evidence. We will analyse the pilot

from the public is that they support a tough approach. I make no
apology for dealing with the concerns of the public. We are not, as was
suggested, talking about a recent phenomenon. We said at the general
election that we would deal with immigration. We have reduced net
migration to the country by a third. We have cracked down on abuse. We
have seen an increase in the number of students and skilled workers
coming here. We want to give the message that we are open for business
for the best and the brightest, but that should be combined with
dealing firmly with people who break our immigration laws and either
come here illegally or overstay their visa. Those things are
compatible, and that is how we wish to

March 2013 the Government published a consultation, “Opening up
UK payments”, which set out the Government’s proposal to
introduce a new, competition-focused, utility-style regulator for
retail payment systems in the UK. This proposal reflected the
Government’s concerns about the market for UK payment systems,
in which strong network effects and vertically integrated ownership
structures give rise to problems in three main areas: competition,
innovation and delivery against end-user needs. The consultation
presented a set of questions identifying the key issues on which the
Government sought views. The consultation closed on 25
June.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100970000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/wmstext/131009m0001.htm#13100970000031">The
Government are publishing their response to the consultation today. The
Government are introducing amendments to the Financial Services
(Banking Reform) Bill to establish the new payment systems regulator as
a separate body under the FCA. The payment systems regulator will have
objectives to promote competition, innovation and the interests of
end-users. The regulator will be able to oversee any payment system
operating in the UK that is brought into scope by being designated by
HM Treasury. Once a payment system is designated, the payment systems
regulator will have a range of powers over its
participants—operators, infrastructure providers and payment
service providers that provide payment services using the
system—in order to advance its objectives.</hs_Para>

regarding rules for the operation of designated systems, and to give
directions to participants in such systems. It will also have specific
powers to require direct and indirect access to designated systems, and
to vary agreements relating to such systems, including fees, charges
and terms and conditions. The payment systems regulator will also have
enforcement powers to publish details of compliance failure, to impose
financial penalties in respect of a compliance failure, and to require
owners of payment systems to dispose of their interests in them,
subject to HM Treasury approval. The regulator will also have
concurrent Competition Act powers to enforce the Competition Act 1998
prohibitions against anti-competitive agreements and abuse of
dominance, and to make market investigation references to the

I am announcing to the House that the six-week period of the Somerset
TB control pilot cull was completed on 6 October. Current indications
suggest that the pilot has been safe, humane and effective in
delivering a reduction in the badger population of just under 60%. We
set ourselves a challenging target of aiming to ensure that 70% of the
badger population was removed during the pilot. The chief veterinary
officer (CVO) has advised that the 60% reduction this year will deliver
clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull. However, Natural
England are considering an application from Somerset for a short
extension of the culling period, as provided for under the agreement
with the company. The advice of the CVO is that further increasing the
number of badgers culled would improve those benefits even further and
enable them to accrue
earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100970000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/wmstext/131009m0001.htm#13100970000036">The

rural broadband projects do not explicitly identify contingency. Bid
costs for individual projects under the broadband delivery framework
agreement must be consistent with the reference costs that were agreed
with the supplier when the framework agreement was put in place. In
addition, the supplier must provide full transparency of costs during
implementation and will only be paid on the basis of actual costs.
Suppliers will not be able to claim for any un-spent contingency. Any
contingency which the supplier included in their bids and which is not
required to achieve the contracted targets will therefore be available

constituencies, local authorities and regions is invested on the basis
of applications for funding and the figures do not reflect the large
amount of funding channelled through our key partners, such as National
Governing Bodies of Sport, to increase the number of people playing
sport and support talented people fulfil their potential. Funding for
National Governing Bodies is reflected in the national figures as all
of Sport England's awards are to English beneficiaries and for activity
within England. Funding for the previous Physical Education and Sport
Strategy for Young People (PESSYP) 2008-11 and the current School Games
programme cannot be disaggregated by

on welfare during transport (Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005) stipulates
what member states shall check when approving journey logs. Among other
things, Article 14 requires that the journey log is realistic and
indicates compliance with the terms of the

other legislation, including that relating to the rules on road
transport.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13100959000069" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0008.htm#13100959000069">Meat:

to recommendations made in Dr Martin Read's independent report entitled

(QDS) returns of all 17 Departments participating in the QDS process
were delayed owing to the development of the Cabinet Office’s
Government Interrogating Spending Tool (GIST). The GIST was developed
in response to recommendations made in Dr Martin
Read’s independent report entitled “Practical Steps to
Improve Management Information in Government”. The GIST is an
online tool that allows the public to access a breakdown of Government
expenditure through the gov.uk website. It makes the process of
accessing and analysing complex QDS and OSCAR data easier and quicker,
and for these reasons was seen to justify a short delay in publishing
QDS data. The GIST can be found at the following web

Willetts:</Member></B> The Horizon 2020 programme reflects key UK
objectives, which were established after extensive consultation with
stakeholders in academia and business as well as independent
evaluations of previous programmes. Key features include: a focus on
supporting world-leading research and innovation, notably via the
European Research Council; mobility of researchers through training
schemes; funding along the innovation spectrum to help address major
societal challenges; public-private partnerships in key sectors; and
dedicated support to small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition,
all participants should benefit from simplified administrative
arrangements. The Government believes that the UK is well placed to
play a leading role in Horizon 2020 and we will monitor implementation
carefully.</hs_Para>

in response to recommendations made in Dr Martin Read's
independent report entitled ‘Practical Steps to Improve
Management Information in Government’. The GIST is an online
tool that allows the public to access a breakdown of Government
expenditure through the Gov.UK website. It makes the process of
accessing and analysing complex QDS and OSCAR data easier and quicker,

The figures given in the tables on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences, it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are
used.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">Justice

In relation to an individual who is convicted of a stalking offence and
receives a sentence for that or other offences which make him subject
to statutory supervision, the offender supervisor (in prison) or
offender manager (in the community) may refer the offender for a
specialist mental health assessment. Such a referral is not automatic
and will be made only following careful consideration of all relevant
circumstances. Where a specialist mental health assessment is obtained,
the offender supervisor or offender manager should review and, as
necessary, revise the offender’s risk assessment, using the
offender assessment system (OASys). From the OASys assessment, the
offender supervisor and/or offender manager will develop a sentence
plan, setting out interventions to address known risks, as well as a
risk management plan, to manage those risks. In the case of an offender
convicted of stalking, the sentence plan and risk management plan
should contain relevant actions to address that
conviction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310101002699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131009/text/131009w0002.htm#1310101002699">Where
