ticking boxes on minimum staffing levels does not equate to good care.
It can sometimes lead to a drive to the bottom, rather than to
addressing the needs of the patients whom the front-line staff are

the Francis report the Berwick review considered that issue in detail
and highlighted the fact that safe staffing levels are not about
ticking a box for minimum staffing, but about developing tools that
recognise the individual needs of patients on the ward. The previous
Government went down the route of tick-boxes in health care. I worked
on the front line during that time and that route did not deliver
high-quality care. We need the right tools to support front-line staff

responsibility to be transparent about care should apply equally in the

more levers, because we are purchasing care and we can impose more

descendants of deceased adopted people continue to face significant
difficulty when they attempt to access information about their
biological, rather than adopted, family. For example, the child of a
deceased adopted adult often finds it impossible to trace any
information about their biological grandparents. That difficulty is
heightened when the adopted individual has made no efforts to trace
their biological parents before they die. Information about the
biological relatives of deceased adopted people can be fundamentally
important, especially in relation to medical
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102262000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm#13102262000006">If
an adopted person dies suddenly, their direct descendants often need to
inquire into the condition from which they have suffered to discover if
what they died from is hereditary. For example, familial breast cancer
typically occurs in people with an unusually high number of family
members who have been affected by breast, ovarian or a similar cancer.
Those who have a family history of breast cancer often need different
medical management from those without such a history because of the
clear differences in the potential for developing such
cancers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102262000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm#13102262000007">While
it is important that everyone is able actively to look after their own
health, the descendants of deceased adopted people are prevented by
procedural barriers from doing so. For all they know, a hereditary
condition is sitting within them like a ticking time-bomb, and the
current legislation prevents them from attempting to defuse it.
Particularly in an era when we ask everyone to take more care of their
own health and inject some personal responsibility into their
well-being, it is crucial that the descendants of deceased adopted
people are granted access to the medical information required to
undertake preventive
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102262000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm#13102262000008">The
solution to such a quandary is relatively simple but, as I have learnt
in the few years I have been in this place, the simple solutions often
appear to be the most difficult to implement. [<SmallCaps>Hon.
Members:</SmallCaps> “Hear, hear.”] I welcome the
House’s enthusiasm. If we simply insert the term “their
direct descendants” into specific clauses of the Adoption and
Children Act 2002, the direct descendants of deceased adopted people
will be granted access to information to which, I believe, they are
rightfully entitled. Such an amendment has the support of the
descendants of deceased adopted persons group and the British
Association for Adoption and Fostering. Some people have expressed
concern that that will lead to a rush of claims, but there is no
evidence to show that the proposed measures will open the floodgates to
unmanageable numbers of descendants of deceased adopted people wishing
to access information through intermediary services.</hs_Para>

must be noted that in 2010 the Law Commission looked at introducing
such an amendment via the other place, and there is still the potential
for such an alteration to be made in that way. However, given the
limits on Government time, of which we in this House are all too
plainly aware, such potentially wide scoping currently remains
unlikely. Therefore, a small amendment could be made which grants the
direct descendants of deceased adopted people access to medical
records. I hope the Bill will proceed through the House with the

objective remains to reduce annual net migration to the tens of
thousands by the end of the Parliament, and we must also reform the
immigration system that manages the flow of migrants in and out of the
UK. When I addressed the House in March this year, I explained that the
immigration system that we had inherited from the last Government was
chaotic and dysfunctional. Having created a separate entity in the UK
Border Force<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T12:44:20"></hs_TimeCode> to
get a grip on border checks, we were left with a UK Border Agency that
still lacked transparency and accountability, and to tackle that I
split the UK Border Agency into two distinct operational commands
inside the Home Office—UK visas and immigration and immigration
enforcement. I made it clear that while organisational reform was
necessary to transform the way in which we dealt with immigration, it
would not on its own be enough to achieve that goal. We also needed to
update the IT infrastructure and to change the complicated legal and
policy framework that so often worked against us. The Bill changes some
of that legal and policy framework so that it will be possible for the
immigration system to operate fairly and
effectively<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T12:45:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102262000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm#13102262000027"><Member ContinuationText="Simon Hughes" PimsId="1067" UID="13102262000232" xid="296" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm#13102262000232"><B>Simon

cut abuse of the appeal process. It will streamline the labyrinthine
legal process, which at present allows appeals against 17 different

their deportation or removal. By limiting the grounds for appeal to

take precedence over public interest in immigration control and when
deporting foreign criminals. The Bill will make the view of Parliament

live and work in the UK illegally and take advantage of our public

1 of the Bill is about removals. The current process for enforcing the

many stages before an individual can be removed. With

opportunities to bring challenges throughout the process. That
increases the risk of further delays before removal takes place. We

inform the individual that they cannot stay in the UK, and enable
immigration enforcement to remove them if they do not leave

then use it as an opportunity to disappear. Bail might be appropriate
in some circumstances, but can it be appropriate to grant bail when a

to ensure that the person who has travelled to the UK is the rightful
holder of the visa, but there are gaps in our powers to take
fingerprints, and the Bill closes them. When the police encounter a
suspect, they have the power to check fingerprints, but when an
immigration officer encounters a suspected illegal migrant, they may
check fingerprints only where consent is given unless they arrest them.
Not surprisingly, not everyone consents. Officers need powers
equivalent to those of the police so that when they find an illegal
migrant they can check their fingerprints to confirm their suspicion
and start enforcement

2 is about appeals. The appeals system is complex and costly. Seventeen
different immigration decisions attract rights of appeal, and when a
case finally comes to a close some applicants put in fresh applications
and start all over again. That is not fair to the public, who expect
swift enforcement of immigration decisions. The Bill sorts out the
mess. In future, the 17 rights of appeal will be reduced to four.
Foreign criminals will not be able to prevent deportation simply by
dragging out the appeals process, as many such appeals will be heard
only once the criminal is back in their home country. It cannot be

opportunity to challenge a decision where fundamental rights are
concerned. The public are fed up with cases where foreign criminals are
allowed to stay because of an overly generous interpretation by the

Long experience tells me that the tribunals do not accept information
that has come in after the original application was made; it would
sometimes be better if they did. We are all interested in streamlining
the system. However, given the very high number of decisions on appeal
that overturn the original decisions by the Home Office or the
immigration officials abroad, what guarantee can she offer that the
quality of the reviews that will now be undertaken by Home Office
officials as an alternative to appeals will be subject to proper
supervision? In my experience, when we had those reviews before we
often got poor-quality decision making and people within the Department
saying, “Oh well, if so and so has already said no, I’m
going to say no too.” If that happens we end up with more
judicial
reviews<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T13:06:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102262000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm#13102262000076"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs May" PimsId="1758" UID="13102262000272" xid="420" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0001.htm#13102262000272">Mrs

need a British bank account to take cash out of a cash machine or to
earn some cash on the side. What difference will the measures make to
the growing number of people who are here illegally because they are
less likely to be stopped at the border and less likely to be sent back
home? Deportations are down by 7%. The number of people stopped at the
border and turned away has halved since the election. The number of
illegal immigrants absconding through Heathrow has trebled, and the

the first place? Student visitor visas have now become too easy a route
through which people come to Britain to work illegally. They do not
even have to provide proper paperwork to show they have a place on a

alarm bells for Ministers. The Labour party will table amendments to
have proper checks on student visitor visas, stronger inspections and
enforcement, and stronger action against employers who take on and
exploit illegal migrants. If the Home Secretary is serious about

end modern-day slavery. Last week a dreadful case of modern slavery and
trafficking ended with the conviction of a couple from Eccles who had
brought a deaf 10-year-old orphan girl into the country, using the
passport of a 20-year-old woman. They kept her as a domestic slave and
subjected her to sexual assault. Is it not tragic that someone who is
rescued, such as the victim in this case, and actually well looked
after, might have been snatched back into trafficking, and ended up in
a brothel or worse? The Government have not enacted measures to assign
a trusted individual in such cases, although they could have done so in

them?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102262000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102262000186"><B><Member ContinuationText="Yvette Cooper" PimsId="2709" UID="13102262000348" xid="132" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102262000348">Yvette

to some of the remaining elements of the Bill. People who come to
Britain and then abuse British law should not expect to stay here, and

involving foreign criminals. We also believe that appeals should be

far too long.</hs_Para>

in the Bill do not deal with those issues, however, and instead it
appears that the Government want to abolish appeals for whole
categories of immigration cases because they cannot cope with the fact
that they get so many decisions wrong in the first place. There are
genuine and serious concerns about that approach because it turned out
that the Government got it wrong in 50% of entry clearance cases that
went to appeal. In managed migration cases that went to appeal, they
got it wrong in 49% of decisions. In the majority of those cases the
problem was Home Office error, so why not just put a bit of effort into
getting the decision right in the first place? If those appeal rights
are removed, many cases will cite human rights grounds to get an appeal
and more cases will go to judicial review. The Government’s own
impact assessment shows that that could cost £100
million, halving any savings the Home Secretary might hope to
make.</hs_Para>

in the Bill is that is says nothing about the exploitation of
immigration in the workplace. There is nothing to deal with employers
who take on illegal migrant workers or to tackle the exploitation of
legal migration by the undercutting of wages and conditions in the
local labour market. There is nothing to deal with the lack of
enforcement of the minimum wage, or employers who use loopholes in the
minimum wage to overcharge workers for overcrowded accommodation and
offset that against their pay. There is nothing to deal with agencies
that recruit only from overseas and exclude local workers from their

nationalities.</hs_Para>

who are exploited, bad for local workers who are undercut, bad for
other businesses that are undermined and bad for our economy, which
continues to depend on low-skilled migration being exploited in that
way. The Government are doing nothing. The Labour party will set out
amendments to give councils powers of enforcement on the minimum wage,
close loopholes and tackle irresponsible agencies, and I hope the

There are concerns about private sector landlords, but if someone is

good, solid logical reason for having the full documentation. After
all, they want to collect the rent. Many residential landlords already
take passport and other such details. The Bill is a perfectly

congratulate her on doing so. As the shadow Home Secretary and others
have said, those vans caused enormous concern in the communities. We do
not have a figure for how many people got into the vans and asked for a
lift back to the airport, but the vans cost £10,000 and were out
for six days in inner-city London. As yet, we do not know how many
people have gone back. When the pilot is over, we will need those
figures. Meanwhile, I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Perth and
North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) for his superb Adjournment debate. It
gives us all heart to know that we can call for an Adjournment debate

the country as a result of the £2.8 million contract

to my second bit of praise for the Home Secretary at the end of my
speech, but I first wish to highlight a couple of issues that cause me
concern. The first is the issue of landlords checking people’s
passports, which will cause huge problems. The shadow Home Secretary
said that people might have to look at 400 different
European identity cards and documents. I am concerned that ordinary
landlords who are not trained in immigration policy will simply not
know the difference between leave to remain, indefinite leave and other
Home Office statuses placed on non-British passports. Most landlords,
when 
<?notus-xml column=181?>they grant tenancies, already ask for copies of people’s
passports. The risk is that the only people who will be able to get
accommodation are those with British passports. That means that a lot
of people with a perfect right to remain here will not be able to get
accommodation because landlords are too scared or do not understand the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000009">I

machine. It was about 10 years old and not the most sophisticated piece
of equipment, but they told me, “We use this to find out whether
a document is a forgery.” We cannot expect landlords to have
such machines—they would not be able to afford them—but
if we do not train them or have regular inspections, which we could not
afford, it is difficult to know how the provisions will work in
practice. In theory, it is a brilliant idea, but it is totally
unworkable in

second concern is the removal of rights of appeal. This is a crazy
idea. The one way in which people can be sure of whether they can stay
in the country or have to go is through the appeals process, whereby
someone with the authority of a judge looks at the case. There is
nothing wrong with the appeals process. I know that the Minister for
Immigration recently said that immigration lawyers get too much money
and that one of the purposes of the Bill is to cut their income. I
declare an interest, as my wife is an immigration lawyer, although she
does no legal aid work. If the decision making is right in the
beginning, cases would not have to go to appeal.</hs_Para>

for Immigration is prepared to listen to points made by Members of
Parliament. Whenever we have put points to him, he has listened
carefully, and I think that he should listen seriously to the idea of
creating a hub in London. He has talked about the need for
administrative reviews. The problem with those reviews is that
unqualified people have to look at legal issues. I am not sure whether
the same immigration officials who said no at the first stage are the
right people to say no at the second stage, but that is what happens
with the entry clearance operation. If someone is knocked back on a
visa, but has a right of appeal, they go to the same post and talk to
the senior immigration officer who has to make the decision. It would
be a much better idea—and I am sorry that the Labour Government
did not do it—to create a hub in the UK for cases that have been
knocked back. People could go to a senior official at the hub and put
arguments for people to come into the UK.</hs_Para>

years as an MP, I get frustrated when people come to my surgeries on
Friday evenings and say, “We want to stay longer.” I feel
they have no right to stay, but I am not an immigration officer and do
not know the history of their case. Multiple appeals do not help, but
the solution is a quick and robust decision. We must tell people, in a
timely way, whether they have a right to remain in this country, and if
they do not, they ought to leave. That is when the enforcement process
should begin and end, not 10 years after someone makes an asylum
application, when they have established a family. It is very difficult
to tell people to go back, when faced with a loving family and children

when he comes, we will want real, practical dates for the introduction
of the e-Borders programme. As I have said, the Minister listens to the

It is an absolute disgrace that anyone should sign a contract for an
e-Borders programme worth £750 million and not tell the company
what they expect and when they expect it. That is why we have an
arbitration process that has been going on for two and a half years and

When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T14:12:58"></hs_TimeCode> we leave at
Heathrow airport, they look at our boarding cards, but they do not
check 
<?notus-xml column=183?>our passports. It would be easy to introduce these checks now, and it
would be a big win for the Government —much better than ad vans.
They could place immigration officers at departure gates—it
would not create any queues—to check people’s passports
as well as boarding cards. That way, they would know who was going in
and out. It is not as brilliant as an e-Borders programme, but it would
be the first stage of knowing who has left the country. I hope the
Minister will give special attention to that point.</hs_Para>

on the administration of the Home Office, I give full credit to the
Home Secretary for abolishing the UK Border Agency, but it will only
have been worth abolishing if we get something better. Over the past
few weeks, I have been trying to get answers from senior Home Office
officials to simple Select Committee questions about the number of
people with the right to remain in the country and the number of people
who have applied for further leave to remain. In the end, I got the
answers half an hour ago, after I said that I would come to the Chamber
and name the officials who had not replied to my letter. I do not want,
as the Chairman of a Select Committee, to have to do that, but when
people write to Ministers and officials, they need a reply. That goes
not only for Select Committee members, but for members of the public;
members of the public want timely replies.</hs_Para>

improve the administration of the Home Office on immigration and visas

closed, secretive and defensive. If at the end of the year we are
having exactly the same problems with the same officials in the same
jobs, answerable to the same line managers, which is what they were
told would be the case, we will be disappointed. At the moment, their
administrative changes have a fair wind, but we will want to see a real
difference in how immigration policy is not just agreed by the House,
but implemented after it becomes

Teather</B> (Brent Central) (LD):</Member> Last month, one of my
constituents—I will call him Philippe—attended an
asylum-screening appointment at Lunar house. He had a history of
serious ill treatment in Cameroon and had in his hand a referral to
Freedom from Torture from his very worried advocates, so one would have
expected him to be treated with care and attention when he arrived for
his screening appointment. It is worth reading the whole of his
statement—it took me some time to do so—to understand
what happened to him over three days in September. It gives a picture
of what happens to people when they try to navigate Home Office
bureaucracy. I want to tell hon. Members a little about what happened
to him, because there is a danger that this debate will be about
headlines and statistics, but will forget the very people we are being
tough on—the very people who are the subjects of the
Bill.</hs_Para>

all that my constituent said, one gets a sense of his fear and
nervousness when he first arrived at Lunar house with all his documents
in his hand, and then the abject rudeness with which he was treated,
the dismissals, the disbelief and the downright incompetence; and the
petty squabbles between contractors unwilling to go beyond the letter
of their own instruction and offer basic, normal human compassion and
basic, normal 
<?notus-xml column=184?>information to my constituent. Hon. Members need
to read it all to understand his fear, confusion and
bewilderment, to follow him from the first moment, when he arrived,
with nervous trust, for his asylum-screening appointment, to the moment
when, in vain and with frustration, he tried to make the official at
Lunar house appreciate that he was there for an agreed appointment and
to get her to read his referral to Freedom from Torture. In vain, he
tried to make his point through the interpreter about where his
belongings were, but
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T14:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>stead he was
arrested, handcuffed and taken to
Harmondsworth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T14:17:00"></hs_TimeCode>.

when Philippe arrived at Harmondsworth, rather late at
night, somebody realised he should not have been there; somebody
eventually checked his documentation and realised that he had
originally turned up for a routine asylum-screening appointment, and he
was taken back. Eventually, after petty squabbles, which he witnessed,
he was dumped in a hostel without any documentation, without being told
where he was and without being given an address. There followed a
distressing 48 hours, during which he had a paranoid episode and ended
up lost on the streets of south London. He had one contact, one human
being, who went out of their way to help him. Someone from a church in
Brent who had been working with him drove around the streets of south
London to find him and then took him into her own home and reconnected
him with his lawyer—the best and worst of humanity across three
days<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T14:18:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Teather:</Member></B> No, I do not accept that. This happens because of
the culture of disbelief in the Home Office, and it is that culture
that needs to change, yet I see nothing in the Bill that will have any
impact on the quality of decision making or on how individual officials
treat constituents such as mine when they go with their asylum or visa
applications. In my 10 years as an MP, I have seen countless examples
of this behaviour, as all Members will have done. Those of us with the
highest levels of immigration casework will have seen more, but it is a
source of huge frustration for many MPs that our advice surgeries are
spent mostly dealing with stuff that the Home Office should be dealing
with.</hs_Para>

Teather:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes an excellent point. These are
the sort of people I worry will fall foul of the Bill because they
struggle to provide their 
<?notus-xml column=185?>documentation. We know that there are a lot of people who fall through
the net when they are first given refugee status and end up destitute.
They make up the bulk of the people whom the British Red Cross deals
with in terms of food parcels because they cannot prove their
entitlement to benefits. A significant number of people have the right
to stay but will struggle to be able to prove
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000028">Personally,
I have never seen an organisation more in need of checks and balances
on its own use of power than the Home Office or, indeed, its
predecessor, the Border Agency. Instead, the Bill gives powers that it
is not equipped, nor frankly able, to meet and powers that it cannot be
relied upon to exercise properly. Where it exceeds or abuses its power,
or simply fails to do the job, it will be shielded from challenge in
many cases and there will be no redress whatever. The implications of
the Bill cannot be understood without also placing it in the wider
context of legal aid changes and proposals to restrict judicial
review.</hs_Para>

is that the impact on individual lives gets lost in the grandstanding
of headlines. When immigration is all about reducing numbers on a
spreadsheet to meet an arbitrary cap or creating arbitrary political
dividing lines and traps for opponents to fall into, the subjects of
the legislation—the human beings at the centre of it—are
somehow invisible. I am weary of a politics that creates and
defines enemies in order to demonstrate potency but, frankly, it angers
me to see politics do that at the expense of those who have the least
power to change their own futures. All three Front Benches, I am
afraid, are at it, including my own, scrabbling over the mantle of
toughness, chasing opinion polls and, in some cases, wilfully whipping
up fear and loathing in the process. It is staggeringly careless with
lives and with community relationships that have been built up over a
long time.</hs_Para>

that whatever the damage that is done by the detail of the Bill when, I
dare say, it is ultimately passed, some of the worst damage has been
done in our debate in the lead-up to it. The language with which this
was brought forward is what really causes the damage in terms of
community relations. I remind hon. Members of the debate we had earlier
about the Home Office vans. That is a case in point; it had almost no
effect on the ground except to whip up real tension between
communities. My constituency was one of those areas that was targeted
by the
vans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000031"><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Anne Main" PimsId="4829" UID="13102272000475" xid="890" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000475"><B>Mrs

involves the prevention of exploitation of vulnerable people who are
brought in illegally, treated badly and fall outside the system? If
their pimps and traffickers are unable to do that because we have
tougher immigration laws, we will free those people from being put in
that awful position. I had a young lady brought to me whose passport
had been taken off her. If people can come to our country legally, it

Teather:</Member></B> I am certain that the commitment of the hon. Lady
on the issue of human trafficking is very real. However, there is
nothing in this Bill that will make that situation any better for the
individuals who are caught up in it. It is worth remembering that, for
a lot of vulnerable people who come here, it is very difficult to enter
the country legally. Many of the legal routes have been closed down.
Someone coming here and applying for asylum may have entered the
country illegally and then claimed asylum. Understanding that is
important, as is understanding some of the detail. I am in danger of
speaking for too long and I know that other hon. Members want to speak,
but we must understand that those who get caught up in this may be some
of the most vulnerable
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000034">There
is a great deal in the Bill that will have catastrophic consequences on
the ground. In most cases, the problem that it seeks to fix has been
poorly defined and the solutions ill thought through. All of it is
incredibly rushed, a point made by a number of hon. Members. A number
of my hon. Friends have also made the point about there being no
pre-legislative scrutiny. It seems to me that the detail has been
negotiated by an exceptionally tight group of people within the
Government, and very little time is being afforded to this House to
consider it. One day on Report is extraordinary. The very small period
of time between the Bill being published and Second Reading means that
most of the briefings from relevant organisations came in yesterday
afternoon as they have just begun to grapple with the detail of this
Bill. There is a significant amount of detail and the devil will be in
making sure that the detail is correct.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102272000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000035">It is worth
noting some of the increases in power that the Bill gives. There is an
extension of removal powers and the application to family
members—including British citizens, I should add, who are not
excluded from the Bill. Those matters will be in secondary legislation
and we have no way of properly scrutinising the extension of powers.
There is a significant extension of immigration officers’ powers
to use reasonable force, despite the fact that whether the Border
Agency previously used reasonable force has been a matter of constant
dispute. It is completely within the culture of the Home Office, it
seems, always to assume that force is the only way to manage
any situation, which was precisely the culture within
Government when I was negotiating the details around the ending of
child detention. We sought to try to change that so we did not always
go to the maximum end of force in enforcement procedures to get a
family to understand that they had exhausted the appeals process. I
cannot see how an organisation so psychologically addicted to the use
of such powers should properly be given more powers until it has learnt
how to use the powers it already has well, and certainly until it has
learnt from the work that has been done elsewhere within its vast
structure to try to change the
culture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000036">Staggering,
too, are the proposals on bail for immigration detainees, which would
effectively allow the Home Secretary repeatedly to issue removal
directions in order to prevent an application for bail. No account
would need to be taken of changes in circumstance, or of the health of
the detainee or their family. There was an earlier intervention about
criminal bail. I want to make the point that some of the detail of that
intervention was not fair because, within criminal procedures, one
automatically eventually 
<?notus-xml column=187?>comes up for bail, whereas within immigration detention there is no
automatic right to have one’s bail application
considered.</hs_Para>

more people than any other European country except Greece, and Greece
only detains people for very short periods. We effectively operate
indefinite detention. The UNHCR has made clear its profound concerns
about UK policy on detention and made it clear that bail
hearings ought to be automatic. The removal of appeal rights was spoken
about by the Chair of the Select Committee, the right hon. Member for
Leicester East (Keith Vaz). That effectively removes appeal rights for
all areas of managed migration, an area that has traditionally had very
high rates of success on appeal. Given the appalling nature of decision
making in this area, it seems to be particularly absurd to remove
appeal rights. It is also likely to result only in more claims under
judicial review or under article 8, which the Government say they want
to try to reduce. It seems utterly
nonsensical.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000038">It
was perhaps the redefinition of article 8 that made me shudder
particularly. It completely ignores the test around the best interests
of children and ignores all case law in this area. No doubt this is a
deliberate attempt to overrule case law, but certainly it flies in the
face of our obligations under the United Nations convention on the
rights of the child. It ignores children under the age of
seven—those children who have been here for fewer than seven
years—and will of course apply not just to adults in terms of
their right to family life with any of their children, but to
unaccompanied migrants in decisions on their immigration cases. I find
it very difficult to see how the courts are going to interpret this,
but certainly it will have a chilling impact on the Home
Office’s own decision making in this area. I am rather
frustrated that the careful work we did on the ending of child
detention, on the culture within the Home Office and on how we treat
families seems to have been completely cut across by this very
political statement in the Bill. It also cuts across the Children and
Families Bill, which is still making its way through the Lords as we
speak.</hs_Para>

most absurd proposal in the Bill is that on landlords’ checks. I
have listened to some of the discussion on that and there is some
naivety about the property market in London in terms of understanding
what it means to try to rent a property and the difficulty of getting
in there first. If there is any doubt whatever about someone’s
immigration status, there is no way they can rent in my constituency.
Many people find it difficult to prove their documentation. The claim
that this will all work well because a similar system involving
employers has worked well flies in the face of our experience of the
employers’ checking line, which often gives out inaccurate
information resulting in people being unable to get or keep a job. It
is extraordinary to propose a similar system that could affect
someone’s right to live somewhere.</hs_Para>

quite have achieved the definition of “refugee” under the
terms of the Geneva convention, yet cannot be returned to their own
country because it is not safe to do so. I would count people from
Syria among those affected in

have campaigned for more than 30 years against injustice in our
immigration laws. Indeed, one of the reasons that I stood for election
in Slough rather than anywhere else was that I wanted to follow the
tradition of Slough Labour MPs who had voted against the Commonwealth
Immigrants Act 1968. That legislation had the effect of making whole
groups of people stateless, and I was proud that that injustice was
remedied in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.</hs_Para>

recognise that we can achieve change and get justice even when the
debate on immigration is as toxic as it is at the moment. I also
recognise that people feel deep anxiety about immigration, particularly
in an era of austerity when they are feeling insecure about their jobs,
their pensions and about their families’ futures. However, this
Bill is operating the worst form of dog-whistle politics in blaming
migrants for problems that are not of their construction. I know how
much migrants bring to Britain. Slough, a migrant town, is the third
most productive wealth-producing town in Britain outside
London.</hs_Para>

introducing the Bill, the Home Secretary told us stories about cases of
repeat applications by criminals and abuses of the appeals system. I
suppose this is why the Home Office loses cases so frequently! We are
not talking about a load of radical Trotskyist judges; we are talking
about judges who decide that the Home Office is wrong almost half the
time. The Home Office is now 
<?notus-xml column=189?>saying that the judges will not make those decisions in future, and that
it will resolve those matters through administrative appeals.</hs_Para>

me tell the House about the administrative reviews that already exist
in parts of the system. A judicial review in the upper tribunal
involved a case in which an applicant had given the Home Office their
credit card number, and—guess what—the Home Office had
typed it out wrongly. The consequence was that the application was not
treated as a proper application because it was not accompanied by the
full fee. The case had to go as far as the upper tribunal before a
judge decided that it was a proper application, and that the Home
Office had written down the credit card number wrongly.</hs_Para>

cases are not rare. I have a constituent whose husband wrote the cheque
to accompany her application, but instead of putting £865, he
put 865p, because he is a twit. The consequence is that her application
is now out of time, and she has no appeal. Another case involved a
response from an entry clearance officer who, having stated that the
immigration rules require a spouse to have good spoken English and to
have passed a speaking and listening test, said that the applicant had
passed that test but failed the English writing test and was therefore
refused entry. We have asked for reviews of all those cases,
but—guess what—we have been told that there will be no
review or that the review has upheld the original decision.</hs_Para>

of us who deal regularly with the Home Office know that it is incapable
of doing what it is supposed to do now. Yet through the Bill, it is
grabbing a whole lot of work for itself from the appeals system. The
result is that it will break. It might have got rid of the
UK Border Agency, but the Home Office will break if it tries
to do all those things.</hs_Para>

need to heed the words of the Wilson committee report. On decisions as
serious as whether someone should be allowed to live with their
husband, everyone should have the right to have that decision subjected
to an independent review. That is why we need an appeals system. There
are groups of people who currently have no right of appeal, but the
Home Office admits that it cannot do anything about them. There is a
large Zimbabwean community in my constituency, but the Home Office is
not returning any of its members to Zimbabwe because of the
situation there. They are hard-working people who are desperate to
work, yet they are in limbo. In passing responsibility for immigration
control from those previously responsible to other bodies such as
landlords and the health service, the Home Office is putting those
people at greater risk. They are already at horrible risk. I have
spoken to constituents who turn to illegal activities or to
prostitution in order to feed their children, because they are not
allowed to work.</hs_Para>

Government say that it will be easy for landlords to check out the
status of applicants, but any of us who deal with employers know that
the current Home Office advice service for employers is gummed up: they
can never get through on the phone and the process takes ages. Many of
my constituents who are allowed to work here perfectly legally have
been unable to prove it because of Home Office inefficiency, and
therefore lose their jobs. A similar advice service is now going to be
offered 
<?notus-xml column=190?>to landlords. It might be fine in an area where
landlords have to try hard to find tenants, but that is not the way
competition works in the south of England; it is all the other way.
Large numbers of people will therefore be refused housing to which they
should be entitled.</hs_Para>

health, the Bill also suggests that there should be a prior payment.
People should pay, if they are here temporarily, for health
care—there is no problem with that—but the choice
optioned in this Bill is the wrong choice. There is a reason why the
consultation, the details of which I have been asking for for more than

countries have a requirement that migrants should, for example, have an

others.</hs_Para>

Bill shows the arrogance of the Home Office by refusing to have its
decisions appealed. It shows that the Home Office, in an island nation
where it is possible to have effective border controls, does not care
about the racially divisive consequences of increased internal
immigration control. It shows that the Home Office has ignored its lack
of capacity for doing this and, shockingly, includes proposals that
were not prefigured in the consultation and that will bear down on
victims of human trafficking.</hs_Para>

consultation on health payment contained a specific commitment about
victims of human trafficking. Until now, overseas domestic workers have
not been charged for health care. There is a reason for
that—they are vulnerable and exploited. Frankly, the National
Crime Agency is not making a priority of tracking down that particular
form of human trafficking. We know how hard it is for those people.
There are shocking stories of people with chronic, often infectious
diseases who are prevented from getting access to health care by their
exploiting employers. Under these proposals, they will be more
vulnerable than they were before.</hs_Para>

shall not be agreeing with her. It was also a great pleasure to hear
from my hon. Friend the Member for Poole (Mr Syms), who is no longer in
his seat. I agree with him about the reasons to support the Bill. He
spoke of the impact immigration has on the streets and it is true that
this is a matter of great concern. The immigration rules have been

do, particularly on landlords.</hs_Para>

with the report by the Migration Observatory in Oxford entitled,
“Migrants and Housing in the UK: Experiences and
Impacts”. It is a very short report that sets out some key
findings, one of which is that the foreign-born population has
significantly lower home ownership rates than the UK-born population.
The detail shows that the foreign-born population is three times as
likely as the UK-born population to be in the private rented sector. If
we drill down further, we can see that recent migrants are more than
twice as likely as the normal foreign-born population to be
renters—76% are more likely to rent. Foreign-born individuals
have lower ownership rates than UK-born individuals and have greater
representation in the private rented sector.</hs_Para>

migrants moved into temporary accommodation upon
arrival…However, after realising that their stay in the UK could

evidence from that statement is clear: if we want to look for new
migrants and potentially illegal immigrants, we need to look at the
private rented sector. It is a key part of trying to ascertain where
they might lie within the system. The evidence so far suggests that
that is what is happening.</hs_Para>

Ealing council recently visiting six properties and the agency found
that 22 out of 39 individual tenants, a large percentage,
were illegal immigrants. Of those 22, 19 were detained. Of those 19,
nine entered the country without leave, eight were overstayers, one was
a failed asylum seeker and one was working in breach of his
visa conditions. In such circumstances, the correct duty should be for
the landlord to check for residence status. There is a long list of
excluded tenancies in the Bill and the Secretary of State has the right
to grant such a right to a person who would otherwise be
disqualified.</hs_Para>

obligation on landlords—the choice of words is crucial—is
to make “reasonable enquiries”. Private landlords are not
expected to be experts in immigration; they are expected to make
reasonable inquiries. They are not supposed to know the details of all
the 400 or so immigrant visas that were mentioned earlier. They are
merely meant to make reasonable inquiries. We are looking to secondary
legislation to include a list of acceptable
documentation.</hs_Para>

contributing to British society given the proven link between migrants

also involve freeing up the housing stock.</hs_Para>

will not conflict with landlords’ contractual arrangements.
Indeed, if we ask the members of the organisations rather than the
representative organisations we find that many members undertake such

that publicity is important, and that we have to let landlords know
what is happening. There is a need to be precise if we are to get the
message out. I received calls from constituents on the matter when it
was first mooted, as they were confused and wanted assurances about
what was right. I was able to give those assurances. The issue of

so, however, I want to make a few general observations about the Bill
as a whole, which is a combination of the good, the bad and the ugly.
Tightening the law on sham marriages, improving our ability to deal
with dodgy immigration advisers, and speeding up the deportation of
foreign criminals are good ideas. Addressing the length of time that it
takes to deal with immigration applications, thereby reducing the
number of years in which people have to live in limbo, literally not
knowing whether they are coming or going, is a 
<?notus-xml column=193?>reasonable aspiration. However, I am not convinced that the right checks
and balances exist in the new decision making and appeal process
outlined in the Bill. It is a complex area. The hon. Member for Brent
Central (Sarah Teather) is right to draw attention to the fact that
briefings on this part of the Bill were issued late in the day. The
Government cannot be confident that the review that they wish to
implement on immigration decisions will be any better or of higher
quality than the initial decision-making process in the Home Office.
There should be an independent review mechanism for appeals on
immigration decisions.</hs_Para>

Bill is undoubtedly ugly is in its unworkable and unrealistic proposals
to outsource the job of immigration officials to letting agency staff
and private landlords up and down the country. Such a change in the law
may or may not contribute to creating the Home Secretary’s
“hostile environment”, but it undoubtedly risks inflaming
racial tensions and smacks of the era in which landlords in the UK put
signs above their doors proclaiming “No blacks, no
Irish”. I for one do not want to return to those
days. I want an immigration system that is firm and fair, and which is
in the best interests of everyone in our country. I want a system in
which the rules are enforced properly and in a timely fashion. No
matter what Ministers say, the immigration arm of the Home
Office—the former UK Border Agency—is a total mess. No
amount of nasty rhetoric turned into sentences on the statute book will
make up for the basic failures in administration, efficiency and
competence that have characterised the Home Office for far
too long.</hs_Para>

wanted to focus on the Government’s proposals for private
landlords. Part 3 introduces a new duty on landlords to check the
immigration status of prospective tenants before properties are let
with hefty fines if flats and houses are rented to people without leave
to remain. There are already tight rules about who can access homes
rented from councils and housing associations. On a superficial level,
I suspect that many people would say, “What’s the problem
with asking private landlords to do that? It sounds like a
good idea.” However, there is a serious problem with the
proposals because of the way in which that would work in
practice.</hs_Para>

Member of Parliament for three years, and in that time I have dealt
with my fair share of immigration cases. When people come to my surgery
with reams of paper from the Home Office I sometimes find it difficult
to ascertain exactly what their status is. It can be complex and
confusing: people do not always fall into neat, defined categories.
Sometimes three people in a family have indefinite leave to remain, but
one, inexplicably, is still waiting to hear from the Home Office.
Sometimes a Home Office decision to refuse an application is overturned
by the tribunal, but then there are inordinate delays in sending
individuals new documentation to confirm their status. Perhaps all
small private landlords and letting agents have an insight or training
in the immigration system, or a special link to the Home Office, which
I do not have, but I think that is unlikely.</hs_Para>

to happen? Let us imagine a busy letting agency in south-east London,

this country as a child, went to school here and now works as a nurse.
She has indefinite leave to remain and she has become a British
citizen. The other person is also a British citizen—a white
woman, a nurse too, but with an English-sounding surname. The admin
person in the letting agency is presented with Home Office papers by
one, but not the other. They know that if they let to an
“illegal immigrant” they might be fined £3,000.
They are confused by the papers. They have a stream of people waiting
to be seen, and they have other things to do. Which of the two people
do they go for? I do not think that I need spell out to hon. Members

hotline like no other. Confusion, procrastination and obfuscation
characterise Home Office hotlines at the moment. Why will this one be
any different? How will landlords and letting agents know who is living
in a house apart from the individual who signed the tenancy agreement?
What happens when someone’s leave to remain expires during their

their properties, but that is not true: these transactions take place
in the shadows of our economy. This policy is unworkable and
unrealistic, and it is deeply unpleasant. Last week in London, the
headlines were of racial discrimination in the letting of
property—people being told that flats and houses were no longer
available because of the colour of their skin. Those headlines made me

the Home Secretary that they are playing a dangerous political game
which I am not prepared to participate in. I believe our immigration

warmly congratulate my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and my hon.
Friend the Minister for Immigration on their relentless focus on what
needs to be done to restore long-overdue order in our immigration
system. Let us not forget why we are here today. Regrettably, the
dysfunctional Labour Government lost control of our borders. Net
foreign immigration on their watch was nearly 4 million, while roughly
1 million British citizens left in that period. This is an
extraordinary scale of immigration, absolutely without parallel in our
history. We now face the massive task of integrating these huge numbers
into our
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:04:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000089">The
Balanced Migration group, which I co-chair with

Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field), is especially concerned about the
impact on our population of continued immigration on anything like this
scale. On current projections, based on net migration of 200,000 a
year, immigration will account for two thirds of our population
growth—not, incidentally, one half, as the 
<?notus-xml column=196?>BBC repeatedly and erroneously tells us. Such immigration would add a
further 5 million people to our population in the next 15 years. This
is completely unacceptable to the British public. According to a recent
opinion poll, two thirds of the public want to see drastic action to
reduce immigration and three quarters of the population want to see it
reduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:05:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000090">The
Government have already had considerable success, for which they have
not been given due credit. Non-EU migration—that part of the
equation which is subject to Government action—has been
substantially reduced from 217,000 in 2010 to 157,000 in 2012. This has
been achieved without constraining access for business to the skilled
migrants that it needs if it and we are to prosper. There are no limits
on the transfer of international staff. The only cap is on work
permits, and only half the 20,700 available work permits have been
taken up. There is much to be done to improve delivery, but the policy
is clearly right. Nor has there been any significant effect on our
universities, which have seen student visa applications increase by 10%
between 2010 and 2012. As I said in an intervention on
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:06:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

is sometimes claimed that the Government are sending out
mixed messages; in one week they are encouraging business and tourism,
in another they are clamping down on immigration. In fact, there is no
contradiction between encouraging legal migration and discouraging
abuse of the system, as is the purpose of this excellent Bill. It is
right that we should seek to encourage tourists, business visitors and
genuine students, while reducing the scale of permanent migration. That
is how we in this country should reap the benefits of a globalised
world, while ensuring that we are not, as a nation, overwhelmed by it.
It is that fear which drives so many people’s anxiety about
immigration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:07:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000092">The
Bill tackles a long-standing weakness in our immigration
system—namely, the relative ease with which those who originally
come quite legitimately can stay on illegally once their visa has
expired. These overstayers frequently work below the minimum wage.
Those who do so undercut the wages of British workers. They also allow
unscrupulous employers to undercut employers who offer decent wages and
conditions. Overstayers also add to the pressure on our public
services, so it is right that they should be firmly but fairly
discouraged from staying on. An important consequence of such illegal
immigration is the added pressure that it generates on our housing,
which already faces a crisis. I therefore welcome the proposal in the
Bill for landlords to carry out checks similar to those now required of
employers, although I recognise that the nuts and bolts may need some
examination. I note the points that

Each of us in this place is properly reflecting the views of our

penal, I hope that hon. Members who do not share the same constituency
issues and problems might take note of some of the speeches that have

want to focus on the heart of the Bill, which is that the Home Office
argues that the immigration appeals framework is flawed. To whom will
it give the work? An internal Home Office review estimated that
approximately 60% of the volume of allowed appeals are due to casework
errors. The Home Office believes that the appeals framework is flawed,
but part of the problem with that framework is the poor quality of its
initial decisions, which then clog up the appeals process. How can the
Home Office believe that an administrative review process will properly
go to the heart of the problem? It will not.</hs_Para>

the Bill stands, refused applicants will be required to apply for
administrative review with 10 days of receiving the decision. All of us
who have extensive correspondence with the Home Office know that most
of the decisions come back to lawyers. So lawyers will be required to
make that administrative review application within 10 days, but the
Home Office must know full well that that simply will not happen. It is
not happening at the moment. Many of our constituents do not receive
notification from their lawyers until several weeks after even a
positive response has been received from the Home Office. The very idea
that such a review could be made within 10 days is quite simply
incredible. Those officials who have told, written to and persuaded
Ministers that this can be done know only too well that that is
false<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:15:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000102">Under
clause 11, where there is right of appeal to the first tier tribunal,
refusal decisions made on erroneous grounds or without reference to
highly relevant information simply cannot be challenged. The option to
raise challenges to unlawful decision making before the High Court in
judicial review proceedings will remain, but that means that the time
of the High Court judges will be used in pointing out basic errors in
Home Office decision making. The Home Office states that the
immigration appeals framework is overtly complex, slow and expensive,
but reducing the number of appeals will cause the number of
applications for judicial review to soar. That will be more expensive,
slower and less effective, but it will be the only lawful option left
for many cases. The High Court is likely to become the first port of
call for those opposing deportation decisions. Again, immigration
officials in the Home Office know that. They know that they are taking
a bottleneck from one part of the system and putting it in another part
where it will be more costly to the public

we cannot see things going
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T15:18:04"></hs_TimeCode>. On the
same principle, if we take off the monitoring, the Home Office will not
improve its processes. The light that judges can currently shine on
what is going on in the Home Office to show where it is incompetent,
where it is taking arbitrary and flawed decisions, will no longer be
there. According to the Home Office’s own statistics, 32% of
deportation cases and 50% of entry clearance applications were
successfully appealed last year. That means that the initial decision
was wrong. We need the judges to be able to keep that focus on those
wrong initial decisions. Yet the Government’s response to this
high margin of error is not to seek to improve the quality of their
decision making, but rather to reduce the opportunities for challenge.
Instead of improving the bad administration and inefficiency at the
heart of the Department, the Government are shifting the responsibility
and attacking due process.</hs_Para>

acknowledges that those costs will exist, but it has put in that column

welcome the Bill and want to talk about the general issues it deals

talking about is one of the most important functions of any Government:
to protect the country’s borders and, most importantly, to allow
the public, of all creeds, colours and religions, wherever they come
from, to have faith, trust and confidence in those borders. This is a
dividing line between the Government and the Labour party. I think that

own demographic issues and population requirements. I will tell Members
the difference between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
When the Scottish Government received the latest population figures,
they put out a press release welcoming the rise in the Scottish
population. Could you ever, Madam Deputy Speaker, imagine a UK
Government welcoming a rise in population? That is what distinguishes
us as a Government from them—we welcome the contribution of
immigration. We have our own population requirements, but we are stuck
and burdened with a set of immigration policies that are almost the
exact opposite of what we require. That is why we must wrest control of
our own immigration requirements.</hs_Para>

we look back over the 20th century, we see that for much of that time
the numbers migrating into and emigrating from the United Kingdom were
roughly in balance. From the 1960s to the early 1990s, the number of
emigrants was actually often greater than the number of
immigrants—a net population decline. What has happened in the
past two decades? Immigration has 
<?notus-xml column=208?>exceeded emigration by more than 100,000 every year since 1998—a
significant historical departure from the 20th century and many periods

removal of illegal immigrants who have absolutely no further basis to

at all to live in a type of limbo not knowing one’s status, or,
if one does know one’s status, carrying on being in the United
Kingdom when one cannot really make a life or plan for the future. If
someone has no basis to stay in this country, it is right for them to
return voluntarily to their home country or, if necessary, be forcibly
deported by the Government. I know that the Government will take
greater steps in this area: frankly, the delays are often too long. As

enforcement. That is very

cover the duration of their stay. Because they have moved in with their
son, who was well known to the GP concerned, the GP not only felt that
she had an ethical duty to provide further care and medication for the
parents, but she knew that the doctor/patient relationship with the son
would be destroyed if she refused. Another local GP has thousands of
patients on his list who entertain friends and relatives from Pakistan,

because she—or any applicant—had to speak Polish. At the

various actions were taken. People agreed that such advertisements were

concerned that that will create serious risks to public health,

100,000 people living in this country have HIV, a quarter of whom are

likely to go to sexual health or specialist clinics to be 
<?notus-xml column=210?>tested because of the increased stigma for them and
their communities. They are much more likely to go to a general

health experts agree that increasing the offer of HIV testing to a wide
range of facilities is key to tackling the UK epidemic in all
communities. In addition, the purpose of primary care is to assess the
broadest range of health needs and identify how best to meet
them. Anything that delays or prevents anyone with an infectious
disease from seeking medical advice denies them the opportunity to be
diagnosed and increases the chance of them passing on the infection to
someone else. Someone on HIV treatment is 96% less likely to transmit
it to others. Therefore, the Bill clearly risks unlimited and
unintended consequences to UK public
health.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0002.htm#13102272000183">The
Bill may increase the risk that we will fail to tackle HIV

Department of Health’s review of overseas visitors
charging policy, referred to in the explanatory notes, a comparison of
the administration costs of the current system with the amount actually
recovered showed that it barely broke even. The Home Secretary failed
to address that point, and I hope that the Minister will do so in his

strongly believe in an NHS free at the point of need. Arrangements are

clarity about how the provisions will be policed or expanded. I agree
that we need an immigration policy that protects our constituents from
increasing global financial pressures, but we do not want them coming
up against unintended consequences as a result of measures in the Bill,
on which there has been a lack of consultation. I worry about the risk
to public and private health. Moreover, this debate has thrown up areas
of contention in the referendum debate and problems with having
different arrangements in Scotland and England. If the Bill removes
long-held reciprocal agreements with countries that we are friends with

concerned. Finally, I am concerned that the Bill will cost constituents

immigration—according to the last statistics I saw, I had two of

complicated processes, and take a lot of money off tenants, to check
their credit history, references from previous landlords and all manner

them to check a person’s status as well. Clearly there are some
whose position is so complicated that it will not be easy for a

David Lammy</B> (Tottenham) (Lab):</Member> I am very grateful to make
a contribution to this debate and of course my remarks are informed by
the experience of being the son of immigrants; my father arrived in
this country in the 1950s, but is no longer alive. The remarkable
greatness of Britain that allows me to be here representing my seat in
a sense conveys the importance of the debate; it is what is great about
this country. In discussing immigration, migration and, indeed,
emigration, we balance and underline that greatness, which gives us the
diversity that we all
cherish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000217">I
am also informed by two particular experiences over the past few years.
One was an experience that many hon. Members will share,
particularly those representing so called “safe seats” or
those who have ministerial office in government. During
general elections, we end up out of our constituencies, travelling
around the country, holding balloons in shopping centres and persuading
people to vote for our parties. I found myself in North West
Leicestershire with our candidate Ross, campaigning in Coalville. We
were greeted—well, not greeted; many people tried to avoid
us—and I got stuck in a conversation with a young man called
Scott. He supported Leicester City; I support Spurs. We had a long
conversation about this and then I plucked up the courage, not to ask
him to marry me, but to ask him who he was going to vote for. At that
point, I was set back because he told me he was going to vote for the
British National party. I said, “What do you mean? Why are you
going to vote 
<?notus-xml column=215?>for the BNP?” He described himself as a brickie, and he told me
that eastern Europeans—“the Poles”, as he called
them—had come to that part of the country and undercut his
wages. He said they were preventing him from being employed. He pointed
to his four-year-old son and said, “I’ve got to feed this
boy. That’s why I’m voting for the
BNP<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:20:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:20:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:20:32"></hs_TimeCode>.”
That is a difficult argument to counter, just as it was for
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:20:32"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

badly fumbled it at the last general election, and for all hon. Members

factor was the riots. People talk about them starting in Tottenham, but
they spread to very different areas. I have strong memories of members
of the English Defence League on the streets of Enfield Town, just two
miles away, chanting “England, England, England” and
handing out leaflets saying that we had to do something about the
African gangs.

was that young man in Coalville, Scott, so concerned about immigration
because his wages were being undercut and he often could not get a job?
Was it not the job of the Government properly to enforce the minimum
wage? Was it not the job of the Government to be tough on unscrupulous
employers? In London at the moment, we have a crisis involving school
places, and people are voicing their concerns about the situation.
Surely it should have been the job of successive Governments to deal
with that. People complain about housing and about the benefits bill,
but successive Governments have failed to build sufficient housing in
this country.

back to the period when my father arrived in this country, the 1950s.
It was a period of austerity, with the country just coming out of
rationing, a period in which we celebrated the coronation of our
current Queen and a period of crisis, such as the Suez crisis, but it
was also a period during which it was typical and usual to have on
landlords’ doors in this country, “No Irish, no blacks,
no dogs.” We forget that at our peril. That is why I will
absolutely not vote for a Bill that encourages landlords to go down
that road again and that does not have the necessary understanding,
restrictions and knowledge of our history. Believe me, anyone in this
House who knows anything about the Irish community will know that
“No Irish need apply” has been a consistent phrase in our
country’s history, and we are now going back to a place where we

have got things wrong in their treatment of students and higher
education, just as 82% of landlords are asking, “Please do not
give us this power. We do not want the power, we are not policemen and
we do not want to do this. The Government should do this.” What
is the Government’s record? What about the UKBA? How effective
is it as an agency? How does it stack up on the list of effectiveness?

this debate from two perspectives. First, I regularly do a huge amount
of immigration and asylum work, which is consistently about 40% of the
work in my constituency. The overwhelming experience of that casework,
which is frequently acute, is that far too often the wrong decision is
made at the beginning. Of course, some people abuse the system, but
many do not, and come here perfectly properly. I am talking not about
asylum seekers but about immigrants who come here legally but may
overstay and so on. When they go to officials to put their case, we
often have an enormous struggle to try to deal with that. The Minister,
to whom I pay tribute for his courtesy in always dealing
with matters I bring to him, as did his
predecessor—and whom I rarely trouble, because I seek to deal
with his officials—knows that in the end many colleagues become
hugely frustrated because the most deserving cases imaginable are not
understood or dealt with properly in the system.</hs_Para>

overwhelming concern—I have checked with the person who leads in
my constituency office on immigration and asylum work—is not to
introduce lots of new legislation but to provide a system that works
well by making administrative improvements. That has always been the
case, but sadly there is still a huge backlog of cases both in
immigration and asylum, and a huge number of cases that go to
appeal.</hs_Para>

some really good people working in what was the UK Border Agency and is
now part of the Home Office again. I pay tribute to them,
and I am grateful for their courtesy, but there are some poor people
who do not understand immediacy and the way in which things should be
dealt with. There are some very good people in our outposts around the
world who deal with cases, but as the right hon. Member for Leicester
East (Keith Vaz), the Chair of the Select Committee, said, it is
illogical to ask the same person to review a decision that they have
made and expect them to think that it is the wrong decision only a few
weeks later.</hs_Para>

must proceed carefully when we seek to legislate yet again on
immigration and asylum. When I served in opposition, for too long I saw
Governments introduce immigration Bills, few of which sorted out
problems to the extent that people could say that they were a great
success. However, there are real issues, and our constituents and the
country are concerned. Of course, people are fair-minded, I hope, and
would always realise that we are a country of immigrants—they
are from around the UK, from outside the UK and Europe, and from all
over the world—and that in London and many cities, and most of
the UK, immigration has enriched our culture hugely. None the less it
needs to be controlled, and there has to be a limit. We also need to
make sure that those who are here illegally do not remain here
illegally.</hs_Para>

things that my party tried to do at the last election was put this
issue on the agenda. It was difficult, because the issue of addressing
illegal migration has over the years been something that the public
have found hard to come to terms with. President Obama has sought to do
so in the United States in a brave way with Churches and faith groups
across the parties, and in this country the issue has not gone
away.</hs_Para>

firm but fair immigration system, and we need firm processes for
policing it. I also believe that, because we are a country of islands,
we should not opt into the Schengen agreement, and that we should have
our own border controls. It is not a view that all the colleagues in my
party take, but it is an advantage in managing migration to deploy that
tactic. Irrespective of other European controls we should have our own.
I have always taken the view that we should check people out as well as
check people in, and that when we admit other countries to the EU we
should have gradual admission. The right hon. Member for Sheffield,
Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett) made the wrong decision to
allow mass admission in one go from the eastern European countries. In
the end, everyone accepts that that was the wrong decision. Again, I
think I was in a minority in my party at the time in arguing that the
process should be phased.</hs_Para>

should be clear that the Bill does not deal with asylum. Asylum cases
will, I hope, always be dealt with compassionately. We must be seen to
be a country that is always willing to receive people who come to us
fleeing from persecution because of their politics, faith, gender,
sexuality or whatever else it might be. I hope the Minister will say
amen to that.</hs_Para>

hope, too, that we will always be positive that any changes that we
make have been tried and tested and will not have disproportionate or
unfair outcomes. That is why I am troubled that yet again we are
dealing with a Bill that has not had pre-legislative scrutiny, that it
was not preceded by a Green Paper or a White Paper and that it has not
been the subject of full consultation. This is bad legislative process
and there is no need for it. There is no immediacy that means that we
have to get the Bill on to the statute book in two minutes. We must do
better. We had the same problem with the Transparency of Lobbying,
Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill. This
Government, whom I support, have said that we will do these things
better. Well, we must do them better consistently.
Whatever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:36:07"></hs_TimeCode> view we
take of the Bill, there is no disadvantage in pre-legislative scrutiny
and going through the proper processes to 
<?notus-xml column=219?>make sure that unintended consequences are avoided. I regret that that
has not been done and as a result I may not be able to support the
timetable motion. We need much more time to examine the Bill and I am

to look at it

Member for Leicester East, whose speech I entirely agree with, and
others—have made the point that we have not looked at the Bill
in the context of the changes that we are making to legal aid and
judicial review. They are all interrelated issues. I have outstanding
promises from Ministers on the Front Bench that they would review
previous changes. If we reduce the chances of people going to court to
challenge decisions, then reduce the chance of an appeal at all and
then insist that people go back to countries from which it may be very
difficult for them to appeal, we are denying the right of appeal
altogether. We must be extremely careful about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>, but we
need simpler appeal systems. I welcome the fact that that is on the
agenda of the Bill. We have too many different processes and they need
to be brought together, but they must be simplified in a way that makes
them both workable and
understandable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:37:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000241">We

nationally and internationally that we must fulfil. The Government have
done well. Our Government ended the detention of children for
immigration purposes, which I welcome. My hon. Friend the Minister was
party to that, as were other Ministers, and we must not now undo the
good work that we have done in relation to

the parts of the Bill that deal with marriage and civil partnerships,

no objection to people from outside this country being required to pay
for public services. It seems to me that that is the proper principle,
and therefore the proposal that the national health service has a
charge is one of principle. I support the principle. The question is
whether it is practical and how it is going to be implemented. It also
seems proper to have a bank account control mechanism that means that
people who are legally not meant to be here cannot process
their moneys around and be supported in doing so. The same principle,
for me, applies to driving

severe problems, however, believing that the residential tenancy plans

indicated earlier to the Home Secretary that there are sufficient good
things in the Bill to make it worth taking on to Committee stage and
looking at carefully, but I hope the Government do not try to push us
to rush things. I hope they will be responsive to constructive
criticisms from those of us who deal with this sort of work in huge
volume every day of our lives. I hope that at the end we can get the
message out that we should have tough immigration policies, we should
be firm but 
<?notus-xml column=220?>fair, but we must make sure that we have a better system that works
behind those policies, and we should be clear that another set of

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member> I
am glad to be able to speak about the Bill. I have taken an interest in
immigration policy for very many years, first as an administrative
trainee in the Home Office, and secondly as somebody who year on year
is in the top 10 of MPs processing immigration casework. I have also,
of course, taken an interest because I represent a
constituency with very many immigrants from all over the world, and,
finally, because I am the child of immigrants. I say from my knowledge
and experience of the immigration system that it is bedevilled by poor
administration and rushed and incoherent legislation, motivated by
short-term political advantage—and I do not except the Labour
party from that. I am afraid that this Bill is more of the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:40:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000246">I
say right at the beginning that there are many details in the Bill that
I agree with—which is not surprising, because some of it merely
puts into legislation matters that were regulations under the Labour
Administration—but I deplore the rhetoric and I deplore the
political direction of travel. I remind the House that immigration as
an issue has been freighted with emotion since the days of Enoch
Powell, and since those days immigration has been a synonym for black,
Asian and foreign-looking people—for “the other”.
Any Member of the House who pretends that immigrant, immigration and
anti-immigrant rhetoric does not have that underlying narrative in
British politics is being
naive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:41:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000247">If
people do not believe me, I urge them to read the report of the royal
commission on alien immigration in 1903 and the subsequent Aliens Act
1905, which deal with exactly the ideas that those on the Government
Front Bench are trying to push forward today. What people
say about east European migrants today is what was said about east
African migrants in the ’60s, what was said about
west Indian migrants, what was said about Jewish migrants to the east
end after the first world war, and what was said about Irish migrants
in the 19th century: driving down wages; living in terrible housing
conditions; assaulting our women. It is always the same narrative,
which should be a clue to the House that it is always the same
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:42:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000248">I
remind Government Members who think that they can get away with all
this anti-immigrant rhetoric and not pay an electoral price that the
Republicans in the United States thought that. They went to town
with anti- Hispanic, illegal migrant rhetoric; they thought
that anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric was a huge vote winner. But at the
election they found that perfectly legal migrants ran, not walked, away
from Republicans. Not just Hispanic migrants but Chinese, Japanese,
Indian migrants—every migrant community—voted in
unprecedented numbers for the Democrats, in what was a difficult
election for them in many ways, because when people of immigrant
descent hear that anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric they think,
“Actually, they are talking about me, my dad, my mum, my auntie,
the people on the landing.” Government Members should not think
that they can continue down this anti-illegal immigrant path and not
pay a price with 
<?notus-xml column=221?>the votes of the children and grandchildren of
migrants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:43:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The
danger with the Bill is not just that it will create the hostile
environment for illegal immigrants that the Home Secretary was boasting
of, but that it will tend to create a hostile environment for all of us
of immigrant descent and our
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:43:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000249">I
know as much about the UK Border Agency and abuse of the system as
anyone. I worked in the Home Office and I knew about Croydon. People
say that the Government inherited a shambolic immigration department
from the Labour party, but as long as I have known the immigration
department it has been dysfunctional and shambolic, and there are
systemic reasons for that. It was always seen as an outpost of the Home
Office in Whitehall and no one wanted to work there, so it was allowed
to remain in a welter of administrative confusion.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:43:55"></hs_TimeCode>I bow to no one
in my knowledge and my disapproval of the chaos, unfairness,
inefficiency and poor administration of the immigration department. I
also know—this has not been mentioned—of the abuses
practised on my constituents by so-called immigration advisers. People
talk about abuses of the system, but they are often
triggered not by people who are simply looking for a better life for
their family but by a class of so-called immigration advisers who
systematically rip them off. My constituents come to me years later and
I have to try to pick up the pieces of a case that was mishandled right
from the beginning by people motivated only by profit.</hs_Para>

administrative problems, and I give him every credit for his work on

hon. Friend the Member for Feltham and Heston (Seema Malhotra) said
about people who are left in limbo, even though they are here legally,

are systemic problems with the UKBA, but that does not justify trying

untrained people to pursue matters that the Government and a state
agency should deal with.</hs_Para>

want to say a word about what people hear on the doorstep, which keeps
coming up in this debate. I hear about that from Government Members,
and I am afraid that I hear about it from some hon. Friends. First, let
us kill the myth that Labour had an open-door policy on migration. I
have an office with filing cabinets stacked full of files about the
thousands of cases that I dealt with year on year under a Labour
Government. There was the issue of the miscalculation of the number of
people coming from the eastern European accession countries—no
one denies that—but if there was an open door, why did so many
of my constituents have to wait years and years, divided from their
family, to bring their children in? There was no open door. Far from
apologising, the Labour party should make that point more clearly and
more
often<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000252" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000252">What
do we hear on the doorstep? I can believe that Members hear people
complaining about immigrants. I have the children of West Indians
complaining to me about eastern European migrants. However, in an
economic downturn people always complain about the other, and want to
blame the other for their economic circumstances. 
<?notus-xml column=222?>Of course we as politicians should deal with the underlying issues when
people complain, whether about a lack of housing or job insecurity, but
we must not allow public policy to be driven by people who are
frightened of the changes they see around them, of economic insecurity
and of the fact that the so-called upturn is not helping their living
standards. We are now in danger of passing yet another ill thought-out
Bill to go on the pile that has been heaped up since the
1960s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:47:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000253">Let
us not forget that much of what we hear on the doorstep about
immigration is simply not based on fact. It may be easy to say to
people, “Oh, yes, you’re so right, we’re going to
have fewer of them; we’re going to do this; we’re going
to do that,” but politicians should deal with the facts first
rather than pander all the time to urban myth, which leads to a

is landlords speaking. The effect of the Bill will be that when people
such as my son and the children of some of my colleagues go to see a
flat, they will be told that the flat is taken. Landlords will not want
to take the chance of letting to someone who “might be”
an illegal immigrant. I do not believe Ministers understand how it
feels to knock on a door and be told, blatantly wrongly, that the flat
or room is taken. That is what will happen as a consequence of the

like to give the idea that the problems in accident and emergency and
the health service are caused by illegal immigrants. That is quite
extraordinary. Even if their figures are true—I believe that

there is already legislation about people who are not legally entitled

Lynton Crosby’s dividing-line politics than it has to do with
good administration. I will believe the Government on immigration when

living in an eight-bedroom house in Knightsbridge paid for by the
British taxpayer. The test for this House is how we deal with difficult
subjects and speak up for people who are not necessarily popular or
liked and who do not have a voice. By any test, this piece of
legislation is about short-term political advantage. It is of no real
benefit to Britons, black or white, or would-be immigrants, black or
white. Nobody on the Opposition Benches believes that people who are
not entitled to NHS care should be able to get it for free, or that we
should have a completely open-door immigration

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:54:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), who was right to
make the points she made. Lots of urban myths are going round about
immigration, notably fanned, dare I say it, by some of the emerging
nationalist parties. That makes it all the more important for us to
restore confidence in our immigration system. I, too, speak as someone
of immigrant descent—in my case, Irish on both sides of my
family.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102272000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000269">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:55:08"></hs_TimeCode>
have always been proud of Britain’s open borders and proud that
this country has always been welcoming to people who want to work hard
and make the best of themselves and to those who have sought asylum.
That is a source of great pride and something that is very British.
Having established that record, however, we have been taken for a soft
touch by people who have contempt for our laws and liberties and have
used them against us. Thankfully, some of them have been removed, but
not until after a very long battle.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102272000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000270">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>
the hon. Lady mentioned, there are also the so-called immigration
advisers who are exploiting people who want nothing more than to make
the best of themselves and make a good living. We can and should do a
lot more about those advisers, who, in my experience, take £500
off my constituents and then just send them to see me—nice work
if you can get it. The more we can do to expose these thieves’
dubious practices, the better. As I say, they are exploiting people who
just want to make the best of themselves, and that is totally
unacceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:56:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is also exploitation by some pretty nasty organised criminals and
gangmasters who take advantage of people by trafficking them into what
can only be described as modern-day slavery. It is big business. It is
important that we have a legal system controlling our immigration that
clamps down on these abuses. We do that by making sure that there is no
opportunity for illegal immigration to
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:56:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000271">I
am pleased to see so much in the Bill about tackling sham marriage,
which is also big business. My constituency is now very ethnically
diverse. There has been quite a significant influx of Nigerians and
Ghanaians, in particular. An organised criminal gang recently took
advantage of that by targeting a church in Tilbury where sham marriages
were being organised for Nigerians because the emergence of a large
Nigerian community had made it easy to do that. One of the local
priests participated in a sting with the police. He
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>was very brave
in taking this on because, as he would articulate, once the licences
have been issued, the priest is under an absolute obligation to
undertake the marriage. However, having seen the same ill-fitting
wedding dress a number of times, he smelled a rat. Having on one
occasion recited a list of train stations on the District line and had
them recited back to him by the bride and groom, he definitely smelt a
rat. It was a very scary concept for him, because this was an organised
criminal gang and he felt very intimidated, as did many of the brides.
It was clearly a great money-making business. We owe people like Father
Tim Codling of Tilbury a great debt of gratitude for participating in
that police sting to bring the perpetrators to book. It is 
<?notus-xml column=225?>estimated that they had organised over 30 sham marriages in that church
in Tilbury alone. This is a shining example to everyone involved,
showing that we should bring these people to book when these things
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:58:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000272">Of
course Government Members have no problem with people who abide by
immigration rules and are here legitimately. However, my position on
these matters has hardened since I became a Member of Parliament. I say
that because since being elected to this place three and a half years
ago I have handled 383 immigration cases, and in half those cases
people who had come to see me had broken the immigration rules in some
way, so there is real abuse out there.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102272000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000273">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:03:31"></hs_TimeCode>
would add that the figure of 383 is actually larger in practice,
because many of the people involved are repeat customers. As has been
said, there are so many opportunities to make appeals and reapply on
different grounds that we tend to see the same people over and over
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T16:59:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000274">The
changes made by the Bill will not affect anyone who wants to come here
legitimately and work. The changes made to the student visa regime have
not made a difference to people who want to come to our good
universities, but they are hitting bogus colleges. That is evidence, if
needed, that we are on the right
track<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:00:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000275">The
real problem is that we need to tackle overstayers who, frankly, should
not be here. Once they have been told that they have no leave to
remain, they should not expect to be able to make a fresh application.
Many of them have been here for years. When I say to them, “You
have no right to work here. How are you supporting yourself?”
they reply, “Friends and family,” meaning the same family
who are here with them. It is clear that they are earning their money
in the black
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:00:44"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Bill includes provisions to tackle the work situation and increase the
fines for those who employ people illegally, but I also think that Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs needs to undertake a bigger task.
It is clear that many of the people involved are working in the
self-employed sector. We need to clamp down on that black economy and
remove their ability to
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
all about establishing an environment that makes it clear that once
someone has been told that they cannot remain here, they should not
expect to be able to
stay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000276">The
issue of bank<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:01:22"></hs_TimeCode>
accounts is important. A gentleman from Ghana came to see me after
receiving his third rejection and said, “I can’t possibly
leave. I’ve got a mortgage.” He took that mortgage out at
his own risk. He knew he had no entitlement to stay here and
he cannot expect to be able to overstay his welcome. I
welcome the fact that the Bill’s measures on bank accounts will
actually protect people like
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:01:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000277">Some
of the concerns that have been raised about housing are legitimate, but
we should also be looking at social housing. I know of at least two
cases where people who were already subletting a council
house made a tidy profit out of subletting it to people who were here
illegally. We can add that to the list of abuses inflicted on our
immigrant
population<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:02:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000278">The
issue of health provision has been well rehearsed. Although it is fair
to say that there are already restrictions on the ability to access
health provision, the fact is that often our health service does not
pursue those who  
<?notus-xml column=226?>should pay. More than anything else, we need to give a clear message to
all health providers that from here on in we expect them to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:02:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000279">On
social landlords, we need to be aware of the ingenuity that people will
employ to try to get access to housing. Some people take an elastic
approach to the law and make up good tales in order to get such access.
In one particular case, a lady who was an overstayer came to see me and
said she was a victim of domestic violence. She was put in a
women’s refuge, which she subsequently left because she alleged
that she had been abused there. I asked her why she did not report it
to the police, but I did not get a satisfactory answer. The local
authority gave her access to a flat, because she had three children
under 10. I was more than a little surprised when I got a call four
months later from another lady who claimed she was being harassed and
abused by her landlady, who happened to be the lady in question. We are
dealing with people who have an elastic interpretation of the law and
who will not abide by it. We need to be vigilant with regard to all
access to public
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000280">As
I have said, I represent a constituency that is very ethnically
diverse. Perhaps the most vocal critics of the current immigration
regime are migrants themselves. We all recognise the hard work and
values that the people who came here in the ’50s, ’60s
and ’70s brought. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:04:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) said, they are
keeping our national health service and our other public services
going. It is that group of people more than any other that resents the
behaviour that we are witnessing. We should not let anyone suggest that
this is about race. We are pandering to the nationalist parties if we
let people think

Abbott:</Member></B> It is my experience that the last but one
immigrant group always slags off the latest one. Whether it is West
Indians, East Africans or eastern Europeans, it is almost a rite of
passage. They do it because they are insecure. The fact that we hear
the children of immigrants complaining about more recent immigrants
speaks to their insecurity, rather than proving that their critique is
based on
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:05:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000282"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jackie Doyle-Price" PimsId="5689" UID="13102272000536" xid="1152" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000536">Jackie
Doyle-Price:</Member></B> The hon. Lady makes a good point. She
observed in her speech that such messages surface when people feel more
economically insecure, so we should expect to start hearing them at
times of economic difficulty. Where she and I part company is that I
think that we need to reassure the public that we do not have an
open-door immigration policy and that we will take measures to control
immigration. Unless we are seen to be doing that, the situation will
fester and the only beneficiaries will be the nationalist
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000283">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:06:23"></hs_TimeCode>
that basis, I do not think that there is anything to object to in the
Bill. The British public would expect us to do many of the things that
are in it. For most law- abiding people, including
immigrants, nothing in the Bill should cause them any disadvantage. I

many Members, I represent a diverse, multicultural constituency. My

that detainees have recourse to before they are removed from the
country. I have been visiting Harmondsworth for nearly 40 years. I
remember when it was just a couple of Nissen huts with a dozen people
in them. There are now two prison-like institutions that detain 1,000

others people have been seriously injured as a result of the physical

process of dawn raids where vans turn up and drag people and families
out of their homes. One of the first cases I dealt with after being
elected as a Member of Parliament involved an elderly lady who came to
my constituency surgery because the family next to her had been dragged
out of their house at 6 o’clock in the morning, children and
all. She went into the house, obtained the children’s teddy
bears and followed the van to Harmondsworth so the children at least
had their toys. Is that the society we are returning to as a result of

is detention like? I refer people to the report of the independent
monitoring board of Harmondsworth. These are volunteers appointed by
the Minister, reporting to the Minister. Its latest report, from April
2013, is worth reading. It says that many people handle detention
stoically, but that many others suffer intense distress. Many are
mentally ill. They self-harm. We have had suicide attempts time and
again in Harmondsworth and in Colnbrook. At the last count, last year
125 people were assessed under rule 35 by doctors who found that their
health was suffering so badly that they should not be detained. Many
Members know what rule 35 is: it means that the person should
automatically be released. Of the 125 people so designated by doctors
in Harmondsworth last year, only 12 were released. One was released
because of ill-health, went to Hillingdon hospital and died soon after.
That is what detention means. That is the type of suffering the Bill
will increase, yet 20% of people in the detention centre get released
back into the community. Some have been detained for a long time. I
refer back to the report published in April. Two of those people had
been detained since 2008, and 38 had been detained for more than a
year. For many people, detention is not just a short-term measure
before removal.</hs_Para>

am concerned about what the Bill will mean for the wider community.
Nearly 50% of my constituents are black or people of colour. The Bill
will mean that any person who is black, is of colour or who just looks
foreign will be challenged. They will be challenged by bank managers
and landlords, and by the vicar if they want to get married. They will
also be challenged if they apply for legal aid. I find that offensive.
I voted against identity cards in this House when my own Government
brought them forward. The Bill will yet again bring the process of ID
cards forward. There will be no ID cards for white people; it will be

The Bill is derived from the gutter politics of Lynton Crosby; it is an

Reckless:</Member></B> The hon. Lady says that such things were very
common. I cannot comment on the 19th century, although she
did mention cases that were more up to date. Whether during the depths
of the worst of the de Valera regime in the ‘30s, or after what
we have seen in the past five years with the move to switch away from a
link to sterling and experiment on the Irish people through the
imposition of the euro, which has destroyed so much of the Irish
economy, I feel that this country—England, the United
Kingdom—has stood ready to welcome people who have come from
Ireland, often in large numbers. It has welcomed them and they have
found work here that they were not able to find in Ireland.</hs_Para>

astonished by what the hon. Lady said. As if a large number of people
who are prepared to work harder for less money coming here
would have no impact on wages! Other things being equal, it will have a
significant impact. The debate has changed in that the most recent
large-scale immigration—from central and eastern Europe since
2004—has not been of black, Asian or foreign-looking people, as
she described them, but of the white Caucasians. She is so insistent
that the immigration debate must be about race but, in a way, that
immigration has de-linked race from the debate. It is clear that the
debate is not, or largely not, about
race.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000311" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000311">Whatever
the overall costs and benefits of immigration, the fact is that the
impacts are different. People who are well off often buy goods and
services produced by people who have come to this country. The people
who have come here have, at least initially, competed for some of the
less-skilled jobs. If wages are lower than they otherwise would be in
those categories, that allows better-off people to get a better or
cheaper service—they understandably welcome the people providing
it. However, it is less understandable and not right for better-off
people who benefit from immigration to look down on those who do not
have the same view of those coming here and think that it is because
they have antediluvian or even racist
attitudes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000312">The
reality is that less well-off people are competing with those coming in
and it affects their wages or how hard they have to work for their
wages. Their situation is less good because they are subjected to a
large amount of competition from significant numbers of people who have
recently come into the country. Sometimes the competition will be
between people with skills, but it is often at the lower-skilled end.
They will compete with those who might otherwise have those
lower-skilled jobs or receive better pay in those jobs. It is not
surprising that people are unhappy with the scale of immigration. It is
quite wrong for those who benefit from immigration to look down on
those people and suggest that their attitudes are racist when what we
are seeing is the economic
effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000313" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000313">One
other important context of the Bill is this country’s system of
eligibility for benefits, which is different from that in
most other EU countries. The UK, Ireland, Estonia, Finland and,
importantly, Germany, do not require a significant contributory period
prior to eligibility for unemployment benefit. That leads to the
possibility of 
<?notus-xml column=231?>people who do not have a long-term connection with
this country benefiting without having paid in. I am not suggesting
that that is the most significant part of the immigration pull into
this country, but it causes concern among my
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000314">The
more significant pull within the benefits system is the possibility of
family benefits. The payment of child benefit to children who are
resident overseas, be that in Poland or, in greater numbers, in Romania
or Bulgaria, is wrong and should be stopped. I believe it could be
stopped, even under current EU law, but I am not sure whether Ministers
agree. Another pull is child tax credits. Our system of in-work
benefits for people in some of the not-so-well-paid jobs is very
generous compared with the system prevailing in, for example, Poland,
particularly if they have children. That is a significant draw and my
constituents are not terribly happy with it. They have paid into a
system for a long time and see people who do not have that link with
the system immediately taking significant benefits from
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000315">Those
two problems are the basis and context of the debate. The recent
large-flow immigration de-links race from the immigration debate,
although some people would like to preserve the link. In addition, when
more recent immigrants compete for jobs with people from a previous
migration, the latter understandably object. We will either have to
change our benefit system, or leave the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000316"><B><Member ContinuationText="Fiona Mactaggart" PimsId="1635" UID="13102272000547" xid="400" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000547">Fiona
Mactaggart:</Member></B> Some of the hon. Gentleman’s points

Reckless:</Member></B> One area within the broad range the hon. Lady
describes is the charge for the use of NHS services. If someone comes
to this country for a considerable period, say as an overseas student,
it is right that they should make a contribution. She is right to say
that in many of these areas we are not able to make the
changes that I would like within our domestic legal system, because of
the European Union. It is right, therefore, that my party
has said that it will give the people an in/out referendum so that they
can decide whether they want us to be an independent country or whether
they want to continue to have these rules set by the
European Union.</hs_Para> <hs_Para UID="13102272000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000318">One
impact of the scale of the immigration we have seen to this
country is the linking of those issues in a way
that people understand. If people want to control immigration and
reduce the numbers coming from the European Union, we once again need
to be an independent country. Over the next year as people
from Romania and Bulgaria gain the ability to come here for
employment, rather than self-employment—or purported
self-employment—or other reasons, I hope that we do not see a
huge influx of people from those two countries, which might get in the
way of the very good progress that the Government have made towards our
target of cutting immigration from the hundreds of thousands to tens of
thousands. Were that to happen and to reflect on the
Government—perhaps unfairly, given that it was the previous
Government who signed up to that treaty of accession—it would be
unfortunate if in any way that were to prevent the referendum that we
have promised coming to pass in 2017.</hs_Para>

bear down on several channels for immigration, and some of the issues
it addresses are quite technical. The Home Office has looked
at all the issues and made progress in many different areas to reduce
the overall scale of immigration. Part 2, on restricting the right to
appeal, strikes a good balance. I have referred to the NHS charge in
part 3, but it also addresses the need to ensure that people have the
right to be here before giving them a driving licence. That
is clearly a good thing. In the United States, that is a
massive political issue, and states have very different policies on it.
In this country, it seems to have gone by default, but at
last we have a Government who are waking up and ensuring that people
get a driving licence only if they have a right to do so by virtue of
their eligibility to live in this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000320" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000320">I
welcome the Bill’s approach on article 8. We have heard some
excellent proposals recently from my hon. Friend the Member for Esher
and Walton (Mr Raab). I thought that they were very sound and it was a
shame that they did not make it into the Crime and Courts Bill, and his
approach may have further benefits over and above those in the Bill.
Nevertheless, the provisions in the Bill are very sound. For example,
and crucially, clause 14 would insert into the 2002 Act a new

states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102272000432" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000432">“Little

fact that that will be in primary legislation will at last give us a
real opportunity to rein in the courts and their overly expansive
interpretation of article 8. In this instance, it is not so much the
European Court in Strasbourg, but our own domestic courts that have had
an excessively loose approach to the definition of article
8.</hs_Para>

caution. The provisions on article 8, which are good, will act as a
restraint—although I look forward to reading them in more
detail—but there remains an issue with how section 55 of the
Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 has been used. As a
general principle of family law, it is right that the interests of the
child be paramount—for instance, in a divorce case—but I
am much less convinced that it is useful in considering the
deportation, following a long prison sentence, of a foreign national,
not least because it is not easy for immigration judges to come to a
fair and proper assessment of the interests of that child.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:31:03"></hs_TimeCode> suspect that
very often the individual concerned will not be a good parental
influence on the child, but even where it might have a small
impact—if it might become more difficult for that child to see a
parent—I am not convinced that it should always be the trump
card, which is what section 55 has become. However bad the crime
committed, so long as a foreign national can find a UK partner and have
a UK nationality child, a reference to section 55 has come close to
trumping all other considerations in the eyes of the courts. The
article 8 stuff is good, but I am worried that section 55 will still be
applied, even when the overall balance, including the public interest,
would have individuals deported to their home country.</hs_Para>

objectives and direction of travel, more often than not officials
respond, and in many areas, the Home Office has done good work that has
not been properly sung. For instance, appeals are going a different way
because of operating criminal nexus and because judges can now consider
information from police short of a conviction. That has largely been

legitimacy, we now have the proper checks and linkages. Those are just
two examples, but an awful lot of unsung work goes on in the Home
Office. I welcome that, as well as the Bill, which will
assist us, at least, in bearing down on immigration, and I give credit
to Ministers for their

Blomfield</B> (Sheffield Central) (Lab):</Member> It is interesting
that we started this debate by being reminded that the Home Secretary
was busy distancing herself from the disgraceful ad vans. It is just
unfortunate that she has applied the same school of politics to
developing the Bill, which is absolutely from the ad van approach to
tackling immigration. In her own words, she was trying in the Bill to
create “a really hostile environment” for migrants, and
not just illegal ones—before the Minister intervenes. The
narrative surrounding the Bill is creating a hostile environment for
all migrants and a toxic background for a sane debate about
immigration.</hs_Para>

us look at some of the provisions. I will not go into the detail on
appeals, because many others have, but what sort of approach is this?
The reason we have too many appeals is that too many initial decisions
are wrong. The majority of entry clearance decisions are wrong. The
appeals system is a safety valve. What approach is it to take away the
safety valve, instead of dealing with the problem at the heart of
it?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000328">I
find the stuff on landlords curious because I thought that this was the
Government who had launched the red tape challenge. Where are we now on
the red tape challenge? We are creating a needless bureaucracy for
landlords who, in large numbers, have said they do not want it. Who
will train our landlords to become immigration experts? Where are
people to live while they wait for a decision from the Home Office? The
Minister represents the party that proclaims itself to be the party of
the family. What about the family waiting for mum’s spousal
visa? Where will they set up home? According to the Bill, the landlord
would breach the duty if he or she entered into an agreement to allow a
disqualified person to occupy a property whether or not that person was
named on the tenancy agreement. This is ill thought out, with very
negative social

there are already rules on charging people who are not ordinarily

estimated chargeable costs. Add in the costs of administering the
current system—estimated at over £15 million—and
the current overseas visitor charging system may be generating a small
profit, according to the Department of Health’s own assessment.
Does the Home Secretary look to improve the current system? No, she
introduces a new one without a full impact assessment of how much it
will cost. This really is dog-whistle politics at its worst, building
policy on prejudice rather than on facts and setting it in the context
of a falsely constructed debate around health tourism.</hs_Para>

remember an exchange with the Immigration Minister when he was newly

group, in which he pointed out that we should be talking not only about
the income that international students brought in but about the costs
that were incurred, including the cost to the health service. I went
back to Sheffield university and said that we needed to look into that
issue. The university commissioned Oxford Economics to carry out the
most rigorous assessment possible into the income involved and the
costs for our city. That assessment did not just cover the NHS and
education; it went to the nth degree, covering every conceivable cost
including traffic congestion. It concluded that international students
were worth about £120 million a year to the Sheffield economy in
net terms, which probably equated to about 6,000 jobs.

The point is not that there might be a slight increase; it is that we

the international economy. The Government, through the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills, have estimated that the number of

major concern, and that of our universities, is that we are losing
market share as regards university students coming to the UK. The
health surcharge obviously comes on top of a number of measures that
the Government have introduced, and it is not just about the health
surcharge. The universities are concerned about the provisions on
landlords. They are worried, as other Members have been, about what
will happen and that landlords—we know that 83% of them do not
want these measures—will take the easy way out. We have seen the
evidence in the reports over the past couple of weeks of letting agents
in London who are discriminating against people on racial and ethnic
grounds and on grounds of their appearance. The danger is that that
will happen in this case and that international students, often leaving

remains a complex system. I can remember the expression “a
one-stop shop for appeals” being bandied about under
the previous Government. That was their aim, but they did not entirely
fulfil it—although, to be fair to them, they did try. Some
Labour Back Benchers would do well to remember that.</hs_Para>

welcome the fact that the Opposition are not opposing the Bill and will
examine the measures in Committee. That is the proper approach to take.
I would part company with the Opposition, however, on the question of
net migration and effective immigration control. During the course of
the debate, Opposition Members have made a big point about whether net
migration has fallen by a third or a quarter, and have argued over the
statistics. That shows a little brass neck, to say the least, given
what happened to net migration under the previous Government. It
increased from 50,000 to 250,000 per year over the lifetime of that
Government. I would calculate that as a fivefold increase, yet now
Labour is debating whether net migration has fallen by a quarter or a
third while often opposing some of the measures needed to bring about
that reduction.</hs_Para>

believe the issue should be an important objective of government and
that we should have proper immigration control. I recognise the
contribution of immigrants to society and their worth as individuals,
and I believe that when they come to this country and are legally
entitled to be here they should certainly be welcome. We must bear in
mind, however, that demand to come to this country from less
economically developed countries is almost unlimited. It is one of the
major duties of a Government to impose proper immigration control in
the light of that demand, which our constituents know about and can see
reflected in news stories and developments in other parts of the
world.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T17:49:32"></hs_TimeCode>demand to come
to this country is almost unlimited, to keep our quality of life we
must have regard to population growth and population density.
Immigration is a major driver of population. Our population is 62
million, and to keep it below 70 million net migration must be
carefully controlled, and certainly brought down from 250,000, which is
what it was at the end of the previous Government’s time in
office. Otherwise the population increase—5 million, as has been
said, would be due to migration—would produce a population 
<?notus-xml column=238?>of 70 million, which is equal to the populations of Birmingham, Leeds,
Glasgow, Sheffield, Bradford, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol and Oxford
added together, and accommodation would have to be made for
that.</hs_Para>

Opposition’s policy, I was not encouraged by the response from
the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette
Cooper) to my question about whether the Labour party would have a
target for net migration. The Opposition draw attention to the fact
that we cannot control all the factors that relate to net migration. Of
course we cannot control how many people choose to leave the country,
but that does not mean that we should not control those factors that we
can control, including the number of people who are permitted to enter
the country. If we give way to the demand for lots of people to come to
this country, net migration will run much higher than the figure to
which it has been brought down by the Government.</hs_Para>

encouraged by the policy on migration adopted by the Leader of the

linking foreign workers to apprenticeships. He
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102272000434" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000434">“We
think that can create up to 125,000 new apprenticeships over the course
of five years. And that is a massive boost in skills of our young
people and that is really
important.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13102272000364" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000364">No
doubt it is: many of us would say that that is something that we should
do anyway without linking it to migration. The right hon. Gentleman
also made the point that he wanted to link every one of those
apprenticeships to the admission of a foreign worker into this country,
which means 125,000 extra people, as well as their dependants, as it is
the custom to admit dependants with foreign workers who are allowed
into this country for work.</hs_Para>

things being equal, and without any change in policy in other
directions by the Opposition—there has certainly been no
indication that there will be a reduction to compensate for this in
other migration flows—over the lifetime of a Parliament we would
see an increase of 125,000-plus in net migration, or 40,000 a year,
which would go a considerable way towards doing away with the reduction
achieved by the Government. That puts into context the
Opposition’s quibbling about whether net migration has fallen by
a quarter or a third. If he has time, I invite the right hon. Member
for Delyn (Mr Hanson), who speaks knowledgeably on these matters, to
confirm that that is the Labour party’s policy, and that 125,000
foreign workers would be admitted in line with the 125,000 increase in
apprenticeships. Will he confirm that in addition to those foreign
workers, their dependants would be admitted, and will he provide an
estimate of how much extra net migration would result? In my
calculation, that would produce at best some several hundred thousand
net migrants over the course of a Parliament.</hs_Para>

congratulate my right hon. and hon. Friends on their approach. This is
something that is important to our constituents—certainly to my
constituents—as we do not want to live in a grossly overcrowded
country, with all the consequences that would flow from an increase in
population to upwards of 70 million as a result of the policies that
have been outlined by the Opposition. This is an important subject. I
commend my right hon. and hon. Friends on their

Conservative party are very concerned, and have been as long as I can
remember, about the European convention on human rights and the
European Court of Human Rights. They are an obsession with them. Never
mind that the convention was written by a Tory lawyer and introduced in
1950 and has done a great deal to give people a benchmark of human
rights throughout the member states of the Council of Europe. They want
to say that article 8, the right to family life, somehow undermines the
British way of life. So we have this curious clause 14, which talks
about public interest considerations in respect of article 8 of the
European convention on human rights. It is strangely written because
much of it consists of assertions of the wishes of the Government of

serious examination of the whole question of article 8, and that when
the Bill eventually reaches the House of Lords it will be able to do
something more useful, such as protecting the rights of all of us by

part 3, which deals with the impact on the national health service of
the cost of treating foreign

year, I had the privilege of introducing a private Member’s
Bill, the NHS Audit Requirements (Foreign Nationals) Bill. I am
delighted that most of the measures that were pursued in that Bill have
found their way into the Government’s Immigration Bill. In
preparing my private Member’s Bill, I sent out Freedom of
Information Act requests to all NHS health trusts—more than
400 requests—asking what the impact on their finances
was of treating overseas visitors. I received replies from less than a
quarter of trusts, and those from which I did receive replies gave
haphazard information. Some recorded the treatment of foreign nationals
in ways that did not comply with Department of Health guidelines. That
shows that our understanding of the scale of the issue is at best
limited and, in many parts of the country, virtually
non-existent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:08:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102272000389" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102272000389">There
are wide-ranging estimates of the cost of treating overseas visitors on
the national health service. At the very lowest end, a figure of some
£200 million is often quoted. Interestingly, the European
Commission quotes a figure of £1.5 billion, and the Government
quote the rather modest figure of some £500 million, which was
arrived at through the Department of Health’s independent study.
Of that £500 million, £388 million is identified as being
spent on the treatment of foreign nationals who would otherwise not be
entitled to free NHS care, and those costs should be recovered. The
figure for the treatment of those who come to this country specifically
for NHS treatment, which is commonly known as health tourism, ranges
anywhere between £70 million and £300 million.
The scale of the impact on the NHS budget, and therefore on the British
taxpayer, is quite

do not think that anybody in this House would claim that those in need

not right that the British taxpayer should

is estimated that if we could recover just three quarters of the money
spent treating foreign nationals on the NHS, through insurance or
reciprocal arrangements such as the European insurance health card
scheme, that would be the equivalent of being able to employ an
additional 4,000 doctors or 8,500 nurses, so the scale of the issue is
quite acute.

of fairness, both to the British taxpayer and to the patients using the

must of course remain an outward-looking nation in the 21st century,
but the British people do not want to become a soft touch for those
arriving who are not capable of contributing and who are dependent on
the state rather than self-reliant. We should enforce the law to
prevent and deter illegal immigration and discourage benefit tourism,

confidence in the ability of the political class to grapple with the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:13:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), who is no longer in the

want to put on the record how offensive I find that, and I say that as
the son of someone who fled the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia. To
draw that kind of moral equivalence is utterly offensive and repugnant

to address immigration is the irresponsible thing to do. Having worked
on war crimes and as a diplomat in Europe, and having seen the rise of
Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Jean-Marie Le Pen in France

the political elite bury their heads in the sand. That is the real
fertile ground for extremist politics. Of course, the weaknesses in the
current system make life harder for those we want to welcome, of whom
there are many. So let us ensure that this Bill does what it says on
the tin; otherwise we risk exacerbating the public concern that is the
real fertile ground for extremist politics.</hs_Para>

support from Labour Members, he passed the UK Borders Act 2007, which
made deportation mandatory for foreign criminals jailed for at least a
year—or at least that was the theory. But he paralysed his own
legislation and broke his promise by inserting a catch-all human rights
clause that led to the perverse results in the system that we see
today. I know that the Home Secretary will be mindful of making sure

that in mind, I want to focus on part 2, particularly the
non-suspensive appeals procedure and the provisions on article 8
appeals. This is not some technical, legalistic issue; it affects real
lives. In my constituency, a local waiter called Bishal Gurung was
killed in a vicious attack, and the perpetrator, Rocky Gurung—no
relation—was convicted of manslaughter. He evaded deportation to
Nepal by claiming his right to family life, even though he is a single
adult with no
dependants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:16:26"></hs_TimeCode>. We
are not talking about returning people who might face torture or real
threat to life or limb on their return home—I certainly would
not support that—but about serious criminals convicted and
jailed here who evade removal on the basis of family and social ties
that are often loose, if not outright artificial. Such cases, which are
happening on some scale, warp the moral balance of the British justice
system, endanger the public, and make “human rights”
dirty words for many people, and that is a shame.</hs_Para>

the one in my constituency are not isolated. When I submitted a freedom
of information request in 2010, it was disclosed that successful
article 8 challenges by foreign national criminals were running at a
rate of just under 400 per year—61% of all successful
challenges. When I re-submitted the request in 2012, I found that the
rate was 188 per year, but that that was 89% of all successful
challenges. This is not about a few minor episodes or a few cases here

problem of violent, sexual and other offenders pleading article 8 to
scupper deportation arises because of the rights inflation that has
taken place in Strasbourg and here in the UK under the Human Rights Act
1998. In recent years, the European Court in Strasbourg has inflated
the grounds for challenging deportation orders, adding tier upon tier
of legal excuses which hamstring the effective operation of our border
controls. Encouraged by the Human Rights Act, the UK courts have gone
further still in stretching the application of article 8, so we cannot
just blame Europe. It is not wholly a European issue, but it is at
least partly a home-grown problem.</hs_Para>

am afraid to say that I warned that, because of the way in which Human

these spurious challenges. The Act requires UK courts to read down
regulations inconsistent with the Strasbourg case law or the

this time around is that simply spelling out the public interest
considerations in favour of deportation in article 8 cases will not
achieve that aim. It leaves a very wide margin of discretion for the
courts to consider, decide and balance the various competing factors
for and against deportation.
Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:19:25"></hs_TimeCode> section 3
of the Human Rights Act, the provisions have to be interpreted and the

risk is that little will change in practice. In my view, it would have
been better to cut out all the article 8 challenges by foreign
criminals sentenced to 12 months or more—the very serious
offenders. That would fit the original intention of paragraph 2 of
article 8 of the European convention, and such a mandatory clause could
not be trumped by article 8 because of the way in which section 3(1) of
the HRA works. It states that primary legislation has an overriding
effect, but only when it is impossible to read it down in a way that
makes it compatible with human rights law. We will have to look at that

process, so they will be heard when the appellant has already been

country benefits substantially from immigration. We benefit
economically and culturally. We are net improved by immigration, which
has taken place for many hundreds of years. Are there, however,
problems with illegal immigration? Yes, absolutely, and we should deal
with many of them, including people who are being trafficked and held
in quasi-slavery
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000016">I
want an immigration system that knows what is happening in this country
and knows who has come in and who has left. We need to bring back exit
checks so that we know who is in and who is out. We need a system where
decisions are made quickly and correctly, rather than one with the
current problems. That is what I think the Minister ought to focus on,
and we debated it this morning in Westminster
Hall<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000017">The
Bill deals with a different set of issues. It is a shame that there was
no pre-legislative scrutiny, because we could have fleshed out a lot of
the details and come to understand the proposals. It is clear from
today’s debate that not everybody, and I include myself,
understands the details of much that is being proposed. There is still
a lot to understand and that is a problem. We need the system to work
properly, but that must not be at the expense of a system that is
fair<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000018">The
Bill definitely has some good bits. For example, our dealing with dodgy
immigration advisers will be welcomed by anybody who has repeatedly to
deal with constituents affected by the issue. I am, however, concerned
about certain other things. Effectively abolishing application for
immigration bail is of particular concern, especially when the Home
Office does not seem to have any evidence that it is a specific problem
that needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000019">I
continue to be very concerned, like other hon. Members, about the end
of appeals. That could be dangerous when we are not making the right
decisions. When we are getting the decisions right, we can look at how
we can stop people prolonging the process, but when so many appeals are
successful, it shows that there 
<?notus-xml column=247?>are problems. If we remove people before they have made their appeal,
how can we be sure that we will hear the appeal properly? If somebody
has been wronged, will there be a chance for them to present their case
within a reasonable period of
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:25:02"></hs_TimeCode>? We have
also heard about the needs of children in the UK who have been
separated from their parents through

do not think that the landlord proposal is a good idea. Indeed, I think
that it is a profoundly bad idea. I am pleased that rather than it
being implemented everywhere, there will be only one pilot in one
location to test it. I am confident that it will fail the test, as did
the vans, which I am pleased have been abandoned. If it proves not to
be a good idea, we will be able to vote to ensure that it does not go
ahead anywhere else. I am very pleased about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000021">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:25:51"></hs_TimeCode>
am concerned about how workable the landlord proposal will be. I am
concerned that it will take 48 hours for the Home Office to verify
somebody’s status. I wish that it was always that fast when I
ask it something. In many areas, that will be too long and landlords
will not take the risk of renting to somebody who cannot prove their
status on the spot. If we are to implement the proposal, the Home
Office has to find an easy and clear way for people to show that they
have the correct status. That must also apply to British citizens who
do not have a passport. Otherwise, we will drive people into the hands
of exploitative rogue
landlords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>. This
matter must be subject to the affirmative procedure so that we can be
absolutely sure that we will get a
vote<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:26:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000022">On
the health care proposals, visitors who are here to stay with their
family or on business are already expected to pay for their health care
if they go into hospital, however much it may cost. However, as we have
heard, they do not always do so. The concept that paying
£200 will get people free access to health care is
something that one can imagine marketing overseas: “Come to
Britain and get free health care for £200”. The US would
never offer a deal like
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:26:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000023">There
are many questions to which we need answers. What will that £200
cover? Will people get complete cover for that amount? Will people who
stay here for year after year and who work here, pay their taxes and
pay their national insurance have to pay £200 a year on top of
everything that they already pay? I am pleased that there is a slight
discount for students, but currently they do not pay anything towards
their health care. I hope that the Minister will look carefully at that
issue and, at the very least, offer a larger
reduction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:27:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000024">Various
comments have been made by Members on both sides of the Chamber about
the benefits that we receive from our higher education and further
education sectors. English language schools are a big employer in my
area and in many others. I am pleased that the Government have clamped
down on bogus colleges. None of us wants to make it easy for people who
are actively cheating the system to get away with it. However, further
restrictions will be even more damaging and will send a message to the
rest of the world that we are closed for
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000025">I
was therefore horrified earlier today when the shadow Home Secretary
called for stronger checks on short-term student visitor visas, with no
serious evidence that they are a massive problem. I contacted one of
the English

urge the Opposition not to progress that policy any further because I
do not want my constituents to be damaged in that way. People are

are areas where I think the Bill should go further. I would like to see
a system that ensures that we get decisions right the first time. That
is the key that would unlock this whole problem. However, that is
probably not something that can be written into a clause and slid into
the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:28:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000028">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>
would like a commitment to end the routine detention of children for
immigration purposes to be written into the Bill. It is a disgrace that
the last Government held thousands of young people. We have stopped
that and we should ensure that that legacy continues by writing it into
the law so that it never happens
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:28:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000029">I
hope that the Minister will consider two other matters. First, people
whose children do not share their surname often have to produce a huge
amount of paperwork, including birth and marriage certificates, when
they come into the country to show that they are allowed to travel with
their child. That is a huge burden and I hope that the Minister will
consider the options. Legislation may be required so that
children’s passports are updated to include the names of the
people with whom they may travel. That would make a big difference to a
particular set of people and would allow immigration officers to focus
on the real
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000030"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>Lastly,
as the Minister and I have discussed on a number of occasions, we could
finally close a number of loopholes left in the law by the previous
Government. In particular, some children born to unmarried British
fathers before 2006 are deprived of citizenship. They would be allowed
citizenship if their fathers had been married or if they had been born
after 2006, so this is a clear anomaly and I think the Minister accepts
that. His predecessor certainly did, and the Bill could be used as a
vehicle to correct it. It seems that the Bill will receive a Second
Reading, so I look forward to its being examined in Committee and
substantially
improved.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13102283000600" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000600">6.30

way in which I have found the debate disappointing is that I had
thought we had moved on and divorced the question of race from the
question of immigration. There were a number of contributions from

such a large part.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:30:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless) gave good reasons
why race is no longer tied to immigration, and it is immigration we are

have to say to Opposition Members that that is a debate from which we

are the problems and how can they be described? There are two principal
problems. The first is the complexity of the regime and the lucrative
industry that has grown up among immigration practitioners, which makes
a mockery of both common sense and the law. Most importantly, that has
resulted in constituents of Members from across the House paying large
fees to achieve precisely nothing in terms of immigration advice. The
second problem is that in the minds of many people overseas, this
country has become a soft touch and an easy immigration route into the
European Union. Even worse, it has become that in the minds of its
own citizens —the very people who sent us here to
represent their interests. Those of us who have pushed the Government
in this area know that those issues must be tackled, which is what the
Home Secretary and her team intend to do with this excellent
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0003.htm#13102283000044">I
will turn briefly to the Bill, but before that—if I may in the
time available, Mr Deputy Speaker—I will make a few other
comments. As I have said, tough action was necessary and I am pleased
that we are seeing that in the Bill. Of course we want to welcome the
brightest and best people to this country—we should always
recognise that—and we want all that they offer to our economy
and society. We want to recognise the contribution of many of those who
have come here in the past and who run our NHS, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:37:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hackney North and Stoke Newington observed, and other public
services, and who have given so much to this country. It is
interesting, however—we did not hear this point from the hon.
Lady or any Opposition Member—that it is those who have come to
this country during the past 30 years who most resent the
open-door immigration policy pursued by the previous Government. That
policy saw a number of people come into this country that was
equivalent to the population of a major city such as
Birmingham.</hs_Para>

Bill do and what must we welcome? The Opposition seem to welcome it
since, as I understand it, they are not going to divide the House on
Second Reading. First, we all know that the appeal system is not only
abused but is broken and not fit for purpose. Unmeritorious appeals are
used to delay, obfuscate and prevent that which common sense decrees,
where people are here unlawfully. All the provisions in the Bill are
therefore to be welcomed.</hs_Para>

earth—before the Home Secretary rose to explain I suspect few of
us knew this—do we currently have a system in which decisions on
immigration status and removal are made separately? Are we really so
stupid that we think those who come here illegally will always
voluntarily leave without a removal decision? If we have been so
foolish in the past, thank goodness we are no longer.</hs_Para>

previous Government countenance a system that permitted bail to be
applied for again and again by those to be deported, so that they could
abscond? Why are abusive bail applications made day in, day out, which
tie up immigration judges, and as a result lead to long periods during
which those who have legitimate rights of appeal are denied a hearing
in court? What on earth—I will not echo all the points made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:39:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Esher and Walton—were the courts doing in the
past in interpreting article 8 of the European convention on human
rights in a way that made a mockery of common sense and immigration
policy, as enshrined in law and passed by this House? This is a good
Bill. It is necessary, as those on the Opposition Front Benches
recognise, and has certainly not been brought forward in haste. If the
House divides I will vote to give the Bill a Second Reading. I hope
that all right hon. and hon. Members, wherever in the House they sit,
will do the
same.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/059D54936EB17E09ED69CD9FE75E6D92022DC4FA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2013">Tuesday

need to deal with this complex issue in a measured way. We do not need
to ramp up the rhetoric—I was struck by the contribution of the
hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) to that effect.
No one is saying that immigration is easy. It was complex for Labour in
government and mistakes were made. It will be complex for the
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats in government. However, when I look
at the Bill, I ask whether it achieves any worthy objectives, and
whether it develops and deals with the concerns of the EU, which were
mentioned by the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr
Jackson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>) because
of the pressures he faces in his constituency. Does it deal with the
problem in a way that does not increase tensions, which Labour Members
mentioned? That is what we need to test in detail when we deal with the
Bill in
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000056">Let
us look at the Bill in detail. Part 1 deals with removals. The
Opposition have supported that principle and will support it again, so
I do not wish to deal with it now, but part 2 has generated the most
discussion in the House today. My hon. Friends the Members for Hayes
and Harlington (John
McDonnell<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T18:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>), for
Lewisham East, for Sheffield Central, for Brent North (Barry Gardiner)

hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather), made extremely valid
points on the implications of part 2. I happen to believe—the
Opposition will test this in Committee—that the right of appeal
is a fundamental tenet of British values. We need to deal in Committee
with the fact that we are removing
it—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> The Home Secretary says
we are not removing the right of appeal. We are giving the right of
administrative review, but we are not currently giving a right of
appeal. If that is so important for the Home Secretary, I should tell
her, as Opposition Members have, that approximately 50% of appeals are
currently successful. If part 2 stands as drafted, without clarity of
examination, detailed discussion and the real concerns of my hon.
Friends being reflected by Members in the Committee, what will happen
to the 50% whose appeals are currently upheld? It suggests that they
will no longer be upheld. That is an issue that we want to look at in
detail in Committee to ensure that the provisions will work
effectively, but we will also want to return to the real concerns
expressed by my hon.
Friends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000057">The
provisions on landlords were supported by the hon. Members for Henley

We do not have an objection in principle, because we have
already supported similar measures on employment. But concerns were
raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy), my
hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East and the hon. Member for Brent
Central on bureaucracy, on changes in immigration status during the
course of a tenancy and the costs to landlords of implementing the
policy. While the principle 
<?notus-xml column=253?>may be good, the Committee will need to examine in detail how the policy

do we oppose the health charge in principle. It was supported by the
hon. Member for Crawley (Henry Smith), but my hon. Friend the Member
for Airdrie and Shotts (Pamela Nash) made some very pertinent
observations on it, not least of which was that health is devolved in
Scotland, as it is in my area in Wales and in Northern Ireland, but we
have had no clarity from the Government about how any charge raised
will be distributed, whether it will go to the Consolidated Fund or to
the health service or to regional Administrations. We will need to test

want to put the law squarely on the side of people who respect the law,
not those who break it. The Bill will 
<?notus-xml column=255?>deliver several important reforms to do that, cutting the number of
immigration appeal rights, enabling us to require foreign
criminals—not migrants in general—to leave the UK before
appealing, ending the abuse of article 8 and introducing important
measures to prevent illegal migrants from accessing services or the
labour market.</hs_Para>

and I am confident that when we lay out our aims, we will take Members
with us, having first tested their concerns. We want the Bill to leave
Committee and this House in good shape. As Members will know from my
previous roles and challenges, I do not think we should leave it to the

the time remaining, I shall try to deal with some of the issues raised.
A number of Members raised important points about the proposals on
health. To be clear; we are not talking about denying access to health
care. We are talking about making sure that those who have no right to
free health care have to make a contribution towards it. One of the
points raised by the hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Pamela Nash)
was about public health and access to health for HIV treatment. I
intervened on her to say that public health access will still be
available for free. What I did not remember at the time was that this
Government abolished treatment charges for HIV for overseas visitors
exactly to protect the sorts of public health concerns she
raised.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102283000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000083">We are
talking about making sure people pay a fair share. For those temporary
migrants coming to Britain either to work or to study, we will collect
the money before they come into the UK. It will go into the
Consolidated Fund, and it is well above my pay grade, Mr Deputy
Speaker, to tell colleagues in the Treasury how to do 
<?notus-xml column=256?>public spending. But if money is then distributed, any funds that go to
the NHS in England will of course be distributed to the devolved
Administrations in the usual way according to the Barnett
consequentials. I hope that that is clear. We are not proposing to
change the way in which the devolved Administrations can charge under
the overseas visitors arrangements. Those aspects of charging are of
course devolved. We will talk to the devolved administrations to make
sure that there are no unforeseen consequences from different parts of
the UK having different regimes for visitor charging.</hs_Para>

earlier in response to the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke
Newington (Ms Abbott), these are significant sums of money. She asked
my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary how much we thought was not
collected from health tourists. In the report that my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for Health published today, we say that we think
that between £20 million and £100 million is
the cost of deliberate health tourism for urgent treatment and between
£50 million and £200 million for regular visitors taking
advantage. Clearly there is a range, but this is an independent report
that has been peer-reviewed and it is the best information we have. The
hon. Lady is right; it is not a massive proportion of the overall NHS
budget but £500 million that we are not collecting is
a significant sum and it would make a real difference if we were able
to collect
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000085">The
Chair of the Select Committee, the right hon. Member for Leicester East
(Keith Vaz), made some points about landlords, and we will test those
issues in Committee. He also referred to e-Borders. He deserves a
reasonable reply since he shared the blame around with the previous
Government. We do already collect a significant amount of information
on those coming into Britain and those leaving and we are working on
improving that. I know that he will continue to question my right hon.
Friend the Home Secretary and myself when we appear in front of his
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000086">The
hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather) and I do not always
agree, but she made an important point about refugees. The reason why I
think it is important to deal with people who have no right to be in
Britain is that I want Britain to continue to be a welcoming place for
those genuinely fleeing persecution. I fundamentally believe that we
will only carry the public with us and have the public
support a system where we protect genuine refugees—those fleeing
persecution—if where we decide someone does not need our
protection, and an independent judge does not think they need
protection, those people leave the UK. By the way, we are not removing
appeal rights for those where there is a fundamental right involved. If
they abuse our hospitality by trying every trick in the book to stay
here, they are damaging the interests of genuine migrants. It is our
duty to make sure we do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000087"><B><Member ContinuationText="Pete Wishart" PimsId="4656" UID="13102283000638" xid="647" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000638">Pete

deal with caseworking errors than forcing someone through the appeals

this House takes note of European Union Document No. SEC
(2013) 370, a Statement of estimates of the Commission for 2014

at a time of ongoing economic fragility in Europe and tight constraints
on domestic public spending, it is essential that the European Union
budget reflects the consolidation efforts of Member States to bring
deficit and debt onto a more sustainable path; agrees that the
Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) agreement secured by the Prime
Minister at the February European Council represents a good deal for
taxpayers, delivering 
<?notus-xml column=261?>an unprecedented real-terms reduction of €35 billion on the

the 2014 Draft Budget respects the MFF agreement; notes that the
Commission’s proposal sees a cash reduction in payments of
around €4.5 billion compared to the current budget for 2013; and
calls on the Government to continue its efforts to limit the size of
the Budget by pressing for further savings, particularly in
administration, in order to get the best deal for UK
taxpayers.<I>—(Mr

more about the reasoned opinion process, let me summarise the
Government’s view on the EPPO proposal. The House will be aware
of our long-standing position in the coalition agreement not to
participate in the establishment of any EPPO, and the details of the
proposal serve only to reinforce that position. While of course fraud
must be tackled at all levels, including when it involves funds that

abundantly clear in the coalition agreement in advance of the proposals

the Commission’s published measure in our debate next week on
the in-principle decision as to whether the UK should opt in. That is

start by thanking the Minister for setting out the Government’s
approach to the draft regulation. There is considerable history to the
idea of an EPPO. Back in 2002, the European Scrutiny Committee
scrutinised the 2001 Green Paper in which the European Commission first
proposed the idea of establishing the EPPO. It found that
the EPPO was unnecessary, particularly given the existence of Eurojust.
It also identified a number of concerns, such as the combination of
prosecution and investigative functions; the power of the EPPO to
commit a person for trial and determine the location of that
trial; the creation of differing standards of criminal responsibility
for fraud depending on whether it related to the Community’s
financial interests; the lack of democratic accountability for the
prosecution function; the breach of the subsidiarity principle; and the
dilution of member states’ responsibility for the prosecution of
fraud<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:29:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000458" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000458">The
prospect of a specialist EU prosecution authority has been raised again
since then and was one of a range of initiatives that the Commission
considered in 2011. Again, the European Scrutiny Committee investigated
those initiatives. In 2011 the Committee echoed its 2002 concerns and
cautioned against the “inappropriate and unacceptable”
use of national criminal justice systems in acting against crimes
against EU
finances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000459"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:29:46"></hs_TimeCode>The
Opposition believe that this proposal seeks to address a real problem.
Chapter 1 of the 15th report of the European Scrutiny Committee, to
which the motion refers, makes it clear that the levels of suspected
fraud against the EU budget are estimated by the Commission to have
been around €500 million, or £425 million, in each of the
last three years. That is clearly unacceptable and should be condemned
by all Members of the House. We should of course seek new ways to
ensure that that fraud, which costs us all as British taxpayers, can be
stopped and the perpetrators are brought to justice.</hs_Para>

as we repeatedly made clear when we were in government, we do not
believe that an EPPO is the solution to these problems. We agree with
the European Scrutiny Committee’s recommendation that the EPPO
proposal breaches the subsidiarity principle and that a national-level
approach, supported by existing EU mechanisms, would be more
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000461">Although
the Labour Government signed the Lisbon treaty, which enables the
creation of an EPPO, we argued in government that we were consistently
against the formation of the office and put in place measures to
“double lock” against its creation. The double lock we
secured ensured, first, that the UK would have to opt in; and secondly,
that even if a future Government were to opt in, they would still need
unanimity, which is retained for any decision to establish a prosecutor
or 
<?notus-xml column=266?>extend its powers. As the Lord President of the Council at the time, the

in government we put in place a system in which an opt-in procedure
applies. Parliament could let its views be known and the Government
could put forward their proposals. The Government would then, if they

the discussions and determine by unanimity if they did not wish to

the following: that the creation of an EPPO is not the appropriate
response to tackling EU fraud; that for participating member states the
proposal will transfer responsibility for tackling fraud against the EU
budget away from national-level decision making and towards a
supranational authority whose European delegated prosecutors would have
to prioritise EU fraud above other crime at a national level; that it
is a flawed approach for member states not to be able to determine
their national priorities, and the consequent use of resources, in
tackling crime; that the EPPO would disrupt the current system for
tackling fraud against the EU budget at a time where the Commission has
reported two consecutive years of decrease in fraudulent and other
irregularities affecting the EU budget and their estimated financial
impact; that the proposed EPPO system would result in a duplication of
established national-level efforts, including specific bodies, to
protect member states and EU financial interests, including work
against organised crime; that the best way to tackle fraud is through
prevention, as reflected in the UK’s zero-tolerance approach to
all fraud, which it takes “extremely seriously” and which
has resulted in low levels of fraud, and by using robust management
controls and payment systems and requiring all agencies with
responsibility for distributing EU funds to have processes in place to
monitor and report fraud; and that creation of the office would cause a
shift from prevention to reaction after crimes have been committed, as
it would make each member state less responsible for anti-fraud work at
a national level</hs_Para>

has appeared for some time that the Government have been putting
internal party management and coalition horse-trading ahead of crime

to tackle youth unemployment, and it has had nothing to do with the
national interest—it has all been about managing the divisions

expect the UK to play its part as an EU member state in co-operating as

that there is a thin end of the wedge argument in that the proposal

the specific acknowledgement in the coalition agreement that

there is a problem. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:39:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull North rightly said, it is estimated that there
is a vast amount of fraud against the European budget—some
€500 million a year—and that is unacceptable. National
law enforcement against that is fragmented across the member states.
While the UK may have a robust record on tackling it, that is not
always true of all member states. In fact, only one in five of the
cases transferred by the European anti-fraud
office—OLAF—to the national prosecution authorities leads
to a conviction, and those conviction rates vary considerably among
member states. There is, therefore, a problem that needs to be
tackled<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I
accept what the Minister has said about improvements to OLAF,
but the European Commission and European Union authorities
also need to take a more proactive stance against EU budget
fraud. I do not think, however, that a European public
prosecutor’s office is the solution at this
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:40:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000475">The
Commission’s proposal has an additional problem, in that it
suggests locating the EPPO in Eurojust, but that would seriously muddy
the waters of the role of Eurojust, which is a very effective and
important organisation. I am pleased that the coalition has agreed
that, with certain reforms, we should opt into it. Eurojust is
important in stimulating investigation and co-operation on judicial and
prosecutorial matters. The impetus for it emerged after
9/11, when the importance of tackling cross-border terrorism was made
very clear. It helps European authorities to tackle serious organised
crime, people trafficking, drug trafficking, the smuggling
of illegal immigrants, illicit trade in human organs, kidnapping,
trafficking works of art and computer crime. The list goes on and on
and it is a very good example of how European Union institutions help
us to tackle cross-border crime in a way that would be impossible for
27 different countries trying to co-operate on a bilateral
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Alan Beith</B> (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</Member> I would like to join
the hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins) in giving credit where
credit is due. This debate is taking place on the basis of the report
and reasoned opinion of the European Scrutiny Committee. The Government
agree with that reasoned opinion, but it is very much that of the
Committee. In my capacity as Chairman of the Liaison Committee and the
Justice Committee, I think that the European Scrutiny Committee is
entitled to the credit. If there is something wrong with our procedure,
it is that it does not fully recognise that process. However, the
outcome is a happy one because pretty well everybody agrees that the
reasoned opinion is correct, and it accords with the
Government’s
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:44:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

for a European public prosecutor offends against the subsidiarity
principle. One of its primary objectives is to strengthen the
protection of the European Union’s financial interests. That is
a perfectly reasonable objective to pursue, but it does not have to be
achieved through the creation of a European public prosecutor. Indeed,
it would not necessarily be best achieved in that way.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:45:19"></hs_TimeCode> other limb
of the general argument in favour of the European public prosecutor is
that it is a further development of the area of justice. That provides
the hint that subsidiarity is in danger of going out the
window.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000485">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:49:47"></hs_TimeCode>
are many ways in which the European Union could improve how it deals
with fraud. If national Governments fail to take the actions that they
should take, they should be shamed into doing so.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:45:46"></hs_TimeCode> also have to
be a little careful about using percentage figures on the success of
prosecutions. There is considerable danger if anybody thinks that the
target of a justice system is to have 100% success in prosecutions.
Courts will sometimes find people not guilty because the evidence has
not been brought forward or sustained. The 100% target is a rather
dangerous principle to import into this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:46:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000486" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000486">It
is often pointed out that the European Union could do a lot more to
resist fraud if it designed its schemes and its disbursement of money
in ways that lent themselves to fraud a great deal less. Nothing is
fraud-proof, but schemes can be designed that are less susceptible to
fraud than many of those that have been developed over the years by
European
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:46:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

It would have a similar effect on the roles of the procurator fiscal
and the Lord Advocate in Scotland. The proposal would ignore the
deliberate separation of decisions on investigation from decisions to
prosecute in England and Wales, which is a long-standing element of our
system. We can argue about whether that barrier should be retained, but
we should have that argument in the context of our legal system and not
allow it to be forced on us by the introduction of the European public

in which European nations use the European Union to achieve highly
desirable objectives, such as through co-operating to deal with
international crime. An intrinsic problem with the way in which the
European Union was constructed, which is quite understandable given the
way in which it was constructed, is that there is a belief in the
Commission that the way forward is always to create further powers and
jurisdictions. We have created a system that has that element within
it. However, those who worry about Britain’s membership of the

hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) pointed out that
there is a close relationship between this proposal and the issue of
Eurojust. Unhelpfully, it would compromise the acceptability of
Eurojust to many people if the European public prosecutor was located
within Eurojust. There are other aspects of interrelationship between
the two issues. I regard Eurojust as an extremely valuable institution
that has many processes that are of great advantage to British
citizens. It has an important role in the prevention and detection of
crime against British citizens and British interests. But again, even
within the Eurojust proposals that we will be looking at again shortly,
the role of the national members of Eurojust in the Commission’s
proposal to order investigative measures changes the relationship
between law enforcement and prosecution that is so firmly a part of our
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T19:50:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000493">There

European Commission proposal to establish the European public
prosecutor’s office has been around for quite some time. I can
remember as a Member of the European Parliament being stuck in a debate
in the early 2000s listening to a fantastic German lady, Diemut Theato,
who I think was the head of OLAF for a short period of time and then my
chair of the Committee of Budgetary Control, argue vociferously for the
office of European public prosecutor and everything that goes with it.
This new regulation, however, would create a slightly different
beast—it has morphed even since then. This would be a new EU
body with a head, the European public prosecutor, and at least four
deputies, with powers to conduct investigations and prosecutions in
member states against people suspected of crimes against the EU
budget—fraud. I heard the Minister say that there will be a
further debate next week and I look forward to speaking in it, if I am
called. . However, if I may, I would like to spend a few seconds on

against the EU budget. There is an interesting question about what
constitutes a crime against the EU budget and how that would be
defined. They will have exclusive

possible creation of the EPPO is enabled via the Lisbon Treaty, and I
recognise the work of the previous Government to ensure that we were
not swept up at that time. It can be created through this new
regulation, but we are not bound by it: we can choose to opt in thanks
to the justice and home affairs arrangement. However, the Lisbon treaty
actually discusses the public prosecutor’s power being extended
to other serious cross-border crime, such as computer crime, money
laundering and a host of others. In itself, that could make the EPPO
more powerful than even the FBI, and it would hold the power to
investigate and prosecute in nation states. That looks like the
creation of a federal European criminal justice agency, which is not
something that anybody in Britain would like to
see.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000500" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000500">The

three aspects to why the European Scrutiny Committee says that the EPPO
does not comply with subsidiarity, and I think they are worth
highlighting. First, the European Commission has not adequately
considered options for alternative means for improving the fight
against fraud, such as preventive measures at the point EU funds are
given out—that point was well made by the Chairman of the
Justice Committee. Secondly, the Commission has not waited to see the
impact of the proposed new directive on criminal offences and sanctions
relating to fraud against the EU budget—indeed, I
believe that that directive has not yet been properly agreed, so
perhaps we are putting the cart before the horse on this occasion.
Thirdly, the Commission used questionable data and flawed assumptions
when assessing the proposal, such as unreliable convictions data from
member states—it is questionable how much money the prosecutor
would get back, and no one knows how the figure in the proposal was
reached.</hs_Para>

hon. and hon. Members for their contributions. This has been a useful
debate, and from what we have heard it is clear that the House supports
the motion before us, and identifies that there is an issue of
subsidiarity with the Commission’s proposal for a European
public prosecutor’s office. As I said at the outset, this is a
matter for Parliament and not the Government. Therefore, in the light
of the mood of the House this evening, I hope that the European
Scrutiny Committee will take this issue and work with other interested
parties in Parliament, the House and the other place, and make best use
of their contacts with other national Parliaments in that regard, given
the interest and focus that I know are being directed to this proposal
by Parliaments around the EU.</hs_Para>

seriously in ensuring that public are properly protected against
organised criminality that crosses borders. I will not detain the House
because this is a matter for another day, but it is
interesting that the Labour Government negotiated the right to exercise
the 2014 block opt-out—she described the 2014 decision as an
untested approach. From her comments, I can only assume that the
previous Government had no intention of exercising that right and
therefore of seeking to provide those protections—it was a
sham.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000511" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000511">The

Government website trying to provide the service, offer to provide a
notional service—form filling—and then charge a premium

for a website to fill in his passport form, only to discover that he
still had to pay £72.50 for the actual cost of the passport.
David from Kidderminster tried to apply for a driving licence online,
filling in a form that he believed was his application, but the website
just checked the information and sent him the typed-out completed form
to send off to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, and charged him
£50 to do so. It did not even pay for the stamp! This website
was a little more helpful, however, as it advertised a number that
could be used to complain about how misleading the site was, but of
course he discovered that it was a premium rate telephone

the worst example of abuse by intermediary websites is the case of a

according to the House of Commons Library, there is nothing preventing
a business from offering services that provide assistance with official

law does not make them illegal, even if they are utterly worthless. In
my view, they are utterly pointless and simply seek to take advantage
of consumers by putting themselves higher up the search page results
than the official website. We are all caught out by this. We in the
House of Commons, of all people, must be more aware of how Government

misleading attempt to take money from a consumer. As we have heard, a
proper site will end with the gov.uk suffix, an ending reserved for
genuine official Government websites. Similarly, the intermediary sites
are required to carry a disclaimer 
<?notus-xml column=278?>saying that they are not official sites. They all seem to have them.
Generally, they will be found right at the bottom of a fairly long page

news, as I alluded to earlier, is that the search engines broadly
speaking agree with this. Google, in anticipation of this debate, sent
me some advice on how it is already tackling the issue and it is worth
sharing this with the House. Google has what it calls a “sale of
free items policy”, which states that Google only allows the
promotion of sites that charge for services associated with products or
services that may be otherwise available for free as long as a number
of disclosures are presented together prominently above the fold on the
landing pages. I will share the four items it talked
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000538" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000538">The
first is that the site clearly states whether the advertiser is
affiliated or not affiliated with the Government official source or
free source; secondly, that the site discloses that the product,
services or forms are available from the Government official source or
free source either for free, where applicable, or at a lower cost than
the advertiser charges; thirdly, that the site must describe the
additional services offered that are available from the
Government official source or free source—this is the
value proposition—and that advertisers should not misrepresent
the value that they add by highlighting features or services available
from the official source for free; finally, that the ads and landing
pages cannot promote services that provide little or no additional
value to the user beyond the original official online automated
application
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000539">It
is helpful that some of the search engines do have a clear policy but
it is still the case that the consumer’s eye will inevitably be

paid-for ad slot, it must be an official
website.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000540">What
makes this so offensive is that the Government websites are already
ours as a society. We as citizens have a stake in our Government. We as
taxpayers already own these sites amongst us all. When one of these
bogus service providers gets between the consumer and the website, they
are getting in the way of something that is already ours by right. They
are charging us for something we already own, for a service we are
entitled to at the basic cost.</hs_Para>

free enterprise. If there is an opportunity for an entrepreneur to make
a living and it is a legal activity, I wish him good luck and every
encouragement. If there is a genuine need for help to fill in
Government forms because they are so unfathomably complex and a website
advertises itself as providing a service where one is
needed—which could of course include payment 
<?notus-xml column=279?>by PayPal—with ample disclaimers and no attempt to look like the
official website, I think it is reasonable that the need be met. If it
fills a need, it will be
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000542">But
these websites depend on two things—winning the search engine
optimisation battle and paying for the paid-for clicks, and for the
consumer to think that they have found the official website they are
looking for. The solution could be very simple indeed. In the first
instance, it seems perfectly reasonable for the Government to come to
an agreement with the search engine providers to ensure that if there
is a service being searched with responses that have .gov.uk suffix,
that website is placed right at the top of the search results in the
No. 1 slot and at the head of the paid-for ad slot. In that way, every
search will present the genuine official website first and the consumer
will not find themselves being led to a wrong or a bogus site. Indeed,
the search engines have already made headway on this. I spent a bit of
time this afternoon checking and the .gov.uk sites seem to be at the
top of the unpaid-for ads, but they are still in the fourth
slot.</hs_Para>

problem persist and these bogus or dubious websites continue, it seems
reasonable that a value test be put against these sites. If the site
can prove that it is doing a reasonable and useful job, it should be
allowed to compete against the Government on a service basis. After
all, if people feel they need to spend the extra money to unravel a
complex form or to pay using PayPal, it is important that the
Government receive the message that they need to up their game in the
service they are providing. But it is desirable for the Government to
strive to provide an exemplary service to taxpayers in closing the
opportunity to alternative providers of Government services. But should
this problem persist and we continue to see people being duped into
using these sites, even after the Government have done everything they
can to reduce any chance of a value proposition for these misleading
websites, surely a well policed outright ban must be
considered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102283000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/debtext/131022-0004.htm#13102283000544">We
are well into the internet age and, as we develop the service that has
now become a basic necessity of life, it is right that we should
question and push back against some of the more unsavoury and
opportunistic parts of the internet. Search engines are doing their
bit, but it is vital that the Government should protect consumers from
cynical and unscrupulous attempts to turn a profit while they are
attempting to use services that are ours anyway. I am grateful to the
Minister for his attention this late in the evening, and I look forward
to hearing his comments on how we can resolve the

hon. Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) on securing the
debate and on the way in which he presented his argument. I thought he
was rather self-effacing about the importance of the debate. This is
one of the better attended Adjournment debates that I have taken part
in, and the keen interest of Radio Hereford and Worcester has also been
noted. This is an issue that strikes a chord; none of us wants to 
<?notus-xml column=280?>see our constituents being ripped off. He powerfully highlighted the
difficulties, and in some cases the distress, that some users of online
services have experienced as a result of the activities of some
third-party websites providing access to Government services, often at
a significant mark-up while providing little or no additional
value.</hs_Para>

is an important issue, and it becomes even more important because of
its context. As my hon. Friend will know, the Government are extremely
ambitious to deliver more services online and to encourage more of our
citizens and constituents to access services in that way, as set out in
the Government’s digital strategy. Quite simply, we want the
public to receive services that are simple, fast and clear and that can
be accessed easily at times and in ways that suit them. We want to take
full advantage of the digital opportunities. It will also please
colleagues to hear that this will allow us to produce better services
at a much lower cost. It is worth placing on record that the Government
saved £500 million last year on digital and technology-related
expenditure while making improvements to how people access information
and
services.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:21:55"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

is much to celebrate in the progress that we are making in building
world-class digital services in this country, and we are ambitious to
work with the private sector and civil society to help the 11 million
people in the UK who are still digitally excluded to get online and
close that gap.
Given<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:22:16"></hs_TimeCode> that
context, and that ambition, it is really important that we should not
allow fraud to undermine the trust in, and integrity of, the systems
and services that we are presenting. Concerns about security and the
potential for identity theft, confusion about which websites are
trustworthy and fears about being ripped off all act as deterrents to
the take-up of digital services, so this does matter to us and I thank

abuse of access to Government services can take a range of forms, all
of which can have a negative impact on confidence. They include: brand
abuse, in which Government logos are used to imply affiliation with, or
endorsement by, the Government or their agencies; phishing, when
attempts are made to acquire information such as usernames, passwords,
credit card details and other useful personal information by
masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication;
and levying additional charges for access via third-party websites to
Government services that are, in some cases, normally free. The

some Government services are more impacted by this problem than others.
Services that tend to involve one-off transactions, or those that
citizens and businesses use only infrequently, tend to be the ones that
third-party websites offer access to. Such services include passport

complication is that the infrequency of use means that users of
services provided by central Government Departments and their agencies
are not necessarily familiar with the look and feel of those services
online. The wide demographic base of the users of those services also
limits the impact of a broad-based communication and education
approach, in itself an expensive proposition. That does not make the
problem insurmountable, nor does it mean that education about the best
way to access Government services should not be part of our approach to
tackling the problem. However, it does mean that we should seek
creative ways of doing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-22T20:24:56"></hs_TimeCode>, such as
through the use of partners in the private and civil society

second complication is the difficulty we have in categorising the
activities of some of the websites we have been discussing as bad or
misleading. In 2012, as my hon. Friend will know, the Office of Fair
Trading conducted an investigation into the online commercial practices
relating to Government services and concluded that it was not
appropriate to take formal enforcement action. The investigation did
not reveal widespread attempts by non-Government websites to
misrepresent their affiliation with Government. Moreover, the OFT was
of the view that the overall depiction of the sites investigated,
including branding, colouring and images, did not create a misleading
impression that they were official Government websites. In particular,
many of the sites carried statements explaining the nature of the
service provided and disclaiming any official status or affiliation
with the Government.</hs_Para>

of the sites subject to the complaints to which my hon. Friend referred
tend to be those that, as he said, feature in search engine-sponsored
ad spots. Search engines tend to highlight and prominently display such
ads above the search results that are most relevant to the search terms
that have been used and in general Government services that are
accessible via gov.uk, the new single Government website for all

are the Government doing about misleading third-party websites? The

do not think at this stage that legislation is the way to resolve the

complacent, but it means that any action we take should be
proportionate. Frankly, we need more information about how and why

Service have proposed, and Departments have agreed to, a
cross-Government approach to tackling and tracking the problem. That
will result in a clearer view of the scale of the issue, which
currently appears to affect a small proportion of service users.
Further action will depend on the scale and seriousness of the problems
reported. That will also guide our engagement with the search engines

HMRC shut down 841 rogue sites and in 2012-13, it shut down 560.

Ministers in the Home Office have made great progress in the last three
and a half years in tackling the problems with our immigration system
and the atrocious legacy inherited from Labour. One of the biggest
concerns for my constituents is immigration controls. In fact, in the
run-up to the last general election and during the election in 2010, it
was the No. 1 issue raised with me in my constituency—the issue
on which my constituents were pressing for action. That is not
surprising, because it is a rural constituency in the east of England,
so it has many issues with seasonal agricultural workers and migrants
coming in. My constituents wanted, and are eager to see, a wide range
of effective reforms and policies put in place to keep our borders
secure and the public
safe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000008">In
this debate, I want to draw attention to a number of issues,
particularly the ongoing consequences of Labour’s previous
failures; cases from my constituency in which the immigration system
has not worked effectively; the need for further reforms to remove
foreign criminals, prisoners and terrorists; reforms to human rights
laws; EU immigration, the free movement directive and transitional
controls on Bulgaria and Romania; and the need to ensure that we have
an immigration system that, importantly, lets in wealth creators,
entrepreneurs and people who will make a positive contribution to this
country, while preventing from coming in, and removing, those who
should not be
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000009">We
can appreciate what the current Government have already done to deal
with many of the problems in our immigration system and understand what
more needs to be done only by understanding what went wrong with the
previous system under the Labour Government. The Minister is fully
aware of the past and the appalling legacy left by the Labour
Government, and no doubt continues to deal daily with many of the
consequences, 
<?notus-xml column=2?>such as the backlog of cases and appeals. It is a fact that immigration
controls were ineffective. Immigration numbers had spiralled out of all
proportion. Transitional controls had not been placed on the A8
countries when they joined the EU. Of course, Labour passed the Human
Rights Act 1998, which gave illegal immigrants, foreign criminals and
many taxpayer-funded lawyers new excuses to block deportation. We are
still living with many of the consequences of that on a daily
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000010">Three
quarters of the new jobs created in the UK economy after 1997 went to
people born overseas, and of course a monumental backlog of asylum
cases had built up. Almost 500,000 asylum cases, which the previous
Government failed to process in an effective manner, accumulated and,
as we now know, the figures were massaged to reduce the backlog, rather
than people being sent home in an effective way. Of course, we now know
that there were not effective systems of control over management or

asylum seeker from Albania in 2002, applied to extend his leave to

never be forgotten that under the previous Government so many
cases—too many—were left unresolved. It has been
estimated that in total, more than 3 million immigrants came to live in
Britain during Labour’s time in office, and illegal immigrants
could add another million to that. In Labour’s 1997 manifesto,

Office for National Statistics has estimated that the UK’s
population, which is currently about 63 million, could reach as much as
75 million by 2035, with two thirds of that increase arising out of the
consequences of immigration. In my county of Essex, between 2004 and
2012, the estimated number of non-UK-born residents increased from
69,000, which was 5% of the population, to 104,000, which is over 7.5%
of the population. Across the UK in the same period, the number of
non-UK-born residents rose from 5.2 million, which is the equivalent of
9% of the population, in 2004 to nearly 7.7 million in 2012, which is

is not the only cause of pressure on our public services, housing and
infrastructure, but of course it is a factor that cannot be ignored.
The previous Government tried to shut down debate on this issue, but it
is valid for the Government today to have this discussion. That
reflects the fact that the current Government deserve credit for their
commitment to addressing these problems. Conservative Ministers can be
proud of the actions that they have already taken to regain control of
the broken immigration system. Net migration is down by one third. It
is heading closer to the Government’s target, which is to bring
it below 100,000 by 2015. The number of immigrants coming to Britain is
at its lowest level since 2001. Interestingly, under the previous
Conservative Government, between 1991 and 1997, the inflow of migrants
to the UK ranged between 266,000 and 329,000—a modest
level—with annual net migration not exceeding 77,000, but after
that, under Labour, inward migration increased year on year, in five of
the next six years, from 391,000 in 1998 to 589,000 in 2004. It stayed
above half a million until last
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000018">The
UK Border Agency, one of the most poorly performing and discredited
Government agencies, is being abolished and replaced. Bogus colleges
have been exposed and student visa abuses tackled. New controls on the
family migration route to tackle sham marriages—quite
rightly—and to protect vulnerable people have been introduced
and are welcome. The new Immigration Bill goes further and does more to
control our borders and immigration flows. I welcome the measures, as
my constituents do, to make it more difficult for illegal immigrants to
come to Britain and live in this country. There is also the
contribution that temporary migrants will be required to make to the

earlier, immigrants are entrepreneurs and business people, and
immigration touches on the skills agenda—another issue we could
debate for a long time. Where people make a positive contribution, we
should find the best routes—the right routes—to make them
welcome and support them in visa applications and so on. We must be
proactive on that front, but we can only

the devastation left by the Labour Government was so great that we
cannot overestimate the scale of the challenges faced by the Government

Labour’s legacy can still be seen across the country. I am sure
that many hon. and right hon. Members see cases in their constituencies
involving immigrants who have been deemed to have no right to remain in
the UK, but, quite wrongly, pursue every legal avenue to remain here.
In my constituency, there have been cases of immigrants who have
outstayed their welcome. Such cases demonstrate the systemic failures
of the controls put in place under the previous Government. I could
reel off many cases, but I have a couple that I would like to
highlight.</hs_Para>

the Philippines was granted permission to enter the country in 2006 on
a 48-month work permit to work in a care home. Since then, her husband,
family and children, who have gone to local schools, have all come
over. Of course, once the visa expired and she was asked to leave,
little action was taken, so the family remain in the UK. Last summer,
the case was brought to my attention and an appeal to remain in the UK
was rejected. To avoid deportation, the family lodged a further
application to remain in the UK on human rights grounds in January this
year, which was refused in June. The case is now going on and on. In
July, they lodged another appeal, which is still pending. If that
appeal is rejected, the family may undertake another appeal and prolong
the process even more. Surely that cannot be right.</hs_Para>

in my constituency that has been ongoing for years involves a family
from Nigeria who are here without any right to remain. They were
informed that they should leave the UK two years ago, but they, too,
embarked on a series of applications and appeals. Such actions are all
about delay and prolonging the process for people who have no right
whatever to remain in the country. That undermines public confidence in
the immigration system. A stop must be put to repeated applications and
appeals.</hs_Para>

delay. Once someone has lost their case or appeal, unless there are
genuinely exceptional circumstances, there is no reason why they should
not leave voluntarily or be deported, if that has to be done, within a
couple of weeks. They should certainly not be here for a prolonged
period. That would obviously restore public confidence in the system
and send a powerful signal to those who have abused the system. It
would send a message that Britain is not a soft touch and will take
tough action.</hs_Para>

welcome the approach that will be taken to deporting foreign criminals
before their appeals are held. I ask the Minister to consider extending
that approach to other persons staying in the UK illegally and involved
in repeat applications and appeals. An aspect of immigration controls
that greatly concerns my 
<?notus-xml column=5?>constituents and the wider public is the way in which foreign offenders,
prisoners and terrorists are able to remain in the country, despite the
overt threat they pose to public safety and national security. The Abu
Qatada case is symbolic of the wider problem with immigration controls
and human rights laws: judicial activism and judgments
from Europe that, frankly, undermine this country.
We should be able to remove the likes of Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who
killed a 12-year-old girl, and serial Somali criminals Abdisamad Adow
Sufi and Abdiaziz Ibrahim Elmi, without the courts and human rights
laws interfering and our courts being lectured on what we should be
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000027">Killers,
sex offenders, violent criminals, persistent offenders and supporters
of terrorists should face the automatic expectation of deportation.
They should not expect to be protected by the ridiculous
interpretations of human rights laws that the European Court of Human
Rights, and sometimes even our own courts, provide. We should have a
prison-to-plane approach, whereby foreign national offenders who have
served custodial sentences are removed. When they leave prison, they
should be taken to an airport and deported at the earliest opportunity.
My constituents and the British public would feel greatly reassured if
they knew that such dangerous criminals were not able to set foot again
in our country and their communities. I welcome the fact that the
Government are taking the matter seriously; that is shown in the way
that they are initiating deportation proceedings sooner. As a result,
the average time taken to remove a foreign national offender following
the completion of a custodial sentence was lowered to 77
days in 2011. We still have 11,000 foreign national offenders in our
prisons and thousands more who avoid custodial
sentences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000028">The

foreign nationals who are subject to deportation orders are still in
the country. Shockingly, that includes 2,300 people who have been on
the list for more than a year, 25 of whom have been here for more than
10 years. Every day, hard-working British taxpayers are left to pick up
the hefty bill for legal costs and other expenses for those
individuals. We must put an end to it, and if that means going further
on the Human Rights Act 1998, reforming the European convention on
human rights and taking unilateral action to defend parliamentary
sovereignty from European judicial activism, my constituents and the
British public would expect nothing less from a Conservative Government
acting in the national
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000029">I
urge the Minister and his colleagues in the Ministry of Justice to look
at ways to deport European prisoners to their countries to serve their
sentences. As he is aware, the Council of Europe convention on the
transfer of sentenced persons enables European national prisoners to be
deported to serve their sentences in the country of their nationality,
but unfortunately, it is a voluntary agreement. There are 4,000 or so
European national prisoners in our jails, but only 138 applications
were received in 2011, with 127 being referred to other jurisdictions
for consideration. The numbers being deported under the convention are
too small. In 2007, 111 prisoners were deported, but that number is
declining and has since dropped, meaning that not even 1% of European
national prisoners serve their sentences in their own countries.
Slightly more than 1,000 foreign national offenders from the European
economic area were deported 
<?notus-xml column=6?>in 2011. I hope that the Minister will make that issue a priority in his

final aspect of immigration controls I shall raise relates to
immigration from Europe. The free movement of goods and peoples is an
important principle of the European Union, but the unrestricted access
given  to European nationals has added significantly to our
population and the strain on public services. Of the 2.7
million residents in this country who were born in other EU countries,
1.1 million are estimated to have been born in those countries that
joined the EU since 2004. In 2003, more than 500,000 nationals from
other EU countries and 50,000 from countries about to join in 2004 were
employed in the UK. By 2011, that number more than doubled to 1.29

intake of member states and more than 500,000 from the pre-2004
accession.</hs_Para>

that, there are an estimated 600,000 economically inactive EU nationals
in the UK, many of whom will be accessing public services and benefits.
This morning, I read that one in 25 people claiming jobseeker’s

public services is clearly enormous. Meanwhile, child benefit is being

right that our country faces an uphill battle, and legal action with
Europe, to reduce some of the benefits being paid to EU nationals. I
encourage the Minister and the Government to consider how we can
renegotiate the position with Europe to bring common sense and sanity
to our immigration controls, so that they do not prevent the working of
the free market but enable us to limit immigration, prevent abuses of
free movement rights and remove those who should not be here and are
pushing the boundaries by accessing benefits and public
services.</hs_Para>

the Minister to take firm action on European national criminals. I also
urge him to consider the transitional controls on Romanian and
Bulgarian immigrants. The transitional controls are due to expire at
the end of this year. First, immigration is about sustainability, and
Britain cannot sustain or cope with a large influx from eastern Europe.
Secondly, criminal gangs are an issue that is well documented; the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) read out the list of countries. In
the last 10 days, we have seen reports of Romanian criminal gangs
committing crimes. They are flying into some of our airports daily. The
experience of the last decade has led the public to feel anxious about
new waves of immigration. This is an opportunity for the Government to

anyone that more action is needed to establish an immigration system
that is finally fit for purpose and has public confidence. The
Government are taking the right steps towards creating a system of
controls that enables wealth creators and entrepreneurs—those
who want to make a positive contribution—to come to our country,
as well as tourists, whom we invite, while keeping out people who
should not be here. Once the excellent new Immigration Bill has gone
through Parliament, I trust he and his ministerial colleagues will
continue to focus on strengthening  our immigration controls
and taking action to secure our borders. As I have stated throughout
this debate,  we must send out positive messages to those whom
we should welcome to this country and, importantly, reassure
hard-pressed British taxpayers that we are fixing the broken system. We
should give the public confidence in the immigration
system.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/D9EC2039B19EE5FA74D87BA7D702656BB59170C1" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2013">Tuesday

Field</B> (Cities of London and Westminster) (Con):</Member> It says
much about 21st-century Britain that my hon. Friend the Member for
Witham (Priti Patel) should have introduced this debate. Although I am
a proud Englishman, that is only part of my story. My late mother was
twice a refugee by age 15, having been born during the early months of
the war in Breslau, or Wroclaw, in what was then Germany and is now
Poland. By age 15 she ended up in West Germany, where a few years later
she met my father, who was serving in the British Army. Immigration has
had an impact on me, given that one of my parents was an immigrant to
this country, and both my hon. Friend’s parents were immigrants
to this country. We love this country and the opportunities that it has
given us. Despite much of what she said, we do not necessarily see
immigration simply as a problem; it has some very positive sides. It is
important that those elements are put on the record from time to time
as well, and I shall endeavour to do so in my contribution.</hs_Para>

to hear the mantra that net migration has been cut by a third. It has
become a key campaigning tool in recent months for the Conservative
party, and it will no doubt be heralded as one of the
Government’s central achievements as we approach the 2015
general election. Undoubtedly, important work has been
done  
<?notus-xml column=8?>to crack down on some obvious immigration abuses, and rightly, as trust
in the whole immigration system has reached an all-time low among our
fellow Britons.</hs_Para>

Government should be applauded for the work that they have done to
clamp down on bogus colleges, sham marriages, fake students, health
tourists and the like. I noticed only this morning that my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State for Health rightly announced that we
should not become an international health service. We should be proud
that the NHS is free at the point of delivery. I have been an MP for
central London for the past 12 years, and I have no doubt that health
tourism has become increasingly acute in some areas, such as Paddington
in my constituency. My constituents are suffering, and hard-working
individuals’ taxes are not being used for their own
purposes.</hs_Para>

Government have also been striving to address some of the pull factors
that have hitherto made the UK such an appealing destination for those
who wish to abuse generous western welfare and benefit systems.
Nevertheless, we should be wary of the notion that the imposition of a
cap alone and a broader clampdown mean job done on immigration. For all
the talk about the squeeze on numbers, all too many Britons experience
a different daily reality on the streets where they live and read a
different story in their newspapers. Meanwhile, precisely the type of
person whom we seek to attract to our nation—successful business
people, entrepreneurs, investors, the highly skilled, top students and
high-spending tourists—have encountered great difficulties
entering the UK, just as we have been rightly discussing the need to
compete in the global race. I fear that the disparity between the
headline figures and reality is breeding ever more cynicism while doing
economic
damage.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13102256000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000115">I

with new migration broadly. As long ago as January 2007, I led a debate
in the House of Commons on the possible impact on London of the
accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union. In particular,
I sought to increase funding to Westminster City council, which was,
even at that stage, being overburdened by the significant increase in
rough sleeping, crime and antisocial behaviour following the 2004
accession of the so-called A8 countries, such as Poland and the Czech
Republic.</hs_Para>

the things of which I warned at the time have come to pass as Romania
and Bulgaria edged closer to fully fledged EU membership. Many of us
have seen at first hand the Roma gypsy encampments that have sprung up
around Marble Arch; others appeared in the vicinity of Victoria station
during last year’s Olympics. Some of the people living in those
encampments were part of an organised begging operation, deliberately
targeting the lucrative west end tourist market in the Marble Arch
area. That encampment has since become merely the most visible example
of a growing problem, with similar camps appearing outside the Imperial
War museum—south of the river, near the constituency of 
<?notus-xml column=9?>the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)—and around the 9/11

I am receiving, and continue to receive, weekly reports from
exasperated constituents who find spontaneous bedrooms in the doorways
of their homes, as well as litter, excrement and worse in garden
squares. There is also the issue of constituents and tourists who come
into central London being harassed by aggressive beggars daily. Some
local residents have even witnessed such issues in broad daylight. The
people living in those eyesore encampments have, in my view, no
intention of legally exercising their treaty rights to be here.
Nevertheless, due to international treaties, particularly the
EU-related treaties, they are incredibly difficult to remove, as the

shores as well as in other parts of the Union within a matter of weeks

the perceived complexity of the UK visa system. I know that we will get
some improvements, but there will still be that perception about time
lags. It deters high-value business investors, visitors and workers.

the evidence of reciprocal negativity that we see in elements of a
bureaucratic, tick-box culture in the UKBA and the Home Office. It is a

Julian Huppert</B> (Cambridge) (LD):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mr Crausby, and to follow the hon. Member for
Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field). I agree with many of his
concerns about what our policies are doing and about many people being
put off from applying to come here. The issue is not only the facts of

me give my assessment. I think that legal immigration has a substantial
benefit financially and in the generation of jobs. We also benefit
culturally from people coming here and bringing an international
mixture, as we saw in the fantastic sporting achievements in the
Olympics of 
<?notus-xml column=13?>people who have not, or whose families have not, been here their entire
lives. We in this country benefit from
immigration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000068">We
need a system that works, that is fair and fast, and that discriminates
accurately between people coming here legally and those trying to break
the rules, but that is not happening. The Government must actively
promote our country to the world to encourage people who would benefit
the UK to come here—we have seen a bit of that in relation to
China—rather than send out messages about our being so
determined to clamp down on immigration and so fixated on a numerical
target that we are prepared to accept the consequence of driving people
away.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000069">Like
the hon. Gentleman, I find that when I talk to companies in our
fantastic and world-leading high-tech centre in Cambridge, one of the
two top issues they almost invariably raise is concern about the
immigration system. Sometimes the issue of transport is raised first,
but normally it is immigration, because those companies are trying to
get staff and are experiencing delays. Bad decision making holds them
up. If errors are made, they have to let people go: they simply cannot
wait, because they need staff who can
travel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000070">Companies
sometimes cannot get customers to come to the UK. One company I
recently visited told me that prospective clients in the US whom it
wants to invite over to look at a product, which sells perhaps for
£500,000, are increasingly not US citizens, but citizens from
China, India or elsewhere, so they cannot come into the country. It
does not help British sales and exports if the person to whom companies
are trying to sell cannot get into the country in a reasonable time
scale. That hits our exports and reduces our ability to sell around the
world. Such issues come up time and
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000071">The
Minister kindly came to Cambridge to meet a small selection of
organisations, and I hope that he found it an interesting experience. I
believe that his heart is absolutely in the right place. I am sure that
he does not want our approach to cause harm to Britain, and that he
would like nothing better than to get rid of the problem—the
bureaucracy and other issues—but that problem absolutely must be

are no doubt problems associated with illegal immigration, but that is

work here, and it is fantastic to keep the people whom we have just

here. We do fantastically well from a network of people who go on to
act as British ambassadors. None the less, the messages that get sent
out are problematic. The hon. Gentleman spoke about post-study work. We

also have an issue around rhetoric, which is becoming increasingly
unpleasant and inaccurate. A recent headline in <I>The Telegraph

Britain. The definition of unemployed in that instance was interesting,
because it included schoolchildren, pensioners and a whole range of
other people whom one would not normally think of as unemployed. They
were not a problem, but that is the sort of rhetoric that we see. The 
<?notus-xml column=15?>Government have touched on that matter. I am sure the Minister and I
will disagree over the appropriateness of the “Go home”
vans and of some of the other messages that are put out. Today, the
Home Secretary has announced that the “Go home” vans will

much sense. The Home Office try to correct such decisions when they
come up. I pay tribute to the regional account manager, Saleah Ahmed,
who has helped me with a huge range of cases, but it should not be the
role of MPs to spot that people have got things repeatedly wrong. Those
decisions make a big difference and they get around the world. A
perverse decision was made in a recent case: an Indian student who was
required to have a certain amount of money in their bank account ended
up being just £20 short of a very large sum, due to currency
fluctuations just before the decision. Any reasonable system would have
spotted that the reason was a drop in the rupee by a few per cent., and

have constituents who are waiting. They contact the Border Agency every
year asking for a decision and are told, “Not yet, we will let

things in a box marked “complex cases” and then leave
them there. These are people who have been stuck in this country for
years. One constituent of mine has been waiting for 14 years. They are
uncertain of their future and of what to do. We should never do that to
people. People deserve a decision, and those decisions need to be

lose so many of them. I am sure that there are people who are trying to

more constraints have been put on family migration, making it hard for
many of my constituents to be reunited with their families. Families

carefully at
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000088">There
are also the oddities in our immigration system, which I have raised
with the Minister before, and I thank him for his recent letter. For
example, children born to unmarried British fathers before 2006 are not
entitled to British citizenship due to a loophole in the way that the
legislation was written under the previous Government. They would be so
entitled if they were born after 2006. I am pleased that the Minister
accepts that that should be changed. I hope that there will be some
legislative vehicle to do that. Will he comment also on the related
question of what happens to people in that category who are raised in
the UK and who are effectively stateless? Other countries believe them
to be British—they have a British father and they are in the
UK—but we do not allow them British citizenship.</hs_Para>

matter raised with me was the effect of border controls on families
whose children have a different surname from the parent with whom they
are travelling. Quite rightly, when this happens, the border force asks
why such children are being taken out of the country; that is
absolutely appropriate. However, it is incredibly frustrating for a
parent who travels constantly, because they must carry with them seven
legal documents including a birth certificate and a marriage
certificate. That seems inappropriate. A suggestion has been made to
the Passport Office that parents’ names should be listed in a
child’s passport. That would simplify the situation and enable
us to stop cases where children are being abducted, and not stop
families who are trying to travel properly. I hope the Minister will
consider that
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000090">We
must have immigration controls, but we also need exit checks to be
introduced competently so that we know who is here and who is not,
which will result in 
<?notus-xml column=17?>better data. That would allow us to have a properly informed debate
rather than the anti-foreign rhetoric that is heard far too often from
both the media and political parties on the left and right. I want the
Minister to ensure that we have a system that works and that makes the
correct decisions so that the right people who will benefit Britain can
come in quickly and easily and that the people who are not allowed here
also get fair, reasonable and accurate rejections. I hope the Minister
gets a reputation for making our decision-making process entirely
competent and not politically
sexy.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/516BC0E92A7E25858E4C57AF34F66ED40648430D" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2013">Tuesday

hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel) on providing us with an
interesting aperitif to what will be a very full day of immigration
debates, with the Immigration Bill going before the Commons later

have only been on the immigration brief for just over 10 days, having
been moved to it by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition.
I have had jobs in Government in Northern Ireland, in the Home Office,
in Justice and in prisons. However, I have a feeling that immigration
will remain one of the key debating issues and challenges during the

constituents want some of the things that the hon. Member for Witham
wants, and I am sure that your constituents want them too, Mr Crausby.
We want to have effective controls at the border; we want to see
foreign criminals who have committed offences in this country being
deported; we want to see illegal immigrants tracked, picked, accounted
for and, if need be, deported; we want to see speedy and effective
appeals, so that people can have their just case looked at accordingly;
and we want to see a crackdown on sham marriages and sham colleges.
Those are issues that any sensible Government will want to deal with.
Nobody has ever said that immigration was easy and those challenges are
not easy, but potentially they are common ground that could be looked
at.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102256000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102256000094">I
agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Members for Cities of London and
Westminster (Mark Field) and for Cambridge (Dr Huppert); my
constituents also want some of the things they have said they want, as
I am sure yours do, Mr Crausby. My constituents want people from abroad
who have modern skills to come to this country to help industry, wealth
and products to grow.</hs_Para>

industries in my constituency in north Wales such as Airbus, which
makes one of the most high-tech products in the world today, the Airbus
aeroplane system. Sometimes those industries need skills from outside
the EU, which will help to ensure that 6,500 people in my
constituency keep their jobs in competitive markets. The same is true
of what the hon. Member for Cambridge said about the science-based
technology in his constituency, and of the needs of the City of London.
I attended a City breakfast only last week, which was just outside the
constituency of the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster,
where the issue was not  
<?notus-xml column=18?>immigration but positive immigration, including the way in which we can
bring in skills to Britain and develop them in this country.</hs_Para>

market brings in millions of pounds in investment, not only in terms of
fees and expenditure but in terms of that unquantifiable issue that was
mentioned by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster,
which is good will. I still love my university town and I left 35 years
ago. People will still come to this country and love it because of the
investment and skills that we have given them to compete in the world
at large in the future. As I have said, nobody says immigration will be
easy. However, those positive signs I have mentioned need to be
considered alongside some of the challenges that exist.</hs_Para>

Member for Witham mentioned the previous Government. I served in that
Government for 12 of the 13 years that they existed, although I did not
cover any immigration post at any time. However, let me say that there
were challenges, and mistakes were made. My right hon. Friend the
Leader of the Opposition has said that, and we need to assess some of
those challenges when we reflect on the debate on
immigration.</hs_Para>

the hon. Lady and indeed to the Minister that “day zero”
did not commence and end when the Labour Government left office;
“day zero” happened three and a half years ago and this
Government and the hon. Lady now have a record to account for,
regarding their actions during those three and a half years. I hope
that today, including during this afternoon’s debate on
immigration, we can potentially have her standing up not only to attack
the previous Government but to pose some serious questions to her hon.
Friend the Minister about this Government’s
performance.</hs_Para>

we need to look at why the number of people being stopped at our
border, including checks on people from outside the UK, has halved
since the general election and since this Government came to power.
Statistics from the Library show that, comparing the first quarter of
2010 with the second quarter of 2013, checks at the border have fallen
by 46.4%, from 26,378 to 14,134.</hs_Para>

needs to be aware of the very serious issue about foreign deportation
of criminals. Why has the number of foreign criminals being deported
fallen by 13.5% in the past three years, from 5,471 to 4,730? As a
Justice Minister, I personally visited Nigeria to negotiate the
agreement on prisoner deportations, and I did the same in Vietnam and
in China. However, the number of foreign criminals being deported under
such agreements has now fallen. The Minister needs to account for that
fall.</hs_Para>

interesting aspects of this debate has been that only the hon. Member
for Cambridge mentioned the issue of labour markets associated with
European immigration, which is a big issue. When the Minister responds
to the debate, will he say why the number of people fined for employing
illegal immigrants has halved since the general election? Such fines
act as a deterrent. I want to know why the number of people who have
been prosecuted since 2010 for not paying the minimum wage is only two.
The Minister and the hon. Member for Witham know that there are many
cases where people are being exploited and undercut, and where such
enforcement is required.</hs_Para>

needs to respond to some of the points that the hon. Lady made about
waits and competence on tier 1 visas. Why is it that it took 30 days
for a tier 1 visa to be processed in 2010, and yet according to the
response from the Home Office to a parliamentary question the delay in
2012 was 83 days? Innocent as  I am in the first week of
covering this brief, I also want to know why, for example,
fingerprinting of individuals entering the UK illegally at Calais was
cancelled by this Government. That was one of the self-evident controls
that we need to consider in relation to this issue.</hs_Para>

Government’s answer to that question? The hon. Member for
Cambridge has mentioned it. What we have, rather than effective action
on some of those issues, is ad vans driving around some sensitive parts
of our great capital city, with the simple message, “Go
Home”. I would like the Minister to pay attention for a moment,
if he would, because I believe that those ad vans are just a pilot. If
I had watched “Question Time” on Thursday night to hear
what he said, I would know that they were a pilot that could be rolled
out. And yet this morning, in the <I>Daily Mail</I><I>, </I>I read that
sources close to the Home Secretary have said that the ad vans will be
cancelled. Perhaps when he responds to the debate, the Minister will
say once and for all whether what he was saying on Thursday is
true—or is what the Home Secretary has been reported as saying
today true and the ad vans are being scrapped?</hs_Para>

knows that my right hon. Friend the Member for Normanton, Pontefract
and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) has said that she does not believe that
those ad vans were a positive development, and I share her view. I hope
that the vans have been cancelled, but perhaps the Minister will say
whether he is the source close to the Home Secretary or somebody else
is. What is the position on those

need to look at all the issues I have mentioned. However, the
Government’s Immigration Bill, which we will debate in detail
later today, examines just some of the issues relating to the major
challenges that we face. Some real concerns have been expressed about
the Bill regarding the ending of appeals for certain categories of
migration. I might be old-fashioned in this respect, but I think the
right of appeal still remains an important issue and we will test the
Government on that issue when we debate the Bill later
today.</hs_Para>

Field:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman will have gathered from my
own contribution that I am relatively liberal on matters of
immigration. However, there is also no doubt in my mind, after 12 years
as a constituency MP, that the abuse by immigration lawyers and others
in the legal system is nothing short of a national disgrace. The idea
of streamlining this system should be wholly welcomed across the
House.</hs_Para>

Hanson:</Member></B> We will look very carefully at that issue of
appeals. Part 2 of the Immigration Bill, which will be considered
today, proposes ending appeals, apart from administrative reviews, for
a number of categories of immigration. We must look carefully at that
issue, because I want to ensure that we speedily remove people who
should not be here, and that we do not speedily allow in 
<?notus-xml column=20?>people who should not be here. However, we must also ensure that people
have an opportunity to receive a fair hearing.</hs_Para>

Minister tell me—either now, later today or in
Committee—why 50% of the current appeals are upheld? If 50% of
the current appeals are upheld, that means that the original decisions
in those cases were wrong. If the appeal mechanism is removed, what
guarantees do we have that that 50% of appeals will not be
unfairly dealt with by the Government? That is all I am
seeking in this debate—fairness. With the Minister, I will
happily consider how we can streamline the appeals system and make it
more effective. However, if ultimately 50% of appeals are upheld and we
remove that right of appeal, that 50% of appeals will not even be
considered, which would mean that people from abroad will not come here
and potentially will not have happy marriages, employment or other
aspects of life, because of a failure of initial decision making. That
is where we need to go back to, rather than potentially having a debate
about who should and who should not be here.</hs_Para>

issues that are dealt with in the Immigration Bill are, in theory,
perfectly acceptable, but we will need to consider the practical
details of how they will work and how, for example, we can expect
landlords to know the 400-plus types of visa or conditions of entry
that might exist. In particular, constituencies such as that of the
hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster have a high turnover
of students and other people coming here, and the same applies in many
big cities. How landlords can be expected to do that job practically
will have to be tested later today. We will also look in detail at the

that we will need to go to the basics of all the issues I have
mentioned today. I noted that, with the exception of the hon. Member

believe that some labour market issues also relate to where the vast
majority of new immigrants to the United Kingdom come from: wider
Europe. If the labour market is undercut by people forcing down wages,
by poorer conditions, by gangmasters in areas such as the east of

wages and treats people casually, there will be tensions in society

strengthening the rules covering gangmasters, introducing measures to
prevent migrants being crammed into unsuitable accommodation such as
overcrowded mobile homes to cut labour costs, giving local councils
power to take enforcement action on the minimum wage, extending the
Gangmasters Licensing Authority, stopping rogue landlords providing
overpriced accommodation, and targeting areas with high levels of
foreign recruitment, particularly in relation to recruitment agencies.
We will

want to give the Minister a few moments to contribute to the debate,

would never, ever portray as a fact something that is not. Perhaps in
his opening comment, he could tell us that he agrees with the Home
Secretary that ad vans should be scrapped. If that were his opening

the Minister will touch on how many texts were sent to British
citizens—I am waiting for replies to parliamentary questions on
this—and the basis of the information for that part of the
campaign. Instead of looking at gimmicks and rhetoric, we should look
for cross-party consensus on dealing with illegal immigration,
effective border controls, removal of foreign prisoners, stopping sham
marriages, closing sham colleges, and ensuring that in our rhetoric and
policy we do not deter the positive people who want to come to the
United Kingdom. We must make it easier to attract skills and easier to
bring students here. We must use immigration as it has been used
historically: as an engine for growth instead of a rhetoric for
fear.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/9F0F4DCC819E316D2F861384EAC7BCE3ACF5B0D7" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2013">Tuesday

want to spend some time responding to the points raised by my hon.
Friends, but first I want to explain briefly why the issue is of great
concern. My hon. Friends the Members for Witham and for Cities of 
<?notus-xml column=22?>London and Westminster put their finger on it when they said that we
inherited a shambles. The previous Government had let migration run out
of control at more than 250,000 a year.</hs_Para>

system was also out of control, and the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr
Huppert) alluded to that. When we came to office, we inherited
450,000 cases that had not been concluded; my predecessor,
the right hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green), did a sterling job in
sorting that out and driving the number down. The hon. Gentleman is
right in saying that we have not completed that work; we are still
working through some very old cases. We know from the work of the chief
inspector of borders and immigration that there was a period from 2007,
under the previous Government, when, when there were queues, checks
were not carried out, to manage the length of the queues. That does not
happen now. We have an operating mandate: everyone who arrives at an
airport is
checked.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102257000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102257000008">The
right hon. Member for Delyn mentioned the one mistake that I believe
the Labour party has acknowledged. The lack of transitional controls on
accession countries in 2004, which my hon. Friend the Member for Cities
of London and Westminster mentioned, was a huge mistake and is part of
the reason why immigration is an issue. Parts of the country saw very
significant and very fast growth in the number of migrants, which put
public services under pressure. However, the right hon. Gentleman did
not mention something that the Labour party skips over. During its
period in office, the number of people coming from outside the EU was
twice as high as the number from inside the EU. Yes, the Labour
Government made a mistake with transitional controls for EU migrants,
but what they do not talk about is that twice as many came from outside
the EU and there were no legal constraints from EU rules. They let that
run out of
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102257000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102257000009">My
hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster talked
about the importance of welcoming people who contribute. That is
absolutely right. Ministers are always clear, although this is not
always reflected in what is reported, about achieving a balance. We
want the best and the brightest to come to Britain and we want people
to contribute. The Queen’s Speech referred to an immigration
Bill and it was clear that it would have two purposes. One was to
attract those who wanted to come and to contribute, and the other was
to deter those who did not. We must get both parts of that story right;
I will touch on the detail in a
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102257000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102257000010">My
hon. Friends the Members for Cities of London and Westminster and for
Witham talked about issues with EU nationals and where we need to
tighten up on those who abuse free movement, particularly when there is
criminality. There are some real issues of criminality in the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and
Westminster. Immigration enforcement officers are working closely with
his local authority and the Metropolitan police to deal with those
involved in what we tend to call low-level criminality, but which has a
real impact on UK nationals and visitors who want to come and spend
money in our country. We have taken significant
steps.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102257000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102257000011">The
real issue with EU nationals is that although we can remove them from
the country and we have had some successful operations—for

Hendon—

hon. Friend should also be aware that because of pressure from the Home
Secretary at EU level, we finally got the message home. At the Justice
and Home Affairs Council on 7 and 8 October, the Commission accepted
for the first time that there is an issue with abuse of free movement
rights. Commissioner Reding stated that free movement is a fundamental
achievement, with which I agree, but the Commission also noted that
free movement rights are weakened by abuse and that it would support
member states to use existing EU tools—including sanctions such
as expulsion and re-entry bans in certain circumstances, with the
appropriate safeguards—to fight such abuse. That is very
welcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102257000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102257000013">The
Home Secretary raised those issues with the Commission and with
colleagues from Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, and we have
started to build a sense that there is a problem to solve. If we solve
that problem and the problems of abuse, we will strengthen the benefits
of free movement across the EU, from which many British citizens
benefit, and make Britain a more attractive home for inward investment.

balanced way—it is not surprising that about a third of
criminals in London are foreign nationals, but that is not a hysterical
point; it is a very understandable point, because broadly a third of
the population of London are foreign nationals. The Metropolitan
police’s core job of addressing criminality involves dealing
with a significant number of foreign national criminals. The number is
not disproportionate; the proportion is about what would be expected,
given that there are significant numbers of foreign nationals in
London. The tools we are able to give to the Metropolitan police,
working with our immigration enforcement officers, means that it can do
that job more effectively. We have seen significant success, and we
have started to roll out those resources in the west midlands, for
example, and increasingly in other police forces across the United
Kingdom. I think that will be helpful.</hs_Para>

the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames), who ran the all-party

hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster is right
that there are issues, although, largely, they are not issues of
perception, but that does not mean the issues are not important. Of
course, part of the job that the Chancellor and the Mayor of London
were doing last week in China was to ensure that perceptions catch up
with reality. For example, in China the average time for a business
visitor to get a visa to Britain is some eight days, and we are looking
to make that even faster for high-value visitors. I am not pretending
that there are no real issues on the business side, because there are,

He will have seen today that the Health Secretary has published a
significant independent audit, which has been peer-reviewed and shows
that the NHS is failing to recover some £500 million
of income that it should be getting from the foreign nationals that it
treats. Frankly, I find it extraordinary that the Labour party, or at
least its health spokesman—I do not know whether he talked to
the right hon. Member for Delyn—has said that it will not
support our proposals on that. I do not know whether that is connected
to the Unite union’s opposition to those health proposals. In 
<?notus-xml column=25?>fact, Unite has said that health workers should not collect money from
foreign migrants. I do not know whether Unite is setting
Labour’s policy, but that statement is extraordinary. We have a
national health service, not an international health service. We are
not talking about not treating people, which is one of Unite’s

treatment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102257000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102257000025">If
my right hon. Friend the Health Secretary and I go to another European
country, that country is much better at charging the UK for our health
treatment; we are not very good at charging for such treatment. If we
go to another country, we would be expected to use private health care.
In some countries we would not get health treatment before paying for
it. In the UK, though, we are talking about never withholding urgent
treatment but ensuring that people pay for it, which is fair to
taxpayers. I look forward both to the changes that we are making in the
Immigration Bill and to my right hon. Friend’s proposals for
charging overseas visitors and being more effective at recovering the

people who are paying for visas and coming to the United Kingdom to
work hard, to study and to contribute. We want to give them a good

we should offer asylum to those who are genuinely fleeing persecution,
but if the system is to work and to command public confidence, the flip
side is that those who we find do not need our protection—and
where an independent judge agrees that they do not need our
protection—should return to their country of origin. We should
not have to spend thousands and thousands of pounds of
taxpayers’ money detaining those people and enforcing their

demonstrate that gallant naval port’s loyalty to Britain. The
George Cross was created on 31 January 1941 by Her Majesty’s
father George VI. It has been awarded twice to a group of people, first
to Malta in 1942 for its resistance following significant bombing by
the Germans during the second world war, and more recently to the Royal
Ulster Constabulary in 1999. I pay tribute to the armed forces that
served in Northern Ireland during recent times. In both cases, the

Kevin was one of the leading lights in the campaign for Gibraltar to

grandson of Louis XIV of France, and the Habsburg Archduke Charles of
Austria. Louis XIV, the Spaniards who were loyal to Philip V and the
Electorate of Bavaria supported Philip of Anjou. England, the
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Savoy and some of the German states

time that he had over the summer. He makes a fair point, which I hope
to deal with. Gibraltar played a significant role prior to 
<?notus-xml column=29?>the battle of Trafalgar and during the Crimean war. Its strategic value
increased with the opening of the Suez canal, because it lay on the sea
routes between Britain and the British empire east of Suez. If Britain
had not had control of those straits, we would not have been able to
bottle up the French fleet in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic
wars. That would have allowed the French to come out from Toulon and

also played a major role during the second world war. The decision by
the Spanish dictator Franco to remain neutral during the war, and
Spain’s reluctance to allow the German army onto Spanish soil,
stopped Hitler from gaining control of the strategic naval port.
Gibraltar has not only provided a naval base and dockyard for our Royal
Navy to operate from, but has ensured that we have a Mediterranean base

operations.</hs_Para>

that by giving Gibraltar the George Cross, Britain will send a clear
message that we want to thank the Gibraltarians for their loyalty and
that we abide by the commitment that the Gibraltarians have shown in
referendums to remaining a British overseas territory. Consistently,
Spain has campaigned for the British Government to hand over
sovereignty of the Rock. The current dispute over the fishing reef is
yet another example of how the Spanish Government do not get the
message. For some reason they think that if they carry on pushing they
will get a result. I hope that nothing could be further from the
truth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102257000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102257000048">It

the monkeys leave the Rock. The last time I was there was on national
day last year, when I met a delightful former Miss World, and I assure
you, Mr Crausby, that the monkeys were present in abundance. They stole
fruit from my bedroom in the Rock hotel. I fully realise that the
Government must consider proposals of this kind case by case. However,
giving Gibraltar the George Cross would support its fortitude, loyalty
and determination, and would emphasise the nature of the
honour—an emphasis established by George VI himself. Anyone who

Gibraltar have suffered in wartime. They have experienced some very
difficult times as a result of political pressure from Spain. The
closure of the border from 1969 until its full re-opening in 1985

awards are usually made in recognition of specific acts of bravery by
individuals in saving or attempting to save life. The George Cross, as
hon. Members know, is the highest of the awards for civilian gallantry.
The hallmark of the award is deliberate self-sacrificial heroism with
the imminent prospect of death. Before anyone else points it out,

it has been awarded on a collective basis on two occasions:  to
Malta in 1942; and to the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1999.</hs_Para>

not about Malta or the RUC, but it is relevant to point out the
circumstances in which they were awarded the George Cross, because that
will help to explain why such an award is so rare. Malta was awarded
the honour for the heroism and devotion of her people in the face of
extraordinary danger. The island experienced one of the heaviest, most
sustained and concentrated aerial bombardments in history. Axis forces
flew some 3,000 bombing raids over a period of two years. From 1
January to 24 July 1942, there was only one 24-hour period in which no
bombs fell on Malta. In March and April 1942, the island received twice
the bomb tonnage dropped on London during the entire blitz. The
population were forced to live in tunnels and caves, where they
suffered malnutrition and scabies, and 1,600 civilian lives were
lost—a huge and significant
sacrifice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102259000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102259000017">The

requested this debate in light of figures published by School Direct

education. School Direct enrols unqualified graduates to teach in
schools and trains them while they are teaching. The programme has been
expanded this year, causing a significant change to teacher training as
a whole and leading to concern about that training and the supply of
teachers. I will explore the concerns raised by School Direct. Teacher
training in this country is regarded as being of a high standard and
improving, a point made to the Select Committee in evidence
sessions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000011">I
shall also look at some of the evidence on what constitutes great
teacher training and what is considered to be going well. My comments

and their ability to continue to play their part in ensuring that the
highest standards of professional training apply. I may also look at
the inherent contradiction in a system of teacher training that is
supposed to promote the highest standards but operates alongside an
academy system in which unqualified teachers can be employed. On that
note, there has been a 141% rise in the number of unqualified teachers
since the 2010 election, and free schools have been allowed to award
10% of teaching posts to unqualified teachers. It is difficult to
report those figures without questioning how the growth in the number
of unqualified teachers can sit alongside the Government’s claim
that improving the standard of qualified teachers is so
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Kevin Brennan" PimsId="2281" UID="13102269000372" xid="67" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000372">Kevin

is extraordinary that the Government do not know the details of what
goes on in schools over which they have direct control. I can only
imagine what their comments would be if information about what goes on
in local authority schools were not available. Perhaps the Minister

the Department for Education’s School Direct programme, 9,000
teacher training places were transferred from universities to schools
in 2012-13, with the expectation that schools would recruit trainee
teachers who would commence training in September 2013. School Direct
is led by schools, but is delivered in partnership with universities.

figures published in September suggest that the final numbers to be
released in November will reveal a reduction in the number of new
entrants to teaching. School Direct places have been going unfilled,
with just 6,730 acceptances against an allocation of 9,580, unless the
Minister has new figures for us today. In addition, the number being
trained through the university route is down due to the lack of places
being given to the institutions by the Department for Education as a
result of the move towards School
Direct.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000017"><Member ContinuationText="Nic Dakin" PimsId="5672" UID="13102269000374" xid="1143" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000374"><B>Nic

securing this important and timely debate. Does he agree that not only
are the figures he gave worrying, but that the problem is exacerbated
by the fact that the National College for Teaching and Leadership
seemed reluctant to transfer those unfilled places from School Direct
to universities, so there is a shortage of people being trained in
subjects such as maths and physics, instead of them being up to

Evidence to the Select Committee in its follow-up session was that that
is exactly what has happened. Places that were not filled by School
Direct were not transferred. In fact, some of the witnesses requested
that that should happen, and that there should be virement between the
different routes. Perhaps the Minister will respond to
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000019">When

his report for McKinsey in 2007, Sir Michael Barber found that while
high-performing systems such as those in Finland, Japan, Singapore and
Korea had very different approaches to the curriculum, teaching methods
and school structures, they all made the quality of teaching their top
priority. Sir Michael concluded that the top two priorities for raising
school standards are getting the right people to become teachers and
developing them into effective instructors. In 2010, McKinsey published
a follow-up that showed that</hs_Para>

Institute of Education also quotes research that shows the dramatic
impact that different teachers have on pupil progress. It shows that
pupils who are taught by the best teacher in a group of 50 will learn
twice as fast as average, while those taught by the worst teacher make
only half the average progress. The Government’s 2010 White
Paper looked abroad for inspiration, noting admiringly that South Korea
recruits teacher trainees from the top 5% and Finland from the top 10%
of their school leavers. That brings us back to the question: how did
we end up with School Direct and such a shortage of
applicants?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000023">To
begin to answer that question, I go back to what the Secretary of State
said: that teaching is a “craft”, best learned on the
job. That statement perhaps gives a clue as to why there has been such
an acceleration in the scale of School Direct this year. That in turn
may explain the problems being identified by so many of those involved
in teacher training. As a result of the Secretary of State’s
view, the Government decided to shift teacher training from the
universities into schools, creating teaching schools on the model of
teaching hospitals. That all sounds very
plausible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000024">In

evidence to the inquiry were clear that the partnership needed to

working with head teachers who have been doing recruitment and
selection with us as a school-based provider for something like 10
years, is that they are finding that those schools that do not have the
experience are looking for teachers and not trainees. They are not
selecting, and we are getting returned to us people who we would
probably have put on the course but they do not, because they clearly
do not represent the finished article. If schools have not had
significant experience in ITT recruitment as opposed to teacher
recruitment, they tend to miss some of the opportunities that are
presented to
them”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13102269000040" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000040">I

made the point that head teachers who are used to recruiting trainees
make the distinction between recruiting a trainee who has potential and
finding the finished article before they have started training. Chris
Husbands from the Institute of Education told the Committee that some
schools are considering people who they think would be good but who do
not 
<?notus-xml column=38?>have the minimum entry requirements, such as GCSEs in English, maths and
science at grade C or better. As the Chair of the Committee, the hon.
Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart), pointed out, academies
and free schools are already free to do just that by employing
unqualified teachers. The Minister will need to address the point about
unqualified teachers, not least given the remarks of the Deputy Prime
Minister.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000042">It
is perhaps not surprising that some maintained schools look at
so-called academy freedoms and wonder why they, too, cannot recruit
unqualified teachers. That evidence, again, came to the Committee. In
my view, the Minister really needs to explain how he can say that he
supports the highest possible standards in teacher training on the one
hand, while encouraging the employment of unqualified teachers on the
other.</hs_Para>

to concerns about the role of universities. It is clear that any threat
to the ongoing involvement of universities is a major concern, given
the implications for the quality of training that follow from the
evidence I quoted earlier, when it comes to the importance of having
equal partnerships with universities, and of theoretical, reflective
learning, not to mention academic study in continuing professional
development. Potentially, a key part of teacher training is under
strain, according to what university teacher training departments are
saying.</hs_Para>

the setting-up of School Direct, evidence to the Committee suggested
that planning for the set-up was inadequate. That included a lack of
communication with universities, which made administration very
difficult, and a lack of thought about how a school-based system would
operate and about how schools would work with universities. As a
result, universities were left with a lack of certainty, which makes
planning impossible and means that they do not know whether they will
be viable next year.</hs_Para>

Husbands told the Committee that schools cannot plan school places and
therefore cannot plan teacher supply. In his view, School Direct has so
far had the wrong balance between schools and universities, and that
could lead to a shortage of teachers. James Noble-Rogers from the
Universities Council for the Education of Teachers confirmed that the
way that School Direct had been set up could destabilise existing
high-quality provision. That would be the result of the transfer of
places to School Direct from postgraduate certificates in education.
According to Mr Noble-Rogers, the implication of the way in which
School Direct has been set up is that it will become the only way into
initial teacher training.</hs_Para>

evidence that schools cannot plan the number of teaching places, the
very real danger is that we will end up with a shortage of teachers
year after year in certain subjects. Instead of raising standards, the
Government could suppress them because of the way that School Direct
has been set up. Some will say that universities and other teacher
training providers have a vested interest in opposing change. The
Minister may even say that—he is smiling at me; I wonder what
that means. Chris Husbands’ reply to that point in the Committee

an organisation of which initial teacher training is part of the core
business. It makes up about 18% of my turnover. I think we do it well,

<?notus-xml column=39?>a better and more effective way of doing it,’ I am prepared to
accept that. What makes me feel uncomfortable is that we are being

issue to my attention. Given the importance of the university to the
city of Sunderland, I have a keen interest in its continued success,
and I am in regular contact with the vice-chancellor, Professor Peter
Fidler, to discuss any areas of concern that he may have. This is a
particularly big area of concern for the university, and not just
because of the financial implications. There are financial implications
from losing places, of course, but the knock-on effect on the capacity
of the university of Sunderland to deliver future places at the high
level of quality that it currently provides is the most concerning
impact. Sunderland is not alone in being challenged by this. In fact,
because it has an “outstanding” rating from Ofsted for
its secondary teacher training, it may be less affected than other
universities, certainly in the short term. However, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Sefton Central has described, this problem threatens to

Secretary of State for Education and Skills, my noble Friend Baroness

she is speaking from an uninformed position. In that article, she sets
out clearly that the loss of guaranteed allocations and the lack of
information about future numbers mean that initial teacher training
providers are struggling to plan for the future. That makes it
difficult for them to retain experienced 
<?notus-xml column=41?>staff and therefore to deliver high-quality training. In the worst
cases, it could even mean that they will struggle to continue to run
the courses on a viable footing altogether. We are already seeing
universities having to face up to

the same article, Baroness Morris makes other valid critiques of the
School Direct roll-out as well. She points out that there is no
strategy to ensure even coverage of schools, either geographically or
by subject area, meaning that opportunities may not be available to all
candidates. She also points out that schools are under no obligation to
fill the places that they have been allocated, meaning that we have no
idea from one year to the next what the actual intake will be. However,
it is the impact on the higher education sector, which, we should
remember, also plays an important role in providing high-quality
continuing professional development, that is the most
concerning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000060">What
are the Government doing to counter the concerns? What the Minister and
his colleagues have done, as in so many other policy areas, is in
effect to absolve themselves of any responsibility for getting things
done. There is no central planning, no assessment of the impact of the
changes in the market and no accountability. In some ways, it is a
remarkable contradiction of their academisation programme, which is a
drive to make the Department directly responsible for an
ever-increasing proportion of schools, although of course, as we saw
last week, when failings emerge, Ministers are quick to absolve
themselves of that responsibility too, so I suppose it does fit a
pattern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000061">However,
although we agree with Nick—to recycle that well used
phrase—that teachers should be qualified, this particular issue
of how they get that qualification is not a question of ideological or
political differences. It is more a question of process and
practicality. I like the idea of prospective teachers having a
different postgraduate route into the profession. Provided that the
schools providing these opportunities are up to scratch, particularly
in terms of their special educational needs practice, School Direct
should produce good teachers. Whether those teachers will be better or
worse than those who gained qualified teacher status by the more
traditional route is something that we do not know and may never know,
so the extent to which Ministers and Government agencies appear to be
championing this as a better option, rather than just an
alternative option, is
questionable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0001.htm#13102269000062">A
good idea is a good idea, but even the best ideas can run into problems
because of a failure to think through and plan for their knock-on
effects. Introducing and expanding new schemes must always be done with
an eye on the consequences elsewhere; in consultation with those
affected; and in such a way as to support the core objectives. In this
case, the Government appear to have ignored the concerns raised by
universities and the Education Committee and are pursuing an
implementation programme that will seriously affect other providers of
initial teacher training. Worse is the potential knock-on effect of
these reforms being a lack of teachers being recruited in shortage
areas such as the sciences, including computer science, as we have
heard. Even worse than that would be a shortage of teachers overall to
meet the growing demand on the school system that is set to begin in a

as the intended consequences of the whole programme need to be thought
through. One unintended consequence is that if there is no initial
demand, because the demand goes in another direction, universities will
have to let qualified staff go, so the staff will not be there to pick

universities are asking for too much when they ask for some certainty
now. They accept that new schemes will come along from time to time, as
we discussed, but like me, they rightly believe that the established

my 30-plus years in education tell me that well-trained teachers
improve the quality of teaching and learning and the outcomes for young
people. My hon. Friend demonstrated that the evidence collected by the
Education Committee confirms that judgment. It would be laughable for
someone who had studied biology and physiology at a high level to be
deemed qualified to practice medicine with no medical training, yet the
Government seem happy for people to teach with no teacher training. The
clear message is that anybody can teach and there is no skill involved.
I can tell the Minister that there is a lot of skill: it is taught and
it is learnt. Interestingly, while the Government squabble with their
schizophrenic self, parents are clear about what they want: qualified
teachers teaching their kids.</hs_Para>

head teacher friend whom I bumped into at the weekend that I thought
things were in a spot of bother and might get worse. To my surprise, he
said that teacher education and supply were already in
chaos—that is from someone on the front line—adding that
he did not understand why the effective graduate teacher programme had
been scrapped. With a bit more digging—speaking to north
Lincolnshire’s excellent lead for teacher induction, Kim
Francis—I discovered that the restructuring and the reduction in
staffing, with the responsibilities passed to the National College for
Teaching and Leadership, coupled with systemic change in initial
teacher training have resulted in widespread frustration for providers
of initial teacher education. Lines of communication have become

ambivalent and lukewarm about taking on the

single portal for all initial teacher education applications was due to
open on 1 November. All School Direct lead schools as well as all
accredited providers will be listed—hundreds of organisations.
North Lincolnshire has been trying to secure its registration since
July. The NCTL appears to have been the problem in that it has not
passed on the new school-centred initial teacher training details to
UCAS. Last Friday,  it was announced that the UCAS site will
not open  until 21 November, due to the backlog in registering
organisations, thus further delaying the recruitment cycle
for 2014-15. The announcement caused understandable consternation for
providers, who made plans based on the 1 November date. That
illustrates the chaos in the system.</hs_Para>

the retrospective application of the new skills test, based on
“three strikes and you’re out”, has made potential

the detailed questions that should have been thought through have not

on earth are the Government dismantling effective teacher education? If
they are looking at international comparators, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson) pointed out,
they might consider Finland, where it is universally recognised that
children do well. Its teacher education has universities at its heart,
is pitched at master’s level and involves longer periods of
study and shorter classes. Instead, the Government chose to focus only
on the idea of teaching schools, adapting it so as to be unrecognisable
when compared with the Finnish model. They should go back to the
start.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000082">We
could look at Canada, which is sixth for literacy in the programme for
international student assessment tables—PISA. Universities are
right at the heart of its teacher education. Students spend two years
training and cover a wide range of educational theory, which they
value. They spend much less time in the classroom, even over two years,
than ours do. Teacher education is more than learning on the job. It is
more than “Sitting next to Nellie”. Professor Christine
Jarvis, dean of education at Huddersfield university, explains it
well:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102269000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000340">“Firstly,
the obvious—teachers need to learn properly (not in the form of
a few handy hints) about the psychology of learning, about the
implications of social deprivation and context and not just about the
specific government strategies and practices in force at any one time.
They must have some in-depth knowledge. Second, they need time to
reflect, critically, and with support away from the school in which
they are working—the school whose practices they may wish to
question. Third, teachers need to think about themselves as
researchers, developing the ability to create knowledge about
teaching—they need to learn research skills and methodologies.
Finally, I think teachers are more than classroom practitioners. They
are education professionals and should have a right to understand the
job they are doing in a 
<?notus-xml column=45?>wider context, to take a place in wider society as people who can
contribute to debate about what education should be, what schools

partnership between schools and higher education has been crucial to
the success of teacher education. Universities are reporting requests
for support from schools, but an unwillingness by schools to pay for
such support. That is leading university vice-chancellors to question
whether they can afford to be involved in this work. Schools are told
by the National College for Teaching and Leadership that they must
lead. They keep most of the income, design the curriculum and do most
of the training, but because the university is the accredited provider,
the university gets inspected by Ofsted. The university has little
control and no power over the quality, but it will get the poor rating,
while the school’s Ofsted grade will remain unaffected even if
it messes up. It is not surprising, given the comparatively poor record
of school-led teacher training in the past according to Ofsted
judgments, that universities are worried about their reputations under
the new arrangements. It is not surprising, therefore, that they are
already beginning to cut their losses and pull out of teacher
education.</hs_Para>

Government are presiding over a crisis in teacher education and supply
that will get worse unless they act quickly. The limited
opportunity to transfer allocations between different routes, which my

exacerbated the problem, impacting significantly on key
subjects such as physics, mathematics and modern foreign languages.
Overall, recruitment is 43% down in physics and 22% down in

Will the Government provide greater certainty about the core allocation
over the next few years to enable providers to plan and invest? Will
the Government make it easier to transfer unfilled
allocation between different routes to ensure that good candidates are
not turned away? I note from the Minister’s intervention that he
is, properly, concerned that that should be happening, and I hope that
he is right about that. Will the Government take positive action to
make HE equal partners in teaching schools by making it clear that HE
partners should be invited to NCTL meetings and included in any
correspondence about the teaching schools where they are partners? Will
the Government look at getting Ofsted to inspect the lead organisation,

late to put the situation right, but teacher education is hurtling
towards a shipwreck. If the Minister agrees with his party leader, the
Deputy Prime Minister, that every child in a publicly funded school
should have the right to be taught by a qualified teacher, he needs to
say so today. He needs to take the necessary action to guarantee the
quality of teacher education and secure future teacher supply. I am
more optimistic—I am naturally optimistic—than the head
teacher I bumped into at the weekend, but I do not have to run a school

training had the right skills, knowledge and professionalism to work in
our classrooms. Newly qualified teachers’ satisfaction with
their courses was at an all-time high in 2010-11, which is the last
year for which data are available. They rated their university courses
as good or very good in 90% of cases. The proportion of graduate
entrants holding a 2:1 or a first-class degree had been increasing
steadily for years, prior to 2010. That is not perfect, and nor is
there room for complacency; but it is a reasonably good picture,
overall. There is recognition across the profession and, I think,
throughout the House that we have a better, more qualified,

various and diverse routes into teaching and the role of the higher
education institutions as well as school-based providers. It was clear
to us that a sharp move from higher education and school-led
partnerships to largely school-led provision was highly contentious and
fraught with difficulties, not least because the school-led sector was
not yet robust enough and did not have the capacity to replace the
higher education sector. The Minister will no doubt say that he does
not intend to replace the higher education ITT sector with school-led
ITT, but that will be the outcome if the higher education-led ITT
sector is not sufficiently funded and supported. Universities will
simply reduce or withdraw from the market, closing their schools of
education. As the Minister knows, that is beginning to
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000096">As
part of the inquiry the Select Committee visited Finland and Singapore,
countries that are recognised as among the best in the world for ITT,

with a research-based dissertation through a university, are required
to produce the best teaching force. In 2012 the Select Committee

reservations about whether schools are currently equipped to deliver
the programme on their own and, in many cases, to lead

facing the crisis that my hon. Friend’s colleague and friend

qualification including QTS from a university, rather than from a
school, albeit one that is linked to a higher education provider. That

66% of places allocated to School Direct have been met—well
below the target allocation. In addition there has been
over-recruitment in subjects including chemistry, history and PE, and
that has masked much larger shortfalls in subjects such as maths and
physics. Overall recruitment is 43% below target in physics and 22%
below target in maths. The shortfall has been made worse because the
Government have chosen to reduce allocations to HE institutions and
universities, the bit in the system that we know works well and that

of Education degree, I would not have had the necessary skills and
knowledge of child development. I would not have known how children
learn, or about differentiation and delivering a syllabus to a range of
abilities; I would not have known about assessment, or understood what
each child could or could not do, and what they needed to do next; I
would not have been able to manage behaviour in a classroom, or to
identify and meet the needs of children with special needs. Probably
just as importantly, I would not have had credibility, or the trust of
my colleagues, the parents, and the pupils. Pupils know who is or is
not experienced, and they can quickly tell who is qualified. Often that

their classroom behaviour.</hs_Para>

of this debate is the fact that the Secretary of State for Education
does not believe that teaching is a profession at all. He has made it
clear that he thinks it is a craft to be picked up on the job, which is
why he does not really care whether teachers in taxpayer-funded schools
are qualified. That is his policy: teachers in academies and free
schools need not be qualified. Bearing in mind that more than half of
secondary schools are now academies, that represents the majority of

just as we now know the Deputy Prime Minister believes, that it is
wisdom to ensure that teachers in our taxpayer-funded schools have or
are en route to gaining a teaching qualification, and that they enhance
those qualifications throughout their career through continuing
professional development. Like  my hon. Friend the Member for
Scunthorpe, I did a postgraduate certificate in education many years

the impression from some of the debate that there has been a vast lurch
away from a university-led or university-involved system, but the
reality is that higher education institutions currently deliver 86% of
all teacher training places. In absolute terms, HEIs will deliver more
places in 2013-14 than in 2012-13. Obviously, many School Direct places
are in partnership with HEIs; they are not stand-alone organisations.
One good thing about School Direct is that schools often have a more
constructive dialogue with HEIs, rather than getting whatever they are
given.</hs_Para>

teacher quality, it is vital that the teaching profession can attract
and retain the best people. As the hon. Gentleman and some of his
colleagues mentioned, top-performing education systems around the
world, such as those in Finland and South Korea, draw their teachers

mix of personal and intellectual qualities. Candidates then go through
high-quality training, often led by schools, focusing on the skills and

an accurate picture of where we were with recruitment at that stage in
the cycle. The picture is mixed across subjects, as the hon. Gentleman
acknowledged. The data showed that we had exceeded our targets in some
subjects: chemistry, where we achieved 110% of the target; English,
114% of the target; and history, 137% of the target. However, they also

we have over-allocated—I will return to that point
later—the allocations, particularly in this first year of School
Direct, to ensure that we did not lose high-quality people across the

under-recruited areas referred to by a number of hon. Members were
those where both higher education institutions themselves and School

School Direct had come in under target, but they both came in below

figures, which I do not have to hand, but there were considerable
undershoots on both, so we have not been suppressing demand for places
in higher education institutions, particularly in those shortage
subjects. As she will know, maths and physics are subjects that have
traditionally been challenging to recruit for, although we recruited a
record number of physics trainees last years. We would need 37% of all

in recruitment are mitigated by the fact that newly qualified teachers
make up only about half—23,500—of the 45,000 new teachers
in English state schools in 2010-11; of the rest, a third of the total
or 14,700 people had qualified in previous years, and a fifth of the
total or 8,200 people were returners. Initial teacher training targets
are set in the context of longer-term recruitment patterns and
anticipated need over a number of years, so over-recruitment in
previous years, including in maths and chemistry, is taken into account
in the targets set for future years. Therefore, over-recruitment in
previous years gives some protection against under-recruitment in one
year. We have over-recruited in some areas over the past few
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000170">Alongside
getting teachers into the key subject areas, we must still maintain our
strong focus on teacher quality in all subjects. We know that we have
the highest quality of trainee teachers ever. In 2012, more than 70% of
graduates starting teacher training had a 2:1 or higher, which is the
highest proportion ever recorded. We are increasing teacher quality
through a number of reforms. We have provided schools with increased
flexibility to decide how much they pay a teacher and how quickly pay
progresses, which will enable schools to target school-level
recruitment and retention problems. We are reforming initial teacher
training so that schools play a greater role in the selection and
training of teachers, through the expansion of School Direct and with
more schools becoming accredited ITT providers. That will provide
schools with greater choice and influence over the quality of both
training and
trainees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000171">The
introduction of School Direct marks a sea change in how schools are
involved in the recruitment and training of teachers. It effectively
gives head teachers more influence over training and recruitment
issues. Many of them welcome that, which is why schools are so keen to
participate in the School Direct programme, 
<?notus-xml column=57?>albeit that they have proved themselves, in the first year, to be highly
discriminating about the applicants whom they decide to take on. That
is a good thing, although it is a challenge to ensure that we get the
allocations right. The director of the leading Arthur Terry teaching
school in Birmingham has
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102269000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000344">“It

time, many teachers and head teachers will want to take more
responsibility for managing initial teacher training. The number of
schools that are interested in taking part in School Direct shows that
there is an appetite for that, and it is right to respond positively to
this enthusiasm. Although it is still early days, School Direct is
proving a highly popular means of recruiting great candidates into
high-quality school-led training. For 2013-14, more than 9,000 places
were requested by 850 schools, more than a third of which were from
teaching schools, and by May, about 22,500 people had applied for the
9,400 places available. Recruitment shortfalls cannot be attributed to
the introduction of School Direct. So far School Direct has recruited
67% of the places it was allocated, and—I made this point
earlier—the subjects that have struggled to recruit through
School Direct have also struggled to recruit to core places in HEIs,

best place to keep secrets from the Labour party is on the floor of the

shadow Minister, who has been beavering away: he has looked in the
coalition agreement and searched through the press cuttings. It is all
very impressive, but all he had to do was to listen to what went on at

I proposed, that was voted for by the Deputy Prime Minister and the

the past 18 months, the most vicious and destructive battle has been
waged at Coventry City football club. Sadly, it has not been about
football; it is a fight for land and property. The Ricoh arena was
built and paid for by local and national taxpayers and a highly thought
of local charity, the Alan Edward Higgs Charity. It was built to create
jobs and economic activity in a deprived part of the city, and because
the football club was not financially capable of building it itself.
The club’s hedge-fund owners and its boss, Joy Seppala, want the
stadium, the freehold and the surrounding land, but they do not want to
pay more than a pittance for it, and have moved the club out of the
city and nearly destroyed it in order to achieve that.</hs_Para>

club was put into administration seven months ago. The owners have
repeatedly claimed, through solicitors and direct statements, that the
company owed rent to the stadium but had no assets. Documentation has
now come to light that shows that to be untrue. Since 1 June 1995, this
company, now in liquidation, has owned the club’s rights, title,
and assets, all its playing staff, its goodwill, and the right to play
in the league. Why did the administrator, Mr Paul Appleton of David
Rubin &amp; Partners, fail to discover that? He claims that he spent
thousands of hours conducting his investigation. He possesses the full
powers of an officer of the court. He is supposed to have ability. He
charges more than £300 an hour. Despite protests from bidders,
creditors and me, as MP for the local area, he sold the company that
was in his charge without finding out what he was selling, thereby
ensuring that the owners were the successful bidders. I ask the
Minister why those who put companies into administration are able to
avoid scrutiny and loss, at the expense of creditors, by choosing their
own administrator. Now the appalling error has come to light—let
us call it an error—can we ensure that an independent liquidator
is appointed to look at the situation in
Coventry?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000188">Let
me ask about the role of the Football League in this sorry tale. It

e-mailed me saying that the Football League board would not allow the
club to move away from Coventry without demonstrating a clear plan to
return within a prescribed time frame. The Football League then allowed
the club to move to Northampton. Did the club show the league a plan,

and most importantly, I want to talk about whether or not we can get
the club back to Coventry. This lunchtime, there was a small
demonstration outside Council house. Fans are understandably desperate
to see the club back in Coventry. Joy Seppala admits, however, that she
is not interested in football and is not a fan. She is interested in
her investors and describes herself as the shepherd of other
people’s money. She says that she is £60 million down.
She claims she was not involved in the catastrophic decision to buy the
club in 2007. If I were a Sisu or a Sconset investor, one of her sheep,
I would ask questions about that, but she says that she wants a return

repeatedly claimed that a new stadium will be built near Coventry. It
is said that it would cost around £25 million—nothing
like the Ricoh arena. As Joy Seppala cannot get the fans to go to
Northampton, it is estimated that she and her organisation are losing
at least £3 million a year for at least the next three years as
a result of playing their home matches in Northampton. If we add the
£25 million to the £9 million probable losses from the
club’s current course of action, that is £34 million. If
she wants, as she has said, the stadium, the surrounding land and the
freehold of that land, why does she not make a bid? Why is she
incapable of making a bid of around £34 million? If she made a
bid of that magnitude, she would be getting a casino and a conference
centre thrown in for nothing, but she has not made that bid, and she
will not do so. The question is
why.</hs_Para>

Nuneaton (Mr Jones); I have never disagreed with him. In the past,
under previous leadership, perhaps members of Coventry city council
have not agreed with that line. However, if the club needs to own its
stadium, it needs to pay for it, does it not? Does it expect the
stadium to be given to it for nothing? That is what I am asking,
because I believe that what we are looking at is 
<?notus-xml column=61?>an attempted land grab. Figures such as £7 million are being
floated by Sisu’s fans for a stadium that cost more than
£100 million to provide. Property markets have gone the way that
they have, and the economy is not in the same condition as it was, so
people will make a loss, but to float derisory figures such as that is
an indication that there is an attempt at making a killing at the
taxpayer’s
expense.</hs_Para>

have been a number of debates on this issue—what has happened to
Coventry City football club? I will not go back over those; I think
that my right hon. Friend has made adequate representation and adequate
queries over a number of debates. However, I would like to pick up on
one or two
points.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000208">The
first thing that people have got to understand, and the people of
Coventry certainly understand it, is that the site of the stadium was a
derelict site for more than 40 years because there was an old gasworks
on it, and at the time the conventional wisdom was that there would be
a long period before the site could be cleaned of fumes and that sort
of stuff. So, it took a long time and if I remember correctly—I
am sure my right hon. Friend will put me right if I do not—to
clean that site up before it was even built on probably cost something
like £16 million. I may have got that figure wrong, but I cannot
be too far wrong. So the site lay derelict for many, many
years.</hs_Para>

representations over the years from Coventry City football club,
because originally there was talk of siting it where Coventry airport
is now, at the Baginton site. That never got off the ground, but
eventually the present location—the Ricoh Arena—was
looked at and decisions were made about the location of the arena, but
more importantly it was part of a regeneration scheme for the whole
area, if I remember correctly. So we have to put these things in
context.</hs_Para>

a lot of sharp practices have gone on; there is no doubt in my mind
about that and I will not repeat them here again today. However, I have
always taken the view that we can deal with those sharp practices
separately. The most important thing is to get the club back into
Coventry. That is my view, and I have always taken the view that the
best way to do that is through conciliation. In fact, I have said on
one or two occasions that the only way to deal with the situation is
probably to get an independent arbiter.</hs_Para>

him that, and by the way he has handled things, but that is for another

situation goes a lot broader, because to deal with the
situation at Coventry we have to look at the Football League and
consider some sort of regulation or some legal framework of sorts. It
has had a free hand for many years now. We have seen what

satisfactory. The fans have been taken for a ride by some of these
football clubs and some of these football owners, and it is about time

already said, the problem is not just with Coventry. I am aware that
almost every football club in the country has its own problems. I
believe that what has happened in Coventry has been exceptionally
inadequate, but there are a huge number of cases of poor football
governance. It is clear that what has happened in Coventry is not an
anomaly. The institutions of our domestic football governance are
inadequate and out of date, and they need to be seriously

Media and Sport Committee launched its report into domestic football
governance in December 2010, publishing it in July 2011. It was very
clear that the Football Association was in need of urgent reform; that
the leagues, particularly the Premier League, have too great an
influence over the decision-making processes of
the FA; that the game has seen increasing commercialisation; and that
there is a distinct lack of financial regulation, which has led to
significant financial risks being taken by football clubs. Indeed,
billionaires seem to treat football clubs as investment accounts or
assets; they are not, and they should not be treated this way. The
Select Committee urged the industry to take the opportunity to reform
itself and said that if it did not, there should be legislation.
Football authorities put forward proposals for reform but their
proposals simply did not address the key
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000216">What
needs to be addressed is that the structure of the FA leads to too much
responsibility being delegated away from the main board and towards
committees, which are dominated by the Premier League and Football
League. We need proposals that are far-reaching; we need improved
financial stability; we need to reform the licensing model; we need to
ensure that membership of the main board, council and influential
committees is fully representative, and balances different interests;
and we need to improve the way supporter engagement operates at club
level. When will the Government accept that the time has passed for the
industry to make its own
reforms?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000217">As
I have said, something must be done now. We have got a situation where,
in a way, we have practically got a sort of civil
war in Coventry, between the fans and the owners. That cannot be
allowed to continue. We need to get somebody independent to look at
that situation, but more importantly to deal with the situation in
Coventry and to prevent it happening in the future we need to look at
the Football League and do something about
it.</hs_Para>

three key areas where we need real progress are the licensing system
for clubs, the introduction of empowered—that word is
important—and balanced boards and improved supporter engagement
at club level. My Department continues to urge the football authorities
to introduce full transparency around club ownership. The licensing
system should set out stricter criteria both around owners being fit

plans for how they will safeguard clubs’ futures. Taken
together, those would provide greater clarity for clubs’
supporters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000230">Having
said all that, the football authorities deserve some credit for the
rules introduced in recent years, including an early-warning system
with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs around tax returns,
transfer embargoes that help to curb club spending, a new
means-and-abilities test and a strengthened owners and directors test.
I also welcome the fact that the football authorities and all 92
professional clubs have now adopted the financial fair play principles,
the implementation of which should lead to reduced spending by clubs
and, I hope, fewer incidents of club insolvency as a result. We hope
the licensing model being developed will strengthen the relationship
with fans, who should be better informed about a club’s
activities, such as its financial standing and owners’
identities. Supporters should be consulted as part of a club’s
decision-making process.</hs_Para>

for the football authorities to agree what works best for this country,

during the judicial review of the police’s decision to stop
David Miranda at Heathrow airport in August, deputy national security
adviser Oliver Robbins also spoke of the damage caused by the
disclosures. He noted that the material seized from Mr Miranda is
highly likely to describe techniques that have been crucial in
life-saving counter-terrorist operations and other intelligence
activities vital to UK national security. If those techniques were
compromised, it would do serious damage to national security and
ultimately risk lives. Those releasing this material would do well to
understand that the types of capability they are writing about are
those we have relied on in recent years to stop terrorist plots,
disrupt organised crime and put cyber-criminals, including those
exploiting children or illegally proliferating arms, behind bars. Once
an adversary knows if and how we can read their communications, they
will change their behaviour. When it was revealed that the US could
read Osama Bin Laden’s communications in the late 1990s, we did
not hear from him again until September
2001.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102269000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/halltext/131022h0002.htm#13102269000304">I

Friend’s intervention. It is right to say that it is obviously
not for Ministers to direct the police to arrest or investigate anyone.
He will understand that that would be inappropriate. It is for the
police and the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether a crime
has been committed and what action to take. Given the ongoing police
investigation after Mr Miranda was stopped at Heathrow, it would be
inappropriate to comment further. Ultimately, it is for the police and

were concerned about such material being held insecurely without any of

about the consequences of more of this material becoming public, and
the grave risks that that would pose to operations, individuals and

appreciate and respect the fact that journalists may spend significant
time weighing up whether an issue is damaging to national security, and
genuinely believe that they are doing the right thing. However, I
respectfully suggest that they are simply not in a position to make
national security assessments. The Government strongly support a free
press. We have never denied the possibility of a debate on privacy and
security or the work of the intelligence agencies, but we cannot
condone the way in which others sought to bring this debate about and
the damage it caused. Any leak of security material is serious. It can
put the lives of our agents at risk and give valuable information to
terrorists and others who wish us harm. As we have heard, there have
been calls to prosecute, but that is not a matter for me; it is a

Poulter:</Member></B> The UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC)
which advises Ministers and the national health service in all four
countries about all aspects of screening policy recommends screening
infants for heart defects as part of the NHS Newborn and Infant
Physical Examination Screening Programme (NHS NIPE). The national
screening programme offers parents the opportunity to have their child
examined shortly after birth and includes an examination of the baby's
heart as well as a general physical examination and an examination of
the baby's eyes and hips and testes in boys. As some conditions can
develop later, the examination is repeated at six to eight weeks of
age, usually by a general
practitioner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102285000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/text/131022w0001.htm#13102285000195">In
addition, as part of the NHS Foetal Anomaly Screening Programme (NHS
FASP) all pregnant women in England are offered a minimum of two
ultrasound scans. The first is an early scan, undertaken after eight
weeks gestation; the second ultrasound scan is undertaken between 18
weeks + 0 days to 20 weeks + six days of pregnancy. The main purpose of
the second scan is to look for abnormalities in the unborn baby,
including serious cardiac abnormalities. This is also a UK NSC

measures to improve air quality at the Air Balloon Roundabout junction,
where the Air Balloon Pub and surrounding cottages are situated. The
Highways Agency has installed CCTV along the route and operates regular
incident response patrols to help keep the traffic flowing in the
congested parts of the area. Improvements in rail capacity on the
Swindon Gloucester rail link are also expected to increase the capacity
of the rail and encourage the use of alternative forms of transport to
reduce traffic flows at the Air Balloon Roundabout. This work is

1.6 also shows that a £520 increase in the annual employee upper
earnings limit yields around £170 million. Very large increases

and will continue to be undertaken as a result. HMRC is also working
with international partners using the data to drive forward its

Webb:</Member></B> One of the main objectives of the Innovation Fund is
to learn what works in helping separated parents to work together in
the best interests of their children. Robust evaluation is, therefore,
critical and we have set aside funding to ensure this is carried out
effectively. At present, all of the projects commissioned in the first
round are in the early stages of implementation, with some not yet
working with clients. Although we have started to monitor outcomes
where projects have begun working with clients, and we have found some
very positive case studies, we do not expect to have robust evidence
until next year, after which we will publish formal evaluation results.
This evaluation will include the number and gender of parents assisted
by the
projects.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13102291000060" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131022/text/131022w0002.htm#13102291000060">Social

specific comparative assessment of delays and congestion at the

junction is unique. It has a steep gradient with significant

This means a comparison with other junctions would have little value.

detailed commitments about how the rail network will operate after HS2
Phase One opens in 2026, or after Phase Two opens in 2033. However,
illustrative scenarios have been prepared by HS2 Ltd and Network Rail

safety auditors operating in the United Kingdom and, as such it is not
possible to answer the question fully. The best indicator is the
current register of members and fellows (including honorary) of the
Society of Road Safety Auditors (SoRSA). The total membership is
presently 296. There are likely to be many active auditors who are not
registered with SoRSA as there is no formal requirement to do so. The
IHE (Institute of Highway Engineers) also keep a list of registered
Road Safety Audits, this includes the details of 30 practicing road

such as energy, process and material efficiency. We have a wide range
of targeted policies to increase uptake of energy efficiency measures

the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme and the Energy Savings Opportunity
Scheme. Action in this decade will also help industry prepare for the
future, to support the innovation needed for more technically
challenging or costly measures. During the 2020s and beyond, we expect
reductions will also be driven by switching to low carbon fuels and
carbon capture and storage technology. We have specifically launched a
2050 industrial sector roadmaps project to work with key industries on
developing their low carbon strategies for the eight most heat
intensive industrial sectors (iron and steel; chemicals; oil; refining;
paper and pulp; ceramics; glass; cement; food and drink). The project
will explore the technical emissions abatement potential of the
individual industrial sectors, the relative costs of alternative

Hancock:</Member></B> The externally commissioned impact evaluation of
Round 1 of the Employer Ownership of Skills pilot (EOP) is expected to
use both quantitative and qualitative information to assess whether the
training being provided is of high quality, mainly gathered via surveys
of employers and learners. Quantitative measures will tend to focus on
employment and wage outcomes for learners, and are likely to cover net
improvements in employment status and wages. Qualitative measures will
tend to focus on attitudinal aspects, and are likely to include shifts
in perceptions amongst employers and learners regarding the quality and
appropriateness of training provided, and whether they are more
satisfied with the training provided compared to mainstream
provision.</hs_Para>

money assessment will use evidence on net impact (ie impact of EOP
adjusted for what would have happened anyway) on learners and
employers, quantified in terms of economic benefits for learners and
employers (using available evidence on wage and productivity returns),
and compare these benefits to the costs of the pilots. The assessment
will also use monitoring information from the pilots to judge how cost
effective it has been in terms of using public money wisely and
efficiently by taking account of a number of indicators such as number
of learner starts, completions and
achievement.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Correction" ColStart="3"><?date 2013-10-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_22_PT_1/3334AD369153B1625FAE132A6572ACE7827BB4AF" __version__="1.1"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 October 2013">Tuesday
